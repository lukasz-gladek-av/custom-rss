                <p>EA's College Football 25 was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2024s-best-selling-games-in-the-us/2900-5106/" data-ref-id="2900-5106">one of 2024's best-selling games in the US</a>, but the game didn't deliver everything fans wanted. Now, EA has officially unveiled CFB 26 and discussed its new and improved features.</p><p>To begin with, CFB 26 has more than 2,700 new plays to choose from, while the roster of real college athletes in the game is in the "thousands," EA said. The student-athletes are being paid <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-will-pay-student-athletes-1500-to-appear-in-cfb-26-more-that-double-last-years-rate/1100-6530192/" data-ref-id="1100-6530192">at least $1,500 to appear in the game</a>, which is more than double the rate from last year.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMGIfmAcNwA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/sMGIfmAcNwA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>All 136 FBS schools are represented in CFB 26, while more than 300 real-world coaches have lent their likenesses to the game, which launches on July 10 for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S.</p><p>CFB 26 also has expanded player types and abilities, including 84 total abilities and 10 new archetypes to help players customize their roster to their liking. Additionally, EA added a new "wear and tear" system that requires players to manage player fatigue and injuries.</p><p>The game also sports better AI, improved blocking and coverages, and a new "Dynamic Substitutions" system to help "show your opponent what your program is made of."</p><p dir="ltr">The Stadium Pulse system from CFB 25 has been "revamped" for CFB 26 to add new crowd-based challenges and things like "clock distortion" and "extreme screen shake" to help ramp up the intensity in pressure-packed moments. There are also 160 new school-specific chants in CFB 26, along with 10 new PA tracks--including "Enter Sandman" by Metallica.</p><p dir="ltr">The broadcast and commentary team from CFB 25 returns for the new game, including Chris Fowler, Kirk Herbstreit, Rece Davis, Jesse Palmer, Desmond Howard, and David Pollack.</p><p dir="ltr">EA also said fans can look forward to improved Dynasty and Road to Glory modes, while the Road to the College Football Playoff mode has a new online progression format.</p><p dir="ltr">CFB 26 launches July 10, but people who buy the game's deluxe edition or the EA Sports MVP Bundle--which includes CFB 26 and Madden NFL 26--can start playing on July 7. There will also be a free 10-hour trial for EA Play members, which means Game Pass Ultimate subscribers have access, too.</p><p dir="ltr">The Standard Edition of EA Sports College Football 26 features <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-sports-college-football-26-cover-features-two-top-wide-receivers/1100-6531832/" data-ref-id="1100-6531832">Alabama's Ryan Williams and Ohio State's Jeremiah Smith</a>, two of the top-ranked wide receivers in the country.</p><p dir="ltr">For more, check out GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-sports-college-football-26-preorders-up-for-grabs-for-ps5-and-xbox/1100-6531106/" data-ref-id="1100-6531106">CFB 26 preorder guide.</a></p><p dir="ltr">Sales numbers for CFB 25 were never announced, but EA said recently that the game drove <a href="https://s204.q4cdn.com/701424631/files/doc_financials/2025/q4/Q4-FY25-Earnings-Press-Release-FINAL1.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">more than $1 billion in "net bookings,"</a> which means revenue.

                <p>Subscription services for video games have grown over the years, but former PlayStation Studios boss Shuhei Yoshida has expressed concern about them. In an interview, Yoshida spoke about how the expansion of first-party titles could eventually lead to third-party studios being shut out of subscription services, as the companies could prefer to hedge their bets with a growing library of first-party releases instead of experimental games.</p><p>"If the only way for people to play games is through subscriptions, that's really dangerous because what [type] of games can be created will be dictated by the owner of the subscription services," Yoshida said to <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/shuhei-yoshida-warns-subscription-services-could-become-dangerous-for-developers" rel="nofollow ">Game Developer at Gamescom LATAM</a>. "That's really, really risky because there must always be fresh new ideas tried by small developers that create the next wave of development. But if the big companies dictate what games can be created, I don't think that will advance the industry."</p>

<p>Yoshida added that Sony's approach is "healthier" as the company only adds first-party releases to its PlayStation Plus service after they've been on the market for a certain amount of time. Once sales have tailed off on a first-party game, it usually finds its way onto PS Plus, thus allowing more people to experience it for the first time.</p><p>In comparison, Microsoft's main selling point for Xbox Game Pass is that games developed by its internal studios are day-one releases on its subscription program, and third-party games have also been included in this strategy. So far, 2025 has seen day-one launches of big titles like Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, Blue Prince, Doom: The Dark Ages, and South of Midnight on Xbox Game Pass. The releases have been fairly diverse as well, with games like Pentiment, Grounded, and Hi-Fi Rush joining traditional fare like Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 and Forza Motorsport.</p><p>Developer Rebellion's newest game, Atomfall, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-release-atomfall-was-immediately-profitable-report/1100-6531671/" data-ref-id="1100-6531671">was also "immediately profitable,"</a> and the studio recently spoke about<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/atomfall-dev-discusses-game-pass-launch-and-risk-of-cannibalizing-sales/1100-6530925/" data-ref-id="1100-6530925"> why it was a good business decision</a> to release it through Game Pass. At the same time, another developer has spoken <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-hurts-sales-says-dev-behind-xbox-game-pass-title/1100-6514084/" data-ref-id="1100-6514084">about the risks of Game Pass</a>, and Microsoft has also clarified its own statements on the service <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-clarifies-its-own-admission-that-game-pass-cannibalizes-some-game-sales/1100-6511503/" data-ref-id="1100-6511503">potentially cannibalizing game sales</a>.</p><p>Yoshida did praise Microsoft for its backwards compatibility, a feat of engineering that he called "smart and very well planned" for its subscribers. PS Plus--and Xbox Game Pass--will be home to a day-one third-party release in June, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/control-spin-off-fbc-firebreak-is-a-defiant-punk-rock-take-on-co-op-shooters/1100-6531475/">Remedy Entertainment's FBC: Firebreak will be available through those services</a>.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-playstation-plus-may-2025-games-for-premium-and-extra-subscribers/2900-6587/">PlayStation Plus Game Catalogue was also updated this week</a> with a few more titles, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-plus-essential-free-games-for-june-2025/1100-6531805/">June's PS Plus games</a> includes a few recent titles from 2024 like the Alone in the Dark remake, Destiny 2: The Final Shape, and NBA 2K25.</p>

Trump attempted to use the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to implement the tariffs, but <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-tariffs-trade-court-0392dbd59f548e49ad4f64254ae3f94a" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a three-judge panel rejected this</a>. What all of this means for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a> and other gaming products, however, is unknown at the moment.</p><p>The ruling said Trump may still be able to implement import taxes of 15% for 150 days on certain countries where the US is in a major trade deficit, however.</p><p>The US government may have to refund companies that paid the tariffs. George Mason University professor Ilya Somin, who worked on a related tariff case, told <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/05/28/federal-court-strikes-down-trumps-april-2-tariffs-00373843" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Politico</a>, "Anybody that has had to pay tariffs so far will be able to get them refunded."</p><p>The US Justice Department is appealing the decision, and it's possible the case could be heard by the US Supreme Court if it goes far enough.</p><p>Nintendo cited Trump's tariffs as one of the reasons why Switch 2 preorders were initially delayed. While the Switch 2 price remains at $450, Nintendo <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-first-party-accessories-will-be-more-expensive-than-originally-announced/1100-6530965/" data-ref-id="1100-6530965">did raise prices on some accessories.</a> Microsoft raised Xbox console prices, citing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-consoles-games-and-accessories-see-price-increases-starting-today/1100-6531257/" data-ref-id="1100-6531257">"market conditions,"</a> but without mentioning tariffs specifically. Sony, for its part, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-prices-have-increased-in-some-regions-but-not-the-us/1100-6530829/" data-ref-id="1100-6530829">raised PS5 prices in April.</a> Tabletop gaming companies are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tabletop-game-publisher-is-very-publicly-suing-trump-administration-over-tariffs/1100-6531040/" data-ref-id="1100-6531040">affected by the tariffs</a>, too.</p><p>Whether or not gaming companies were baking the tariffs into their price increases is unclear; also unclear is whether or not companies will offer refunds. </p><p>Gaming companies might raise prices for any number of reasons, beyond a potential impact of tariffs. For example, experts agree that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/people-are-ready-and-willing-to-pay-80-or-more-for-games-analyst-says/1100-6531571/" data-ref-id="1100-6531571">people are ready and willing to pay more</a> for their favorite products because the data shows they will. The Switch 2 is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/is-the-nintendo-switch-2-really-that-expensive-a-history-of-console-prices-over-the-years/2900-5761/" data-ref-id="2900-5761">about $50 more expensive than the original Switch</a>, adjusted for inflation, and Nintendo might be charging more <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/will-tariffs-increase-switch-2s-price-why-the-console-and-games-are-so-expensive/1100-6530591/" data-ref-id="1100-6530591">simply because people will pay it</a>.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> has received a day one patch ahead of its release tomorrow.</p>
<p>Ready across all platforms, the update "aims to improve gameplay and stability" according to the (very minimal) <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-nightreign-patch-notes-version-101?">patch notes</a>.</p>
<p>The changes are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improved handling of playable characters</li>
<li>Soundtrack addition and adjustments</li>
<li>Text adjustments</li>
<li>Balance adjustments</li>
<li>Added character scenarios</li>
<li>Bug fixes</li>
</ul>
<p>No further details are provided in the notes, so I hopped into the game to check out the changes.</p>

<p>Testing a single player expedition, it would appear the balance adjustments have made it slightly easier. While enemies are still aggressive, their health seems lower and my character stats appeared to be higher.</p>
<p>Of course, it could be my skill level has increased over the review period. But even a half-arsed run got me two thirds through the first Nightlord boss, which wouldn't have happened previously, so make of that what you will.</p>
<p>Still, I wouldn't take this as a sign that solo play is a viable option to complete the game. It's still very much intended to be a multiplayer experience.</p>
<p>One obvious improvement, though, is the "improved handling of playable characters", which relates to the game's parkour movement. It's now much cleaner jumping up the side of cliffs.</p>
<p>The remaining changes will need to be tested over a longer period of time.</p>
<p>Elden Ring Nightreign is FromSoftware's multiplayer spin-off to its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-sales-pass-30m">30m selling game</a>. It's out tomorrow across PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and PC (Steam). Note that crossplay between platforms is not included.</p>
<p>"FromSoftware's multiplayer spin-off is an exhilarating rush and a celebration of the studio's prior achievements Souls veterans will devour," I wrote in our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-review">Elden Ring Nightreign review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3573040/Squad_22_ZOV/">Squad 22: ZOV</a> is a new squad tactics game that just released on <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-did-not-suffer-a-security-breach-and-you-dont-need-to-change-your-password-says-valve/">Steam</a> yesterday, and claims to be "<em>officially recommended</em>" by the Russian military "<em>for use as a basic infantry tactic manual for cadet and Yunarmy training<strong>.</strong></em>"</p>
<p>Spotted by <a href="https://simulationdaily.com/news/steam-russian-military-propaganda-game/">Simulation Daily</a>, the game's <a href="https://squad22.online/">website</a> claims that the development team includes soldiers currently fighting in the war between Ukraine and Russia, and claims that it shows "<em>History as it</em> <em>is.</em>"</p>
<p>The website reads,"<em>Dive into 2014 and 2022-2024 events, through different campaigns and learn how people who lived in them saw what happened, how it affected their lives and changed opinions</em>."</p>
<p>The <a href="https://cpd.gov.ua/en/results/rf-en/how-russia-militarizes-youth-through-computer-games/">Ukrainian Center for Countering Disinformation</a> has already published articles about Squad 22: ZOV, and how it is Russian military propaganda that aims to "<em>mythologize the war and its participants</em>" from Russia's point of view, to bring young Russian men into the fold of the army.</p>
<p>"<em>The Squad 22: ZOV game is not just entertainment, but an element of propaganda aimed at justifying the war and creating a heroic myth about the Russian</em> <em>military,</em>" the Center for Countering Disinformation writes.</p>
<p>"<em>This is another step in the militarization of Russian society and its preparation for a long-term war.</em>"</p>
<p>It's unclear how exactly Squad 22: ZOV was able to get its Steam listing and pass through moderation checks. Valve has not yet commented on the game, nor has it taken action to remove the game like it recently did with a <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/steam-game-promoting-sexual-assault-removed-from-sale-in-uk-australia-and-canada/">game explicitly depicting sexual violence</a>, or how it removed a game depicting the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uk-counter-terrorism-unit-demands-steam-withdraw-controversial-shooter-from-sale">conflict between Israel and Palestine</a>.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-chronicle-update-june</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/phasmophobia-chronicle-update-brings-evidence-overhaul-and-more-in-june.1201569/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-chronicle-update-june<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Kinetic Games has revealed the release date for the next major&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>update, which will bring a rework to the evidence system and more next month.</p>

<p>Arriving on June 24th, the Chronicle update will introduce "a total overhaul of evidence collection", according to Kinetic, along with three new evidence types, a redesign for the journal, and a new UI for the main menu.</p>

<p>One of the new evidence types, Sound, will require you to use the brand new Sound Recorder device to capture subtle audio cues in your environment. Each tier allows you to detect "deeper layers of audio", with ghost events, Spirit Box responses, and paranormal sounds all available to be recorded.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/phasmophobia-chronicle-update-staircase.jpg?itok=Mf8ajJun 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/phasmophobia-chronicle-update-staircase.jpg?itok=N4fnReB3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>New evidence types are available for you to collect in the&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>Chronicle update, due in June.</figcaption></figure><p>As for the journal, it's getting a complete redesign. The "Photos" tab is being replaced by one titled "Media", which will house your proof, including photos and videos you've taken, as well as the new Sound category.</p>

<p>If you want to complete an investigation, you'll have to fill your journal with different types of evidence, and you can look forward to "new paranormal moments to capture", including EMF spikes and "fleeting glimpses of otherworldly forms".</p>

<p><em>Phasmophobia</em>'s Chronicle update also brings an overhaul to the way evidence works; the first instance of each media type captured will be marked as "Unique", while subsequent captures will be marked as "Duplicates", and smaller rewards will be given for those.</p>

<p>Other changes in Chronicle include a reworked leveling and progression system (<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-ascension-update-release-date" rel="nofollow">yes, another one</a>), as well as a new main menu UI that should make navigating&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia</em>'s options easier.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/phasmophobia-chronicle-update-journal-rework.jpg?itok=c-ZvZna6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/phasmophobia-chronicle-update-journal-rework.jpg?itok=V9JkYuPr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Phasmophobia</em>'s journal system is being reworked in the Chronicle update.</figcaption></figure><p>Following the Chronicle update, the previously-revealed Grafton Farmhouse rework will be released; we don't have a release date for it yet, but it'll bring "updated visuals, redesigned layouts, re-themed rooms, and a haunting new attic" to the map.</p>

<p><em>Phasmophobia</em>'s Chronicle update lands on June 24th. The game is available now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/739630/Phasmophobia/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/phasmophobia/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/phasmophobia-game-preview/9N6D60SBZN05" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/atomfall-wicked-isle-dlc-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/atomfall-wicked-isle-dlc-brings-new-area-and-more-next-week.1201566/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/atomfall-wicked-isle-dlc-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Rebellion has announced that the first major piece of story DLC for&nbsp;<em>Atomfall</em>,&nbsp;<em>Wicked Isle</em>, will be launching next week. It'll be purchasable separately if you don't own the Deluxe Edition, but if you do, you'll already have access to it.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Wicked Isle&nbsp;</em>launches on June 3rd. It'll add&nbsp;a new location to&nbsp;<em>Atomfall&nbsp;</em>in the form of Midsummer Island, and while you're there, you'll also uncover new weapons, new leads, and even new endings.</p>

<p>As you've probably already surmised,&nbsp;<em>Wicked Isle&nbsp;</em>is built heavily around&nbsp;<em>Atomfall</em>'s folk horror elements; if you haven't played the main game yet, I won't spoil, but suffice it to say you're not just dealing with bandits and trigger-happy military types.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/atomfall-wicked-isle-dlc-release-date.jpg?itok=pWwwjFPe 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/atomfall-wicked-isle-dlc-release-date.jpg?itok=8pakGODG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Atomfall</em>'s Wicked Isle DLC is coming next week.</figcaption></figure><p>Head of design Ben Fisher says that because Midsummer is closer to the Windscale plant than the rest of&nbsp;<em>Atomfall</em>'s world, "the levels of infection in both the people and the environment are higher than on the mainland".</p>

<p>As such, you'll be encountering new enemy factions, some of which may be too infected to reason with. A new pirate bandit faction will also be present on Midsummer, and it'll be up to you how you deal with them.</p>

<p>New weapons include a blunderbuss, a new bow, and "the Beekeeper's Staff", which feels to me like a not-so-subtle reference to Nic Cage's terrible 2006 remake of the British folk horror classic&nbsp;<em>The Wicker Man</em>.</p>

<p>Not only that, but new skills will also be available, and you'll be able to use your new upgraded metal detector to help you find loot caches with even more useful stuff in them. In short, if you love&nbsp;<em>Atomfall</em>, you'll probably love this as well.</p>




<p>Released <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/atomfall-release-date" rel="nofollow">back in March</a>,&nbsp;<em>Atomfall&nbsp;</em>proved popular at launch, reaching <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/atomfall-player-count-1m-stats" rel="nofollow">a million players by its first weekend</a> (having been released on the Game Pass service on day one).</p>

<p>You can check the game out right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/801800/Atomfall/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/atomfall/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/atomfall/9NC4WDL5KZBL" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>.&nbsp;<em>Wicked Isle&nbsp;</em>will be launching across all three platforms on June 3rd. Make sure to check out our Erren's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/atomfall-review-british-invasion" rel="nofollow">review of the base game</a> to see what she thought of it.</p>

Alongside Switch 2 support comes new features, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/642093/nintendo-switch-smartphone-app-zelda-notes">first announced in early April</a>, making it easier to access screenshots on other devices and adding mobile notifications for GameChat invitations.</p><p>The most useful update to the app is that the Switch 2 will be able to upload screenshots and videos to it through the cloud. The Switch 2’s album will have a new Upload to Smart Device option for manually sending screenshots, as well as an automatic uploads feature where the 100 most recent screenshots and videos on the console will be available in the app.</p><p>Files will be stored in the cloud for up to 30 days, Nintendo says, but can be downloaded from the app to a mobile device’s camera roll to be saved permanently. If you attempt to upload more than 100 screenshots and videos, the oldest screenshots will be overwritten. A free Nintendo Account is required to use the feature, but a paid Nintendo Switch Online membership is not.</p><p>Sharing screenshots from the original Switch was a more cumbersome process requiring a smartphone to scan a QR code on the console and then connect to a temporary Wi-Fi network to transfer the files wirelessly.The Nintendo Switch App will also let you see when you’ve been invited to a GameChat call and includes the Zelda Notes features for the Switch 2 editions of <em>Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild </em>and <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>. Although not active in the app yet, the feature will include achievements, spoken directions to areas you mark on a map, and access to additional Princess Zelda recall memories.</p><p>The Nintendo Today app also received an update today with new features including the ability to link its calendar with your own calendar app so you can see upcoming Nintendo events and game release dates as part of your personal schedule. There’s also the option to favorite content and filter news so you only see what you’re interested in, and the app now lets you zoom in on images.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

    <p><span>New evidence types, streamlined user interface and more.</span>
      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > Kinetic Games [6 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/kinetic-games">Kinetic Games</a> will release the “Chronicle” update for the Early Access release of four-player <a title="Genres > Co-Op [271 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer/co-op">cooperative</a> psychological <a title="Genres > Horror [622 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/horror">horror game</a> <em><a title="Games > Phasmophobia [6 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/phasmophobia">Phasmophobia</a></em> on June 24, the developer announced. <span id="more-968084"></span></p><p>Described as the game’s “biggest update yet,” the update will introduce a complete overhaul of evidence collection, expanding investigations with three new evidence types—including the new Sound evidence, the three-tiered Sound Recorder—a completely redesigned Journal, reworked leveling and progression, a refreshed main menu interface, and “many eerie surprises.”</p><p>Here are the details:</p><blockquote><p><strong>New Equipment: Introducing the Sound Recorder</strong></p><p>At the heart of the “Chronicle” update is the chilling debut of Sound evidence, a new haunting paranormal proof type captured through the new Sound Recorder. This fresh mechanic will add a new dimension to gameplay, revealing subtle clues that might otherwise be drowned out by terrified screams. Available in three upgrade tiers (T1, T2, and T3), this new equipment unlocks deeper layers of audio detection, as players will be able to record audio from ghost events, Spirit Box responses, and Paranormal Sounds like those detected by the Parabolic Microphone.</p><p><strong>Journal Overhaul</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>The “Chronicle” update will redefine how ghost hunters gather evidence. The journal will get a full redesign, where the Photos tab will be replaced by a brand-new Media tab. This tab will organize all captured proof into three sections—Photos, Videos, and new Sound Recordings—offering a richer, more immersive investigation experience where players can log photographic, visual, and new haunting audio evidence all in one place. Investigators will now need to fill a full book of unique media to complete a perfect investigation, with new paranormal moments to capture—from EMF spikes to ghostly interactions and fleeting glimpses of otherworldly forms.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/unnamed.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Redesigned Evidence System</strong></p><p>“Chronicle” will also introduce a revamped media quality system. The first evidence capture of any media type will be marked as “Unique”, granting extra cash and XP rewards at the end of each contract. Any subsequent captures of the same evidence type will be classed as “Duplicates”, offering smaller rewards. The new system will also add tier bonuses based on the equipment used and adds all media captures into the Reward Multiplier, making every shot, sound, and sight count even more toward player’s final payouts.</p><p><strong>…And More!</strong></p><p>In addition to the evidence collection overhaul, Sound Recorder, and revamped media quality system, the “Chronicle” update will introduce a reworked levelling and progression system, and a brand-new Main Menu user interface. Behind the scenes, the <em>Phasmophobia</em> team has also been hard at work exorcising bugs to polish the experience for players—and there are still plenty of secrets waiting to be uncovered when the update drops.</p><p>This year, <em>Phasmophobia</em> will also see the highly-anticipated rework to Grafton Farmhouse, following Bleasdale Farmhouse’s recent overhaul. Grafton, an abandoned, crumbling home, will soon feature updated visuals, redesigned layouts, re-themed rooms, and a haunting new attic. The revamped Grafton Farmhouse arrives after “Chronicle”—stay tuned for release details!</p></blockquote><p><em>Phasmophobia</em> is available now in Early Access for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [9,553 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > PS VR2 [235 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps-vr2">PlayStation VR2</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [7,259 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [23,254 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/739630/Phasmophobia/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The notes don't go into too much more detail than that, though, as you can see the whole list of patch notes below:</p><h2>Patch contents</h2><ul><li>Improved handling of playable characters</li><li>Soundtrack addition and adjustments</li><li>Text adjustments</li><li>Balance adjustments</li><li>Added character scenarios</li><li>Bug fixes</li></ul><p>These patch notes also came with some warnings about the PC version of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign/" data-ref-id="5000-654963">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>. There is an issue where the game won't boot up on PC. However, this can be resolved by opening the Properties menu for Elden Ring Nightreign from your Steam library, navigating to the Installed Files submenu, and selecting the Verify Integrity of Game Files option.</p><p>Then, once the game is booted up, some PCs "using the latest graphics cards may experience frame rate drops." Bandai Namco has not clarified which graphics cards in particular are affected or how severe the frame rate drops are, but says it is "currently investigating the cause." It's recommended that players set the graphics settings to Medium or Low and install the latest graphics-card drivers to avoid these performance issues in the interim.</p><p>Elden Ring Nightreign launches today for PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S.

Ahead of its launch, publisher Bandai Namco has released a new trailer for the game that is a must-watch (probably not for a reason you can guess).</p><p>Titled "Bring Me To Life Trailer," this Nightreign trailer utilizes Evanescence’s popular song, "Bring Me To Life," to great effect to create something that’s more like an AMV (anime music video) or something you’d see on VH1 or MTV in the early 2000s. Perhaps it’s because I’m a millennial (born in 1995, so just barely), but this trailer just feels right.</p><p><strong>You can check it out for yourself below:</strong></p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ot6j_qqYQaM"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ot6j_qqYQaM" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>If you’ve been watching Nathan Fielder’s <em>The Rehearsal</em> on HBO after <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/exclusive-feature/2025/05/11/equal-parts-boring-and-intense-visiting-the-set-of-the-last-of-us"><em>The Last of Us</em></a> finishes up on Sunday nights, you might have already had “Bring Me To Life” on your mind for reasons I won’t spoil here – you should watch <em>The Rehearsal</em> if you aren’t already.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/2025/05/28/ea-cancels-black-panther-game-and-closes-its-developer-cliffhanger-games<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>EA has shuttered Cliffhanger Games and canceled the team’s upcoming Black Panther game. This marks the third round of layoffs at the publisher this year.</p><p>Black Panther was <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2023/07/10/black-panther-game-announced-by-ea">first announced</a> to be in development in July 2023 as part of a three-game partnership between EA and Marvel. The first game revealed for that initiative is an upcoming <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/09/20/motive-studio-announces-single-player-iron-man-game-as-first-part-of-new-eamarvel">Iron Man title</a> developed by Motive Studios, the team behind the 2023 Dead Space remake and Star Wars Squadrons. Black Panther was the second title; the third game has yet to be announced.</p><p>EA formed the Seattle-based Cliffhanger Games to develop Black Panther. At the time of its reveal, Black Panther was very early in development; Cliffhanger was still hiring staff. Because of this, we know very little about what the game would have been beyond what Cliffhanger described at the time as a “single-player story-driven third-person action-adventure game.” It also would have been the character's first solo starring role in a video game, having previously appeared in supporting roles.</p><p>In an unfortunate twist of fate, Cliffhanger was led by Kevin Stephens, formerly of Monolith Productions. Cliffhanger’s staff also partly consisted of former Monolith talent who worked on Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor. Monolith Productions was shut down by Warner Bros. in February and had its own superhero game, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/the-game-awards-2021/2021/12/09/monolith-open-world-wonder-woman-game-in-the-works">Wonder Woman</a>, canceled.</p>

</article>
<p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-cancels-black-panther-game-closes-cliffhanger-studios"><em>IGN</em></a> reports that Cliffhanger’s staff were informed of the shutdown via an email from EA Entertainment president Laura Miele. She explained that the closure was part of EA’s larger goal to "sharpen our focus and put our creative energy behind the most significant growth opportunities” as the publisher aims to focus on developing a small batch of franchises: Battlefield, Apex Legends, The Sims, and Skate. Despite this initiative, Miele’s email also states that Motive’s Iron Man, Respawn’s third Star Wars Jedi game, and BioWare’s next Mass Effect title will remain in production. EA Sports, which is a separate division from EA Entertainment, is also said to be unaffected by today's events.&nbsp;</p><p>Employees working in EA’s mobile and central teams were also impacted. Miele states EA will work to find new positions for affected employees in other parts of the company. It is unclear exactly how many employees have lost their jobs, though <em>IGN </em>believes the number is less than 300.</p><p>This news follows the round of layoffs that hit the publisher last April, which included 100 employees at <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/04/30/update-respawn-suffers-layoffs-amid-team-adjustments-cancels-two-early-projects">Respawn Entertainment</a>. This resulted in the cancellation of incubation projects that included a Titanfall title. BioWare also saw layoffs in January due to a restructuring aimed at focusing all resources on developing the next Mass Effect. In February 2024, EA laid off <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/02/28/ea-lays-off-670-employees-cancels-respawns-star-wars-fps">over 650 employees</a> and canceled an upcoming Star Wars first-person shooter by Respawn. That particular round of layoffs saw CEO Andrew Wilson state that the publisher was “moving away from the development of future licensed IP that we do not believe will be successful in our changing industry.” &nbsp;</p><p>Black Panther fans now only have <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/03/20/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-is-skydances-captain-americablack-panther-game-arriving-next">Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra</a> to look forward to. Developed by Skydance New Media and led by former Uncharted creative lead Amy Hennig, it stars Captain America and Black Panther Azzuri, the grandfather of T’Challa, alongside a soldier and a Wakandan spy, battling Hydra during World War II. That title was recently <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/05/13/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-delayed-to-early-2026-to-add-more-polish">delayed to 2026</a>.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/pc-gaming/676167/nvidia-geforce-now-steam-deck-test-hands-on<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><div><p>I don’t want gaming to become another streaming subscription service that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23901586/streaming-service-prices-netflix-disney-hulu-peacock-max">keeps going up in price</a>. I don’t want to put even more power in Nvidia’s hands, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/pc-gaming/672637/nvidia-rtx-5060-review-meddling-gamersnexus-wake-up-call">particularly not right now</a>.</p></div><p>But I can’t deny that the company’s $20-a-month* GeForce Now is a near-perfect fit for the Steam Deck. I’ve been covering cloud gaming for 15 years, and this is the very first time I’ve wanted to keep playing indefinitely.</p><div><div><p id="what-is-geforce-now"><h2><strong>What is GeForce Now?</strong></h2></p></div><p>For the uninitiated, Nvidia’s GeForce Now is a game streaming service that farms the graphical processing power out to the cloud. Instead of controlling a game running locally on your Steam Deck’s chip, you’re effectively remote-controlling an RTX 4080-powered* gaming rig in a server farm many miles away, which you sync with your existing Steam, Epic, Ubisoft, Xbox, and Battle.net accounts to access your games and savegames from the cloud.</p><p>*Nvidia’s GeForce Now also technically has a free tier, and a “Performance” tier, but I recommend you ignore both. For me, it was the difference between playing many games through a clean window or a dirty window, the difference between playing <em>Alan Wake II</em> and <em>Indiana Jones</em> with full ray tracing or none at all, the difference between comfortably stretching to 4K or not.</p></div><p>Handhelds have already become my favorite way to play games. The Steam Deck is comfortable and easy to pick up whenever and wherever the mood strikes. But neither my Deck nor my aging desktop PC have kept up with the latest titles. <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> and <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> can look like a fuzzy mess on a Deck, and I’ve never seen <em>Alan Wake II</em>, <em>Portal RTX</em> and <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> in all their ray-traced glory on my RTX 3060 Ti desktop.</p><p>But today, with Nvidia’s <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce-now%2Fdownload%2F" rel="sponsored">just-now-released GeForce Now app</a> for the Steam Deck, I can play every one of those titles at near-max settings, anywhere in my home, for hours and hours on a charge. And if I dock that Steam Deck to my 4K TV, it can output 4K60 HDR and/or ray-traced graphics that put <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/24289319/ps5-pro-review">the PS5 Pro</a> to shame.</p><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23561989/nvidia-geforce-now-rtx-4080-price-reflex-hands-on-cloud-gaming">When we tested GeForce Now’s last big upgrade in 2023</a>, Tom and I agreed it wasn’t <em>quite</em> on par with playing on a native PC.</p></div><p>But on a Steam Deck, where I’m either playing on a low-res handheld screen or sitting across the room from a TV where I don’t notice so many imperfections, it can feel like the best of both worlds.</p><p>Here’s what <em>Expedition 33 </em>looks like running natively on my Steam Deck today, versus the Deck with GeForce Now:</p><p>The best part might be this: while handhelds like the Steam Deck barely get two hours of such a game at potato graphical settings, I could get 7 to 8 hours of GeForce Now. I saw the cloud gaming service consistently sip under 7 watts from my Steam Deck OLED’s 49.2 watt-hour battery, barely more than the system consumes at idle.</p><p>And the new native app makes it a cinch to set up, with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/2/24147034/nvidia-geforce-now-steam-deck-script-install">no more web browser-and-script workaround</a>: just hold down the power button and switch to desktop mode, download the app, run it, and scan QR codes with your phone to link your various accounts.</p><p>Oh, you’d best believe there are caveats. Giant gaping gotchas galore, which I’ll explain as we go. But after testing the service for nearly two weeks, I’m starting to believe in cloud gaming again.</p><p>Now, you might be wondering: how the heck am I playing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/667900/doom-the-dark-ages-clair-obscur-expedition-33-parry-season">a game where timing is so critical</a> via remote control? Here’s the first big caveat: you need a low-latency internet connection, a good Wi-Fi router or wired ethernet, and you need to be within range of Nvidia’s servers for the magic to work. Download speed isn’t as key: 50Mbps should suffice for 4K, and you can get away with less.</p><p>But I’m armed with a AT&amp;T Fiber connection, and I live maybe 30 minutes away from Nvidia’s San Jose, California servers, which makes me a best-case scenario for this tech. Still, Nvidia has over 35 worldwide data centers now, including 14 distinct locations in the United States, and my colleagues with Xfinity and Spectrum cable internet in Portland and Brooklyn tell me <em>Expedition 33</em> played just as well for them.</p><p>“The latency was negligible to the point that I wasn’t missing parries,” <a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/cameron-faulkner">Cameron Faulkner tells me</a>, saying he nailed the Sad Troubadour on the first try. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/jay-peters">Jay Peters</a> and I found we needed to adjust our timing a bit, but I wound up playing roughly half the game over GeForce Now and almost never looked back.</p><p>Even with the best of connections, though, GeForce Now isn’t bulletproof. Once or twice a day, my seemingly stable gameplay session would at least briefly unravel into a choppy mess.</p><p>In single-player games like <em>Expedition 33</em> and <em>Indiana Jones</em> I could easily forgive a few minutes of trouble, but my colleagues <a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/antonio-g-di-benedetto">Antonio Di Benedetto</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/erick-gomez">Erick Gomez</a> saw it in otherwise stable twitch shooters where lag could be a bigger issue. “I saw a handful of lag spikes / hiccups that would definitely screw anybody over in a competitive shooter, but thankfully they weren’t at the worst times and they soon subsided,” Antonio tells me.</p><p>You also give up some of the Steam Deck’s portability. While you can plug and unplug the Steam Deck from a TV dock and seamlessly switch between big screen and small screen play, you can’t just put the Steam Deck to sleep without ending the session and losing unsaved progress. (Unlike, say, <a href="https://github.com/streetpea/chiaki-ng">Chiaki.</a>) And although the native GeForce Now app supports 4K60, a big leap up from 1440p, you may find yourself squinting at tiny text because it doesn’t scale the UI appropriately.</p><p>Speaking of portability, public Wi-Fi generally isn’t good enough for GeForce Now, and neither are most cellular connections — even with four bars of Verizon 5G UWB service and a wired USB tether to my phone, my stream quickly deteriorated into the jumble you see below. Only the very best cellular connection in my entire neighborhood, a spot right under a 5G tower where I can get 1,200Mbps down and 30 millisecond ping, felt playable to me.</p><p>You may have noticed an asterisk* or two earlier in this story, back when I said I was testing a $20-a-month service that gives you the power of a GeForce RTX 4080. That’s because Nvidia’s GeForce Now also technically has a free tier, and a “Performance” tier, and I highly recommend you ignore both of them, even just playing on a Steam Deck, because they’re dramatically subpar.</p><p>For me, it was the difference between playing <em>Expedition 33</em> through a clean window, or a dirty window. (Epic spec, native resolution, vs. Medium spec, 50 percent resolution with DLSS). It’s the difference between playing <em>Alan Wake II</em> and <em>Indiana Jones</em> on the Deck’s screen with full ray tracing, or none at all and some graphical compromises to boot. It’s the difference between comfortably stretching to 4K with some DLSS tricks, or not.</p><p>But the biggest caveat with GeForce Now may be outside the company’s control: you have to bring your own games, and yet you only can bring games where Nvidia has explicitly struck a distribution deal.</p><p>Nvidia has made progress: 165 of my 457 Steam games are now available to play, up from 85 two years ago. The company offers over 2,100 games in total across Epic, Battle.net, Ubisoft, Xbox, and GOG too. But Nvidia has no games from Sony, so I’m not playing <em>Helldivers 2</em>, no games from Rockstar, so I’m not playing <em>GTA V </em>or <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>, and no <em>Elden Ring</em>, no <em>PUBG</em>, no <em>Schedule I</em> or <em>Football Manager</em> or <em>FIFA</em> or <em>NBA</em> or <em>The Sims.</em> We never quite know which games GeForce Now will get, or when, or if they <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/6/21168645/nvidia-geforce-now-2k-games-titles-bioshock-borderlands">might disappear</a>.</p><p>Cloud gaming has never felt like a better deal, now that the service has matured, now that handhelds can make such good use of it, and now that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/656783/gpu-prices-are-out-of-control-again">buying your own GPU is such a ridiculously expensive proposition</a>. Maybe I’ll defer my own next GPU upgrade in favor of a subscription.</p><p>But it’s not for everyone — you should definitely try a $8 GeForce Now Ultimate day pass first — and there’s still <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22547334/cloud-gaming-xbox-xcloud-microsoft-streaming-google-stadia-amazon">a lot of mental friction</a>. I’m not looking forward to the day that Nvidia <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/7/24289443/nvidia-geforce-now-monthly-playtime-caps-performance-membership-1440p">alters the deal further</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-gets-native-steam-deck-app/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>NVIDIA announced today that the GeForce NOW native Steam Deck application, previously announced at CES 2025, is now <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce-now/download/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">available for download</a>.</p>
<p>It was already possible to run GeForce NOW on the Steam Deck via the built-in browser. However, that wasn't an optimal solution. Even the installation has been streamlined, as users can just download the app from the official website and follow the instructions to install it on their portable device. NVIDIA says that playing a game via its cloud gaming platform can consume up to 50% less battery life compared to running the same game natively on the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>GeForce NOW on the Steam Deck supports streaming at up to 1440p 120 FPS when connected to a<br>
monitor or 4K 60 FPS when connected to a TV. NVIDIA will further improve the GeForce NOW<br>
streaming experience and is looking to add new features, including support for 90 FPS in a future update.</p>
<p>HDR10 is supported on GeForce NOW for premium members (those subscribed to the Ultimate or Performance tier). It works when using the Steam Deck in handheld mode (provided that you've got a <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-deck-oled-announced-reservations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam Deck OLED</a>, since the original model does not support HDR10) or when connected to a TV or monitor. Of course, if you're subscribed to those tiers, you'll also enjoy RTX features such as ray tracing/path tracing, NVIDIA DLSS 4, and Reflex on supported games.</p>
<p>Speaking of games, today's GeForce NOW Thursday also reveals six new PC games to the ever-growing GeForce NOW library:</p>
<p>● Nice Day for Fishing (New release on Steam, May 29)<br>
● Cash Cleaner Simulator (Steam)<br>
● Tokyo Xtreme Racer (Steam)<br>
● The Last Spell (Steam)<br>
● Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon (Steam)<br>
● Torque Drift 2 (Epic Games Store)</p>

To cross to the island players must talk to the boat-keeper who can be found on the jetty in Wyndham Village. He will give you information about the island as well as your first Lead.</p><p>“Midsummer is located close to the Windscale Atom Plant and as a result the levels of infection in both the people and environment are higher than on the mainland,” explained Rebellion Developments head of design Ben Fisher. “You are going to meet new enemy factions including pirate bandits and infected druids. To help you survive there are new weapons to be found on the island including a devastating Blunderbuss shotgun, a new bow, cutlass, daggers and the Beekeeper’s Staff. You will also be able to acquire new skills which will aid you on your quest as well as an upgraded metal detector which will enable you find even more loot caches.”</p><p>The Leads you uncover in “Wicked Isle” will open a variety of story treads, some of which create new potential endings for the main <em>Atomfall</em> game.</p><p>Included in the Deluxe Edition and in the Deluxe Upgrade Pack, and available to purchase separately when released ($19.99), “Wicked Isle” will be available June 3.

                <p>Doom: The Dark Ages launched earlier this month, and if you've already finished the Doom Slayer's prequel journey through Hell and a bizarre cosmic dimension, you don't have to stop ripping and/or tearing just yet. Bethesda and Kramer Guitars have partnered to create three guitars based on the game, and they're every bit as flashy and intense as the Slayer--but you'll have to be lucky to get one. </p><p>The three guitars, which appear to be functionally identical and sport different Doom-related visual designs, are classic Kramer, featuring a Floyd Rose bridge and a single humbucker. The brand was well known in the '80s for its shred-friendly axes, and the aesthetic certainly pairs well with a game as violent and over the top as Doom. </p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15971423/4503506-doom-kramer.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4503506" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15971423/4503506-doom-kramer.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4503506"></a><figcaption>Glowing eyes not included</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15971423/4503506-doom-kramer.jpg"></figure><p>"The unique designs were carefully applied with multiple layers of paint across several weeks, and each focus on one of the powerful weapons in your arsenal: the Atlan, Serrat the Dragon, and the Doom Slayer himself," reads the <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/05/29/doom-kramer-guitars-giveaway/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">official announcement</a>. They were created by illustrator Luke Preece, whose other work includes Gears of War: E-Day and art for bands like blink-182 and Metallica. </p><p>Now comes the bittersweet part: You can't buy these guitars. Instead, Xbox will be giving them away via its Instagram accounts, with residents from the US, Canada, the UK, France, Germany, Austria, and the Netherlands eligible to win. Alongside the three guitars, you can win a copy of Doom: The Dark Ages, the game's collector's edition, or special-edition Xbox controllers. </p><p>Doom: The Dark Ages is a great addition to the legendary series, focusing on brutal counter-attacks and close-quarters chaos. In our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/doom-the-dark-ages-review/1900-6418361/" data-ref-id="1900-6418361">Doom: The Dark Ages review</a>, Alessandro Barbosa called it "a finally tuned adventure that delivers the power fantasy of ripping and tearing through thousands of demons without losing an underlying complexity that makes each encounter engaging to blast through."

            <p>The Ukrainian government-run Center for Countering Disinformation have <a href="https://cpd.gov.ua/en/results/rf-en/how-russia-militarizes-youth-through-computer-games/%22%22">released a warning</a> about a new free-to-play shooter, Squad 22: ZOV, which they say is a blaring propaganda instrument for the Russian military that "mythologises" the country's invasion and bombardment of Ukraine since 2022. The accusation actually dates back to February this year, but it has resurfaced and picked up pace online now that Squad 22 is on sale via Steam. Valve have yet to comment. </p> <!--more-->
<p>Squad 22: ZOV certainly makes no secret of its affiliations. According to the Steam page, it's "designed with insights from Russian veterans and active soldiers" and "is officially recommended by the Russian Military for use as a basic infantry tactic manual for cadet and Yunarmy training" - Yunarmy being short for Russia's state-funded Young Army Cadets National Movement. </p>
<p>On the <a href="https://squad22.online/gameteam/">official website</a>, it's further described as being "developed with information support by The Main Military-Political Directorate of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation". Developers SPN Studio cite several military consultants, including a soldier who fought in the "SMO region" between 2014 and 2024 -  SMO being short for "Special Military Operation", the Putin regime's cute little safeword for their perverse and stupid invasion, which has led to hundreds of thousands of deaths on both sides.</p>
<p>The developers have responded to the accusations of being stooges for the Russian military on <a href="https://x.com/AlexanderT68010">Xitter</a>. They appear to be enjoying the adverse reaction, predictably describing it as "free marketing" and inviting people to "put our team on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myrotvorets">Mirotvorets</a>", the online repository of "enemies of Ukraine" set up by Ukrainian politician Georgy Tuka back in 2014. They also post a fair bit in support of Russia's assault. Of Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy's recent declaration that Ukraine has no plans to capitulate to Russia, the developers comment snidely: "meaning, we will have a lot of content to make more missions in our game".</p>
<p>All of which makes me wonder what, exactly, Valve's policy is towards naked state-backed propaganda games on Steam, of which there are more than a few. According to the developer Twitter feed, Squad 22: ZOV <a href="https://x.com/AlexanderT68010/status/1922915188577030147">passed Steam moderation on 15th May</a>. For all the bragging about Russian heroism on social media, the game's creators strike a timid stance on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3573040/Squad_22_ZOV/">the Steam page</a>, promising only to "delve into the complexities of the 2014 and 2022-2024 events" and "gain insight into the perspectives of those who lived through these periods, understanding how these events shaped their lives and opinions". I wonder how much, if at all, they had to tweak that wording to satisfy Valve's moderators.</p>
<p>Valve don't explicitly prohibit state-sponsored propaganda on their <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/steamdirect/">Steamworks submission page</a>, though they do prohibit hate speech, "libelous or defamatory statements", "content that violates the laws of any jurisdiction in which it will be available", and "content that is patently offensive or intended to shock or disgust viewers". If they did ban games that explicitly advance the interests of national militaries, they presumably would have taken down the page for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/203290/Americas_Army_Proving_Grounds/">America's Army: Proving Grounds</a> - the official FPS of the US Army, live on Steam since 2015 - and possibly also Pandemic's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4520/Full_Spectrum_Warrior/">Full Spectrum Warrior</a>, a 2004 tactics game which describes the U.S. Army as "the most powerful ground force in the entire world" and began life as a military training aid.</p>
<p>I make those last comparisons not for the sake of some whatabouttery argument that every side is as bad as the other - amongst the hairs we might split, neither <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/full-spectrum-warrior">Full Spectrum Warrior</a> nor <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/americas-army-proving-grounds">America's Army: Proving Grounds</a> is explicitly set in an on-going war, with the prospect of DLC obnoxiously riding on the delaying of a peace settlement - but simply as a reminder that connections between military organisations and the video games industry run deep. Squad 22: ZOV is a real piece of work, but it's far from an anomaly.</p>
<p>I've emailed Valve for comment and will update this piece as and when I receive one. In the meantime, perhaps you'd like to play <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2362070/Hollow_Home/">the demo for Hollow Home</a>, a Ukrainian-made RPG about the occupation of Mariupol, or check out Frogwares' <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-sinking-city-remastered-gets-a-surprise-launch-with-a-50-discount-on-steam">recent remaster of The Sinking City</a>, or have a browse of <a href="https://indiecup.net/">the winning entries to last week's Indie Cup Ukraine competition</a>. Thanks to <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/05/27/russian-army-backed-military-propaganda-game-squad-22-zov-listed-on-steam">Game Informer</a> for passing this on.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tmnt-tactical-takedown-impressions<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown</em> came out last week and, being a turn-based tactics game, <a href="https://aftermath.site/strategy-game-turn-based-tactics-movement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I was both personally and professionally obligated</a> to try it out.</p><p>How does a series based on <em>TMNT</em>, which famously features loads of melee combat against hordes of shitty enemies, work in a tactics game, a genre usually known for cover, guns and careful planning? It embraces the chaos, asking you to take control of turn-based ninja turtles and spend a whole level running around slashing and smashing things.</p><p>To make things a little spicier than just an endless grind of close-quarters combat, <em>Tactical Takedown</em> has what I can best describe as a continually collapsing landscape, where sections of the map will disappear while others appear ahead of you. It's important to note that the game does this regardless of where you are; you don't trigger the collapse, it just happens to you in the middle of a fight, with the idea (I assume) being it continually ushers you through a level as though you were flying through a stage<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles_(arcade_game)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> from Konami's classic 1989 beat-em-up</a>.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown - Official Launch Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/S0Ab1XckSRM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>It makes the game breathless in its own turn-based way, as you can never just bunker down behind cover and get in a leisurely shootout. Since you're always taking damage (it's melee combat against a <em>lot </em>of bad guys, you can't avoid it) you have to always be moving to kill enemies and always be jumping to grab health items and always be thinking and always worrying about the impending collapse of the tiles you're currently standing on. I dig the idea! Any attempt to try something fresh with an established genre like this should be applauded, because as you might expect given how many turn-based games are called "<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=xcom+like&amp;rlz=1C1CHBF_en-GBAU1030AU1030&amp;oq=xcom+like&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIMCAEQIxgnGIAEGIoFMgwIAhAjGCcYgAQYigUyEwgDEC4YgwEYxwEYsQMY0QMYgAQyDQgEEAAYgwEYsQMYgAQyEwgFEC4YgwEYxwEYsQMY0QMYgAQyCggGEAAYsQMYgAQyDQgHEAAYgwEYsQMYgAQyEwgIEC4YgwEYxwEYsQMY0QMYgAQyCggJEAAYsQMYgATSAQgxMDgzajBqN6gCALACAA&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">XCOM-like</a>", innovation can sometimes be in short supply.</p><p>In this particular game's case, though...this is not what I play these kinds of games for. I am a languid gamer, an enjoyer of turn-based games for the serenity and contemplation they allow, and the amount of stuff <em>Tactical Takedown</em> was throwing in my face the entire time was just too much, too damn stressful. It often felt overwhelming in ways that I am actively trying to avoid with this genre, yet which in turn felt wasted on a game where everyone had to wait their turn instead of just <em>going at it</em>. </p><p>Not helping things are a lack of variety once the game's basics are laid out to you in the first couple of levels, and a few too many cut corners in terms of presentation. I'm not demanding AAA standards from my low-fi tactics games, but for something with a half-decent license, and which is drawing inspiration from one of the best-looking video games of the late 80s, the static visuals--the game looks more like a tabletop experience, with animation in short supply--were a little disappointing.</p><p>I get the design lure of bringing one game or genre's vibe into another--<a href="https://stonehandgames.com/the-great-air-race/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I've literally done this myself!</a>--and appreciate there may be many others who are far less precious about their genre expectations than I, but for me, here, the two just weren't a great fit, no mater how interesting the foundational idea might have been.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/ea-black-panther-canceled-layoffs"><h3>Another Day, Another Round Of Layoffs At EA</h3></a><p>Black Panther is canceled, and workers (once again) suffer the consequences</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/parrying-good"><h3>Parrying Is The Best Thing In Video Games</h3></a><p>Everybody’s gangsta until somebody parries your bullshit</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
