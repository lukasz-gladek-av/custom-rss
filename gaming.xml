			<p>Today, Electronic Arts <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/news/global-drop-rates" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unveiled</a> the official drop rates for the <a href="https://wccftech.com/apex-legends-shockwave-gameplay-trailer-released/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apex Legends</a> lootboxes to get Heirloom Shards. Why now after five and a half years? Well, the reason is simple: South Korea recently passed a law that requires publishers to disclose loot box drop rates, so EA decided to share a global communication. Here's what they had to say about Heirloom Shards:</p>
<p><em>Heirloom Shards are rare, reflecting the very special nature of these items in our game. While we have shared in the past that Heirloom Shard drop rates were less than 1%, we can share the more detailed percentage of 0.045%. However, we built in a guaranteed Heirloom Shards drop for those who did not receive any after opening 500 Apex Packs† to balance this. This ensures that every player will receive this currency to unlock a Mythic item of their choice along their Apex journey.</em></p>
<p>EA stressed that these are the lowest possible rates based on the inventory of a player who hasn't earned any of the Apex Legends cosmetics from the relevant Apex Pack pool. Since Apex Packs feature duplicate protection, players cannot receive the same cosmetic item twice; as users unlock more of a cosmetic item type, their odds of getting a specific item inevitably increase. As a result, every account has different odds of acquiring each cosmetic item type based on what they have previously unlocked. The post also reminds fans that items in the Apex Pack pool may also be obtained through other means, like using Crafting Metals to craft the item.</p>
<p>Apex Legends players already knew the drop rates to be 'less than 1%', although the reality is much worse, as many had already suspected. By the way, rather than complying with the new South Korean law, Take-Two has recently <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/nba-2k25-to-remove-vc-packs-due-to-mandatory-odds-disclosure-in-south-korea.986688/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decided</a> to outright remove NBA 2K25's own lootboxes (the VC Packs) from the Korean version.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/9/24266135/nintendo-original-alarm-clock-alarmo-prototypes<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo just announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/9/24265984/nintendo-alarmo-alarm-clock-date-price">its new Alarmo clock</a> with a motion sensor, and even though we’re still soaking in the $100 device, the company also shared a look at some interesting early prototypes that reveal how the project changed during its development.</p><p>While the Alarmo is round and an eye-catching red, one “early” prototype Nintendo showed in an “Ask the Developer” interview had a more boxy shape and came in gray. This prototype did have an interesting feature in its dot matrix LED display (similar to the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/24/24205675/amazon-discontinue-echo-dot-with-clock">now-discontinued Echo Dot with Clock</a>), but Nintendo ultimately went in a different direction because “we felt that this display system wouldn’t be able to communicate the instructions sufficiently,” says Nintendo’s Yosuke Tamori, who oversaw the development of the Alarmo. “It was especially difficult to explain the product’s new features, such as the motion sensor,” he says.</p><div><figcaption><em>I don’t hate this?</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Nintendo</cite></p></div><p>Another prototype, which looks more like the Alarmo you can buy now, sat on a pedestal. “The system that serves as the brain of the alarm clock is in the base, and the LCD screen and speaker are built into the upper part, with one dial on the top, and a second on the side,” according to Tetsuya Akama, the director of the Alarmo project.</p><p>However, “the second prototype was difficult for left-handed people to use because the dial was on the right,” Tamori says. “Also, we wanted it to be stable even without the base part, so eventually, we placed all the controls on the top.”</p><p>Those two prototypes aren’t as immediately recognizable as an alarm clock, but Akama explained why the team went with the more traditional alarm clock shape with the final product:</p><div><blockquote><p>The most difficult factor in the design decision was whether to make it look like an alarm clock or not. While it’s a highly novel product that offers a completely new experience, we thought it was important to communicate clearly that it’s an alarm clock. After a lot of consideration, we decided to go with a design that people would instantly recognize as an alarm clock. Also, Tamori-san requested that if Alarmo was to be drawn as a picture or icon, it should be in a shape that would be instantly recognizable and eye-catching to anyone who saw it, so we ended up with this shape.</p></blockquote></div><p>The full interview, which is broken out <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fwhatsnew%2Fask-the-developer-vol-14-nintendo-sound-clock-alarmo-part-1%2F">into</a> <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fwhatsnew%2Fask-the-developer-vol-14-nintendo-sound-clock-alarmo-part-2%2F">four</a> <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fwhatsnew%2Fask-the-developer-vol-14-nintendo-sound-clock-alarmo-part-3%2F">separate</a> <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fwhatsnew%2Fask-the-developer-vol-14-nintendo-sound-clock-alarmo-part-4%2F">parts</a>, includes a ton of other interesting details about the Alarmo, including why the team went with the color red, didn’t go with gesture controls (somewhere, a Google employee <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/15/20907715/google-pixel-4-motion-sense-gesture-controls-radar-sensor-project-soli-demo-features">is shedding a tear</a>), and didn’t add any game elements to the clock.</p><div><figcaption><em>I can hear </em>Breath of the Wild<em> sound effects just by looking at the font.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Nintendo</cite></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

And if you want to master mechanics and hone your play style, there are great in-game tools to help you. A fantastic example of this is the brand-new V-Rival mode, that was also added in the recent update.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="192516" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Halo Infinite Map of Zelda’s Kokiri Forest Is Absurdly Detailed" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="102" data-playlist="192516,193144,192531" data-current="192516"><div><p>This Halo Infinite Map of Zelda’s Kokiri Forest Is Absurdly Detailed</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/192516/192516_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/192516/192516_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/192516/192516_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/192516/192516_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/17972.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><strong>Read More:</strong>&nbsp;<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/street-fighter-6-replay-review-how-to-use-1851667802&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/street-fighter-6-replay-review-how-to-use-1851667802"><em>Street Fighter 6</em> Has Added The Coolest New Feature, And Not Enough People Know About It</a></span></p><p>Similar to the aforementioned Replay Review feature, the V-Rival mode has been somewhat overshadowed by the Terry Bogard DLC fighter. It’s also entirely possible you missed this new addition if you haven’t visited the Battle Hub since the update. We’re going to break down how this mode works, the secret to setting up your own V-Rival, and how to complete the associated V-Rival Challenges.</p><h2 id="h129137"><a id=""></a><strong>How Does V-Rival Mode Work?</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="f9be836c9597e177bc5ecd7497027f78" data-recommend-id="image://f9be836c9597e177bc5ecd7497027f78" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Street Fighter 6 Juri win screen with feedback messages on the right-hand side." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Street Fighter 6 Juri win screen with feedback messages on the right-hand side." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f9be836c9597e177bc5ecd7497027f78" data-recommend-id="image://f9be836c9597e177bc5ecd7497027f78" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Street Fighter 6 Juri win screen with feedback messages on the right-hand side." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The mode will unlock once you’ve spoken to Li-Fen and her cute robot partner Sim Sim in the Battle Hub. Not unlike Super Ghost Battle from <em>Tekken 8</em>, <strong>V-Rival mode pits you against AI fighters that are compiled from player-ranked data.</strong> You enter parameters, such as a specific rank, character, and control type, then an AI opponent who meets the attributes you selected will be generated.<br></p><p>Win or lose, you’ll earn some post-match feedback depending on how you played. This could range from commending you on breaking throws to pointing out that you were often hit by Drive Impacts. Talking to Li-Fen directly will provide some deeper commentary on what’s going well and what you could improve on.</p><p>It’s also possible to spectate a battle between two V-Rival CPUs. All you need to do is enter the same parameters as above to narrow down what kind of CPUs you want to watch fight. I prefer to watch these through replays, but a general representation of players fighting through this is still pretty useful.</p><h2 id="h129138"><a id=""></a><strong>How to Fight Your Own V-Rival</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="1f170e483e683d4c3e22d9f8db660f45" data-recommend-id="image://1f170e483e683d4c3e22d9f8db660f45" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Self V-Rival menu, which shows how many matches are needed to generate one." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Self V-Rival menu, which shows how many matches are needed to generate one." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1f170e483e683d4c3e22d9f8db660f45" data-recommend-id="image://1f170e483e683d4c3e22d9f8db660f45" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Self V-Rival menu, which shows how many matches are needed to generate one." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>For a more introspective experience, you can also face off against a V-Rival based on your play style. You need online experience against them in 10 matches to create a Simple V-Rival, and 50 matches to create a Detailed V-Rival. If you’ve played online a lot already, there’s a chance you’ll have enough matches logged to try this feature immediately. This will, unfortunately, be pretty tricky for everyone else.<br></p><p>The wording isn’t very clear, and has led most people to believe you either need online matches as a particular character or against them. Ironically, both groups are halfway there. <strong>The only way to log matches for your own V-Rival is through online mirror matches</strong>. If you want to fight your own V-Rival Zangief, you’ll need to play as him against other Zangief players.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong>&nbsp;<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/street-fighter-6-terry-preview-replay-v-rivals-1851633356&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/street-fighter-6-terry-preview-replay-v-rivals-1851633356"><em>Street Fighter 6</em>’s Version Of Terry Looks And Feels Tremendous In Action</a></span></p><p>That’s not too tall of a task when you’re using a popular character like Ken, or a new roster addition like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/street-fighter-6-terry-preview-replay-v-rivals-1851633356&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/street-fighter-6-terry-preview-replay-v-rivals-1851633356">Terry Bogard</a></span>, but it’s undeniably tough for fans of Dhalsim or E. Honda. My suggestion is to find people in the Battle Hub who are using the same character. This is a far more convenient method for mirror matches than the random selection of Casual and Ranked modes.</p><h2 id="h129139"><a id=""></a><strong>How to Complete V-Rival Challenges</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="630b459c1608f100cc73ca6aa065664c" data-recommend-id="image://630b459c1608f100cc73ca6aa065664c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A strange-looking player avatar asking Li-Fen for feedback." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A strange-looking player avatar asking Li-Fen for feedback." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="630b459c1608f100cc73ca6aa065664c" data-recommend-id="image://630b459c1608f100cc73ca6aa065664c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A strange-looking player avatar asking Li-Fen for feedback." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>At the bottom of the V-Rival menu is an option labeled Rewards. Most of these are very straightforward to earn, but a few have the confusing task of completing a <em>V-Rival Challenge</em>. There isn’t a proper explanation of what these are, or even how to accomplish them. You won’t be able to figure it out by just playing matches non-stop, either.<br></p><p><strong>The trick is to talk with Li-Fen and ask her if she has any feedback for you.</strong> She’ll offer you some praise on what’s going well and mention a specific aspect you could work on. Keep what she said in mind and apply it during your next V-Rival matches. After you’ve had at least one successful match with improvement, talk to her again to properly complete the V-Rival Challenge.</p><p>Don’t feel bad if this left you feeling perplexed. There’s no visible marker for what the current challenge is or when you’ve improved enough to consider it done. That means you need to make your best estimate of whether you’ve shown progress toward the criticism she laid out. I’ve been able to complete a couple of these with one solid match, but it might take longer for other challenges or higher rankings.</p><hr><p>Many find V-Rival to be a great way to experience and learn from ranked mode fights in <em>Street Fighter 6</em>, without the worry of losing progress. I recommend at least using V-Rival matches as a warm-up before entering ranked mode. It could be a better way to get you in the competitive mindset than just playing a few casual matches.<br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Fans have <a href="https://x.com/StevenImpson/status/1843811770559017132" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">taken to Twitter</a> to report that PlayStation removed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/hotline-miami-2-wrong-number-review/1900-6416049/" data-ref-id="1900-6416049">Hotline Miami 2</a> from sale in Australia and refunded PS5 owners who bought the game. It was added officially to the PS store just over a year ago--almost a decade after its release--but was removed because the game never received an official rating from the infamously strict Australian Classification Board.</p><p>Upon the game's initial release in 2015, designer Jonatan Söderström encouraged Aussie fans to pirate the game since it had been blocked by the ACB. This was mainly due to its inclusion of a skippable scene that showed a simulated sexual assault. However, when it was released last October on the PS5, and even added to the PS Plus Extra catalog, things seemed copacetic for players down under.</p><p>This week, players were suddenly greeted with an email and a refund for their purchase, explaining the situation.</p><p>"We have become aware that the product Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number has not received a proper rating from the Australian Classification Board and have therefore taken steps to refund customers who have purchased the game," the message read.</p><p>"We have issued a refund of the total purchase price for the product back to your original payment method. This may take 30-60 days to appear on your bank statement," it added. "If your original payment source is unavailable, we will refund the purchase amount to your PlayStation Network wallet."</p><p>Interestingly enough, this isn't the first time the game has been accidentally released on a digital storefront in Australia. In 2019, the same thing happened for the <a href="https://press-start.com.au/news/nintendo/2019/08/20/hotline-miami-collection-has-released-in-australia-despite-being-banned/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo Switch</a> but it was removed just 24 hours later and is still unavailable.</p>

October's PlayStation Plus additions for Premium and Extra subscribers have been revealed, and there's a bunch of seasonally appropriate spookiness - <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dead-island-2">Dead Island 2</a> and Dark Pictures: The Devil Within, for starters - alongside the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/return-to-monkey-island">Return to Monkey Island</a> and Gris.
</p>
<p>
In total, October brings 10 new PlayStation Plus catalogue additions for Premium and Extra members, and there are a further four Premium-exclusive titles - including cult-classic PS2 horror Siren - which combine to look like this:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Dead Island 2 (PS4, P55)</li>
<li>Two Point Campus (PS4, PS5)</li>
<li>The Dark Pictures Anthology: The Devil in Me  (PS4, PS5)</li>
<li>Gris (PS4, PS5)</li>
<li>Return to Monkey Island (PS5)</li>
<li>Ghostbusters: Spirits Unleashed (PS4, PS5)</li>

<p>
So it's a busy one, with plenty of options if you're looking for a bit of Halloween spookiness. There's gruesome first-person zombie maiming in Dead Island 2, another bout of Supermassive-developed cinematic narrative horror in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-dark-pictures-anthology-the-devil-in-me">The Dark Pictures Anthology: The Devil in Me</a>, multiplayer spectre-snaring action in Ghostbusters: Spirits Unleashed, and, of course, enigmatic stealth-horror from Silent Hill creator Keiichiro Toyama in 2003's Siren.
</p><p>
Slightly less spooksome, but still schlockily intense is Capcom's much-loved Dino Crisis (basically Resident Evil but with dinosaurs instead of zombies) - and for something completely different, other highlights include comedic point-and-click pirate adventure in Return to Monkey Island, emotionally charged platforming in the beautiful Gris, and jovial Bullfrog-like management action in 2022's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/two-point-campus">Two Point Campus</a>.
</p>
<p>
All the above joins the PlayStation Plus game catalogue next Tuesday, 15th October, and you'll find more details on each title <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/10/09/playstation-plus-game-catalog-for-october-dead-island-2-two-point-campus-gris-return-to-monkey-island-and-more/">over on the PlayStation Blog</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/paleo-pines-future-uncertain<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Paleo Pines&nbsp;</em>developer Italic Pig has revealed that it's unsure whether it'll be able to "keep our team together for much longer" if it doesn't find a production partner for further updates to the game, as well as a potential sequel.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1202200/view/4693404975557515744" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post on Steam</a> titled "<em>Paleo Pines&nbsp;</em>Needs Your Help", Italic Pig says that while it initially thought the plan for the game "seemed simple", the studio has noticed that "the whole indie game scene is facing a sudden drying-up of publishing and investment opportunities".</p>
<p>It seems Italic Pig is feeling that drought as well. The studio says it's been "searching high and low for a production partner" for a <i>Paleo Pines&nbsp;</i>sequel, as well as potentially to keep up work on&nbsp;<em>Paleo Pines</em>, but that the "future" has "fall[en] through" on a number of occasions on this front.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/paleo-pines-future-uncertain-digging.jpg?itok=aP2Jlo5r 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/paleo-pines-future-uncertain-digging.jpg?itok=dMC72KjF 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The future of&nbsp;<em>Paleo Pines&nbsp;</em>is uncertain right now, developer Italic Pig has admitted.</figcaption></figure><p>In the Steam post, Italic Pig entreats fans to help the studio by forwarding any information they may have about potential publishers or investors to studio CEO Kevin Beimers.</p>
<p>Other ways you can help include buying&nbsp;<em>Paleo Pines&nbsp;</em>DLC if you're so inclined, as well as buying the full game if you're playing the demo, picking up a&nbsp;<em>Paleo Pines&nbsp;</em>plushie, or ordering other merchandise.</p>
<p>Even spreading the word however you can will help Italic Pig in some way, the studio says. The post closes with Italic Pig thanking <i>Paleo Pines&nbsp;</i>fans and expressing a hope that "this won't be the end of the&nbsp;<em>Paleo Pines&nbsp;</em>adventure".</p>

<p><em>Paleo Pines</em>' current publisher is Maximum Entertainment, which is currently undergoing a pretty drastic restructuring that has seen <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/merge-games-shuts-down">subsidiary studios like Merge Games</a> swept up in its wake.</p>
<p>Evidently, there's some issue with Maximum funding future&nbsp;<em>Paleo Pines&nbsp;</em>endeavors, which is why the devs are turning to fans in order to figure out what to do next.</p>
<p>If you want to support&nbsp;<em>Paleo Pines&nbsp;</em>and you haven't picked the game up already, you can do so right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1202200/Paleo_Pines/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10005927" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/paleo-pines/9NQ5Z2WH4XDB" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-games/Paleo-Pines-2431592.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.&nbsp;</p>

In short, <em>Stardew Valley</em> iterates on the core mechanics of the <em>Harvest Moon</em> (also known as <em>Story of Seasons</em>) series of games. That means there is an in-game day/night and season cycle during which players can grow and harvest crops, do some fishing, construct new buildings on their farm, and form relationships with other residents of the game’s town. This combination of systems (and many more that I didn’t mention) creates the potential for every player to find exactly what they like in <em>Stardew Valley</em> and pursue that for the entire playthrough. In many ways, the mundane but delightful cycle of farming in <em>Stardew Valley</em>’s beautiful pixel art world was responsible for the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/best-cozy-games-disney-dreamlight-valley-chill-relaxing-1848255535&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/best-cozy-games-disney-dreamlight-valley-chill-relaxing-1848255535">cozy game trend</a></span> that is now in full force. </p><figure id="" data-id="c01459c6e9894b6eace579f864827230" data-recommend-id="image://c01459c6e9894b6eace579f864827230" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A farmer walks across wooden piers at night, surrounded by colorful boats" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A farmer walks across wooden piers at night, surrounded by colorful boats" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->ConcernedApe</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c01459c6e9894b6eace579f864827230" data-recommend-id="image://c01459c6e9894b6eace579f864827230" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A farmer walks across wooden piers at night, surrounded by colorful boats" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The ability to choose how you play is central to the longevity of <em>Stardew Valley</em>’s success. Each of the game’s systems is fully realized, supporting and rewarding hours upon hours of investment, if you so choose. This also means that you can focus on those elements that appeal to you most. If you don’t like fighting enemies in the mines, for example, you can largely ignore that. Hell, if you want, you don’t even have to farm too much and can just turn this into your own <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-five-best-fishing-mini-games-1838787493&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-five-best-fishing-mini-games-1838787493">fishing simulator</a></span>. Which you absolutely should because despite what many people say, the fishing in <em>Stardew Valley</em> is actually excellent!<br></p><p>That breadth of options also means that there is always something new to try if you’re getting stuck in a rut or want to start a new playthrough. Not that <em>Stardew Valley</em> ever really ends. Sure, there is a loose main story to pursue if you want, but even after that’s wrapped up the game constantly has new festivals to attend, new buildings to construct, and even entirely new areas to explore. This is in large part thanks to developer ConcernedApe constantly updating the game. Just this year, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/stardew-valley-update-1-6-launch-time-new-features-1851348560&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/stardew-valley-update-1-6-launch-time-new-features-1851348560">patch 1.6</a></span> brought with it a slew of new things for players to discover. </p><p>All this is to say, <em>Stardew Valley</em> really is as good as everybody says it is. It is the platonic ideal of the cozy farming game. Again, you probably already own it. But even if you do, surely you know somebody who doesn’t, and since<em> Stardew Valley</em> is only $7.49 right now, you could buy it for them as a gift! Who wouldn’t want that gift?</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/sparking-zero-tops-all-dragon-ball-games-on-steam/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Dragon Ball Sparking Zero is now in early access on Steam and has already demolished player peak records for all other Dragon Ball games on the platform. At the moment, Dragon Ball Sparking Zero sits at an all-time player peak of 91,005 on <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1790600/charts/">SteamDB</a>, more than double that of the next contender.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To put things into perspective, there are several popular Dragon Ball games on Steam; however, none of them have ever had an all-time peak that was even close to Dragon Ball Sparking Zero. Dragon Ball Fighter Z is the next game in line, and this title peaked at 44,303 around 6.8 years ago. Similarly, games like Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot and Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2 peaked at 25,852 and 19,416, respectively.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Dragon Ball Sparking Zero hitting a peak of over 90,000 on Steam is a remarkable achievement, considering this player base currently only consists of the ones that purchased the Deluxe or Ultimate Edition. A whole wave of players are yet to join the game once it launches for Standard Edition owners.</p>



<p>However, we do not know how the game compares to the old Budokai Tenkaichi titles, as they were never released on Steam. But, we do know that Dragon Ball Sparking Zero has also beaten the likes of <a href="https://steamdb.info/charts/?compare=454650,678950,851850,1364780,1778820,1790600" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Tekken 8 and Street Fighter 6</a>.&nbsp;</p>

It was a continuous chatty presence in the corner of your screen, that occasionally serenaded you with really bad songs and potato recipes.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">It literally does nothing useful. It goes against any good software practices. It’s completely unusable. Running it is bad usability. It is a constant disruption on your screen… Yet people really appreciated this distraction.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">Its popularity was enough for me to make a second version where you could water your potato, comb, or discipline your potato for whatever reason. Sometimes your potato would feel threatened by other files on your machine and you would have to protect it.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">Seeing how people appreciated these toys, I went on to making other desktop pets… like a little ghost that would haunt your screen and hide behind windows.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It is fascinating to me how people like collecting these. I was told that people would make a folder and treat those folders like they are a “home” to these silly digital creatures, including decorating the folder with little offerings to them (like image files).</span></p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sWA-ueDpfFI" height="300px" width="100%" data-testid="iframe" scrolling="auto"></iframe><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I went on to explore this theme further by making a game that took place on your actual desktop, inside of folders, called “</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://alienmelon.itch.io/lovestory">A Desktop Love Story</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">“.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">There were two folders, each with a file living inside them. One file, “the shy file”, was in love with “the cute file”, but couldn’t profess that love. Only you as a system administrator could help them fall in love and finally meet.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">So you spent time passing around notes (plain text documents and images) between these two files, which one file generated for the other. A simple script in the files would read what you put into their directory, generate a response, and state was managed that way.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">Eventually the two files agreed to meet, and you have to put them into the same folder.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">Note that if you did this too early they would freak out because they were not ready to meet. They had to be ready.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">When they were ready, you finally placed them together and they’d fall in love, supposedly living happily ever after in that folder. Also note that if you separate them after that, they would cry about losing their love.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">People often tell me that they still have that folder with the two together, and they imagine the two having a happy file life there.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">This is just a little thing that uses the actual desktop, and desktop folders, as a space to tell a story. It completely changes your perception of what a desktop and files are.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">Even something as simple as files on a computer have a life that we can apply a narrative to.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This highlights that transformative quality these unusual things have. Suddenly your desktop is not just some space for work, but it’s a world to exist in. Play is possible here.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This has always been part of computers. That urge to make something our own, to extend it, to customize it, to be weird in it… is a cornerstone to exiting on the web or on a desktop.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">We have such a long history of spaces, tools, platforms, software, that allowed customization and even thrived because of it.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">We remember GeoCities because of that.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Computers empower people to be creative and enable a fantasy reality. We can be whoever we want on the web. That anonymity isn’t only necessary for expressing ourselves, it empowers us to explore aspects of ourselves we might not be able to in other contexts.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">If we understand this, this need for users to exist like this, we can build in a positive direction that continues to keep this dream alive.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As game designers we, more than anyone, understand the value of fantasy realities.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The way this translates to tools and platforms I think is inspiring. Not only that but “fantasy realities” are necessary for building better realities.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The fantasy console movement, for example, I think is as beautiful as it is profound for how it lets participants create actual games in this entirely made up context. Pico-8’s accessibility, and even disarming way that it exists, makes it so approachable the community surrounding it is naturally supportive and positive.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">The fact that it’s a fantasy reality, brought into practical reality by inviting participation with both play and creation, gives people a space to exist in that’s egalitarian.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">It’s hard to imagine that Pico-8, or Bitsy devs, would be as exploitative as the larger game industry or any other issues plaguing mainstream games, because of the context these tools exist in.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">Pico-8 keeps this dream of creative participation, fantasy reality, anonymity… alive because I could start participating there anonymously, and explore making things for that space, without any bar for entry or even pressure to output work a certain way.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The stakes are low and creative autonomy is in my own hands.</span></p><p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iIqqKQLrGZc" height="nullpx" width="100%" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="iframe-video"></iframe></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When I started this journey that eventually led me into game design, I began as some high school kid dabbling with interactive art for the web because I was inspired by the net-art movement. I was enamored by the idea that I could bypass curation, galleries, and what seemed (at the time) an incredibly unattainable art world that would never let me be part of it because I didn’t have access to the types of things that would enable an artist to be seen.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">With the web I could just publish my work, and people could see it. I could grow on my own, on my own terms, anonymously.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">The internet put power into my own hands. It gave me that freedom.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">I put out this collection of interactive poetry pieces called&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://bluesuburbia.com/">BlueSuburbia</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. It was an online world of animated poems, and spaces that a visitor could explore. I was studying animation at the time, so BlueSuburbia was like existing in a giant animation that you could click through to trigger or explore its tangents.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">The bar for entry was very low. Flash made it easy to make something richly animated, with lots of sounds, music, programming… I didn’t need to know any engines or game design. I could grow on my own terms, learning to code as I needed it.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">I think this is still a beautiful thing about computer culture, and the internet, this sort of complex output is made simple because of tool makers that made it accessible to someone like me.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">Now I can make tools too, and I “give back” by doing so.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">We are all participants in this type of positive upward spiral.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">BlueSuburbia grew to having a cult following. It was a lot for a highschooler. I enjoyed following people’s reaction to the work, and speculation about who made it. I was fairly anonymous at the time. Nobody knew that it was just some high school kid making this. My friends didn’t know, my teachers didn’t know… I worked on it during break in the library, or after school. I didn’t really share my secret art project with anyone.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">People online loved it. It would constantly get shared in impressive sounding places, and got put on some curriculum for interactive art. Nobody knew it was me.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">I would get people sending me their resumes. When they found out it was just some kid doing this they would stop talking to me…</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">I make it a point to share all this because I don’t think I would have found this creative path if it wasn’t for anonymity.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">I couldn’t have done it without this low-stakes fantasy possibility space that was the early internet.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Here, I could make something without any obligation to anyone, and there was a healthy boundary between myself and the people that called themselves fans of it. I didn’t owe anyone anything just because they liked it.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">Contrast this to today, where artists have to have a constant calculated presence on social media, and share a lot of time, energy, or aspects of themselves to promote their art. There’s really no sense of boundaries here. Having those would even be counterproductive to successfully existing on these platforms, or building a following.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">Existing becomes a form of competition in context of the social media web. It’s a type of constant aggressive public performance, rather than a space for self-expression.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">I draw this distinction because we, as developers and creators, still have the autonomy to do better. The internet is still a massive possibility space where we can invent better avenues of participation. We are not that powerless to the whims of corporations.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Links in this slide…</span></span><br><span data-testid="content-text">–&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1SQlvtaX60">Why Are YouTubers Quitting?</a></span><br><span data-testid="content-text">–&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://vandevo.medium.com/the-shocking-truth-why-youtubers-are-quitting-in-2024-8d2237fc9486">Why Youtubers are Quitting in 2024</a></span><br><span data-testid="content-text">–&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://fstoppers.com/business/why-are-so-many-influencers-quitting-youtube-657006">Why Are So Many Influencers Quitting Youtube</a></span><br><span data-testid="content-text">–&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/@Zheng_Yu/reasons-why-youtubers-quit-youtube-66dfd4c30005">Reasons Why Youtubers Quit Youtube</a></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I often think to what extent the game industry’s reliance on centralized algorithm based social media, like Twitter, actually caused harm in the way it encourages us to dunk on eachother, or drag eachother for ultimately irrelevant things often taken out of context. Social media rewards controversy and manufactured outrage.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">It’s easy to get sucked into participating in the hamster wheel of takes because you want to be part of something, but to what extent?</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">Who do we alienate with that behavior?</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">Who have we alienated when we all jumped into a conversation that was rooted in dunking on someone?</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">It happened so often that it became normal… It’s hard to imagine any other context where it’s ok to treat peers like this.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">It is a long standing rule that outrage feeds engagement, and I don’t think that dynamic will ever change because it’s so core to modern social media.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">2024 marked a year of mass exodus of various popular to small Youtubers announcing that they are quitting Youtube. Various reasons have been sighted, most notably burnout and a change in how the monetization model works. One Youtuber explained that if you go inactive for even a short period of time they will turn off your monetization, and your channel will sink back into oblivion. Youtubers are kept in a constant hamster wheel race of outputting content, with the rules of the platform constantly changing in ways that often negatively impact their monetization. What gets to be viral or not is heavily based on chasing algorithms.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">It’s fascinating to look at all this because, along with the hope of popularity comes the constant grind of maintaining all that, otherwise you will disappear.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">This isn’t sustainable, nor is it healthy for people.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">The word “Content Creation” entails creating content for a platform, often for free, and there are a few that rise to the top in a way that they can maybe both maintain that success and sustain themselves from it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If you grew up on the early internet, and watched these platforms rise to popularity… Maybe you could have seen this coming. Either way, I’ll share a story…</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">At the beginning of YouTube the website had a very small yet positive community of artists making videos there. Me and my sister would post our work there. One of my animations was even featured on the front page. This happened a few times, and was back when they still curated. Humans curated. It was not algorithm based.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">Despite being given this visibility boost, there was not a single negative comment to my video. It was rare to get anything outright mean.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">With the rise of web celebrities, and celebrity video blogging, YouTube was featured in mainstream news on TV. The sensation that anyone could now be famous was irresistible.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">My sister often points to that very moment that the dynamic on the site changed.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">Our videos got flooded with negative angry comments, or sarcasm. The dynamic completely shifted. People expected to be entertained. This was now something for consumption, and people were entitled to it.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">It wasn’t long until people found out that by causing flame-wars in their video comments that it helped give the video attention.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">This sort of dynamic seems to have stuck with the way attention is directed, or harnessed, on modern social media. Outrage is good for views.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">With this, I think it’s important to understand that social media is not the internet. It is a layer built on top of the internet. We are capable of building beyond that.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Older social spaces like GeoCities or MySpace offered plenty of room for positive self-expression, and customization. You could thrive there as an artist and have your work recognized. Plenty of musicians gained their popularity on MySpace. It was possible to grow a following without chasing the favor of algorithms or shifting monetization rules.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">In modern context, we don’t have that type of self-expressive, customization, or level of freedom, and it seems crucial that we understand these dynamics because we (as developers, designers, and creators) are the ones with the power to do better.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Links in this slide…</span></span><br><span data-testid="content-text">–&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://chollinger.com/blog/2024/08/why-i-still-self-host-my-servers-and-what-ive-recently-learned/">Why I still self host my servers (and what I’ve recently learned)</a></span><br><span data-testid="content-text">–&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://nekoweb.org/">nekoweb.org</a></span><br><span data-testid="content-text">–&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://mmm.page/">mmm.page</a></span><br><span data-testid="content-text">–&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://neocities.org/">neocities.org</a></span><br><span data-testid="content-text">–&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://leaflet.pub/home">leaflet.pub</a></span><br><span data-testid="content-text">–&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.exegesis.io/">www.exegesis.io</a></span><br><span data-testid="content-text">–&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://zonelets.net/">zonelets.net</a></span><br><span data-testid="content-text">–&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://github.com/k0a1a/hotglue2">Hotglue</a></span><br><span data-testid="content-text">–&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.pillowfort.social/">www.pillowfort.social</a></span><br><span data-testid="content-text">–&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.wickeditor.com/#/">www.wickeditor.com</a></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I was lucky to have my roots in websites because I always understood the value of building my own online spaces, and hosting everything that mattered to me on my own sites.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">Many online communities that I wanted to rely on, but didn’t because I hosted my own things, came and went. Each time I was grateful that I never decided to rely on any one service.

It’s positive participation, and that positive feedback loop that grows out of it.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">When we contribute to this internet, existing in the digital world this specific way with alternatives, we contribute to a type of independence from monopolies and control.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">Understanding the basics of self-hosting, website building, and DIY culture is digital freedom. This liberates us from the enshitification and exploitation we constantly deal with.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There’s a point to be made that when GeoCities was at its peak, and personal websites were very much the way people existed online, that space often got criticized for “bad web design”. Things moved too much. The colors were too bright. Every website was completely different. There was a pocked of people that didn’t like this, and pushed for more standardization.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">Eventually the personal website went out of fashion, but it’s interesting that we remember this the way we do.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">It was imperfect for its time, but idealized now… Even Myspace was heavily criticized for all those wild customized pages with animated gifs and weird navigation between places… But it’s now sorely missed.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">I think this is an interesting push and pull, because these things, once criticized, are what people generally miss the most now.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Commercialization, and the standardization that follows when shifting focus to something being catered specifically to consumers, is a type of gentrification that even the internet was never immune to.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I think, when you consider these small examples of internet history, it is more meaningful to focus less on what the web used to be, and focus more on what we want it to be.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Inspired by this colorful past, as developers, we can create possibility spaces with our tools and communities.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">We can invite people into this space, lowering the bar for entry, and keep alive this model of making creation accessible to anyone.</span></p><p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/z8FcDouH31o" height="nullpx" width="100%" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="iframe-video"></iframe></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A few years back I started building this tool called the&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://unicornycopia.com/ezm/">Electric Zine Maker</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">It started as a cute little creative tangent to a larger project that I planned to bundle it together with.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">Initially the Electric Zine Maker was just going to be a black and white drawing tool that outputted to an 8-page zine template, for quickly making and printing really simple little things. I had the know-how, so why not make a little hidden easter-egg zine making tool as part of my bigger game?</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">I love the idea of letting people make art inside of a game. Creativity is such a vulnerable thing. It makes the game much more personal to players because they are able to express themselves in it. It creates a connection between the player and your game. It’s why the intersection between tools and games is so interesting to me. The space that an art tool lets you inhabit can be playful too.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">This is the tangent the Electric Zine Maker grew from.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Overnight I threw this little drawing app together. I asked on social media if people would be interested in using it, to gauge if it was even worth the effort of releasing it on its own. My friends all said “yes”.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">I was pretty concerned that the lack of features would make it uninteresting so, to compensate for that, I made the UI as over the top as I could, hoping that this would make it an interesting experience for people.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">I didn’t think it would be much, so I made sure that it also had a potato presence in it so I could shoehorn it into my potatoware software. It seemed like a good candidate for software that is useless, silly, or a practical joke.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">Whatever the result, it would still fit in *somewhere*.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Most of this early build of the Electric Zine Maker was hacked together in a frenzy.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I love eccentric and colorful UI design, it makes things fun to exist in. The fact that it looks “so different” helps encourage people to be open minded when interacting with something. It invites you to leave your expectations at the door, and be willing to experience something radically new because it just looks so weird.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">It encourages this level of open mindedness in players, especially when you need to encourage people to view what they are doing playfully, which is perfect for art-making.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">I also added some weirder tools to the Electric Zine Maker, to accompany the simple black and white features, that I thought might help with throwing together unique looking zines.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I published whatever I had to itch.io and thought nothing more of it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This early “Electric Zine Maker” took off overnight. The way it did really fascinates me.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">It garnered a lot of interest, and I credit that to how different, weird, unusual, eccentric, loud, colorful, and so on… it looks.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">The project turned into something of a “yes, and” (like in improv theater) between me and the community that used it.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">I would see someone use the Electric Zine Maker in a unique or silly way, and then I would make sure that this style of creation was supported by it.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">Like I noticed people using it to design games, so I incorporated templates that let you have branching options when paging through the final zine. Some of these templates were very weird, like the Tetraflexagon, which is based on a popular paper-math-toy.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">In this template you can page indefinitely, always discovering new combinations of pages… It’s bizarre, but people ended up using it in very creative ways, so I made sure to support more of that.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">I kept building the Electric Zine Maker to support sillier use-cases or features that I noticed people using it for.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The drawing tools that ended up being in the Electric Zine Maker are all very weird in terms of an art tool. You can draw with glitches, it has a “fluid dynamics” features where you can splash around in your art, you can paint with animated gifs that you import, or use it to generate actual ASCII art, or even paint with ASCII art… Lines will pulsate, grow, and change colors… All of these combinations allow you to make very different looking art.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">In the end, that supposed “uselessness” ended up being very useful to people because it made things like glitch-art accessible to anyone.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">People using the Electric Zine Maker often use it just for the art tools… not just to make zines. They’ll use the art tool to create game art because it’s so easy to make glitchy looking things in it.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">The combination of tools makes certain aesthetics accessible to people who would otherwise not know how to do the same in Photoshop.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">I think that alone is a really beautiful thing to see.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Each tool, or game engine, has its own aesthetic. Smaller more specific tools empower aesthetics that would otherwise require more technical know-how in the bigger style-agnostic engines. Pico-8 lets you discover your voice as a pixel artist, even if you don’t know how to make pixel art. You can explore your own pixel aesthetics there.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">It’s harder to do that in something like Unity where you have to specifically know what you want to make before making it. These larger tools require a bigger technical hurdle, and plenty of practice, before you’re good enough to just confidently throw something good looking together.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">It’s similar with the Electric Zine Maker. The fact that it is a fantasy, completely separated from more realistic art tools, lets people explore aesthetics that would require more work elsewhere.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I always thought it was sad that modern mainstream art tools spend so many resources on replicating real world art tools, like realistically drawing with water color, pencil lines that mimic drawing with actual pencil, or the way chalk looks… when digital art has this huge possibility space where we can re-invent what a line is.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">I think this is a great metaphor for any other tool, engine, platform, community, or aesthetic. We can invent these new playful ways of being, or expressing ourselves, and empower people to participate in that.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">It lowers the bar of entry for everyone. Because it’s so egalitarian it makes creation welcoming to people who might otherwise be put off by, or intimidated by, things that look too professional. It completely removes the need to be “good enough”.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It’s enough to just make something.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As game designers we understand the importance of building fantasy. Our digital worlds hold space for inhabiting fantasy in beautiful and creatively empowering ways. The intersection between tools and games is made possible through play.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">Software is art too!</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">An art tool can be art just as much as its output.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">Art is a type of play.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">Creativity is play.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">I think acknowledging this is inspiring because I built this fantasy world around the Electric Zine Maker too.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I made a silly website called “</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://mackerelmediafish.com/">Mackerelmediafish.com</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">” and it’s part of this entirely different tangent about a lost technology. The player has to visit this website, dig around in it, to find this missing deteriorating technology, eventually freeing it so it can live again.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">The Electric Zine Maker makes references that it is built in “</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://mackerelmediafish.com/">Mackerelmedia Fish</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">“. Tying into this fictional world.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">As a result, the Electric Zine Maker feels more like a relic of some alternative digital universe, than it does as realistic software.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">By creating this fiction the tool exists in its own space. At this point it’s more than just a tool, it’s part of a story, and people are invited to participate in that story by making their art in a specific, wild, unusual way.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">It encourages this playfulness as you create.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I find it very interesting that a common feedback for the Electric Zine Maker is that it helped people break out of a writers block, or get out of a creative rut.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">When I showcased the Electric Zine Maker, it was always fascinating to observe the types of people that use it. You will get this person approaching the table, clearly interested, but too shy to use it.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">They’ll say that they “don’t have any ideas”, are “not good at drawing”, or “aren’t creative” themselves… They’ll start casually pocking around in it. As they discover these silly tools they’ll be smearing lines, glitching, enjoying the animated bubbling brush-strokes… What ended up being a very casual “sure I’ll try it”, turns into half an hour or more of them making an actual zine.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">The fact that it’s such a “toy” helps it be a tool to people. They invent uses for the very weird art tools. They end up making something even though they had no intention to do so.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">This speaks to the power of play in creativity. When you make a tool, you clearly see how connected playfulness is to art.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“Different” can break us out of a creative rut. It’s beautiful to be given spaces where you are encouraged to “play”. We get so used to viewing software, the internet, websites… a certain way, with certain restrictions and traditions, that we forget all this can be wildly different.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">There’s a difference between usability and tradition.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">Usability is not a one-size-fits all model, and it should not be viewed as a death sentence for creative, different, wild, loud, or colorful work.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">Conversations surrounding usability, accessibility, and who this alienates always bothered me because I don’t think it means that work can’t be interesting anymore if you care about usability.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">It’s a design language like any other, and it can be explored to empower other forms of usability too, that does not alienate people who enjoy or want different things. It also does not need to prevent experiences from being eccentric.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">Standards and good usability are not the same thing. Approaching it like it is a design language, where you get to see how it fits into your project, you can define your own way to make your work accessible.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">It’s about listening to your user base, and seeing how you can empower them to exist in your software that certain way.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When we view usability as this very rigid and restrictive thing, the conversations often turn into the same arguments that criticized GeoCities, or experimental websites.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">Software is art too!</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">It’s about giving people access to being able to enjoy that.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">People often criticize my work for being so different, but I think that’s missing the point.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">I didn’t have it in me to make another Photoshop, or something similarly traditionally accessible for a number of reasons…</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">The biggest ones being that I could never compete with Photoshop, or properly cater to the needs of the type of community that would use something traditional.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">Standards come with their own set of expectations, and that can be difficult if you have limited resources.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">It’s A LOT of work, resources, time, energy, and often stress, to make something “normal” because the bar for expectations for that already exists. It’s set by people much more advantaged than me, who have the resources to cater to exactly that. “Normal” entails higher expectations based on the professional bar of quality that exists.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">The way your tool is designed is also what creates the type of community your tool ultimately attracts. If you create something professional looking, you will have to take care of professional needs, which is a lot more work for someone like me.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">I have no comfortable means to invest enough work, or time, required to make something “standard” that lives up to these expectations.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">I believe that it’s important to find your own voice. Everyone brings something unique and meaningful to the table. This is true for software too. Lack of resources can ultimately be your greatest strength because it forces you to really explore something different. There’s space here to make something beautiful, meaningful, and unique.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">In this case, I decided that there are enough professional tools out there. There are not enough unique tools that treat how they exist as a type of personal expression in itself.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Our digital world needs this silliness too, just as much as it needs productivity oriented professional software. These two things can live in harmony and are necessary for each other.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">The Electric Zine Maker grew to support countless other silly, strange, and unusual tools for this reason.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Another interesting thing about developing the Electric Zine Maker, which I also observed in other “low-stakes” tools like Bitsy, or Pico-8… is that simplicity in your own development choices as you build makes it much more welcoming to others that might want to extend your tool.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">When I decided on how to approach “saving your work” in the Electric Zine Maker, I was looking at a lot of options.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">Some more complicated ones would have involved more arbitrary formats…</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">It took a lot of late nights looking into all sorts of complicated sounding things that I remember more as a fever dream than anything I can recall to properly convey here…</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">I eventually decided to keep it as simple as possible and just output to a folder called “Zines” on your desktop. Inside of “Zines” is a folder named after whatever you named your work, and (inside that folder) is each panel of the zine, saved as a .png titled after the page number.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">Each panel is saved as just a number, not names, so it’s incredibly simple to load and save your work.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">Because of this you can easily take your zine, import your panels into Photoshop, and work on it there. You could just use the Electric Zine Maker for the templates, and not as an art tool. This made collaboration simpler.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">–&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://jeremyoduber.itch.io/js-zine">https://jeremyoduber.itch.io/js-zine</a></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Also, because of that simplicity… another developer, Jeremy Oduber, created an&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://jeremyoduber.itch.io/js-zine">HTML5 reader</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;for publishing Electric Zine Maker zines for the web. It features this adorable page turning effect, and you can have your zines running in your website.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">Credit to this, most Electric Zine Maker zines are shared as HTML files online, instead of just boring pdf’s, or as a template. It made the entire project even more accessible.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I don’t think it would be half of the program it is today without that one feature built by another person. This was made possible because the entire thing was simple enough to extend.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">As developers, I think it’s easy to forget that simple, low-fi, is often good. Lower the bar for others. Big fancy impressive-sounding technical decisions often work against us.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When you create a tool, platform, or anything, it’s a collaboration between you, the computer, and the community that uses it.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">No matter how eccentric, weird, arbitrary seeming the tool. People will love to use it. People love low-stakes niches. Participation is what makes our digital culture so special. It’s easy to underestimate these low-stakes things, but there are plenty of examples for how they take off because they are so accessible to anyone.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If we leave behind the standard practices, conceptions, and ideals about what a program (or even what a game, what the internet…) “should be”, then we have this massive unexplored creative space. The possibilities here are endless for inventing new modes to be creative. Inventing new ways that a community can exist around something. Even empowering people to view what they are doing in a new positive light.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">This empowers a type of uniqueness only possible in a digital context. The digital world lets us explore unimagined “what if’s”. It lets us explore concepts we would never be able to in real life, because we can create things that are so singularly weird.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If you think about it, even early Twitter was viewed as useless. They had to convince people that a character limit was a cool thing. That limitation ended up being what made it the social media platform that it became.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Limitations can empower us. As game designers we can embrace that and invent positive alternatives.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Links in this slide…</span></span><br><span data-testid="content-text">–&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://enginesdatabase.com/">https://enginesdatabase.com/</a></span><br><span data-testid="content-text">–&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.nathalielawhead.com/candybox/the-generous-space-of-alternative-game-engines-a-curation">The Generous Space of Alternative Game Engines</a></span><br><span data-testid="content-text">–&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://itch.io/c/235488/cool-tools">Cool Tools</a></span><br><span data-testid="content-text">–&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://microsoftgraveyard.com/">Microsoft Graveyard</a></span><br><span data-testid="content-text">–&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://killedbygoogle.com/">Killed by Google</a></span><br><span data-testid="content-text">–&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://killedby.tech/">Killed by Tech</a></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Scandals surrounding Unity have been an unfortunate reality for a lot of developers. I’m old enough to remember when Unity was not a mainstream tool at all but just becoming a competitor to Flash development. Unity was for the underdogs. It was an indie tool.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">It still amazes me when I see how mainstream it is. It’s something that companies now use, with job listings involving it.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">Unity became successful because of all the “little people” that used it. We made it what it is. It’s easy for a company to lose sight of that, but in the grand scheme of things that keeps happening.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">When a tool dies because of bad leadership, arbitrary decisions from the company that owns it, or any number of unfortunate things, it’s a sadly massive loss. A tool represents a piece of digital history. A tool is a lot of effort on part of everyone that participated to make it what it is. It’s an evolution in use-cases, feedback, and prioritizing various needs that shapes it. Every tool is unique for that.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">I dearly miss Flash and don’t think anything ever really replaced it.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">We where at that point again, where we saw the same thing happening to Unity.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">I saw a lot of teachers completely panicked by these decisions wondering what they will teach their students now that Unity is on such shaky ground. Some even give up entirely teaching one tool because it’s so hard to promise a future in the game industry to begin with.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">I think these are interesting things to observe… When our reliance on that one standard gets uprooted, it reminds me that ultimately the principles surrounding good game development are engine agnostic.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The very good programmers I know are comfortable enough with reading and writing code that they can look at a language that they never used before, and understand what that language is trying to accomplish. Working with that new language doesn’t present a major hurdle because the underlying structures are all the same.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">I often wonder why we are not there yet when it comes to the way we approach game engines.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I recently started building games in Unreal. I got good enough that I can throw something together quickly and understand all the trappings, especially what and why something goes wrong. In retrospect, it wasn’t that hard. I realized that what I know still applies here, and it helped me grow into that new ecosystem. Game design, game development, and all these principles are something I’ve cultivated over many years, the basis of which never change no mater what environment I’m in.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There are so many alternatives. Each presents its own interesting way to make a game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Good design is platform agnostic. Our skills are platform agnostic. There are basic principles that apply anywhere. I think we fool ourselves into thinking our skills are reliant on any one tool when digital art is so much bigger than that, and so is our participation in that.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Professionally, yes, we need these standards, but (again) Unity became what it was because of the army of hobbyists that used it. Hobbyists have the power to pick and choose alternatives. Hobbyists and indies have the power to platform those alternatives with what they make in them. Indie developers have that sway.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">No tool would be what it is if it wasn’t for the indies that made it the mainstream tool that it became. We can use that same drive to empower alternatives.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">I think there’s that hope for the future, where we understand that we don’t rely on any one mainstream engine or toolset, but we can conscientiously empower other tools with what we choose to use. Our creative decisions define the future too.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">Who do we empower with our choice to use something?</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">Who do we platform when we create in a tool, use a platform, or participate in a community?</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">It’s up to us.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Its NES Hub connects to that port and adds Bluetooth connectivity, allowing up to four wireless controllers to be connected to the almost 40-year-old console.</p><p>The NES Hub is currently <a href="https://8bitmods.com/retrotime-nes-hub-bluetooth-for-nes/">available for preorder through 8BitMods</a> for $57.28 and is expected to ship as early as December 2024. Installation doesn’t require any soldering, hardware modifications, or for the NES to even be opened. The NES Hub simply snaps into the expansion port and is designed to perfectly sit hidden inside the cutouts under the console. The most complicated part of the installation is connecting a small Bluetooth antenna and sticking it to the back of the console, which seems easy enough.</p><div><figcaption><em>The NES Hub stays hidden inside the cutouts on the underside of the NES.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: 8BitMods</cite></p></div><p>With support for up to four Bluetooth controllers, the NES Hub replicates the functionality of an accessory Nintendo released in 1990 called the NES Four Score that expanded connectivity to up to four wired gamepads.

            <p>Back in July, the Powers That Be at Rock Paper Shotgun's parent company Ziff Davis <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/humble-games-announce-restructuring-laying-off-entire-publishing-team">laid off all 36 members of Humble Games</a>, in response to "challenging economic times for indie game publishing". Now, Humble Games's former general manager Alan Patmore and global publishing VP Mark Nash have founded <a href="https://www.goodgamesgroup.com/">Good Games Group</a>, a new indie publisher who will work with many of the same development partners from their Humble days. They're also partnering with Ziff Davis again, providing support for Humble's previously released games.</p><!--more-->
<p>"Partnering with Ziff Davis allows us to continue working with the amazing indie developers we collaborated with at Humble Games, while also allowing us to chart a new course for the future," Patmore writes on the new publisher's website.</p>
<p>Back in July, it was <a href="https://aftermath.site/humble-games-layoffs-closure-ziff-davis-ign">reported by Aftermath</a> that third-party consultancy the Powell Group would assume responsibility for Humble's remaining publishing projects. It's not clear whether that was ever, or is still, the case, but as our fellow Ziff Davisites at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/">Eurogamer</a> note, several projects released by Humble Games appear on the GGG website, including Carto, Temtem and Midnight Fight Express.</p>
<p>The Humble Games "restructuring" appears to have been on the cards for a while, going by a leaked recording of a conversation with Ziff Davis' technology and shopping division president Steve Horowitz. In the recording, again passed along by Aftermath, he allegedly revealed that ZD had attempted to sell Humble Bundle publishing twice over, but "neither attempt created significant demand, and unfortunately neither attempt created a viable offer or an outcome."</p><p>The "restructuring" of Humble Games - which followed a wave of layoffs last November - sent ripples of dismay through the indie development community. "We are devastated to hear today about the apparent closure of our publishing partner, Humble Games," <a href="https://x.com/LastStarfarer/status/1815842819111526653">wrote</a> the developers of Signalis. "We were lucky to work with really wonderful people who were laid off in November and today and hope they can all land on their feet and find amazing new jobs elsewhere quickly." It's nice to learn that at least a few of them have.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/kaos-cancelled-netflix<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Yesterday, Variety reported that Netflix has <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/kaos-canceled-netflix-1236170945/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cancelled <em>Kaos</em></a> after one season, a show based on Greek mythology that premiered on August 29. Despite spending most of its life so far in Netflix’s top 10 list and garnering millions of views, that wasn’t enough for the streamer to bring it back for a second season. What are we doing here?</p><p><em>Kaos</em> starred Jeff Goldblum as Zeus, the paranoid top god of a version of Earth where people still worship him and his pantheon. Stressing out over a prophecy that predicts his downfall, he becomes the center of an <em>actual</em> conspiracy undertaken by gods and mortals. I found the show’s pacing a bit lacking at times, but the world the show painted was funny and compelling. The standout for me was <a href="https://www.instagram.com/misiabutler/p/CufH_UqoFiD/?img_index=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Misia Butler</a> as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caeneus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Caeneus</a>, a trans guy actor who brought a lot of nuance to the canonical story of his character.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="KAOS | Official Trailer | Netflix" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-max0wOTcuI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Variety writes,</p><blockquote><p>[<em>Kaos</em>] did spend four weeks in the Netflix top 10 charts upon its release, but failed to garner a significant audience in that time. It peaked at number three on the English language TV chart in its second week of availability, with its peak viewership hitting just 5.9 million views.&nbsp;</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>As a regular human and not a Netflix executive looking at the above paragraph, that seems pretty good to me? <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/kaos-canceled-netflix-one-season-1236026813/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Hollywood Reporter</a> writes that <em>Kaos</em> got 14.9 million views over its lifespan, which it calls “middling” but which doesn’t seem terribly out of the ordinary for other <a href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/top10/tv" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ratings on the list</a>. <em>Kaos</em> has only been out for a little over a month, during which it spent most of its time on the Top 10 chart. It seems a little early to me to be pulling the plug, but hey, I’m just some guy who thought the show was pretty OK!</p><p>I am, of course, not <em>just</em> some guy–I’m a journalist who covers TV as part of my beat. I watched the entirety of <em>Kaos</em> close to its release so I could understand the conversation around it and look for potential blog fodder. An actual normal person, with a partner or kids or a job or a regular life to lead, might not have the time to watch a show the moment it airs, especially when the entire series releases at once. A bulk release can be a bigger time commitment than a show that airs every week; it can be hard to resist the urge to watch it all at once, but also easy to watch an episode or two and then not have time for or forget about it, especially if all the critics and websites write about it right away and then move on to the next thing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://x.com/Variety/status/1843642438566502596/quotes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Social media reactions</a> to <em>Kaos</em>’ cancellation bear this out, with plenty of people stating the obvious: they didn’t have time to get to it yet! Others say that it’s hard to get invested in a Netflix show written with multiple seasons in mind when Netflix keeps cancelling things; as <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2023/01/17/netflix-has-created-a-self-fulfilling-cancelation-loop-with-its-new-shows/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Forbes</a> wrote about this sentiment last year, “So you hold off watching new shows, even ones you might otherwise be interested in, because you’re afraid Netflix will cancel them. <em>Enough</em> people do this and surprise, viewership is low! And the show ends up cancelled.” I don’t disagree with this sentiment, and <a href="https://variety.com/2023/tv/news/frequent-tv-series-cancellations-affect-viewership-1235553780/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">data</a> backs it up, but I think it puts the onus on us, the viewer, to drop everything to support a show, instead of the companies like Netflix that actually <em>paid</em> for the show standing behind their work.&nbsp;</p><p>When I took my bafflement to Aftermath Slack, Nathan posited that this ties into the culture around how we’re expected to relate to media in general these days. It’s not enough to just <em>watch</em> a show; we’re required to be <em>fans</em>, for <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-acolyte-cancelled-star-wars" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">better or worse</a>, bingeing shows immediately or seeing movies in theaters on release day, then encouraging others to watch. It feels like if you like something, there’s a certain level of public support you should perform as a ward against it being cancelled or <a href="https://aftermath.site/coyote-vs-acme-fuck-david-zaslav" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">deleted</a>. On the other side, we’ve seen <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/star-wars-lord-of-the-rings-bridgerton-toxic-fans-hollywood-response-1236166736/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">toxic fans</a> wield this power for <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-acolyte-star-wars-controversy-ratings-this-is-all-terrible" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">their own ends</a>, which affects the content of media: IGN reported that <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/inside-out-2-was-the-hit-pixar-needed-but-the-laid-off-employees-who-crunched-on-it-are-still-hurting" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pixar</a> became overly cautious about queer content following backlash to <em>Lightyear</em>, and <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/star-wars-lord-of-the-rings-bridgerton-toxic-fans-hollywood-response-1236166736/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Variety</a> reported that some studios even do focus groups with “superfans” to assess marketing materials or get a sense of what might anger viewers.&nbsp;</p><p>But in a recent newsletter on this phenomenon, <a href="https://buttondown.com/charliejane/archive/why-are-toxic-superfans-such-a-nightmare-for/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Charlie Jane Anders</a> wrote, "Here's the conundrum about super fans in a nutshell:&nbsp;they have some ability to do damage to a movie or TV show, but they have zero ability to make a project successful." Putting aside historical <a href="https://screenrant.com/tv-shows-fans-saved-cancel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">examples</a> like <em><a href="https://fanlore.org/wiki/History_of_Star_Trek_Fan_Campaigns#:~:text=more%20famous%2C%20campaign.-,Origin%20of%20%22Save%20Star%20Trek%22,a%20fourth%20season%20was%20unsuccessful." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Star Trek</a></em>, we've seen this a lot lately: the fan outcry over the end of <em><a href="https://ew.com/our-flag-means-death-creator-announces-end-of-the-road-no-new-home-for-show-8606188#:~:text=Our%20Flag%20Means%20Death%20has,the%20show)%20yielded%20no%20fruit." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Our Flag Means Death </a></em>or Warner Brothers' <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/tv/hbo-max/cartoon-cancellations-animation-warner-bros-discovery" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">constant deletion</a> of beloved cartoons. Shows get cancelled all the time now, whatever level of positive fandom people perform. If I had to diagnose a cause for this, I'd posit it's the growing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financialization" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">financialization</a> of everything: the thing itself matters less than the money that can be attached to it. If positive fans can generate <em>more</em> money--a tall ask, and a marketing responsibility that shouldn't be on them--a thing might stick around; if negative fans can <em>cost</em> a company more money, or even just the threat of it, a thing might get the axe. This feels like it puts the average viewer in a bind: a show can be cancelled if there isn't enough instant buzz and viewer numbers for it, but it also can't necessarily be saved by all the passion and fandom it can muster. Ambivalence then seems like the most logical approach, but that has its own consequences.   </p><p>It seems clear Netflix didn’t see an audience for more <em>Kaos</em>; at its most basic level, you could say this is the fault of not enough viewers watching it. But requiring that instant enthusiasm and time commitment as a measure of success is short-sighted; in <em>Kaos</em>’ case, it now leaves Netflix with an unresolved story that I imagine will be hard to drum up more enthusiasm for. Not that Netflix needs that now–the show is made, and now it can <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/07/magazine/netflix-library-viewer-numbers.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">vanish into the endless onslaught</a> of new shows for Netflix to release and cancel. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/growth-of-esports-betting/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/%E2%80%98it%E2%80%99s-not-an-emerging-betting-sector-anymore%E2%80%99-expert-panel-on-the-growth-of-esports-betting.1005063/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/growth-of-esports-betting/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Recently, an expert industry panel appeared at ESI Lisbon to guide an audience through the growth and state of play for the esports betting market. Presently, esports betting and wagering make up a whopping 53% of all esports revenues, and it’s the biggest channel for earnings in the market.</p>



<p>On the panel sat Moritz Maurer (GRID Esports), Karl Rönn (Kambi Abios), Gal Ehrlich (BETER), and as they explored the esports betting market, it became clear that things were looking bright.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-there-are-billions-in-wagers">‘There Are Billions in Wagers’</h2>



<p>Esports wagering makes up a massive portion of the industry. These days, almost every mainstream betting platform covers esports tournaments, and more operators <strong>specific </strong>to esports betting are surfacing all the time. For the biggest esports games in the business, every tournament represents a solid opportunity for both operators and esports fans to make a little money.</p>



<p>That was the theme touched on by Moritz Maurer, the CEO at GRID Esports:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It’s not an emerging betting sector anymore, <em>there are billions in wagers</em> … We’ve been at this for six years now, and it took a few years to introduce this paradigm shift, but right now we’re in a time where there is buy-in.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>What’s helping the growth of esports betting is the density of data coming out of the space. Over time, esports data is evolving and becoming a much-needed resource in the business. It allows organisations to scout better, media to report clearer, and betting operators to devise more intricate and advanced markets.</p>



<p>Gal Ehrlich of BETER referenced that very point:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>If you look at the amount of data generated by an esports game, it’s enormous. The ability to take this data and build it into algorithms, that’s a major difference … Things are getting blurred. This trend will continue – games are getting more popular, more tournaments, more exposure.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He was bold and bullish about the future of esports betting: <em>‘It’s here to stay and to further develop.’</em></p>



<p>Currently, the likes of Counter-Strike, League of Legends, and Dota 2 represent ‘The Big Three’ in esports. They have the biggest financial backing, the most ambitious tournaments, and the largest betting handles out of the dozens of games that make up the industry.</p>



<p>But things are changing, of course.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>VALORANT is not emerging at all anymore. It’s on par with Counter-Strike when it comes to per-map betting volumes … The Big Three are still there, but I would say that we now have The Big Four. – <em>Moritz Maurer</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>Karl Rönn of Kambi Abios parted ways with key information about the ‘typical esports bettor’, highlighting how esports wagering is bleeding into the wider market:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The typical bettor is male but he’s a bit older than you might think. Almost all people that bet on esports are also big punters in either football or other sports – but usually football.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Esports can reach a diverse audience, and it’s an audience that’s growing all the time. It’s estimated that some 500 million esports enthusiasts exist worldwide, and with a pool of more than two billion gamers filling out that market all the time, it’s only growing – and at a rapid rate.</p>



<p>We’ve already seen esports betting overtake some traditional sports categories – will it continue to surpass bigger and bolder sports as the market grows? Let us know your thoughts on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

The first movie, starring Emily Blunt and John Krasinski, met with criticial and commercial acclaim back in 2018.</p><p>Here’s how the noise detection works: by activating your microphone, this optional feature lets the game’s deadly creatures detect every sound you make in real life, bringing the horror “right into your room.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Here's the official blurb:</p><blockquote>Capturing the frantic terror, unnerving atmosphere and gripping human drama that made the franchise famous, A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead is designed for fans of the films, horror games, and story-driven adventures alike. With nothing more than your wits and the simple tools you can scavenge, you’ll have to overcome the many treacherous challenges and obstacles that lie ahead, all while trying to survive the ever-present dangers that lurk all around you.</blockquote><blockquote>Experience the harrowing journey of Alex, a young college student suffering from asthma and struggling to survive the end of the world alongside her boyfriend, Martin. But the nightmarish creatures stalking the land aren’t the only threat she’ll have to contend with as she travels through the ruins of civilization in search of a safe haven for herself and her family.</blockquote><p>A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead is developed by Stormind Games, the Italian studio that created survival horror franchise Remothered and action RPG Batora: Lost Haven, and published by <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-ii">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a> maker Saber Interactive.

The critically acclaimed remake launched earlier this week, and now Konami has released a Silent Hill 2 costume guide which should help cosplayers put together an outfit in time for Halloween.</p><p>Konami's Silent Hill 2 costume guide <a href="https://img.konami.com/games/silenthill/2r/s/img/SH2_costume_design.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">is online as a PDF</a> via the company's official site. Unfortunately, it's not a comprehensive look at all of the costumes in the game. Instead, it features two of the main characters, as well as two of the most popular creatures in the game. Of the four, it will probably be easier to make a James Sunderland cosplay. His outfit is pretty simple to put together, although finding a good match for his jacket might be hard for some.</p><p>Similarly, Maria's outfit and look should be easily achievable, especially by experienced costume makers. The real challenge will be with the creatures: the Bubblehead Nurse and Pyramid Head. Both of those monsters have been popular choices for cosplayers at comics and gaming conventions. Bubblehead Nurse is a design that calls for some makeup expertise as well. For Pyramid Head, the challenge is getting his helmet to look right.</p><p>GameSpot's review for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/silent-hill-2-remake-review-born-from-a-wish/1900-6418296/" data-ref-id="1900-6418296">Silent Hill 2 remake</a> praised the game for its "meticulous, loving, and stunning recreation" of the original, which came out in 2001. It's currently out on PC and PlayStation 5, but Xbox Series X|S players <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/when-does-silent-hill-2-remake-release-on-xbox-heres-what-we-know-so-far/1100-6526954/" data-ref-id="1100-6526954">will have to wait at least a year</a> before Konami brings it to those consoles.</p>

To do so, the team is searching for test pilots to put the sequel through its paces. But there's a catch: Your PC has to be powerful enough to handle the game.</p><p dir="ltr">Developer Asobo Studio pointed out on <a href="https://www.flightsimulator.com/join-us-for-the-microsoft-flight-simulator-technical-alpha-in-october/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the Flight Simulator website</a> that participants will need to fill out their PC specs to be considered for the technical alpha.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a>'s version 5.1 update is not fully voiced in English due to "recording arrangements".</p>
<p>What these exact recording arrangements are isn't mentioned in the <a href="https://www.hoyolab.com/article/34066691">patch notes</a> that revealed the incomplete English voiceover track, but fans are speculating that the SAG-AFTRA <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/us-video-game-performers-are-striking-over-ongoing-ai-concerns">strike action by video game actors over AI concerns</a> is the cause.</p>

<p>Eurogamer can confirm that Kinich (played by John Patneaude) and Kachina (played by Kristen McGuire) aren't voiced in the the latest story update that continues the nation of Natlan's Archon Quest.</p>
<p>Each update's limited-time events release over the course of six weeks, so it's also possible that the main event in version 5.1 isn't fully voiced either. This event marks a return to the nation of Sumeru, which debuted in Genshin Impact in August 2022, so will be the first time some Sumeru characters have been seen (and possibly heard) in quite a while.</p><p>Developer miHoYo's other games have also seen some English voice talent changes. Adam Michael Gold was replaced as Argenti and Mr. Tail in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/honkai-star-rail">Honkai: Star Rail</a>, as was Courtney Lin, who played Huohuo. Lin also voiced Lucy in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zenless-zone-zero-tier-list-best-characters">Zenless Zone Zero</a>, where she was similarly replaced, along with the unknown actor who played Soukaku. All of these changes were relayed through the games' patch notes.</p>
<p>While neither miHoYo nor the replaced actors have revealed the reasons why they are no longer able to voice the characters, Adam Michael Gold said <a href="https://x.com/AdamGoldVO/status/1818033375464329719">in a tweet after his replacement</a> that "Nobody wants to see their path diverge from characters they've had the chance to love and embody," but that he's "got a clear conscience about the whole situation," while using the hashtags for Argenti and Mr. Tail.</p> <div>

<p>This could refer to the fact that, while the strike does not technically cover games that commenced production before August 2023, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sag-aftra-suggests-gta-6-and-other-games-not-technically-hit-by-strike-could-still-be-impacted">SAG-AFTRA has encouraged</a> all "members who want to show solidarity with the union" to "elect voluntarily not to work".</p>
<p>Apart from some strike retweets from the other replaced actors, Gold's tweet is the closest we've got to confirming that the SAG-AFTRA voice actor strike is the reason for miHoYo's recent English VA changes.</p>
<p>Eurogamer has asked miHoYo for comment.</p>

			<p>The PC version of God of War Ragnarok doesn't offer many opportunities to scale beyond the PlayStation 5's Quality display modes, but with some choice mods, the latest entry in the series can look outright gorgeous.</p>
<p>A new 8K resolution video shared on YouTube by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Massihancer">Beyond Dreams</a> shows the game running with ReSTIR G.I. in Complete Ray Tracing and a custom ReShade preset which bring improved global illumination, ambient occlusion, enhanced FOV, Color grading, and more. In pretty much every scenario shown in the video, the mods make the game look incredible and much better than it does on PlayStation 5.</p>
<p><iframe title="[8K60] God of War Ragnarok | Looks INCREDIBLE with RAY TRACING | RTX 4090 | Complete RT | Camera Mod" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WSLQID_oNEQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The PC version of God of War Ragnarok comes complete with the Valhalla expansion that was released for free on consoles last year. The expansion is a great addition to the experience, managing to introduce a roguelite tweak that works incredibly well, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/god-of-war-ragnarok-valhalla-facing-the-past/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>For a free expansion, God of War Ragnarok: Valhalla offers quite a lot. The roguelite take on the base game's formula works extremely well, thanks to the excellent combat system, which truly shines in the extreme combat scenarios Kratos will have to conquer to confront his past and finally make a step towards the future. Its short length, which prevents the adventure from overstaying its welcome, and excellent accessibility with multiple difficulty settings that don't lock content behind them, also make the expansion one that all those who loved the base game should play.</em></p>
<p>God of War Ragnarok is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, and PlayStation 4 worldwide.</p>

			<p>Notorious Studios, the game developer <a href="https://wccftech.com/notorious-studios-founded-by-ex-wow-devs-wants-to-build-the-next-chapter-of-core-fantasy-rpg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">founded</a> by former members of the World of Warcraft development team, has announced that <a href="https://wccftech.com/legacy-steel-early-access-debut-set-for-late-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Legacy: Steel &amp; Sorcery</a>, its PvPvE extraction action RPG, will be available during the upcoming Steam Next Fest with an Alpha <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2344320/Legacy_Steel__Sorcery/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">demo</a>.</p>
<p>Chris Kaleiki, Founder and CEO of Notorious Studios, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>Our goal was to build upon the foundations of RPG and MMO PvP into its own title, something we haven't quite seen before. We incorporated many of the lessons and learnings from building one of the biggest MMOs of all time (World of Warcraft) into Legacy. Based on feedback we've had from players already, I think we have something special here and we can't wait to share it with more and more players.</em></p>

<li>Actively dodge, block, sprint, attack, and cast in combat.</li>
<li>Level up each character to unlock new skills and traits.</li>
<li>The world is part of the battle. Warriors can charge through walls and hurl boulders, while priests can float over danger and away from enemies. Each class has unique ways of interacting with the environment.</li>
<li>Improve your reputation with vendors to craft the most impressive gear and get them to sell you the best stuff.</li>
<li>Upgrade your permanent dwelling with higher quality furnishings. Better facilities mean more benefits on your adventures.</li>

<p>The game will launch in early access and remain there for around one year before the 1.0 release, which will feature more classes, maps, social features, Steam achievements, additional art, and balance polish. During early access, Notorious Studios plans to release a major update every few months containing new features and content, in addition to bug fixes as needed.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Destiny 2’s Revenant Act 1 Comes Up Short For Players]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/destiny-2s-revenant-act-1-comes-up-short-for-players/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/destiny-2%E2%80%99s-revenant-act-1-comes-up-short-for-players.1005006/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/destiny-2s-revenant-act-1-comes-up-short-for-players/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Destiny 2 has since switched to episodic content to try and make the game more successful after the latest expansion release failed to sell as well as they had hoped. As a result, Bungie has made the choice to switch up their technique entirely, now making all content released episodic, with three episodes being announced by the company. The first episode, Echoes, was released in June, and the second episode, Revenant, is beginning to be released this month. Act 1 of Destiny 2's Revenant has been released, but players quickly find themselves unhappy. Revenant is adding a lot of new content to the game, including updates to Onslaught, as well as new armor and weapons. However, one of the biggest features is the removal of content time-gating, something that fans have been annoyed with for quite a long time.</p>
<p>Revenant was released just yesterday, where players get to fight alongside Mithrax and take on Fikrul, who was one of the major villains in Forsaken, as well as in some other content from Destiny 2. The trailer seemed to be full of excitement and gave the players a lot of hype to work with, but as the content has been released, it seems that players are already disillusioned with what has been released. The whole concept of episodic content for the game was to make it last longer than the expansions did and so that there would be drawn-out storylines that players would get to progress through at a reasonable speed. However, that does not seem to be the case with Destiny 2's Revenant.</p>
<p><iframe title="Destiny 2: Revenant | Launch Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vm_UeYVOWFI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>With the time-gates being removed from the content, it seems that there isn't much content there to begin with. In the first act of Episode 1, it seemed that players were unhappy with the meaningful narrative being time-gated, as it just didn't feel appropriate. However, players immediately began to express their disappointment in the new content, as players found out that there was just about an hour of meaningful content in the new Episode release. Granted, this isn't the entire episode and is only the first act, but the first act is comprised solely of three missions for players to complete in its totality. Players will now have to wait until November 19 for Act 2 to be released, and there's no guarantee that there will be any sizable content added in that part of the episode, either. The trailer seems to have overhyped the act, and players have been left incredibly disappointed.</p>
<p>Already, YouTube videos are coming out expressing their disappointment, and the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1fz7mwf/there_is_no_way/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_content=post_body&amp;embed_host_url=https://www.destructoid.com/destiny-2s-revenant-act-1-can-be-finished-in-under-an-hour/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Destiny 2 Subreddit</a> is brimming with commentary about the recent content added to the game. Considering how The Final Shape performed, the negativity surrounding their new system doesn't seem to be doing <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-to-compensate-artist-for-destiny-2-nerf-blaster-art/">Bungie any favors</a>, either.</p>
