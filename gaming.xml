            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/latest-warhammer-40000-dataslate-update-makes-moderate-changes-across-board<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Games Workshop has released a new <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-40000" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Warhammer 40,000</em></a> dataslate update. This update to the grimdark sci-fi tabletop miniatures game includes numerous adjustments to units, mechanics, and updates to various FAQs and errata.</p>



<p>In an official <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/goxjzhii/warhammer-40000-balance-dataslate-heres-whats-changed-in-the-41st-millennium/" rel="nofollow">Warhammer-Community post</a>, Games Workshop released details on the <em>Warhammer 40,000</em> dataslate update. This update affects all armies in the game and can either be downloaded for free through your browser or through a Warhammer app.</p>

The Adeptas Sororitas' Miracle Dice has been changed slightly. Now you'll get one of these dice every time one of your units dies. Several units have had their recruitment points adjusted accordingly.</p>

<p>The Adeptas Custodes have had some of their units' recruitment points changed as well. The Blade Champion, Custodian Wardens, Venerable Contemptor Dreadnought, Telemon Dreadnought have increased. Alternatively, the Aleya, Custodian Guard, Knight-Centura, and Shield Captains have had their recruitment cost reduced.</p>

<p>The machine-spirit worshipping Adeptus Mechanicus have gotten a slight change. Their Bellisarius Cawl and Tech-Priest Dominus units have gotten a slight cost reduction. Furthermore, the Aeldari army's named unit Asurmen's Hand of Asuyran ability has been adjusted. It is now an Anti-Infantry 5+ ability, reducing its Devastating Wounds potential.</p>

<p>The rank-and-file troops of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/new-warhammer-40000-astra-militarum-army-box-features-death-korps-of-krieg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Astra Militarum</a> received several adjustments in the new Warhammer 40,000 dataslate. The Firing Hot Stratagem now only applies to targeting enemy units within 12 " of the model, and the Krieg Engineers' Remote Mines have been reduced to inflicting 1d3 mortal wounds.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40000-dataslate-chaos-daemons-artwork.jpg?itok=vfOM5WcS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40000-dataslate-chaos-daemons-artwork.jpg?itok=5fhwERCv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Chaos Demons' Legion of Excess detachment has gotten a rework. The Seductive Gambit rule has been changed where dice re-rolls to wound or hit only applies within their Shadow of Chaos. The Thieves of Pain Stratagem now explicitly states the unit intercepting the damage must be able to see the target. Lastly, battle-shock is now gone from the Overwhelming Excess stratagem.</p>

<p>Lastly, the supersoldiers of the Imperium of Man, the Space Marines, have gotten some changes. The new dataslate now makes it clear the Oath of Moment Army Rule only applies if you only use units found in the Space Marines Codex. No Black Templars, no Blood Angels, Deathwatch, or Space Wolves allowed if you want that extra +1 to wound.</p>

                <p>Destiny 2's seasonal event, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-guardian-games-2025-guide-new-weapon-armor-exotics/1100-6530050/">Guardian Games 2025</a>, brings a brand-new weapon to the space shooter's arsenal: Keraunios. This Legendary Arc trace rifle is far more effective in PvE than PvP activities due to the perks it can roll with. Having said that, Keraunios also receives plenty of buffs from Heresy Artifact, as it focuses on Arc abilities and damage output. Here's how to get it and the Keraunios god roll perks to look out for.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#How_to_get_Keraunios">How to get Keraunios</a><ul><li><a href="#Keraunios_god_rolls_">Keraunios god rolls </a></li><li><a href="#Keraunios_PvE_god_roll">Keraunios PvE god roll</a></li><li><a href="#Keraunios_PvP_god_roll">Keraunios PvP god roll</a></li></ul></li></ul></div><h2 dir="ltr" id="How_to_get_Keraunios">How to get Keraunios</h2><p dir="ltr">Keraunios can drop from any Guardian Games weapons source, such as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-rushdown-guide-boss-rush-challenge-rewards-and-encounters-explained/1100-6530070/">Rushdown </a>or by completing objectives given by Eva Levante in the Tower for the duration of the event. Doing the Rushdown mode is the most effective way to get your hands on Keraunios quickly, as if you defeat at least three bosses in a single run, you're guaranteed a Guardian Games weapon drop. Keraunios is exclusive to Guardian Games, so remember that once the event is over, you will no longer be able to obtain it. At least, not until 2026.</p><p dir="ltr">Guardian Games event challenges also include a guaranteed Keraunios drop. All you need to do is earn and deposit any medal from the games in the Tower event area. Completing the first step in the Best in Class quest, collected from Eva Levante, will also give you a Keraunios. Remember that you need to equip or use the Guardian Games class item as an ornament for rewards to drop.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1850/18507742/4458412-destiny-2-keraunios.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4458412" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1850/18507742/4458412-destiny-2-keraunios.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4458412"></a><figcaption>Keraunios</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1850/18507742/4458412-destiny-2-keraunios.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="Keraunios_god_rolls_"><span>Keraunios god rolls</span></h3><h3 dir="ltr" id="Keraunios_PvE_god_roll">Keraunios PvE god roll</h3><ul><li dir="ltr">Barrel: Fluted Barrel  <ul><li dir="ltr">Stability +5, Handling +15</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr">Battery: Light Battery  <ul><li dir="ltr">Handling +10, Reload Speed +10</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr">First Perk: Recycled Energy or Eddy Current  <ul><li dir="ltr">Recycled Energy: Reloading after defeating targets grants energy to your lowest charged ability.</li><li dir="ltr">Eddy Current: Temporarily increases reload speed and handling after sprinting or while Amplified.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr">Second Perk: Jolting Feedback, Detonator Beam, or Rolling Storm  <ul><li dir="ltr">Jolting Feedback: Dealing repeated damage applies Jolt.

As standard, it fires accurate bursts of Arc energy at enemies, but with the right roll it turns into a lethal laser gun. Adding secondary effects, such as Jolt, increases the amount of outgoing damage as well as having the ability to disrupt enemy attacks. While we've opted to improve the handling of the weapon, you can also Masterwork its reload speed to complement the Light Battery, and we'd recommend this option first if you chose Eddy Current over Recycled Energy.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4458414-destiny-2-keraunios%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4458414" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4458414-destiny-2-keraunios%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4458414"></a><figcaption>Guardian Games 2025</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4458414-destiny-2-keraunios%281%29.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="Keraunios_PvP_god_roll">Keraunios PvP god roll</h3><ul><li dir="ltr">Barrel: Smallbore  <ul><li dir="ltr">Range +7, Stability +7</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr">Battery: Projection Fuse  <ul><li dir="ltr">Range +10</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr">First Perk: Dynamic Sway Reduction  <ul><li dir="ltr">Improves accuracy and stability while continuously holding down the trigger.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr">Second Perk: Closing Time  <ul><li dir="ltr">Improves range, accuracy, and handling as the magazine gets lower.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr">Masterwork: Range</li></ul><p dir="ltr">From our selections above, it might seem obvious that we're aiming for a huge increase on the Keraunios' average range. In a fast-paced PvP environment, it's not the strongest weapon you can take to the Crucible. It's still impressive and has the potential to put up a fight against the most formidable Guardians. Closing Time is great for boosting stats that will help you win in close fights, including range, although the magazine needs to be half-empty in order for it to trigger, so don't get too enthusiastic with your manual reloading.</p><p dir="ltr">If you're looking for other new guns, check out the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-lotus-eater-god-roll-guide/1100-6530084/">Lotus Eater sidearm god rolls</a>.

On the Dew Drinkers Discord and Mountain Dew subreddit, you can often spot people sharing photos of their collections. Because there are so many variants of Mountain Dew and some of them are rarer than others, collecting all of them, just the super-rare versions, or simply one’s personal favorites has become a big part of the community. </p><p>Some of these collectors empty the cans and bottles out, displaying them like figurines or pieces of art. But others keep the liquid in the containers, sometimes drinking them years later with mixed results. And one of these collectors, West_Yogurtcloset497 on Reddit, had the worst thing happen to him recently when a single, unnoticed leaky can caused a devasting chain reaction. </p><h2 id="h2772913"><a id=""></a>A Mountain Dew disaster</h2><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/mountaindew/comments/1j7jcy0/psa_check_up_on_your_cans_frequently_and_make/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mountaindew/comments/1j7jcy0/psa_check_up_on_your_cans_frequently_and_make/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On March 9</a></span>, West_Yogurtcloset497—who has been collecting Dew for about three years—checked on his collection of Mountain Dew cans still sitting comfortably in their boxes. What he discovered was horrible. The boxes were soaked and dozens and dozens of cans were leaking. </p><p>“There was a pool of [Mountain Dew] Maui Burst on the floor,” West_Yogurtcloset497 told <em>Kotaku</em> via DMs. “I thought my cat had peed there. I cleaned it up and went about my day. The next day, the [puddle] was there and I investigated.”</p><p>However, it wasn’t cat urine that he had found. Instead, his collection of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-true-crime-story-of-a-gamefaqs-user-who-just-wanted-1847161600&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-true-crime-story-of-a-gamefaqs-user-who-just-wanted-1847161600">Mountain Dew</a></span> cans were leaking soda all over each other and the wall. According to the collector, he’d had most of those cans for about a year and had been storing them in his room while he went to college about two hours away, which made it hard for him to check on the collection. And despite keeping the cans upright, a tactic used by many collectors to avoid blowouts caused by weight crushing the weaker sides of the cans, a leak ruined everything. </p><figure id="" data-id="dc0b504d8077c26c1824666109d30f93" data-recommend-id="image://dc0b504d8077c26c1824666109d30f93" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->West_Yogurtcloset497 / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="dc0b504d8077c26c1824666109d30f93" data-recommend-id="image://dc0b504d8077c26c1824666109d30f93" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>“Presumably, one can from the very top was faulty out of the factory, and leaked,” explained the collector. “The acid decayed the other cans causing them to leak, which exponentially killed more and more cans over the months.”</p><p>After discovering the soda destruction—the collector says he lost about 100 to 125 cans—and cleaning up the sugary mess, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/mountaindew/comments/1j7jcy0/psa_check_up_on_your_cans_frequently_and_make/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mountaindew/comments/1j7jcy0/psa_check_up_on_your_cans_frequently_and_make/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">West_Yogurtcloset497 posted images</a></span> of what happened on the Mountain Dew subreddit, adding: “PSA Check up on your cans frequently and make sure they are stored correctly.”</p><h2 id="h2772914"><a id=""></a>Community reactions and the future</h2><p>In the comments below, people commiserated with the collector about his loss and shared similar stories of times they were screwed over by a leaky can or bottle.

However, he did confirm that his wall is ruined and will need to be cleaned and fixed up. As for the future, the collector tells me that he will continue to store cans, but has learned a valuable lesson in how to do so properly. </p><p>“[I won’t] keep the cans in the boxes anymore,” said West_Yogurtcloset497. “And make sure to check on them frequently. I knew cans eventually leak, but I had no idea that a single leaking can could kill most of my can collection.” </p></div><p>&nbsp;.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The official trailer for The Last of Us Season 2 that premiered on Saturday at SXSW broke HBO viewership records. According to Warner Bros. Discovery (via <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/03/the-last-of-us-season-2-trailer-viewership-record-hbo-1236324465/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deadline</a>), the trailer was viewed 158 million times across various platforms in just three days, a record for any HBO/Max original show in the same timeframe. It goes without saying that the trailer also outperformed previous trailers of the show itself by at least 160%.</p>
<p>It's not the first time the show has made news for its excellent viewership results. It was the second most-viewed HBO premiere of the last decade after George R.R. Martin's House of the Dragon, and it subsequently <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-tv-sets-hbo-record-for-pilot-to-episode-2-growth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">registered</a> the biggest pilot-to-episode-two growth, capturing 5.7 million viewers in the United States when it first aired a couple of years ago.</p>
<p>According to WBD, Season 1 episodes have averaged around 32 million viewers to date in the United States, or around four times the same-day audience of the first season's finale episode, which also marked a record for same-day viewership with 8.2 million viewers.</p>
<p>Needless to say, there's a lot of anticipation ahead of the debut of The Last of Us Season 2, which will consist of seven episodes. The first of these airs on April 13 on HBO Max and the finale is scheduled for May 25.</p>
<p>The new season will adapt a portion of the plot gamers witnessed in The Last of Us Part II, with more to come in future seasons (showrunner Craig Mazin said there's material for at least one or two additional seasons). Franchise creator Neil Druckmann explained there will be some differences from the source material, which will soon <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-pc-is-out-on-april-3-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">also be available on PC</a> when The Last of Us Part II Remastered hits the platform on April 3.</p>
<p>Druckmann also recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/this-could-be-it-for-the-last-of-us-says-series-creator-neil-druckmann/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mused</a> that a third entry in the gaming series may never come to pass, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-is-a-game-about-faith-and-religion-where-players-will-feel-lonely-says-druckmann/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his passion for Naughty Dog's new upcoming sci-fi IP</a> points in that direction. On the other hand, perhaps the viewership numbers, if confirmed throughout the whole season, could sway Sony into asking him to make at least another game in the future.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Last of Us Season 2 | Official Trailer | Max" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_zHPsmXCjB0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Last of Us Season 2 is set around five years after the finale of the debut season, with Joel (played by Pedro Pascal) grappling with the consequences of saving Ellie (played by Bella Ramsey). Other returning characters include Joel's brother Tommy (played by Gabriel Luna) and Maria (played by Rutina Wesley). There will be a lot of new characters, such as Kaitlin Dever as Abby, Isabela Merced as Dina, Young Mazino as Jesse, Tati Gabrielle (who will also play the protagonist of Naughty Dog's upcoming game) as Nora, and Jeffrey Wright as Dixon, reprising his role from the game.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/most-popular-marvel-rivals-heroes-highest-pick-rates.1132740/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/most-popular-marvel-rivals-heroes-highest-pick-rates/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>One of the strengths of Marvel Rivals as a multiplayer title is that every hero is viable in some capacity. But with 37 playable characters (so far) spread across three different roles, there are some heroes in Marvel Rivals that are just more popular than others.</p>



<p>Let’s take a look at the most popular heroes in Marvel Rivals, according to their pick rates.</p>



<h2 id="h-highest-hero-pick-rates-in-marvel-rivals-march-2025-season-1-5">Highest Hero Pick Rates in Marvel Rivals (March 2025, Season 1.5)</h2>



<p>For this list, we’re taking into account the pick rates in both competitive and quick play. For competitive, we’re using current data from tracker sites <a href="https://rivalstracker.com/heroes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RivalsTracker</a> and <a href="https://rivalsmeta.com/characters" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RivalsMeta</a>. For quickplay, we’re using the <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/heroes_data/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hero Hot List</a> from the official Marvel Rivals website. Even though the Hero Hot List was last updated February 17th, it’s a better source of quickplay rates than the incomplete data on RivalsTracker and RivalsMeta.</p>



<h3 id="h-strategists">Strategists</h3>



<h4 id="h-cloak-amp-dagger">Cloak &amp; Dagger</h4>



<figure></figure>



<p>Cloak &amp; Dagger is the most popular hero in Marvel Rivals, in both competitive play and quick play. The strategist duo has been picked in <strong>50.44% of competitive games</strong>, and <strong>18.84% in quick play games</strong>, the most of any hero. Cloak &amp; Dagger’s dual ability set provides high healing potential and elite damage at close range. Even after a nerf, the Eternal Bond ultimate ability is still an incredible tool for crowd control and teamfights. She’s also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cloak-dagger-marvel-rivals-most-picked-hero-is-getting-a-major-buff/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">due for a buff to her primary healing ability</a>.</p>



<h4 id="h-invisible-woman">Invisible Woman</h4>



<figure></figure>



<p>Second to Cloak &amp; Dagger is another strong strategist in Invisible Woman. She’s the second most picked hero in with a <strong>44.39% pick rate in competitive</strong>, and a <strong>18.12% pick rate in quick play</strong>. Invisible Woman’s ability to push and pull enemy players into her Psyonic Vortex is extremely disruptive. Like Cloak &amp; Dagger, Invisible Woman’s ultimate can instantly alter a teamfight, and she has great team up potential with the rest of the Fantastic 4 members.</p>



<h3 id="h-vanguards">Vanguards</h3>



<h4 id="h-doctor-strange">Doctor Strange</h4>



<figure></figure>



<p>Doctor Strange is the most popular choice of Vanguard in quickplay. He has a <strong>27.10% pick rate in competitive</strong>, but a <strong>15.50% pick rate in quickplay</strong>, which is third highest overall behind Cloak &amp; Dagger and Invisible Woman. Doctor Strange is the most popular vanguard thanks to his defensive Shield of Seraphim, and he has one of the most devastating ultimates in the Eye of Agamotto.</p>



<h4 id="h-magneto">Magneto</h4>

<p>Magneto has the slightest edge on Doctor Strange in competitive pick rate, but he’s not quite as popular in quick play. He has a <strong>27.80% pick rate in competitive</strong>, but a <strong>12.60% pick rate in quickplay</strong>. Magneto is a shield expert, with a deployable Metallic Curtain that blocks all projectiles, and a Bulwark bubble he can cast on himself or an ally. His left and right-click attacks deal lots of damage to squishy duelists and strategists, and the special attack from the Metallic Fusion team up makes Scarlet Witch a must-have if playing Magneto.</p>

<p>There are so many duelists to choose from in Marvel Rivals, but Winter Soldier has emerged as the most popular. Winter Soldier has a <strong>25.20% pick rate in competitive</strong>, the most of any duelist, and an <strong>8.09% pick rate in quickplay</strong>, second only to Moon Knight. Most of his ability kit is built around using his Bionic Arm, and the Ceaseless Charge passive that reloads automatically and grants bonus health is exceptionally powerful. And virtually every Marvel Rivals player has been traumatized by the word ‘again’ and an enemy Winter Soldier that doesn’t end.</p>



<h4 id="h-spider-man">Spider-Man</h4>



<figure></figure>



<p>Many Marvel Rivals players, including myself, feel like they run into a Spider-Man in every game. He has a <strong>19.77% pick rate in competitive</strong>, second most for a duelist, and a <strong>6.96% pick rate in quickplay</strong>. Spider-Man players live to endlessly annoy the enemy team, using their hyper mobility to swing in, deal damage, and escape. Arguably nothing in Marvel Rivals has produced more broken keyboards then a well-timed ultimate from Spider-Man.</p>



<hr>



<p>An honorable mention goes to Moon Knight, who’s the most picked duelist in quickplay, but falls down to 8th among duelists in competitive. A big dishonorable mention goes to Black Widow, who has the lowest pick rates of any hero: 4.19% in competitive and 2.76% in quick play.</p>

                <p>Act II of Destiny 2: Episode Heresy has dropped and brought with it some new toys to have fun with. A new rocket-assisted-frame sidearm has arrived in the form of Lotus Eater. This new Void element weapon is another excellent addition to the archetype--however you get your hands on one, a rocket sidearm is a great asset, and this is the first Void rocket sidearm to be released. Here's how players can find it and what the god roll perks for Lotus Eater are.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#How_to_get_Lotus_Eater">How to get Lotus Eater</a></li><li><a href="#Lotus_Eater_God_Rolls">Lotus Eater God Rolls</a><ul><li><a href="#Lotus_Eater_PvE_God_Roll">Lotus Eater PvE God Roll</a></li><li><a href="#Lotus_Eater_PvP_God_Roll">Lotus Eater PvP God Roll</a></li></ul></li></ul></div><h2 dir="ltr" id="How_to_get_Lotus_Eater">How to get Lotus Eater</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4458352-3922217119.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4458352" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4458352-3922217119.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4458352"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4458352-3922217119.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Lotus Eater is only available as a drop from Nightfalls or Grandmaster Nightfalls when the weapon is a part of the weekly rotation. At the end of a Nightfall run, it has a chance to drop. Each difficulty tier has a particular percentage to drop Lotus Eater, but the easiest way to guarantee a drop to happen is to complete a Grandmaster Nightfall with a Platinum score. Achieving a Platinum score on Grandmaster will guarantee a drop for the Adept variation of Lotus Eater while it is on rotation, which offers increased stats and curated rolls.</p><p dir="ltr">After Episode Heresy has concluded and the next expansion is available, Lotus Eater will also be available to unlock via spending Nightfall Ciphers at Zavala in the Tower.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Lotus_Eater_God_Rolls">Lotus Eater God Rolls</h2><h3 dir="ltr" id="Lotus_Eater_PvE_God_Roll">Lotus Eater PvE God Roll</h3><ul><li><strong>Barrel:</strong> Quick Launch  <ul><li>+10 Velocity / +10 Handling</li></ul></li><li><strong>Magazine:</strong> High Explosive Ordnance  <ul><li>+10 Blast Radius / +5 Velocity / -3 Magazine</li></ul></li><li><strong>First Perk:</strong> Repulsor Brace  <ul><li>Defeating a Void-debuffed target grants an overshield.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Second Perk:</strong> Destabilizing Rounds  <ul><li>Defeating a target creates a Void burst; hitting other targets with this burst makes them volatile and grants you Volatile Rounds for a short duration.</li></ul></li></ul><p dir="ltr">Ideally this perk combination maximizes blast radius of rounds and makes passing out the Volatile debuff happen incredibly fast. Combined with the fact that Volatile works off of chain explosions, this can spread to clear large swathes of enemies in seconds. When used with a Void subclass, that will work in concert with Aspects such as Devour and collecting Void Breaches, making this weapon incredibly good for taking out groups. The Repulsor Brace perk also makes the user much stronger in a prolonged fight as the overshield is constantly refilling, thus allowing more damage to be taken.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Lotus_Eater_PvP_God_Roll">Lotus Eater PvP God Roll</h3><ul><li><strong>Barrel:</strong> Linear Compensator  <ul><li>+5 Stability / +5 Blast Radius / +5 Velocity</li></ul></li><li><strong>Magazine:</strong> High Velocity Rounds  <ul><li>+10 Velocity / +10 Reload Speed</li></ul></li><li><strong>First Perk:</strong> Beacon Rounds  <ul><li>Final blows with this weapon grant your projectiles tracking and increase reload speed.

Combined with added tracking from Beacon Rounds and the ability to weaken from Withering Gaze, this weapon will synergize well with Void builds that use melee or short range Void abilities. Weaken will make the target more susceptible to damage and prevent healing from going off quickly, so it leaves targets extremely vulnerable while debuffed.</p>

                <p>The long-rumored remake of Bethesda's 2006 RPG The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion could be announced soon and potentially release before June. That's according to NateTheHate, who has a solid track record of reporting on unannounced games and platforms.</p><p>Asked to say when more information about the rumored Oblivion remake might arrive, <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/1899604247978840406?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">NateTheHate said</a> (<a href="https://www.thegamer.com/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake-launch-before-june-rumor/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via The Gamer</a>) that fans can expect details either this month or in April. As for when the game could be released, NateTheHate said it could be "likely sooner than the original June target." However, NateTheHate said the situation is fluid and there is no concrete information to go on at this stage.</p><p>Some thought Microsoft and Bethesda would reveal an Oblivion remake during the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-developer-direct-january-2025-how-to-watch-and-what-to-expect/1100-6528951/" data-ref-id="1100-6528951">Xbox Developer Direct in January, but that did not happen.</a></p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4458411-oblivion.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4458411" data-ratio="0.60619872379216" data-width="1097" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4458411-oblivion.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4458411"></a><figcaption>Is an Oblivion remake/remaster in the works?</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4458411-oblivion.jpg"></figure><p>The rumor dates back to documents from the Microsoft vs. FTC case in 2023 concerning the Xbox company's proposed buyout of Activision Blizzard. An "Oblivion Remaster" was listed as an upcoming unannounced Bethesda game for release in financial year 2022. Obviously, that did not happen, and Bethesda has yet to announce a remake or remaster of Oblivion. </p><p>There is no word on potential platforms for the rumored Oblivion remake. While Bethesda is releasing some of its games on rival platforms, like this May's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/doom-the-dark-ages-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6526483/" data-ref-id="1100-6526483">Doom: The Dark Ages</a>, Bethesda's biggest game in recent times, Starfield, is still exclusive to Xbox and PC. </p><p>In addition to launching on PC, Oblivion was an Xbox exclusive on console when it debuted in 2006, before coming to PS3 in 2007. The open-world RPG is fondly remembered for its story and gameplay--and infamously for its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/oblivion-horse-armor-now-available/1100-6147013/" data-ref-id="1100-6147013">horse armor</a>, which was a prominent early example of DLC. Bethesda boss Todd Howard later reflected on the horse armor, saying <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/todd-howard-on-elder-scrolls-horse-armor-people-wi/1100-6467386/" data-ref-id="1100-6467386">"people will buy anything."</a></p><p>While an official remake of Oblivion has yet to be announced,<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/skyblivion-the-fan-remake-of-oblivion-in-skyrims-engine-will-launch-in-2025/1100-6529672/" data-ref-id="1100-6529672"> there is a fan-made Oblivion remake, Skyblivion, coming in 2025.</a></p><p>Bethesda followed up Oblivion with the enormously popular The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim in 2011. Bethesda is now working on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6492383/" data-ref-id="1100-6492383">The Elder Scrolls VI</a>, but there is no word yet on when it might be released.</p>

                <p>If you have pleasant memories of blasting the Covenant round after round with your buddies in Halo's Firefight, we've got good news for you. A recent update to Halo Infinite has introduced old-school Firefight back into the game, a mode that was first introduced in Halo 3: ODST.</p><p dir="ltr">Titled "Firefight Classic," it's a round-based mode where you and three squadmates team up to take out endless waves of enemies. This version of the classic mode features rounds of five waves each, with three rounds adding up to a "set." Your team shares a pool of seven lives, and when they're all used up, you're done for.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A_SBMoeezc" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8A_SBMoeezc" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Halo Infinite's Firefight Classic gives you the previously unavailable option to end a session at the conclusion of a set. If two of your teammates go into a zone that's labelled "complete the mission," your team will be extracted. If you choose to continue, each set introduces a new Skull on rounds two and three, which adds a new flavor to the proceedings.</p><p dir="ltr">This mode also comes with a suite of Forge maps to try out Firefight Classic, including remakes of Halo 3: ODST's Alpha Site and Security Zone, as well as Halo: Reach's Courtyard. The update that introduced Firefight Classic, Operation: Blue Team, also includes a number of other additions, including the new map Nemesis, the PvP mode Hot Swap, and a fresh battle pass.</p>

If you're <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-fox">Star Fox</a> fan then the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMejSEspaog">latest Humble Games Showcase</a> might just be for you, with its tease of a brand-new airborne on-rails shooter from Star Fox veteran Giles Goddard. But there's more where that came from, including weather-controlling corgis and the re-emergence of long-gestating heist sequel Monaco 2. Intrigued? Then read on for the full rundown.

And here we are: the new game from Giles Goddard - programmer on the likes Star Fox, Stunt Race FX, and 1080° Snowboarding - and Japanse studio Chuhai Labs. Wild Blue might not be Star Fox <em>exactly</em> - it's set closer to earth than the depths of space - but the inspiration is clear. It sees a plucky band of animal pilots - Bowie Stray and the Blue Bombers - soaring through the skies on a mission to save the world from the evil Baron. It promises on-rails adventuring and daring dogfights over oceans, deserts, and more, with talk of boss battles, branching paths, and even a mysterious rival squad.

We're hardly wanting for farm-based village life sims these days, but Towns of Zoz from Studio Pixanoh looks to have a few tricks up its sleeve. For starters, it's got a cookery focus as players take on the role of Ito, returning to his parents' farm to run the family restaurant. There's a magical calamity afoot, and players will need to combine their combat skills and cooking creativity to save the town and its locals. Throw in local co-op and an attractive art style, and this one shows promise. Towns of Zoz doesn't have a release date yet, but it's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1748110/Town_of_Zoz/">confirmed for PC</a>.

You'd be entirely forgiven if Monaco 2's existence had slipped your mind. This sequel to developer Pocketwatch Games' acclaimed 2013 heist caper <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monaco-whats-yours-is-mine">Monaco: What's Yours Is Mine</a> was first announced almost exactly three years ago - although the studio has been regularly providing updates on its progress since then. The big change this time is the shift to 3D, with Monaco 2's procedurally generated isometric levels enabling a greater focus on verticality as players formulate then execute their stealthy plans. It's coming to Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5, and PC in April and a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3366190/Monaco_2_Demo/">demo's available on Steam</a>.

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/surgeon-simulator">Surgeon Simulator</a> developer Bossa Studios' Lost Skies is an open-world PvE survival adventure in which up to 6 players can explore a world of airborne islands using their grapple hooks and fully customisable airships - and if that sounds familiar, yes, it owes a lot to the studio's earlier multiplayer sandbox game, Worlds Adrift, which shut down in 2019. Since Lost Skies' announcement back in 2023, Bossa has shared regular updates and even a few demos - and it's now emerged again with a new trailer ahead of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1931180/Lost_Skies/">its PC release</a> later this year.

I think we can all agree there aren't nearly enough colourful 3D platformers these days, and I think we can all agree <em>even more fervently</em> there aren't nearly enough musical ones. But here comes developer Giddy Goat Games' Billie Bust Up, in which a headstrong goat (that'll be Billie), his fox pal Oscar, and their axolotl mentor Aristotle all team up to traverse a fantasy kingdom of feline smugglers, sentient puppets, and grinning ghosts. It promises all the prerequisite jumping you'd expect from the genre, but it's also a rhythm platformer, meaning timing is key as players bop along to music by Emmy nominated composer Daniel Ingram. There's no release date for Billie Bust Up yet, but it's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1400830/Billie_Bust_Up/">confirmed for PC</a>.

Another one first unveiled back in 2023, developer Stormy Nights' Breeze in the Clouds is a cheery 2D brawler starring a weather-controlling corgi named Breeze. As players venture across the weather-inspired biomes of Tropolis in search of a way home, they find themselves embroiled in a nefarious pollution plot that'll see them taking on animal enemies and bosses using fisticuffs and elemental powers. Stormy Nights is also promising an eclectic soundtrack featuring the likes of jazz, new jack, swing, and samba - which could be a treat if the trailer's any indication. Breeze in the Clouds is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1823210/Breeze_in_the_Clouds/">due to launch on PC</a> later this year.

And finally for the upcomers, it's Riyo Games' Threads of Time - a 2.5D RPG inspired by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>'s classic <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/chrono-trigger">Chrono Trigger</a>. Its turn-based, time-travelling yarn begins with battles against dinosaurs before whisking players back and forth to encounter everything from a  fantastical past of airships and magical creatures to a dystopian cyberpunk city and an apocalyptic future. It's coming to Xbox and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2090210/Threads_of_Time/">Steam</a> at some later point, and there's a new trailer above.

<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows will be supported on Steam Deck when the game launches.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Through a new <a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/1899863156995903687" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> post (formerly Twitter), the official Assassin’s Creed account confirmed that Shadows will be playable through the Steam Deck on the day the game releases. Currently, the developers are “awaiting the level of classification from Valve,” and more information about the Steam Deck release, such as performance details, is expected to be revealed soon.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Players are pretty excited about Assassin’s Creed Shadows releasing on the Steam Deck; many have described it as a massive win for the company.

Some have also pointed to a <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/assassins-creed/news/4XbPPtFyQEtIMWrA9xVDmZ/assassins-creed-shadows-tech-qa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Q&amp;A</a> from last month, where the game’s Technology Director stated Shadows is not compatible with the Steam Deck as it is below their minimum specs for PC.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, the creative producer of Assassin’s Creed Shadows stated that the DLC will have a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-dlc-features-a-spookier-vibe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">different and ‘spookier’ vibe</a>. Also, check out the latest<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/watch-20-minutes-of-new-assassins-creed-shadows-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> 20 minutes of gameplay</a> for the title.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/the-best-plain-potato-chip-the-wirecutter-wrong<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As a general rule, I respect what The Wirecutter does. Aside from being owned by The New York Times, a genocidal and transphobic rag whose editorial board frequently undermines good reporting, they serve a clear purpose. I would probably not be where I am today without The Wirecutter’s work and I have friends and colleagues who work there. But recommending the Amazon Fresh Classic Potato Chips as the<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-potato-chips/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> best plain potato chip</a> fundamentally misunderstands the spiritual and practical place of the potato chip.</p><p>The top-line reason why Amazon does not make the “Best Plain Potato Chip” is because they are sold exclusively by Amazon. I am not so precious as to suggest that you can’t enjoy chips from a big consumer brand like Costco, Aldi, or the Frito-Lay corporation. I am not even suggesting that the chip tastes bad – its qualities as a chip are irrelevant.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The best chip is not something you buy with next day or same day shipping. The best time to buy plain potato chips is whenever you want or need potato chips. You panic buy them in bulk because you have a BBQ or a party you forgot about. You impulse buy a bag at the liquor store, supermarket, or deli because you want a tasty snack. If you can’t buy a bag of chips immediately at retail, then your chip lacks a core, load-bearing feature that all plain chips must have. Though many of my choices and interests are defined by optimization, I find it offensive to view potato chips the way one would a USB charger, router, or laundry detergent.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>If your chip features a small reminder to order more chips via Alexa, it is too depressing to be considered the best plain chip. Credit: Amazon</figcaption></figure><p>While I respect the sheer rigor with which The Wirecutter tested these chips, the topic of plain chips goes beyond the remit of what The Wirecutter does. The purpose of The Wirecutter is ultimately to suggest the inoffensive “mostly good enough” pick for a subset of upper middle class Times readers financed in part by Amazon affiliate links. As a result, there is a perspective at work through the entire review that feels slightly alien to me. I would be fine with Consumer Reports or America’s Test Kitchen doing this kind of testing, but mainly because I think they have better taste and sense than to recommend “the Amazon chip.”</p><p>But I should say that I half-agree with some of their other picks. Some of them are correct in that they are from Pennsylvania, the unimpeachable snack belt of America. Others are acceptable because they are made by Lay’s and chips are Lay’s’ entire deal. On the whole I feel like The Wirecutter included too many categories, and I find some of their reasons for invalidating the competition to be a little precious and a tiny bit dull. Here is my response to each.</p><ul><li><span><strong>Best kettle</strong>: Deep River Sea Salt Kettle – I am gonna be honest, Deep River are fine but kinda mid. Just sort of an inoffensive chip in a category that should be a little gnarly by design. Also, Zapp’s is better and more interesting than Deep River, that’s just a fact.</span></li><li><span><strong>Best wavy chip: </strong>Lay’s Wavy Original<strong> – </strong>Sure, why not. I’m not gonna start a fight about wavy chips.</span></li><li><span><strong>Best extra-toasty classic potato chip: </strong>Great Value (Walmart) Crunchy Potato Chip – Incorrect, garbage chip.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span><strong>Best thin and crispy classic chip</strong>: Clancy’s (Aldi) – Sure. Aldi’s quality is generally good, although The Wirecutter did not test Lidl’s offerings, and as a rule I find Lidl to be better and more consistent than American Aldi Süd if we are ranking invasive German discount supermarket chains (the other one being Trader Joe’s, a subsidiary of Aldi Nord).</span></li><li><span><strong>Best less salty classic chip</strong>: Utz – Unimpeachable, probably the best choice on this list.</span></li><li><span><strong>Best lighter kettle chip: </strong>Lay’s Kettle Cooked Original – Fine, although going to Lay’s for a kettle chip feels wrong to me for difficult to articulate reasons. I trust Lay’s with inoffensive big store potato chips, freakish chips that Mike Fahey used to review like that one Reuben flavor, and boutique Chinese potato chip flavors that I can only find at Asian grocery stores and illegal weed stores for a 1,000% markup next to lychee-flavored Oreos.</span></li><li><span><strong>Best wavy chips with good looks and baked-potato flavor: </strong>Great Value Ripple Original and Wavy Original – I have been consistently disappointed by Walmart’s offerings here, but again I also don’t really go for wavy or ripple chips unless someone brings them to a BBQ. At least you can go to the store to buy these.</span></li><li><span><strong>Best kettle chip with french fry flavors (?): </strong>Herr’s Original Kettle Cooked – <strong>&nbsp;</strong>That’s a weird category, but Herr’s are good so sure.</span></li><li><span><strong>Best lard-fried potato chips worth considering: </strong>Dieffenbach’s Old Fashioned Original Kettle Chips and Grandma Utz Kettle-Style Potato Chips – Along with classic Utz and Herr’s these are both good chips. The Grandma Utz are better than the Deep River, and Dieffenbach’s’ radiate that old timey Pennsylvania quality that I associate with a good snack the same way the Boyer candy company, creators of the Malo and Smoothie cup, do.&nbsp;</span></li></ul><p>I could quibble about individual choices all day, but more than anything else, I do not want to cede the plain potato chip to Jeff Bezos. Amazon has attempted and often succeeded in making themselves the default choice for entire product categories. They have <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/home/smart-home/amazon-is-losing-billions-of-dollars-on-alexa-and-echo-heres-3-ways-it-can-turn-things-around" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">burned billions of dollars</a> shoving awful little narc orbs in our homes that suck to use even within their category. They have shaped entire communities for the worse around their distribution facilities. They have made a lot of TV, some of which is pretty solid but most of it looks like incoherent, cheaply-made garbage. But everyone has their own capricious lines in the sand, and mine is an Amazon exclusive potato chip.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/severance-theories-lumon-goats-clones-instagram-threads"><h3>Threads Won’t Stop Showing Me Dogshit Severance Theories</h3></a><p>"I think I know what Lumon does.

Some of your tea requests are fairly straightforward, but others are a bit harder to complete. Here, we'll guide you through all the recipes needed to complete your customer requests and advance the story.</p><p dir="ltr">Here we list all the customers and their tea requests in the order you'll encounter them, breaking the game into chapters. There are five chapters total.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Note: </strong>While it's not required to complete the game in any way, I highly recommend having Alta drink a cup of each recipe brewed. You get a unique bit of story or commentary with each recipe she drinks.</p><div data-embed-type="toc" data-hide="true"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">show</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#Chapter_1_tea_requests">Chapter 1 tea requests</a><ul><li><a href="#Gerald__the_knight_">Gerald (the knight)</a></li><li><a href="#Demon_Hunter">Demon Hunter</a></li><li><a href="#Gerald__the_knight_">Gerald (the knight)</a></li><li><a href="#Demon_Hunter_">Demon Hunter:</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#Chapter_2_tea_requests">Chapter 2 tea requests</a><ul><li><a href="#Boro">Boro</a></li><li><a href="#Nana">Nana</a></li><li><a href="#Ren">Ren</a></li><li><a href="#Crafty_customer">Crafty customer</a></li><li><a href="#Ren">Ren</a></li><li><a href="#Boro">Boro</a></li><li><a href="#Bat_customer">Bat customer</a></li><li><a href="#Bat_customer">Bat customer</a></li><li><a href="#Ren">Ren</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#Chapter_3_tea_requests">Chapter 3 tea requests</a></li><li><a href="#Chapter_4_tea_requests">Chapter 4 tea requests</a><ul><li><a href="#Bird">Bird</a></li><li><a href="#Jerry">Jerry</a></li><li><a href="#Terry">Terry</a></li><li><a href="#Larry">Larry</a></li><li><a href="#Zenith">Zenith</a></li><li><a href="#Boro">Boro</a></li><li><a href="#Harry">Harry</a></li><li><a href="#Zenith">Zenith</a></li><li><a href="#Garry">Garry</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#Chapter_5_tea_requests">Chapter 5 tea requests</a><ul><li><a href="#Nana">Nana</a></li><li><a href="#Monster">Monster</a></li><li><a href="#Boro">Boro</a></li><li><a href="#Nana">Nana</a></li><li><a href="#Monster">Monster</a></li><li><a href="#Fairy">Fairy</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#Monster">Monster</a></li></ul></div><h2 dir="ltr" id="Chapter_1_tea_requests">Chapter 1 tea requests</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4458334-altaandboro.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4458334" data-ratio="0.56261682242991" data-width="2140" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4458334-altaandboro.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4458334"></a><figcaption>Alta and Boro</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4458334-altaandboro.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="Gerald__the_knight_">Gerald (the knight)</h3><p dir="ltr"><strong>Tea request -</strong> Something to wake him up</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Recipe:</strong> Brew tea using a Tea Ball and an Azzy Fruit.

This is a pretty easy task. Just grab an empty pot from the shop and then transfer plants into the hanging pots.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Nana">Nana</h3><p dir="ltr"><strong>Request - </strong>Bring any item to trade for something of Nana's.</p><p dir="ltr">This isn't a tea request, but you'll need to trade an item with Nana. This can be anything from a cup, a seed, or a trinket you found. You can return to her two more times to trade and receive items.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Ren">Ren</h3><p dir="ltr"><strong>Tea request -</strong> A fruit flavor that brings to mind "passion"</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Recipe: </strong>This feels misleading, because all of the fruit ingredients list various effects in your field guide, but nothing mentions being related to passion in any way. This request seems to refer to your own passion, and you can brew a tea with any fruit to appease Ren.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Crafty_customer">Crafty customer</h3><p dir="ltr"><strong>Tea request -</strong> Something that helps with chest pain</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Recipe:</strong> Brew tea using a Tea Ball combined with a Snok Cone and a Pellmelon.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Ren">Ren</h3><p dir="ltr"><strong>Tea request - </strong>Silver Moonlight Tea</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Recipe:</strong> Brew tea using a Tea Ball combined with a Messberry, Chip Chip, Pellmelon, and any type of mushroom.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Boro">Boro</h3><p dir="ltr"><strong>Request - </strong>Take five photos and hang them up around the shop.</p><p dir="ltr">This is another easy task.

You find various books as trinkets while tending the tea shop. Sometimes, they are gifts in the mailbox, found while sweeping leaf piles, or given to you by guests.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Bat_customer">Bat customer</h3><p dir="ltr"><strong>Tea request -</strong> Miracle Pomme</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Recipe:</strong> Brew tea using a Tea Ball combined with Miracle Pomme fruit. At Boro's suggestion, you can add two additional fruits for color. This isn't a requirement, but it may give you different dialogue results.</p><p dir="ltr">To get Miracle Pomme fruit, you'll first need to breed the Weyling Tree with three Hue Shrooms. Watering this new plant will give you a color-swapped Weyling Tree that produces the Miracle Pomme fruit.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Ren">Ren</h3><p dir="ltr"><strong>Tea request </strong>- Any</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Recipe:</strong> Any</p><p dir="ltr">If this objective isn't available to you, and all other quests are complete, try brewing yourself a cup of tea and drinking it.

Jerry insists on Coffee</p><p dir="ltr">Recipe: Pick a coffee bean from a plant, run the bean through the dishwasher, and then brew coffee. This is just boiling water and coffee.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>The coffee requests can't be completed until you first finish Zenith's initial tea request</strong>. So, don't stress if you took the orders for the coffee guys first, but you'll need to speak with Zenith to progress.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Terry">Terry</h3><p dir="ltr"><strong>Request - </strong>Coffee with a fruit containing as little flavor as possible</p><p dir="ltr">Recipe: Pick a coffee bean from a plant, run the bean through the dishwasher, and then brew coffee with a Biteberry.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Larry">Larry</h3><p dir="ltr"><strong>Request - </strong>Cold coffee.</p><p dir="ltr">Recipe: This is just coffee and water without boiling it.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Zenith">Zenith</h3><p dir="ltr"><strong>Tea request - </strong>Tea made with something of value</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Recipe: </strong>Brew tea with any other ingredient.

Just place cups of tea near five different Pluffins.</p><p dir="ltr">This can be any tea recipe, but I'd <strong>recommend something like the Painted Gourd</strong> fruit to change the birds to an orange color. The mint tea made it hard to tell which birds I'd already given the tea to.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Harry">Harry</h3><p dir="ltr"><strong>Request - </strong>Mintiatto coffee. Tastes like mint and ice cream.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Recipe:</strong> Pick a coffee bean from a plant, run the bean through the dishwasher, and then brew coffee with a Chip Chip and Painted Gourd.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Zenith">Zenith</h3><p dir="ltr"><strong>Tea request -</strong> A tea made from a fruit, the plant the fruit came from, and a seed used to grow the plant.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Recipe: </strong>This can be any one fruit of your choosing. However, you also need the plant and the seed associated with that specific fruit. In order to include the plant itself into the mix, you'll first need to take the plant and surround it with three of the blue Shrink Shrooms. Grab a pot and place the shrunken plant into the pot. Then, brew the tea with the fruit, the potted plant, and the seed.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Garry">Garry</h3><p dir="ltr"><strong>Request -</strong> Coffee</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Recipe:</strong> Pick a coffee bean from a plant, run the bean through the dishwasher, and then brew coffee. This is just regular coffee with boiling water.</p><p dir="ltr">Eventually, you'll complete some narrative and return to the shrine for the final chapter.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Chapter_5_tea_requests">Chapter 5 tea requests</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4458339-altasittingonthebench.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4458339" data-ratio="0.56263736263736" data-width="1820" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4458339-altasittingonthebench.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4458339"></a><figcaption>Alta sitting on the bench</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4458339-altasittingonthebench.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">This is your last chapter in the Wanderstop shop.

Pour all of the coffee into the cup. Then, leave this cup sitting.</p><p dir="ltr">For the second brew, you don't want to boil the water. Instead, get the color of the bar to yellow.

I even added a dirty coffee bean.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Boro">Boro</h3><p dir="ltr"><strong>Request - </strong>Boro wants you to add plants to all the large pots inside the shop. This is easy. You can re-pot some of the plants from outside, use your extra seeds, or even the coffee beans.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Nana">Nana</h3><p dir="ltr"><strong>Request - </strong>Nana wants stronger and even more complicated coffee with hints of cinnamon.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Recipe:</strong> Again, this is a two-part process for Nana.</p><p dir="ltr">First brew, brew three clean coffee beans with hot water. Pour all of it into a cup. Leave the cup sitting there.</p><p dir="ltr">Second brew, you need to use warm water (only get the temperature to yellow) and add Weyling Fruit, a Pellmelon for the cinnamon, and a clean coffee bean. Pour this second brew on top of the original cup of coffee you made.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Monster">Monster</h3><p dir="ltr"><strong>Tea request - </strong>Tea that tastes like breakfast cereal, sugar, and dirt.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Recipe:</strong> Brew a Tea Ball with a Snok Cone (for cereal flavor), a Whistleberry (for sugar) and a dirty coffee bean.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Fairy">Fairy</h3><p dir="ltr"><strong>Tea request -</strong> Aeon Brew</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Recipe:</strong> The fairy is now making Nana's orders look easy. <strong>The order of ingredients and time on this one are very specific</strong>. Have a timer ready.</p><p dir="ltr">This is a cold brew, so make sure you don't heat the water at all. You need to add a Dupe Shroom, a Waypur Sprout, a color-swapped Puffpod, a Blue Loop, a Tea Ball, and then<strong> let the ingredients sit one minute</strong> before adding a second Tea Ball as the final ingredient.</p><p dir="ltr">Remember, to color-swap the Puffpod you'll need to add three Hue Shrooms around the plant.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Monster">Monster</h2><p dir="ltr"><strong>Tea Request - </strong>Breakfast cereal and sugar</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Recipe:</strong> Brew a Tea Ball with a Snok Cone and Whistleberry.</p><p dir="ltr">All the trophies/achievements are tied to the story, so by working through all the chapter requests, you should now have all of Wanderstop's achievements/trophies.</p>

This 2024 colorful 2.5D  platformer is easily of one of the best “metroidvania” games released in years, and it’s definitely one of Ubisoft’s best games in recent memory. It plays wonderfully, looks amazing, runs like a dream, and has some memorable boss fights.  It’s also not massive. Most people can finish it in under 18 hours. Seriously, check this one out later this month on either PS4 or PS5. </p><p>Meanwhile, if you want to see where the<em> Armored Core</em> franchise started, the first three PS1-era games will be added to PS Plus Premium later this month. I have fond memories of fighting my brother in <em>Armored Core</em>’s demo, but never actually played the full game. Perhaps I’ll give them a shot later this March. </p><p>Remember, to access, download, and play these games you’ll need to be an active PS Plus Extra or Premium tier subscriber.

                <p>The MMO Defiance, which was shut down in 2021, is coming back to life. For anyone unaware, Defiance was a third-person shooter MMO from Trion Worlds that was developed as a tie-in for the Syfy show of the same name, with events and storylines running across the game and the TV show. It launched in 2013 as a paid game for PC, PS3, and Xbox 360, before adopting a free-to-play model and continued to receive updates even after the TV show was canceled in 2015. A new version of the game, Defiance 2050, came out in 2018--but both games shut down servers in 2021. Now, Defiance is attempting a comeback.</p><p>Fawkes, a game company whose mission is "breathing life to old worlds and preserving their legacy," has announced plans to bring Defiance back following a deal with previous rights-owner Gamigo.</p><p>"Even though the TV series was discontinued in 2015 and Gamigo eventually closed the game in 2021, the memories of epic Arkfalls and immersive, post‑apocalyptic battles live on in your hearts," Fawkes said.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1Jfk8Pt8B4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/p1Jfk8Pt8B4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Fawkes said it has acquired the license to the "worldwide development and publishing rights" for Defiance and Defiance 2050 on all platforms. The first step in the comeback is relaunching the original game on PC in April 2025.</p><p>"Our relaunch is designed to be a homecoming for those who once fought side by side during legendary Arkfalls. We want you to return to a familiar world that still holds countless memories, and to create new ones with friends both old and new," Fawkes said.</p><p>Should the re-launch go well in April 2025 on PC, Fawkes said it will "explore the possibility" of bringing Defiance back to consoles.</p><p>"We will start small, with a very clean state of the game, with the design and drop we understood you like, and grow from there together with you, bringing the changes that had an impact and leaving behind the ones that didn’t. We are ready to re-build Defiance together with you, Arkhunters," Fawkes said.</p><p>Fans can join the official <a href="https://discord.com/invite/fawkes" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fawkes Discord</a> channel to stay up to date on the newest developments.</p><p>"Thank you for keeping the flame of Defiance alive all these years. We can't wait to welcome you back into the world of epic battles and unforgettable moments. Get ready to Defy the odds once again!" Fawkes said.</p><p>Fawkes also helped revive the games Shaiya and Last Chaos, and also has the rights to Desert Operations and Wargame 1942.</p>
