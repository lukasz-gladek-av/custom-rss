			<p>As the long dark nights set it what could be more attractive than some warm Arizona Sunshine? Sure, you are going to fight past hordes of zombies to get a sun lounger by the pool, but that’s a small price to pay if you want to top up your tan.</p>
<p>The original Arizona Sunshine launched in December 2016 with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/06/27/arizona-sunshine-playstation-vr-review/">favourable reviews</a> and was followed by a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/12/06/arizona-sunshine-2-review/">sequel last year.&nbsp;</a> Vertigo games have now taken all the improvements from that sequel and applied them to a total remake of the original, bringing new graphics, new mechanics and even a few tweaks to the maps.</p>
<p><iframe title="Arizona Sunshine Remake Compared –&nbsp;An essential upgrade?" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gM9UPrBeUkI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The story remains the same. Our unnamed protagonist wakes up in their cave seemingly months or years into a zombie apocalypse, but has his spirits lifted when he hears a radio message. Could there be more survivors? A five hour campaign follows which can be played solo or with online co-op as our man works his way through caves, train stations, and factories in a bid to locate the source of the broadcast. </p>
<p>The gameplay loop is fairly predictable, a few zombies at the start of each level and then you reach a blocker of some kind which will require a specific item to let you continue. From then on it’s some exploring, more zombie culling before returning, unblocking the doohicky, and being swarmed by a huge number of zombies.</p>

<p>When I say I huge number I am not exaggerating, the difficulty spikes through the roof. One one encounter I used every single bullet I had but the zombies were still coming and I had to run an lap of the map to lead them away from the exit so I could make a dash for it. You do need to play tactically and take out the fast moving critters first, then the armoured zombies and leave the shamblers till last.</p>

<p>The new graphics allow for plenty of gore with limbs popping off and blood gushing from wounds, plus new lighting, explosions effects. The realistic gun reloading mechanic from the sequel is now in place which really adds the tension, fumbling around for a new magazine, inserting and then cocking the gun may just take a second but when you are being chased by zombies, every second counts.</p>
<p>Arizona Sunshine is fairly simple but a lot of fun, casually head-shotting a zombie in the distance is immensely satisfying and the co-op mode is a laugh, whether it’s waving a bendy sausage at your friend or watching their pained ‘I really need to go to the toilet’ walking animations. </p>
<p>The script is also good. While our man does that video game trope of talking to himself so the player knows what to do, it’s not over used and there’s incidental dialogue which really make you warm to the character. He feels like someone that’s spent a good long while alone and started talking to the Zombies. </p>

<p>Unfortunately the remake has also inherited some of the problems of the sequel, most notably that you can stick you head through certain objects and walls and the screen goes black. When you are being chased by rabid zombies you do not want to lose your vision just because you have backed into the arm of a cactus. The engine does seem to have been improved upon as the pop in that was really annoying in the sequel is not present, although the levels are much smaller. I’m also happy to report I didn’t encounter a single bug, a relief given that the sequel was a bit of a mess when it launched.</p><p>
[agallery ids=”453858,453857,453856″]
</p><p>On top the base game you also a get a Horde mode and both DLC packs in the price which makes up for the shorter campaign, and you can upgrade from the original for $10 which seems very reasonable consdering the huge improvements that have been made.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		It seems odd giving a remake of game a higher score than it's sequel but the Arizona Sunshine Remake takes all of the good elements from it's sequel and thankfully, very few of of the bad elements. Great fun in co-op mode, but playing alone makes it more tense, scary and certainly more of a challenging. 	</p></div>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/denuvo-discord-suspended-inappropriate-content</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-denuvo-discord-temporarily-suspended-after-deluge-of-hate-messages.1012203/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/denuvo-discord-suspended-inappropriate-content<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Denuvo moderators have had to temporarily suspend a recently-opened Discord server created to answer community questions, and I'm pretty sure you can guess the reason for that suspension.</p>
<p>A couple of days ago, Denuvo <a href="https://x.com/gamingatdenuvo/status/1846185023650582821" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announced</a> that it was opening a new Discord server to, ahem, serve as a "platform" for users to express their queries and "receive the answers [they] have deserved all along".</p>
<p>The server featured a mixture of preset FAQs collated from "dozens of users" and "hundreds of...messages" with the ability to ask your own questions directly, with a real member of the Denuvo team stepping up to answer those questions.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/denuvo-drm-discord-closed-inappropriate-content-screen.jpg?itok=egsh0JqV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/denuvo-drm-discord-closed-inappropriate-content-screen.jpg?itok=ehVnQP_7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Denuvo is not exactly popular online, as a recent Discord experiment appears to have proven.</figcaption></figure><p>In a move that will surprise precisely nobody who's familiar with Denuvo's reputation online, however, the DRM maker has now <a href="https://x.com/gamingatdenuvo/status/1846897589527912744" rel="noopener" target="_blank">paused the sending of messages</a> on said Discord server.</p>
<p>Upon its opening, it seems that the Discord server was flooded with "nearly 2,000 people", many of whom wanted to ask Denuvo questions. Some, however, just wanted to express their hatred of Denuvo, and others likely just wanted to post memes or jokes.</p>
<p>Disappointingly but predictably, Denuvo points to the "amount of inappropriate content" received on the server as one of the reasons for the pausing of messages; the DRM maker says its "small team" has found moderation of these messages <a href="https://x.com/gamingatdenuvo/status/1846897627905896676" rel="noopener" target="_blank">"quite challenging"</a>.</p>
<p>It's for this reason that <a href="https://x.com/gamingatdenuvo/status/1846897647635865995" rel="noopener" target="_blank">"changes" to the server are coming</a>. They'll be implemented across the next few days, although Denuvo doesn't say exactly what those changes are yet. I suppose we'll just have to wait and see.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-hunter-rise-denuvo.jpg?itok=y9xwbum_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-hunter-rise-denuvo.jpg?itok=GkLkcOeA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Many games have used Denuvo, including the likes of&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Rise</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Honestly, I'm a little surprised Denuvo itself doesn't seem to have seen this response coming.</p>
<p>It's fair to say Denuvo is probably one of the most hated entities in gaming; <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/reveal-of-dying-light-2-denuvo-drm-angers-fans">players hate it</a>, yes, but it's also been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tekken-director-says-denuvo-behind-recent-performance-issues-on-pc">blamed by developers</a> for causing technical issues, so I can't think Denuvo doesn't know its reputation.</p>
<p>Either way, right now, you can't ask Denuvo questions via the aforementioned Discord server, but you can still <a href="https://discord.com/invite/dQs2DKGAjq" rel="noopener" target="_blank">join it</a> if you want to see what prompted the suspension or prepare for the next round of questioning.</p>

                <p>EA has announced a significant change for Plants vs. Zombies 3, <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/plants-vs-zombies/plants-vs-zombies-3/news/soft-launch-announcement-15-oct" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">confirming</a> that the game is undergoing a "major overhaul" and will be taken offline as the developer reconfigures the game.</p><p>Plants vs. Zombies 3 had a soft-launch earlier this year, and EA said it feels grateful for the "enthusiasm and feedback" that players sent in during this early testing period. With that feedback in mind, EA said it has decided to "re-tool the game" with the aim of making an "even better" experience.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4386107-zombies.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4386107" data-ratio="0.58587257617729" data-width="722" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4386107-zombies.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4386107"></a><figcaption>Plants vs. Zombies 3</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4386107-zombies.jpg"></figure><p>EA turned off in-app purchases for Plants vs. Zombies 3 on October 15, and the game is no longer available to download. November 15, 2024 will be the final day to play Plants vs. Zombies 3 in its current iteration. After this, servers will go down and the game won't be playable to anyone, anywhere.</p><p>Players who earned or bought coins with real money will have those balances saved for when the game comes back. However, all game progress, boosts, and narrative elements are being reset.</p><p>Plants vs. Zombies 3 had its soft-launch earlier this year in the UK, Netherlands, Australia, and the Philippines. The original aim was to have the game's full release later in 2024, but those plans have now changed.</p><p>Unlike the more recent Garden Warfare series of shooters, Plants vs. Zombies 3 goes back to the series' roots and is another tower-defense game. Players must protect Neighborville from encroaching zombies, setting up the usual sorts of garden-based traps and defenses with returning favorite plants alongside new ones.</p><p>Plants vs. Zombies 3, from developer PopCap, was first announced in 2019, so it's been a long time coming, and now the wait is even longer for the final product.</p><p dir="ltr">Plants vs. Zombies first released in 2009, and the brand became a hit for PopCap. Plants vs. Zombies 2 released on mobile devices in 2013, centering around a time-travel plot. It received a <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/plants-vs-zombies-2-its-about-time/">mostly positive</a> critical reception, but the Garden Warfare spin-off the following year quickly became the new face of PvZ for the last several years. The studio also released a card battler, Plants vs Zombies Heroes, in 2016.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/asmongold-apology-palestine-hasan-piker-twitch-youtube<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Asmongold, one of the most popular streamers on Twitch for over half a decade, began his week with <a href="https://kotaku.com/asmongold-twitch-ban-youtube-gaza-israel-hasan-piker-1851672928" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a racist rant</a> against Palestinians and then evidently spent at least part of it doing some soul searching. On Wednesday, he announced that he plans to step away from leadership duties at OTK, a streamer organization he co-founded, as well as Starforge, a PC company he co-owns. He also intends on streaming less. His goal: self improvement.</p><p>"I've been an asshole,” he said in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSI-N-QHNTQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a YouTube video posted yesterday</a>. “I think that I've devolved for the last two years. I think that I've negatively affected other people too, in ways that I hate– I don't even hate to say this. I think I need to say this. I need to say it more: I've negatively affected people in ways that I regret."</p><p>He also discussed his experience of the past few days, since his rant went viral.</p><p>"I'm getting all these people making negative comments toward me,” Asmongold said. “Everyone is telling me 'Oh, go kill yourself, I hate you' – everything like this. You know who reached out to me? And they wanted to talk and have a conversation and see if I was OK? People that were Islamic and people that had family in fucking Palestine. How humiliating is that? How absolutely humiliating is that? And these are the people I was trying to say were bad. I feel like such a fucking stupid asshole."&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="My Plans Moving Forward" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RSI-N-QHNTQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>On a longer timescale, he hopes to visit the Middle East and “see it for myself.”</p><p>“The truth is, and this is the worst thing about what I said, some of the places I would want to visit, I might not be able to because of the internal strife,” he said. “The actual, literal wars that are going on – people being literally killed there – and I might not be able to [go there]. But I want to do it for myself, because I don't like believing what people tell me. I think that when I do, I end up being a fool. And I want to see it. I want to see it for myself and experience it.”</p><p>It is a whiplash-inducing about face for Asmongold, whose comments earlier this week got him suspended from Twitch and also prompted statements from <a href="https://x.com/OTKnetwork/status/1846690831261945954" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OTK</a>, <a href="https://x.com/StarforgePCs/status/1846625010456105071" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Starforge</a>, and affiliated indie publisher <a href="https://x.com/MadMushroomGG/status/1846691386361274622" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mad Mushroom</a>, as well as <a href="https://x.com/TipsOut/status/1846302400988303489" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a lengthy missive from OTK CEO Tips Out</a>, who is of Syrian descent. (OTK, which also includes other big names like Mizkif, Esfand, and Emiru, began in 2020 with a core crew of edgier streamers but has spent the intervening period chasing brand-friendly legitimacy via the aforementioned additional companies, as well as regular events like an annual award show.

I don’t give a fuck. They’re terrible people. It’s not even a question. It’s crazy people don’t see it that way. They’d be doing the same thing.”</p><p>He also insisted that Palestinian culture was <a href="https://x.com/HasanabiProd/status/1845889127629176966" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“inferior”</a> when compared to Western cultures. Negative reaction from the Twitch community was swift.&nbsp;</p><p>"Hey Asmongold, what about my 'culture' makes it okay to genocide my friends/family?" CapriSunnPapi, a Palestinian and Lebanese streamer, <a href="https://x.com/CapriSunnPapi/status/1845897719203737655" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said on Twitter</a>, echoing a sentiment shared by many others.</p><figure><blockquote><p>You know who reached out to me? And they wanted to talk and have a conversation and see if I was OK? People that were Islamic and people that had family in fucking Palestine. How humiliating is that?</p></blockquote></figure><p>Also on Monday, Asmongold proceeded to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukVFg1OlA0M" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spend hours</a> navigating the labyrinth of contradictions that is his worldview with leftist politics streamer Hasan “HasanAbi” Piker, who to his credit largely used the conversation as a teachable moment. In the face of Piker’s history lesson about Israel’s decades-long oppression of Palestine and how something like that can take people’s focus away from social progress, Asmongold repeatedly argued that Palestinian culture is nonetheless inferior because Hamas is incredibly regressive when it comes to issues like queer rights – never mind that Hamas is not Palestine and that Palestine’s people are not a monolith.&nbsp;</p><p>This is the same Asmongold who has spent the better part of a year <a href="https://aftermath.site/sweet-baby-detected-conspiracy-theory-steam" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">crusading against perceived “DEI” initiatives in games</a>, something that has involved whipping <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@AsmonTV/search?query=dei" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">millions of viewers</a> into a frenzy over so-called “woke” games, which often include queer characters or explore queer themes. During his conversation with Piker, Asmongold seemed to care more about people’s freedom to practice or express LGBTQ+ ideas than said people – something which, in fairness, he acknowledged has been eroded in the United States, potentially turning America’s culture “inferior” as well. Despite clear evidence that cultures change over time for good and for ill, however, Asmongold expressed skepticism that such a thing could happen in Palestine, even if its people were not under the threat of constant violence and oppression. He also spoke in the sorts of absolutes characteristic of somebody who spends too much time online and not enough time touching grass.</p><p>"I agree with you that [Palestinians cheering when those oppressing them are harmed] is understandable,” Asmongold said to Piker. “But I think that understandable bad behavior in a lot of cases is still, in fact, bad behavior. It's impossible to know what somebody else would do in a circumstance they're not part of, but what I do know is, when I see a group of people that are celebrating a bunch of innocent people getting killed, then I think that group of people is doing something that's wrong. And I think that it's universally wrong."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>"You'd be the one teenager in Gaza being like 'Hold on, guys. Let's not celebrate the Iranian retaliation against this country that has, like, literally eviscerated my family,’" replied Piker.</p><p>“I would be cheering it on,” said Asmongold. “I’d be like ‘Yes! Fuck yes!’ But I wouldn’t be sitting on a soapbox, saying that I’m the good guy.”</p><p>“They’re not the good guys in this situation,” said Piker. “They’re the victims, and that’s the point.”</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="DEBATING ASMONGOLD ON PALESTINE" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ukVFg1OlA0M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Perhaps seeing more of the world will help Asmongold recognize the complexity of these situations – and of the real human beings who’ve experienced them, rather than the hypothetical concepts of human beings. Disavowing some of his own preconceived notions, as he did in today’s video, is a solid first step. Demonstrations of contrition like this are rare on today’s internet – especially from big-time content creators with millions of followers who’ve espoused reactionary viewpoints – which means they’re more important than ever. There’s also evidence that they can move the needle for viewers. Stories of far-right radicalization via content creators are common, but de-radicalization happens too. Piker even used it as an example of people – and, as a result, cultures – changing during his conversation with Asmongold.&nbsp;</p><p>"There's a shit ton of people that are in my community that used to be right wing on one issue or many other issues that have, over time, understood and demonstrated empathy and have changed their minds on these issues – and no longer consider themselves to be conservative,” Piker said.&nbsp;</p><p>If Asmongold is curtailing some of his own worst behaviors, that could prove good for the many viewers who look up to him, too. In addition to pernicious reactionary stances, Asmongold has over the years become synonymous with a brand of messy degeneracy that even he, himself, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWqIhkiJk9A" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has acknowledged</a>. In his new video, he acknowledged that he’s over-prioritized his online life at the expense of all else.</p><p>"Streaming is my entire life,” he said. “Doing this is my entire existence, and I think that the process of that has been extremely unhealthy for me. It's allowed me to become such a one-dimensional person that I'm not even a person anymore. It's like in <em>Dark Souls</em>; I'm going Hollow or something. … I’m going to try to clean up part of my house, and I’m not going to hire a cleaner."</p><p>"I think I need to do this for myself,” he continued. “I need to take accountability for things that I've done and for letting my life get this out of control. ... I want to live for the idiots out there who are looking to me to be a role model. Not a good idea! But there are people that will see that and they'll think maybe to themselves 'Maybe I should do the same thing.' And if I can do that for one person, well, I've already done it for myself. I've already done a good thing, and so it can only get better."</p><p>Many viewers are excited to see Asmongold clean up his act, in some cases literally.</p><p>“Cleaning room stream would be the most viewed of all time,” reads one YouTube comment with over 7,000 upvotes.</p><figure><blockquote><p>If you think that means my first stream back is going to be playing <em>Dustborn </em>and promoting Sweet Baby, I think you'll be very disappointed.</p></blockquote></figure><p>But for these measures to be effective, they must be considered and consistent. Asmongold’s ability to stick with them remains in question. It doesn’t help that the audience Asmongold has built up by publishing anti-”woke” ragebait has, predictably, reacted to his apology with horror and shock.</p><p>“Never apologize to the mob,” reads one comment on his video with over 11,000 upvotes.</p><p>In the video, Asmongold urged viewers to hold him accountable – to drag him back onto the path to decency if he once again goes astray.&nbsp;</p><p>"I hope that this is the next part of the rest of my life, and I want you guys to hold me accountable to that,” Asmongold said. “So if I'm being a fucking asshole again – if I'm being mean, if I'm just being callous, acting like a psychopath, just treating people awfully, outside of a <em>WoW </em>raid when they get killed by fire, but really laughing at people's misfortune – try to say 'Man, just chill the fuck out. Stop it. Just stop.' And I'm gonna do my best to listen."</p><p>But the problem with Asmongold’s audience is that it is, well, Asmongold’s audience. Listening to them is, to some degree, how Asmongold got here in the first place. He acknowledged that issue earlier in the same video.</p><p>"When you get lost in the sauce and you get fixated around listening [to] and reading feedback – just getting hyper-fixated; this is, like, your entire life – you lose a perspective on reality," he said. "And you lose a perspective on the world."</p><p>Streamers are often emboldened by their own self-created echo chambers, and Asmongold has built a machine that’s at odds with his new goals. After reactions to the video flooded in on Wednesday, Asmongold published a post to his subreddit titled “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Asmongold/comments/1g574c2/why_apologize/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Why Apologize?</a>” In it, he further outlined why he felt he’d reached a breaking point, but also made sure to add that “if you think that means my first stream back is going to be playing <em>Dustborn </em>and promoting Sweet Baby, I think you'll be very disappointed.”&nbsp;</p><p>“Take a break,” one fan <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Asmongold/comments/1g574c2/comment/ls8xa82/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote in response</a>. “Us Chuds will be here waiting for you to make streaming great again.”</p><p>“Don't worry, I'll react to a DEI=DIE gaming video first day back to stream,” Asmongold replied.</p><p>“Thank God,” replied another fan. “I hope this side of you never change[s].”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Ever been in a position where two people are really going at each other, hurling pointed jabs and insults back and forth, and you're stuck in the middle? Well then, perhaps you'll empathise with the enemies in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/archons">Archons</a>, a twin-stick <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-survivors">Vampire Survivors</a>-like where you control two characters at once, and attacks bounce between them automatically as they move about the arena. I gave the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/event-brands/steam-next-fest">Steam Next Fest</a> demo a quick whirl today, and after a couple of swift attempts (I died horribly fast), I realised this could become a bit of a danger to my free time, so I've put it away for now.</p>

<p>Archons doesn't try to hide its influences. The developer very clearly asked themselves one day: what if you took Vampire Survivors, and substituted the main character for two High Templar from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/starcraft">StarCraft</a>? Also, each character is independently controlled by one gamepad stick, like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/brothers-a-tale-of-two-sons">Brothers: A Tale Of Two Sons</a>.</p>

<p>It sounds like a gimmick, and it is. But it also feels nicely put together. The attacks are punchy and precise, the chaos is pretty, and I could always tell what was happening on-screen despite the oodles of juicy bugs flinging themselves at me the whole time. Best of all though, every single attack is synced up to the music. Goddamn, I love it when things are synced up to the music.</p><p>It certainly requires a lot more active thought than the far simpler Vampire Survivors. My first attempts to split my attention between both my archons at once were laughably blunderous. It feels like a muscle I'd have to work out often before it becomes second nature. That also means Archons will likely never recapture the same popularity as the granddaddy of this fledgling sub-genre. It's simply far easier to reach those dopamine highs in Vampire Survivors.</p>
<p>That's fine with me though, because I'm pretty much done with Vampire Survivors, and I'm glad games are cropping up which offer their own spin. I imagine for a lot of people, the added finnickiness of Archons flies in the face of why people play these fairly mindless Survivor-likes. But it hits just right for me. I like that you have to be a lot more thoughtful and focused in Archons if you want to survive more than a minute or two.</p>
<p>If you want to give Archons a go, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3192850/Archons_Demo/">check out its demo on Steam</a>. I just played it one more time, and survived for 10 minutes, finally dying to the boss of the first area. If you survive longer than that (or beat the boss), you're officially better at video games than me.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Nepos Games are the two-person studio behind <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nebuchadnezzar">Nebuchadnezzar</a>, which Nate Crowley <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nebuchadnezzar-is-two-thirds-of-the-perfect-historical-city-builder">called</a> "two thirds of an outstanding historical city builder". They've just informed me they're making a new building sim called <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/county-of-fortune">County Of Fortune</a>, out in Q4 2025. It ain't a city <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-building-games-on-pc">builder</a>, though. In fact, it claims to have murdered the city builder in cold blood, which is unfortunate, because I was really looking forward to a round of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/manor-lords">Manor Lords</a> later. 
</p>
<p>
"The city-builder is dead, long live the county-builder," declares the press release, brandishing the husk of SimCity over its head. OK, I'll bite - what's a county-builder then? Well, it's sort of several city-builders having an argument. In County Of Fortune, you seed and grow a number of settlements side by side, then manage their economic and social relations. In other words, it's a game that appears to simulate the phenomenon of culture clash. I'm not sure all this amounts to the wholesale death of a genre, but it's certainly intriguing. Here's the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3204330/County_of_Fortune/">Steam page</a>, and here's a trailer.

"In County of Fortune, you're not just managing a single city, but an entire county," the press release continues. "The game focuses on the bigger picture: managing multiple settlements and their development, overseeing logistics, and making sure resources flow effectively across your region without worrying about individual buildings.
</p><p>
"Furthermore, as your county expands, unique cultural traits will emerge, based on the characteristics you cultivate in each settlement," it continues. "These traits influence how your communities develop, making each region or even village in the county unique. And it also brings interesting interactions between settlements and even between their leaders."
</p>
<p>
My thoroughly piqued interest is heightened by the discovery that the game is set in (procedurally generated) England, made up of towns like Winchelsea and Chipping Campden that sound like they've been AI hallucinated based on episodes of I'm Alan Partridge, but then you fire up the Googlebox and my word, there <em>is</em> such a place as Chipping Campden. No, there really is! It's in Gloucestershire. 
</p>
<p>
If you're from Chipping Campden, don't get chippy - I've got nothing but good things to say about Gloucestershire, home of the Witcombe Music Festival. It's not like you're from Cheshire. The only things I know about Cheshire are that it consists of cheese and cats and is on the other side of stinking, sewage-drinking Manchester. And don't get me started about Cumberland. They share a border with my own county of birth, North Yorkshire, and we have never forgiven them for allying with the Picts in, er, I think it was 300 AD.
</p>
<p>
As all this hopefully indicates, I can see how a game based around understanding and manipulating the relationships between villages and counties could be entertaining, perhaps even radical. The builder/management genre is vast, mind you, and it's likely something similar has been attempted before.</p><p>I am hungry for specifics. What kinds of social organisation or leadership style will the game support? How extreme will the disparities be - could we end up in a situation reminiscent of Ursula Le Guin's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dispossessed">The Dispossessed</a>, with villages of anarchists and capitalists treating each other like alien planets? Is warfare a feature? 
</p>
<p>
The press release will not say. It merely concludes that "we believe County of Fortune will resonate with players looking for something new in the genre - a deep, adaptive experience that challenges them to plan across the entire map, rather than focusing on individual cities." Fine, keep your secrets. But please, enough killing of genres. That's the kind of thing they get up to in Cheshire, when they're not making cats out of cheese.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://remapradio.com/articles/megalopolis-review/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p><em>Megalopolis </em>has a lot of mind and more on its shoulders. It is the presumptive capstone to Francis Ford Coppola’s 60-year career in film, the showpiece for which he has traded his long-running wine business, an 85-year-old’s sincere message of hope for the future of this world, and–unexpectedly, tragically–a dedication to Coppola’s late wife and collaborator of 61 years, Eleanor. It’s hard not to be moved by that dedication as the credits roll. But there’s also a brief pang: of all the films Coppola could have dedicated to her memory, <em>Megalopolis </em>is the one offered in tribute, a deeply silly paean to traditional virtues and structures, comforting itself that in the face of seemingly terminal decline and advancing evil, love will save us. “Dover Beach” but self-financed to the tune of 120 million dollars and featuring a scene where Aubrey Plaza plays a character named Wow Platinum who gets eaten out by Shia LeBeouf.</p><p>There is perhaps nothing quite so ominous about the opening minutes of <em>Megalopolis </em>than its clear debt to <em>The Fountainhead, </em>and specifically King Vidor’s misguided 1949 adaptation starring a thoroughly out-of-his-element Gary Cooper as Rand’s great hero, Howard Roark. Coppola’s equivalent is Adam Driver’s Cesar Catilina, shown here bestriding the skyline like an Olympian god before heroically dynamiting public housing.</p><p>Catilina, a polymath architect and engineer, has discovered a marvelous new material, megalon, that will enable him to build an urban utopia–a megalopolis, if you will–thanks to megalon’s power to resist and even reverse entropy, outlive the doomed decadence of his New Rome. (New Rome standing in here for New York, apparently in an alternate timeline where Tinto Brass’s <em>Caligula </em>remade American culture so thoroughly that forty years later the hottest thing going is still two girls with Roman maiden perms making out on top of a limo.) Megalon enables new architectural forms, like towering buildings that grow from the land like sequoias and coral, and incredible experiments in urban mobility like… moving walkways and escalators. But it is also the stuff of the gods, a sticking plaster for the body and spirit that can restore a shattered body and mind to perfect health.</p><figure></figure><p>Who would fight against re-founding society on the basis of megalon? Catilina’s adversary, Cicero (Giancarlo Esposito), the mayor of New Rome, who is rooted in the material present in contrast with Catilina’s focus on the immortal future. He is a well-meaning but overmatched functionary: late in the film, his daughter Julia (Nathalie Emmanuel) sees him not as a powerful ruler but a man mired in quicksand filling his office, blissfully doing paperwork at a desk that is canted downward like the deck of a sinking ship.</p><p>Julia becomes the chief point of contention between the two men, as she falls in love with Catilina right after he tells her what a vapid piece of crap she is. Here we must give credit to <em>The Last Jedi:</em> it recognized that Adam Driver or no, this is not the play. But here, Julia is a high-spirited woman-child who lets herself be guided by Catilina and in return functions as his muse. Grimly, the thing that breaks through their impasse is when she spies a child’s playset in Catilina’s office and he encourages her to play with it herself, awakening her to the beauty of his vision while revealing that she is sufficiently elevated to understand the future he seeks to build.</p><p>But Julia discovers that far from being a man of the future, Catilina’s eyes are locked on the past. In this he faintly echoes Coppola’s version of George S. Patton, another lonely visionary alternately inspired and haunted by what he sees through the veil of history: a world of Roman and Carthaginian triumphs and the glorious, pitiful dead baking in the Mediterranean sun. As the forces of reaction line up against Catilina and his brilliant creations, I was reminded most strongly of <em>Tucker: A Man and His Dream</em>, a movie I’d forgotten Coppola directed, where a lone auto designer finds himself the enemy of his industry because he dares to build the kind of better, safer car that Detroit loathes. </p><figure></figure><p>That film, more modest in its goals, was a more persuasive portrait of a capable dreamer with all the forces of malicious complacency and greed aligned against him–in part because his dream was easy to understand. Catilina’s vision of megalon and megalopolises is juvenile in its principles and its specifics: he is going to build a great, 15-minute city with moving walkways and buildings that look like Krypton by way of Hudson Yards’ Vessel. But the city doesn’t really matter, Catilina hastens to assure Julia and the audience at one point. What matters is the conversation <em>about </em>the city. At the climax of the film, Catilina wins the people over with a direct address from atop a coral-like prominence in his model megalopolis, intoning that what we need is a great debate about the future, in which all take part. It’s a prayer for democratization and civility from a character who seized control of the public square and public space and remade it in his image, but who thinks in opening the comments section he is saving civilization.</p><p>Driver and Esposito are good enough performers to make horrendous material almost workmanlike if they fully commit, and indeed, they prove a pair of sirens who lured Coppola away from the salvation of a rewrite. A good moment, suggestive of a better picture, arrives when Julia attempts to bring Catilina and Cicero together over a family meal. Catilina decides to engage the old man in a debate. His opening salvo sounds neat enough, and Cicero smiles appreciatively at the gesture before informing Catilina that he’s misidentified who he is quoting. “Mis-quoting, actually,” Cicero adds with a condescending little smile, before offering a rebuttal from Marcus Aurelius. For a moment the characters have the gravitas the film so often struggles to attain. If you have the option of putting Driver, Esposito, Emmanuel and Kathryn Hunter (playing Cicero’s wife) around a table to hash out their litany of issues, couldn’t that be 80% of the picture? Shouldn’t it be? You wonder how much better it might have been if the film had given free rein to its Shakespearean impulses rather than settling for quotation and pastiche.&nbsp;</p><p>But the intellectual pretense of <em>Megalopolis </em>is just that. The characters have so little to actually say. They just keep quoting Aurelius, the Roman philosopher-king who became so fashionable in recent decades, especially among the super-rich of Silicon Valley. Immediately you can see why Coppola fared so much better with <em>The Godfather</em>. Puzo’s novel had Machiavelli and Caesar and Augustine lurking in the background of every scene, but he knew it’s better if instead of quoting them a character just pulls out a gun and whacks somebody. Adapting him, Coppola threw out most of the speeches in the book and trusted filmmaking and acting to get the thrust across. With <em>Megalopolis</em>, it’s the opposite. When the character's have an idea, it feels like to get it across they have to sneak glances at copies of <em>Bartlett’s</em> between shots.</p><figure></figure><p>Coppola’s love for the material is evident. <em>Megalopolis </em>is bursting at the seams trying to fit in all the bits of moviemaking he adores. The element of Coppola’s filmmaking that I think is most satisfying here is that frequently and unashamedly works with the kinds of shots and sets that defined the silver screen filmmaking that the death of the studio system and the arrival of Coppola’s generation helped consign to history. If so much of <em>Megalopolis </em>is going to be filmed on soundstages with digital mattes, the scenes might as well evoke old movie sets: Catalina’s office is dressed and redressed to be a lavish Art Deco study, a cozy floating nest, and a bustling dream factory. An evening drive through the city takes on an otherworldly cast using reverse projection, the characters seeming to drive through a movie playing outside their windows.&nbsp;</p>

It was pulled so damn hard that Sony wiped it from their web pages and literally deleted it from the scant few customers’ accounts, as if trying to salt the earth from which it had once grown. It’s like nothing we’ve ever seen before.</p><p>So why, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://steamdb.info/app/2443720/charts/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://steamdb.info/app/2443720/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">according to <em>SteamDB</em></a></span>, is <em>Concord</em> still regularly being updated, most recently on October 10?</p><p>The game is no longer available on Steam, and with the servers shut down, it’s not possible for anyone who <em>did</em> buy a copy to play any more. Not that this really interrupted many people’s schedules, given the multiplayer shooter somehow never managed more than a miniscule 697 playing at the same time. For context, at the time of writing, <em>Dune Awakening</em>, a game that <em>isn’t out until next year</em>, saw a peak of 696 people playing in the last 24 hours, while 2013's barely-known racing sim <em>rFactor 2 </em>saw 698. <em>Concord</em> was a AAA first-party Sony game released alongside an international advertising campaign. It’s <em>bemusing</em>.</p><h2 id="h274099"><a id=""></a>Someone, somewhere, is still playing <em>Concord</em></h2><p>Yet, someone, somewhere is still tweaking at its code. In fact, some people are still playing it. Admittedly only two of them in the last 24 hours, but five people were playing at once on October 5. They, logic dictates, can only be people from within Firewalk Studios, the in-house Sony development team who made the game.</p><p>Does this confirm <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/03/an-important-update-on-concord/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/03/an-important-update-on-concord/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sony’s vague allusion toward one day reviving the game</a></span>? It’s not impossible, obviously, and you can bet your teeth there are people at Sony in very expensive suits asking other people in very expensive suits how they can possible claw back some of the better part of half a billion dollars. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/sonys-failed-shooter-concord-has-been-updated-dozens-of-times-on-steam-in-october-and-im-starting-to-feel-a-comeback/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/sonys-failed-shooter-concord-has-been-updated-dozens-of-times-on-steam-in-october-and-im-starting-to-feel-a-comeback/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>PC Gamer</em></a></span> certainly seems to be more optimistic about this possibility.</p><p>My take is slightly different. I think there’s an office inside Firewalk’s Bellevue, Washington headquarters that’s been abandoned since the closure of the game. There’s still paperwork on various desks, a few small plushies hanging from the side of a monitor yet to be reclaimed, and a collection of old coffee mugs now growing mould. The lights haven’t been switched on for weeks, and there’s one ceiling tile hanging loose that no one’s pushed back into place. But if you were to walk past the glass doors of that room at 2 a.m., you would see the faint, blue light of a single monitor, casting its gloom on a hunched individual, a hoodie pulled up over their head, tapping away at the keyboard between furtive glances toward the door.</p><p>That’s Dave. Dave cannot let <em>Concord </em>go, no matter what is bosses have told him. Dave is going to save his game, you’ll see.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>GSC Game World, developers of Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl, have confirmed that the game will run at 30 fps on the Xbox Series S at launch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/stalker-2-interview-xbox-game-pass-xbox-series-x-s-dlc-expansions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Windows Central</a>, the developers revealed that Stalker 2 will ‘stick to 30 fps’ for the Xbox Series S. On the Series X, the game runs at 60 fps, dropping to 55 at times. In some situations, the developers hit the 60 fps mark for the Series S, but the consistency did not match the likes of the Series X. However, GSC is “looking to get a performance mode for Xbox Series S, to get it to 60 FPS”, and they think “it’s possible”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The developers initially thought it would be “impossible” to release Stalker 2 for the Xbox Series S due to the game’s mechanics and “huge amount of things.” However, after they started optimizing, using Unreal Engine’s features for steaming information, and squeezing up “every megabyte from every piece of system content,” things began to change.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The developers added that, after optimizing Stalker 2 for the Xbox Series S, they believe any game can reach the platform’s “memory limits.” At the same time, they understand that not every developer has the time and resources to optimize. But GSC’s optimization efforts have also helped the PC build for the game, “making it a lot more performant.” Due to that, Stalker 2 has “quite low minimum PC requirements for a modern game.”</p>

                <p>During a Gamescom Asia panel, former PlayStation boss Shawn Layden spoke about the current state of the gaming industry and how the disappearance of AA studios had contributed to a "collapse of creativity" in modern games. Layden explained how the rise in development costs had led to studios placing a stronger emphasis on post-launch monetization plans and following trends to remain risk-adverse.</p><p>"You didn't worry so much about the end piece, for better or for worse. Of course back then you didn't make a game for millions [of] dollars. So your risk tolerance was fairly high, Layden said (<a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/shawn-layden-aa-is-gone-and-thats-a-threat-to-the-ecosystem-going-forward" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via GamesIndustry.Biz</a>). "Today, the entry costs for making a AAA game is in triple-digit millions now. I think, naturally, risk tolerance drops. And you're [looking] at sequels, you're looking at copycats, because the finance guys who draw the line say, 'Well, if Fortnite made this much money in this amount of time, my Fortnite knockoff can make this in that amount of time.' We're seeing a collapse of creativity in games today [with] studio consolidation and the high cost of production."</p>

<p>Layden added that while the quality of indie games had risen, the AA space that had been dominated by companies like Interplay, Gremlin, Ocean, and THQ has seemingly vanished. With the options being either indie games or AAA blockbusters, Layden believes that this is a dangerous situation for the gaming industry to be in right now.</p><p>"Now if we can just get a bit more interest and excitement and exposure for these lower-budget, but super-creative and super-unusual [types] of games. I'd like to see more of that.

I have my theories, but they have far more to do with the saturation of the open-world genre and some bad pre-release word of mouth than the bigoted brigading. And as much fun as I'm having, I can't help but notice there's a certain "X factor" missing from parts of the game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">What is that "X factor?" Well, if I knew exactly what it was and how to execute it, Disney would probably have hired me already to team up with Dave Filoni. But it's something that's been scratching at me as the series has advanced, a question I keep asking: why do people love Star Wars, and what about it drives such intense reactions?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I quizzed </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Outlaws</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> creative director Julian Gerighty about this at Gamescom. "This is our shared mythology," he said. "It's 100 percent George Lucas's obsession with the monomyth...it is so refreshing, so familiar, but with the alien twist."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In other words, Star Wars itself is some kind of universal experience, and its alien elements burn it into our memories.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a data-discover="true" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/audio/star-wars-outlaws-lead-actor-humberly-gonz-lez-made-her-character-a-dreamer-" target="_self">Star Wars Outlaws lead actor Humberly González made her character a 'dreamer'</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's a </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbc.ca/radio/ideas/how-mythologist-joseph-campbell-made-luke-skywalker-a-hero-1.5262649">familiar</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> analysis. Unfortunately, it's also lacking. Lucas and The Hero with A Thousand Faces author Joseph Campbell have done a great job branding Star Wars as this film that supposedly taps into universal myths about humanity but I've only grown skeptical of that idea as I've gotten older.

Let's look closely at the idea of "familiar, but with a twist" idea that Gerighty described. It's a common bit of advice for creative direction in all forms, especially game development. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Outlaws</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is, if nothing else, a fantastic case study of this philosophy. The game is a massive success in so many ways, but its reliance on this conceit often loops back around to being "familiar, but familiar."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Let's dig into how a Weequay sheriff and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://gizmodo.com/star-wars-outlaws-nd-5-hot-droid-reaction-2000481524">an unexpectedly hot droid</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> show the possibilities and limits of this philosophy.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="A Weequay sheriff ain't as surprising as it used to be">A Weequay sheriff ain't as surprising as it used to be</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I must admit I take a perverse joy in deploying Star Wars proper nouns on unsuspecting readers. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Don't anger me or I'll start bombarding you with the names of various </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Yuuzhan_Vong">Yuuzhan Vong</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> characters.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Outlaws</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the clearest example of an attempt at "familiar, but with a twist" comes in the form of Sheriff Quint. She's the sheriff of a small town called Wayfar. She's old, grizzled, and has a secret past with the Hutt Cartel harassing the town. She's also a Weequay, a species first seen in Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi, one of many </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RubberForeheadAliens">rubber-forehead aliens</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> populating the posse of the slug gangster Jabba the Hutt.</span></p><div data-component="blockquote"><blockquote><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>A brief diversion here: The Weequay are unfortunately one of many alien species first introduced on Tatooine that draws on tropes and stereotypes from pulp cinema. Tatooine is a simultaneous cinematic ode to Wild West films, pulpy adventures set in the Middle East, and the dreary Kansas farm of The Wizard of Oz. In Return of the Jedi, the Weequay are among a sea of dark-skinned alien goons inspired by the tropes of pulp cinema that first intimidate, then are killed off by, the predominantly white cast.</span></span></p></blockquote></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The Weequay have been expanded since then in various spinoffs and licensed stories, the most beloved being the fabulous backstabbing space pirate </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Hondo_Ohnaka">Hondo Ohnaka</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. If the year were 1986, she'd be a revelation. But in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Outlaws</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, she is not.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Her flaws begin with her visual design and run right through how she interacts with the player. Ubisoft's artists seemed to have been given limited technical boundaries in their character design choices, so she and many other "experts" the players aren't that visually distinct from regular NPCs. At a distance you can clearly she fits the cowboy archetype, but her appearance only stands out at a close distance—and even then, she's not that distinctive from other generic Weequay that fill out the game.</span></p><p>Image by Bryant Francis, via Ubisoft.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">She's a familiar sheriff archetype, but she's a spiky-faced alien. "Familiar but with a twist" in theory, but "familiar but familiar" in practice if you consider how audiences are probably used to spikey-faced aliens like her across many mediums. It doesn't help that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Outlaws</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is stuffed to the gills with Star Wars aliens made more "human" by their fluent grasp of English.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Her story arc, unfortunately, also feels "familiar but familiar." As mentioned, Wayfar is being harassed by gangsters demanding its impoverished residents pay them money. She and the player character Kay Vess fend off a pair of raids by the bandits, the kind we've seen time and time again in films like High Noon. My heart dropped as the first of these setpieces stepped through the familiar tropes. The town is empty. The sheriff ventures onto the main street. The gangsters ride in. Everyone's hands drift to their guns. Then she quickdraws, blasts them dead, and gameplay begins as more rush in. "Familiar, but familiar" strikes again.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The sequence plays out similarly later on, when Quint teaches the player how to improve their own quickdraw ability, Adrenaline Rush (which works like the quickdraw ability from Rockstar Games' Red Dead Redemption series).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ubisoft Massive unfortunately undercut its own "high noon" scenes by giving the player a </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>far better</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> experience with Adrenaline Rush, which </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>is</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> a great example of "familiar, but with a twist." Ubisoft did a fantastic job bringing in rapid camera swings and making it the core combat while racing on a speeder bike. It's dynamic, punchy, and far more interesting to do than watch it play out in a cutscene.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The rest of the player's time with Quint, unfortunately, is stuck in the same gunslinging tropes. Her relationship to the Hutt Cartel is also dulled by the fact that the player can become very good friends with the Hutt Cartel, meaning they're no worse than the sheriff, who's remorseful about her time as a hired killer.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">All the familiar tropes of the Wild West sheriff are meant to be juiced up with that Star Wars alien vibe—but just making her a Weequay isn't enough to stop her from blending into the gorgeous backgrounds of the Great Chott Salt Flat.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="ND-5 is a droid like no other">ND-5 is a droid like no other</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">All right you've eaten your vegetables and now it's time for dessert. And that dessert is ND-5, a BX-series droid commando (first seen in the Star Wars: Clone Wars animated series) assigned to Kay by gangster Jaylen Vrax. The second he walked onscreen, my spouse exclaimed—and this is a word-for-word quote—"Why does he have a slutty waist?!"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Yes, as you may have heard, ND-5 has joined the ranks of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://gizmodo.com/star-wars-outlaw-ubisoft-hot-droid-video-game-1850545405">attractive robots in the video game canon.</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> He's a character that shows where Ubisoft Massive does succeed with "familiar, but with a twist." What makes ND-5 work is that he bridges the familiarity gap across Star Wars and other stories—he's not just a familiar archetype shaped by Star Wars, he's a Star Wars archetype shaped by other influences.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">ND-5 is a "familiar" character in adventure stories, in that he's the brooding, gravelly-voiced muscle assigned to the heroine whose cold exterior hides a comforting core. Some stories might cast him as a romantic interest, but this one only allows the player to lust after him from the other side of the screen.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The "twist" is that he's a droid. But then he's "familiar" again, because he's a droid the audience has likely seen before. Even if you don't know about the BX-series commandos (they were introduced in Star Wars: The Clone Wars, seen in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, but never depicted in any films or live-action shows), he's close enough in design to the comic relief B1 battle droids introduced in Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace to strike that sense of recognition. There's something potent about taking a character design designed to evoke comedy and gently nudging it towards brooding gruffness.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If you </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>are</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> familiar with BX commandos, "familiar but with a twist" strikes again. BX droids are often depicted as hunched forward with slim profiles. ND-5 stands tall and wears a trench coat that gives him artificially broad shoulders. The coat standing open also casts a contrasting silhouette for his body, which draws the eye to the uh, "slutty waist."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">And let's not beat around the bush, his always-open coat and scars across his chest look vaguely inspired by a romance novel cover. A familiar look made fresh on this droid's body.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The trend continues with his role in the story. Because he's a machine bound by a restraining bolt, his relationship with Kay takes a different relationship than if it were human. He repeatedly rejects Kay's offers to help him reclaim his independence, at one point telling her emphatically, "I am not broken."</span></p><p>Image by Bryant Francis via Ubisoft.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Except when he says it, you can't help but feel he might mean the opposite. Actor Jay Rincon really put some grit into that line. It's only made all the more heartbreaking by an encounter with a dying (deactivating?) BX droid commando in a sidequest that unveils more of ND-5's backstory. While the gravel-voiced droid explains the history of the Clone Wars and his time fighting in it, the dying droid repeatedly begs for help finishing its mission, repeating the words "I am broken" over and over again.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">These droids, who the player might have known to be villains, are given a shred of sympathy by portraying them through the eyes of a character who wouldn't have her own preconceptions of them.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">ND-5's twists are familiar, and what's familiar is also a twist. The philosophy works here because traits from one category also fit inside the other. His mishmash of references gives players the freedom to forget what they expected from the character and plenty of room to take him as he is.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Don't just rely on &quot;familiar but different&quot;">Don't just rely on "familiar but different"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I documented a number of other positive and negative "familiar but with a twist" examples across </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Outlaws </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">(shoutout to the developers behind the quest "The Heavy," you know what you did), but Quint and ND-5 make for great compare-and-contrasts. It's also worth playing </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Outlaws</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Jedi: Survivor</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in close proximity, just to see how Respawn Entertainment's swing at the series produces feels far more fresh in the same setting.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Familiar but with a twist" is a common "pillar" you'll find in many game design documents. It's a quick way to explain your game to financiers and investors, and it can help developers think outside the box when conceiving game mechanics, character design, art environments, etc.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If you're not careful, the phrase can put you back inside the box you hoped to escape.</span></p><p>Image by Bryant Francis via Ubisoft.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">What would be better would be to search for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>specifics</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in how you blend familiar concepts. I cracked open the art book for Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith, and found references to paintings by Lawrence alma-Tadema's paintings, illustrations from LIFE Magazine by Chesley Bonstell, and the '60s TV show Swiss Family Robinson. You can trace a line from the referenced art to images in the film itself, and all those specifics tell us more about the power of Star Wars than the fabled monomyth.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">All apologies to Gerighty but "familiar, with a twist" is not the "X factor" I've been trying to name. I am thus cursed again to cast out in search of the words that will capture why I keep coming back to the world's most corporate-friendly franchise that sometimes </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.starwars.com/series/andor">reaches right into my soul</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and other times </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.starwars.com/series/star-wars-ahsoka">makes me want to tear my hair out</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Unity has today launched its new engine globally, Unity 6, which its CEO wants "at the heart of game development for years to come".</p>
<p>The company promises its new suite of tools will allow for quicker and more efficient game development, with a focus on "end-to-end multiplayer workflows", tools for targeting mobile web, and "new graphics capabilities" to boost CPU performance.</p>
<p>The announcement follows a tough time for Unity as it aims to turn around its reputation with developers after last year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unity-reveals-plans-to-charge-per-game-install-drawing-criticism-from-development-community">controversial Runtime Fee debacle</a>.</p>

<p>That fee was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indie-developers-react-to-astonishing-scumbag-move-of-unitys-new-install-charge">heavily criticised by game developers</a> and then, last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unity-cancels-controversial-fees-to-use-its-game-engine-tools-a-year-after-introduction">cancelled entirely</a>.</p>
<p>With that cancellation, CEO Matt Bromberg described the company's aim of "democratising game development" by allowing games to be built by anyone. "I’ve been able to connect with many of you over the last three months, and I’ve heard time and time again that you want a strong Unity, and understand that price increases are a necessary part of what enables us to invest in moving gaming forward. But those increases needn’t come in a novel and controversial new form," he said.</p>
<p>Unity 6 has been "built, tested and refined in partnership with developers from all over the world", with the company committed to long-term support.</p>
<p>"We are relentlessly focused on delivering tools to help game developers build games more quickly and efficiently while also facilitating innovation," said Bromberg. "We're going to do everything we can to ensure that Unity 6 is at the heart of game development for years to come."</p><p>Unity has also released resources to show off the new toolset's capabilities. That includes the conceptual cinematic demo Time Ghost, you can watch for yourself above, as well as two playable demos: mobile game <a href="https://unity.com/demos/fantasy-kingdom">Fantasy Kingdom</a> and cross-platform multiplayer game <a href="https://unity.com/demos/megacity-competitive-action-sample">Megacity Metro</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unity-starts-2024-by-laying-off-1800-employees-as-part-of-ongoing-reset">Unity also began the year with a round of layoffs</a>, eliminating around 25 percent of its workforce as part of a "company reset".</p>
<p>Interestingly, there's no mention of AI in Unity's initial announcement, despite the fact it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unity-6-engine-will-launch-next-year-with-expansion-of-responsibly-sourced-ai-tools">previously stated Unity 6 would arrive with "responsibly sourced" AI tools</a>. </p>
<p>In a report earlier this year, Unity claimed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ai-already-used-by-62-of-studios-unity-report-claims">62 percent of studios are using AI</a> at some point during game development, with animation as the primary use case.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/temtem-swarm-early-access-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Crema has announced the&nbsp;<em>Temtem: Swarm&nbsp;</em>Early Access release date, with the&nbsp;<em>Temtem&nbsp;</em>spinoff set to release next month.</p>
<p>Per a Steam post, the game will arrive via Steam Early Access on November 13th, and it'll cost you just $9.99, although it'll be cheaper in Poland and Brazil due to the way regional Steam pricing works.</p>
<p>Perhaps somewhat unusually for an Early Access release, Crema also says it doesn't intend to raise&nbsp;<em>Temtem: Swarm</em>'s price at any stage, although it does "reserve the right to adjust the price at a later date" following particularly significant updates or extra content.</p>

<p>The studio acknowledges that "Early Access games have a bad rep sometimes" (although <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/no-rest-for-wicked-ceo-early-access-comments">not from certain sectors of the industry</a>), but goes on to say that Early Access is a good model for the bullet heaven genre "because of all the fine-tuning and tweaking".</p>
<p>Crema says that in order to "refine gameplay, balance the world, and ensure&nbsp;<em>Temtem: Swarm&nbsp;</em>is the most exciting and engaging it can be", Early Access is a necessary step.</p>
<p>As Crema itself points out, it's already enjoyed a successful Early Access launch with the release of creature-collecting RPG&nbsp;<em>Temtem&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-like-temtem-release-date-set-for-january-2020">back in January 2020</a>, which the developer says "demonstrated our commitment to community-driven development".</p>

<p>According to Crema,&nbsp;<em>Temtem: Swarm&nbsp;</em>will be in Early Access for "around a year", during which it will be refined and tweaked in order to incorporate player feedback and add all of the content the devs have planned for it.</p>
<p>When the Early Access launch rolls around,&nbsp;<em>Temtem: Swarm&nbsp;</em>will offer a solo mode and co-op support for two or three players, as well as a number of playable Temtem creatures, maps, and bosses to fight.</p>
<p>More will be added over the course of&nbsp;<em>Temtem: Swarm</em>'s development, and you can read more about what exactly Crema has planned for&nbsp;<em>Temtem: Swarm&nbsp;</em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2510960/view/4512135723845292087" rel="noopener" target="_blank">via the original Steam post</a>.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/yoko-taro-fan-archive-cease-and-desist-square-enix</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/yoko-taro-fan-archive-reportedly-hit-with-cease-and-desist-by-square-enix.1012086/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/yoko-taro-fan-archive-cease-and-desist-square-enix<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Yoko Taro fan archive Accord's Library, a site dedicated to "gathering and archiving all of Yoko Taro's work", has apparently been hit by a cease and desist issued by Square Enix.</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/yoko-taro-fan-archive-shutting-down-following-square-enix-cease-and-desist/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">VGC report</a>&nbsp;(which cites a message sent on the archive's Discord server), the owners of Accord's Library were contacted by Square Enix's legal department recently.</p>
<p>That contact resulted in what the archive's owners call "some private communication", and based on "the outlined requirements" of that communication, the site is shutting down permanently on October 31st.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/accords-library-square-enix-yoko-taro.jpg?itok=JzdmA-Qs 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/accords-library-square-enix-yoko-taro.jpg?itok=iiOfk69Z 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Accord's Library is an exhaustive Yoko Taro resource, but it's shutting down soon.</figcaption></figure><p>Per the VGC report, Accord's Library's moderators are "sad [they] have to go", but they say they "also must respect the wishes of the [Square Enix] legal team".</p>
<p>If you're not familiar with Yoko Taro, he's the creator of the&nbsp;<em>Nier&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Drakengard&nbsp;</em>franchises, serving as game director on the likes of&nbsp;<em>Nier&nbsp;</em>(and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nier-replicant-release-date-and-editions-announced">its remaster</a>) and PlatinumGames' followup&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/nier-automata"><em>Nier: Automata</em></a>, as well as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nier-reincarnation-shutting-down">now-defunct</a> mobile spinoff&nbsp;<em>Nier Reincarnation</em>.</p>
<p>As a creative force, he's well-known for his unconventional approach to game design; the&nbsp;<em>Nier&nbsp;</em>franchise is itself technically a distant sequel to&nbsp;<em>Drakengard</em>, taking place after one of the first&nbsp;<em>Drakengard</em>&nbsp;games' myriad endings.</p>
<p>Taro is also known for his eccentric public persona; he routinely wears a comically oversized mask of&nbsp;<em>Nier&nbsp;</em>pseudo-mascot Emil&nbsp;for interviews and presentations, and he's previously expressed a dislike of being photographed as well.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nier-automata-yoko-taro-ruined-city.jpg?itok=740A_5L- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nier-automata-yoko-taro-ruined-city.jpg?itok=6wIlD26U 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Yoko Taro is best known for his work on the&nbsp;<em>Nier&nbsp;</em>franchise.</figcaption></figure><p>Taro's works outside&nbsp;<em>Nier&nbsp;</em>include the&nbsp;<em>Voice of Cards&nbsp;</em>series and Sega's rather odd waifu mobile RPG&nbsp;<em>404 Game Re:Set</em>, which, much like the&nbsp;<em>Nier&nbsp;</em>mobile game, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sega-yoko-taros-retro-waifu-mobile-jrpg-404-game-reset-shutting-down-8-months-from">has now been shut down</a>.</p>
<p>While it's quite often more the MO of companies <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metroid-prime-2d-receives-cease-and-desist">like Nintendo</a> to issue cease and desist orders, Square Enix has handed out its fair share of them as well, perhaps most notably to fan projects like&nbsp;<em>Chrono Resurrection</em>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this likely spells the permanent end of Accord's Library; given the nature of the project, it's unlikely the site could return in some other form. Still, one never knows. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <p>
Join us right here to watch this today's Xbox Partner Preview showcase, which kicks off this evening at 6pm UK time. 
</p>
<p>
If you're over the pond, that's 10am Pacific, or 1pm Eastern time. What do you mean you're supposed to be working?!
</p>
<p>
Microsoft has promised a "no-fluff, all-games broadcast" lasting 25 minutes, featuring games coming to Xbox consoles, PC and Game Pass. Specifically, these are games made by third-parties - not Xbox itself - so there will be no Fable or <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/halo">Halo</a> here.
</p>
<p>
Instead, we're expecting a proper look (and a release date) for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</a>'s Control-themed Lake House expansion, plus a fresh dive into Like A Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii. Dark fantasy action game Wuchang: Fallen Feathers will also feature, alongside other, unspecified "world premieres".

			<p id="ogozdf">In early 2004, the world was shaking it like a Polaroid picture, flocking to theaters to see what was going to happen with all those hobbits, and wondering if that Tom Brady guy was something special. Meanwhile, a few folks around the world were inventing the web as we know it now: A world-shaking social network was brewing in a Harvard dorm room. A Google employee was dreaming up the future of email in their spare time. The coolest cellphone of all time was just about to drop. The internet was still a niche activity, but that was about to change — and fast.</p><p id="LFbBoj">In so many ways, the digital world in which we now all live was created 20 years ago. Google went public and began to ascend to rule the web. Facebook, Gmail, Firefox, Flickr, and Digg all launched — the year Web 2.0 became the web. “Blog” and “the long tail” were on no one’s radar before 2004, and since then, they’ve been everywhere. The United States went through a contentious election, a bunch of sequels dominated the box office, and Apple launched a new product that looked very cool but was ultimately eclipsed by a better product a year later. Okay, some things never change.</p><p id="jnd666">Every year is a big year in tech, of course, but 2004 was an especially big one. And <em>The Verge </em>didn’t exist yet! So, this week, we’ll have stories on the best and most important gadgets and platforms that launched that year and pieces about the cultural events that still affect the way we live now. Basically, we’re going to blog like it’s 2004.</p><p id="DmGA3g"><em>Want to talk about our stories, your memories, and all your raddest photos from the early aughts? </em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24270606/2004-week-tech-internet-gadgets-phones-pop-culture?showComments=1"><em>Come hang here</em></a><em>.</em></p>
