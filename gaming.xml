  <p id="pZKWKP">Ready to feel old?<em> </em>James Cameron's aquatic epic <em>Titanic</em> recently turned 25, and to celebrate, Paramount released an anniversary edition containing exclusive collectibles and a 4K Blu-ray version of the iconic film. Originally $153.99, the 25th-anniversary edition of the movie is currently discounted to just $102.26 on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Titanic-25th-Anniversary-Limited-UHD/dp/B0CJYCZ58L/?tag=polygon05-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank" has-subtag="true" data-cdata="{&quot;rewritten_url&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Titanic-25th-Anniversary-Limited-UHD/dp/B0CJYCZ58L/?ascsubtag=___pl__p_23932091__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder\u0026tag=polygon05-20&quot;,&quot;subtag_max_length&quot;:99,&quot;subtag_delim_length&quot;:3,&quot;subtag_key&quot;:&quot;ascsubtag&quot;,&quot;subtag_data&quot;:{&quot;ascsubtag&quot;:&quot;___pl__p_23932091__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder&quot;,&quot;tag&quot;:&quot;polygon05-20&quot;},&quot;encode_subtag&quot;:false}">Amazon</a>, its lowest price to date. </p>

<p id="Jd46cY">The massive collector’s box houses the original film in addition to a disc dedicated to over 15 hours of bonus features (although unfortunately it doesn’t include the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23613387/titanic-alternate-ending-meaning">hotly debated alternate ending</a>). Inside you’ll also find a coffee table book full of production stills with accompanying commentary from the cast and crew. The 25th anniversary edition also features a sealed envelope full of artifacts from the movie, including blueprints for the titular ship and sheet music for James Horner’s <em>My Heart Will Go On.</em></p>

If you need to make truly evil statements under the guise of regular shit-talk to enjoy gaming, then please play something else. We won’t miss you.”<br></p><p>After this refreshingly no-nonsense speech, Donlon then outlines how Riot Games will be approaching <em>Valorant </em>voice comms going forward, and how the team will update its systems to better combat harassment. This includes:<br></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Updating existing policies within the next 30 days to focus on stronger, faster penalties for severe behavior (hate speech, severe sexual content, threats of violence)</li><li>New actions and penalties including temporary and permanent bans, up to and including hardware bans for the “worst offenders” </li><li>“Beefing up” the teams that manually review reports</li><li>Expanding the rollout of Riot’s voice evaluation system to different regions</li><li>One-time review of the top suspected offenders of the previous Act [a roughly two-month competitive timeframe in <em>Valorant</em>] and issue penalties accordingly</li></ul><p>Donlon is “hopeful” that these steps will help players feel safer while playing <em>Valorant</em>, but she also referenced plans to take a more “proactive” approach that the team will outline at a later date. She noted that hardware bans are an extreme form of punishment (one that some male gamers have, unsurprisingly, derided), but said that Riot Games will manually review these cases and will dole them out when there is “clear evidence” against someone.<br></p><p>As someone who has both experienced and reported on violent, hateful in-game voice chat, it’s good to see that one of the biggest studios in the industry is taking it seriously. Is it because a woman is running the game? Who’s to say…<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The trailer ends with a message serving as a classic callback to the anime that states, “Next time on Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero: Summer Game Fest 2024.” Could we be getting a release date at Geoff Keighley’s showcase? Given that the game was revealed during another Keighley show, The Game Awards 2023, it wouldn’t be surprising.</p>

<p>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero is the next entry in what’s known in the West as the Budokai Tenkaichi series (Sparking is the franchise's original Japanese name). The roster is only halfway revealed, but we’ve already seen a number of confirmed fighters from Dragon Ball Z and Dragon Ball Super, including <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/01/29/new-dragon-ball-sparking-zero-trailer-reveals-24-new-fighters-and-theyre-all-goku">multiple versions of the same characters</a>. The game has no release window but is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. You can learn more about the game's new mechanics and features <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/03/20/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-gameplay-video-reveals-new-mechanics-and-more-characters">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p data-characters="162" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">After allowing players to level up their weapons faster in <em>XDefiant</em> last weekend, Ubisoft decided to come back and gift everyone another double weapon XP period. </p> <p data-characters="231" data-current-count="231" data-injectable="false">Ubisoft <a href="https://x.com/PlayXDefiant/status/1796179788001861839" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that double weapon XP will be available starting Friday at 10 a.m. ET and ending Monday at 1 p.m. ET. This comes after players complained that <em>XDefiant’s </em>weapon progression is <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/xdefiants-weapon-progression-is-criminally-slow-and-fans-want-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">‘criminally slow.’</a> </p> <p data-characters="317" data-current-count="548" data-injectable="true">One <em>XDefiant</em> player claimed it takes over 100 hours to level up one weapon. XDefiant developer Patrick ‘ACHES’ Price clapped back and attempted to reassure fans by claiming that its 3500 XP per weapon level and one kill equals 100 XP. So, operating under that math, it is a maximum of 35 kills per level. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">3500 weapon XP per level. 1 kill = 100xp. So depending on assists etc. could be less, but it's a maximum of 35 kills per level.</p>— PATTYP (@ACHES) <a href="https://twitter.com/ACHES/status/1793051209181360274?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 21, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure> <p data-characters="235" data-current-count="535" data-injectable="true">For secondary weapons, that requirement is even less, with 1500 XP per weapon level. Each weapon has 50 levels, meaning it could take players a few hours to reach the max level on every weapon, but it all depends on their skill level. </p>
 <p data-characters="362" data-current-count="362" data-injectable="false">Skilled players should be able to get around 20-30 kills per round, but that’s also no easy feat. It’s unclear how much of a difference it makes with double XP active, but users should take advantage of it while they can. To get XP faster, Domination or Occupy. Both game modes are fast-paced and take place on the title’s smaller-scaled maps. </p>

<p id="0Bnsiy">In one of the studio’s <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/twid-05-30-24">weekly Destiny blog posts</a>, Bungie announced that <em>The Final Shape </em>raid, <strong>Salvation’s Edge</strong>, will launch on <strong>Friday, June 7, at 1 p.m. ET</strong>, just three days after the expansion’s June 4 release date.</p>
<p id="SCfkTl">Here’s when <em>The Final Shape</em> raid launches in your time zone:</p>
<ul>
<li id="seZog8">
<strong>10 a.m. PDT</strong> for the west coast of North America</li>
<li id="MycVUD">
<strong>1 p.m. EDT</strong> for the east coast of North America</li>
<li id="Ym5U8S">
<strong>6 p.m. BST </strong>for the U.K.</li>
<li id="u1JvmP">
<strong>7 p.m. CEST </strong>for western Europe/Paris</li>
<li id="aaDxmh">
<strong>2 a.m. JST </strong>on Saturday, June 8, for Tokyo</li>
</ul>
<p id="ERqp6D">In order to enter Salvation’s Edge, your Fireteam leader will need to have completed the <em>Final Shape</em> campaign and the “Wild Card” Exotic quest. According to Bungie, the raid will contain major spoilers for the campaign, so be aware of that if you decide to skip ahead.</p>
<p id="O5UOu7">For the contest mode in Salvation’s Edge — which runs 48 hours and will make the raid much tougher — you’ll need to be 1965 Power to be an appropriate level for all of the encounters.</p>

<p id="tOYx4o">If you’re a <em>Destiny 2</em> veteran, you may be a little confused by the timeline here. Typically, Bungie gives players a little less than two weeks — 10 days or so — to finish the campaign of a new expansion and prepare for the raid. However, most raids involve an end boss that is only tangentially related to the main boss of the expansion, rather than the primary antagonist themselves. </p>
<p id="QwCnwN">Since <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23841367/destiny-2-showcase-2023-final-shape-announcement-trailer-summary">Bungie announced <em>The Final Shape</em></a>, the studio has made it clear that The Witness will be the raid’s final boss. This is a huge step for Bungie, and something its developers have wanted to do for a long time. In a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22929425/destiny-2-witch-queen-campaign-raid-boss-dreadnaught-bungie-interview">Polygon interview for <em>Destiny 2</em>’s 2022 <em>Witch Queen</em> expansion</a>, I spoke to Joe Blackburn, now-former <em>Destiny 2</em> game director, about if we’d ever see an expansion’s big bad in the raid again. Blackburn expressed a desire to do that eventually, but said the studio first needed to bring more players into raids. Two and a half years later, it seems Bungie is now confident enough to make that move — likely because of the new in-game <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23318318/destiny-2-lfg-looking-for-group-loadouts-mods-ranks">Fireteam Finder</a> the studio recently added to the game.</p>
<p id="jKuRa5">With the raid being such a big cog in <em>The Final Shape</em>’s story, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1c861lp/the_final_shape_raid_date/?share_id=3uCLumgzLoDhf8gMKyUxr&amp;utm_content=1&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ioscss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=10">Bungie has clarified</a> that it didn’t want players to have to wait nearly two weeks to finish the story and play the campaign’s eighth mission, which only becomes available once players (presumably) defeat The Witness in the raid. The completion of the raid will also lead to the release of <em>Destiny 2</em>’s first episode — Bungie’s replacement for seasons — which will hit the game on Tuesday, June 11.</p>

This red window gets your attention, enticing you to interact with it. As in a museum, there is a small plaque detailing what the window is—because it’s not just a window, it’s performance art. “Red Window About To Break” is the title of the piece, a work by the mysterious character Renzo Nero. A little blurb explains the “strange logic” behind the piece, which is said to embody the idea that destruction can be art. It’s one of dozens of bits of text you read and then log away. Once exiting out of the blurb, however, something happens—the window breaks.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="12a27db5ff21891cc66dce61e773185e" data-recommend-id="image://12a27db5ff21891cc66dce61e773185e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1019" data-height="574" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Lorelei stands in a hallway with a broken red window" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Lorelei stands in a hallway with a broken red window" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Annapurna Interactive</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="12a27db5ff21891cc66dce61e773185e" data-recommend-id="image://12a27db5ff21891cc66dce61e773185e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1019" data-height="574" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Lorelei stands in a hallway with a broken red window" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It breaks in a cacophonous moment that shatters the game’s almost tranquil silence. A brick is lobbed through it from the outside, sending red shards across the floor of the hallway. When, at around midnight one evening, I reached this moment during my playthrough, I screamed at the top of my lungs (sorry to my neighbors). For context, I love horror games and am not prone to getting truly scared by most games’ attempts to do so. And now, the thing that gets me is a simple brick crashing through glass. The worst part is the game told me it was going to happen and it still got me. Even worse, I’ve seen this trick before, because it’s almost <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNERSGFSFPQ&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNERSGFSFPQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">directly lifted</a></span> from the original <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/resident-evil--1&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/resident-evil--1"><em>Resident Evil</em></a></span>, in which a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/resident-evils-window-dogs-set-the-standard-for-video-g-1824258916&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evils-window-dogs-set-the-standard-for-video-g-1824258916">zombie dog suddenly crashes through a window</a></span> and attacks you.<br></p><p>Before this, <em>Lorelei</em> convinces you that something like this will never happen. Before this moment, it has no true scares. The closest it gets is maze-headed men in suits that slowly follow you through rooms at certain points which, while eerie and menacing, aren’t monsters that can kill you in the traditional sense. The game requires that you confront them head-on, at which point you are faced with yet another puzzle to solve. The overwhelming majority of the game is a quiet introspective experience spent looking closely at items while you scribble possible solutions in a notebook. </p><figure id="" data-id="75cce52f33f5684ec657e2d8cc099fb1" data-recommend-id="image://75cce52f33f5684ec657e2d8cc099fb1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1024" data-height="575" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A dog crashes through a window" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A dog crashes through a window" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="75cce52f33f5684ec657e2d8cc099fb1" data-recommend-id="image://75cce52f33f5684ec657e2d8cc099fb1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1024" data-height="575" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A dog crashes through a window" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I wasn’t expecting to be shocked out of my relative, puzzle-induced comfort like this. In retrospect, though, even given that the game had no true scares before the window, I should have been expecting something like this to happen since it plays on <em>Resident Evil</em> tropes so much. The abandoned hotel in which it’s set feels incredibly close to the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/we-did-a-resident-evil-escape-room-and-it-was-awesome-1795583597&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/we-did-a-resident-evil-escape-room-and-it-was-awesome-1795583597">Spencer Mansion</a></span>, and an extended gameplay sequence has players controlling a PS1-inspired game within a game, complete with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tomb-raider-remastered-trilogy-tank-controls-graphics-1851169571&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tomb-raider-remastered-trilogy-tank-controls-graphics-1851169571">tank controls</a></span>. Simogo was putting the <em>Resident Evil </em>connections right in my face. Just like the window scare in <em>Resident Evil</em>, <em>Lorelei</em> was telling me that I could never feel truly safe.<br></p><p>As the initial shock of the moment wore off, my scream transformed into something else: laughter. That’s because in addition to being a jumpscare, “Red Window About To Break” is a joke. It reminds me of the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/dead-dove-do-not-eat&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/dead-dove-do-not-eat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Arrested Development</em> dead dove</a></span> meme. The game literally told me the window would break; what else did I expect? After this point, every time I walked back through this hallway, the red shards of glass on the floor reminded me of the moment and I had to laugh at myself. At least I can find solace in the fact that I’m not alone in my reaction, <em>TheGamer</em>’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.thegamer.com/author/tessa-aneet-kaur/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.thegamer.com/author/tessa-aneet-kaur/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tessa Kaur</a></span> admits that they <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/tessakaur/status/1790848972799508646&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/tessakaur/status/1790848972799508646" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dropped their Switch</a></span> when the brick came flying through the window.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="f054db2e93e41206064d9ec584ff0c99" data-recommend-id="image://f054db2e93e41206064d9ec584ff0c99" data-format="jpg" data-width="1024" data-height="576" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Lorelei stands within a red theater" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Lorelei stands within a red theater" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Annapurna Interactive</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f054db2e93e41206064d9ec584ff0c99" data-recommend-id="image://f054db2e93e41206064d9ec584ff0c99" data-format="jpg" data-width="1024" data-height="576" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Lorelei stands within a red theater" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There’s a beauty to how well “Red Window About To Break” works in the larger context of <em>Lorelei</em>. As stated in the artwork’s blurb, the piece is a collaborative performance between brick, window, artist, and audience. The artist presents the work by lobbing the brick through the window, but it only becomes the professed piece of art in being observed by the audience, or in this case, the player. If a window breaks and nobody is there to see it, did it even break? This same idea of the interaction between player and developer is explored in the game at large. Puzzles and narrative threads are presented to you by the developer but they can only reach their full potential when engaged with by you, the player. It conceives of interactivity as a sort of dance between both parties.<br></p><p>For a well-crafted puzzle box whose final challenge is a test of how well you have been paying attention, it feels more than apt. You complete <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em> by fully engaging with its world on the terms the developers set. By the end, it feels like you are throwing a brick through a window, shattering the game wide open.<br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p data-characters="275" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">‘Hidden faces’ are a type of collectible in <em>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2</em>. Well, they actually bar the way from the true collectible, a small tree that offers a bit of lore. The hidden faces are tough to spot in <em>Hellblade 2</em>, but we have all the locations below.</p> <div data-showtext="show" data-hidetext="hide" data-scrolltype="auto" id="gamurs-table-of-contents-524304" data-initiallyhideonmobile="false" data-initiallyshow="true" data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"> <p><strong><em>Hellblade 2</em> – All hidden faces locations</strong></p></div>   <p data-characters="440" data-current-count="740" data-injectable="true"><strong>There are 17 hidden faces locations throughout <em>Hellblade 2</em></strong>. Believe it or not, they appear as stone faces carved into walls. Crazy, right? Focusing on them causes them to ‘disappear’, opening a path to a small tree — akin to Yggdrasil, the Nordic world tree — beyond, along with a bit of narration. It’s kind of a cool effect with the faces melting into the environment, but I digress. Let’s look for some trees.</p>

The face is just behind it. </p> <figure data-wp-context="{ &quot;core&quot;: 				{ &quot;image&quot;: 					{   &quot;imageLoaded&quot;: false, 						&quot;initialized&quot;: false, 						&quot;lightboxEnabled&quot;: false, 						&quot;hideAnimationEnabled&quot;: false, 						&quot;preloadInitialized&quot;: false, 						&quot;lightboxAnimation&quot;: &quot;zoom&quot;, 						&quot;imageUploadedSrc&quot;: &quot;https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Hellblade-2-all-hidden-faces-12.jpg&quot;, 						&quot;imageCurrentSrc&quot;: &quot;&quot;, 						&quot;targetWidth&quot;: &quot;1200&quot;, 						&quot;targetHeight&quot;: &quot;675&quot;, 						&quot;scaleAttr&quot;: &quot;&quot;, 						&quot;dialogLabel&quot;: &quot;Enlarged image&quot; 					} 				} 			}" data-wp-interactive="" data-current-count="650" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption> <div data-wp-body="" data-wp-bind--role="selectors.core.image.roleAttribute" data-wp-bind--aria-label="selectors.core.image.dialogLabel" data-wp-class--initialized="context.core.image.initialized" data-wp-class--active="context.core.image.lightboxEnabled" data-wp-class--hideanimationenabled="context.core.image.hideAnimationEnabled" data-wp-bind--aria-modal="selectors.core.image.ariaModal" data-wp-effect="effects.core.image.initLightbox" data-wp-on--keydown="actions.core.image.handleKeydown" data-wp-on--touchstart="actions.core.image.handleTouchStart" data-wp-on--touchmove="actions.core.image.handleTouchMove" data-wp-on--touchend="actions.core.image.handleTouchEnd" data-wp-on--click="actions.core.image.hideLightbox" tabindex="-1"> <p> <figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> </p> <p> <figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> </p>  </div></figure>

<p data-characters="424" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>The Final Shape</em> is nearly upon <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/tag/destiny-2/">Destiny 2</a></em> players, but that doesn’t mean there aren’t opportunities to shoehorn in collaborations with other properties. Wizards of the Coast and Sony/Bungie have now teamed up to bring <em>Dungeons and Dragons</em> to <em>Destiny 2</em>. Kindly put aside the finale you’ve been waiting a decade for, it’s time to pony up some cash for medieval fantasy gear in a science fiction shooter.</p> <h2 id="h-somehow-the-mindflayer-warlock-makes-too-much-sense" data-injectable="false">Somehow, the Mindflayer Warlock makes too much sense</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Destiny 2: The Final Shape | Dungeons &amp; Dragons x Destiny" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hDdeAYUpG1o?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="297" data-current-count="597" data-injectable="true"><a href="https://twitter.com/DestinyTheGame/status/1796229524306235780">The announcement</a> came via the official <a href="https://twitter.com/DestinyTheGame"><em>Destiny 2</em> account on X</a>. Fans of both franchises will be able to indulge on June 4, 2024, when the collaboration goes live with the release of <em>The Final Shape</em>. From armor sets to an emblem and even a physical Eye Tyrant Ghost Shell, there’s plenty here.</p>
 <ul data-found-items="8" data-current-count="320" data-injectable="false"> <li>Apex Draconic Set (Titan)</li> <li>Flayer’s Dominion Set (Warlock)</li> <li>Spectral Displacer Set (Hunter)</li> <li>Queen of Dragons Ship</li> <li>Owlbear Chariot Sparrow</li> <li>Eye Tyrant Ghost Shell</li> <li>Bigby’s Fist Finisher</li> <li>Natural 20 Emote</li> </ul> <figure data-current-count="320" data-injectable="false"> <figure><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/destiny-2-dungeons-and-dragons-collab-emblem.jpg"></a><figcaption>Image via Bungie</figcaption></figure> <figure><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/destiny-2-dungeons-and-dragons-collab-ship-sparrow-ghost.jpg"></a><figcaption>Image via Bungie</figcaption></figure> </figure> <p data-characters="299" data-current-count="619" data-injectable="true">This isn’t the first time that Bungie has partnered with another property in a bizarre crossover. Earlier this year, we had the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/destiny-2-is-getting-a-ghostbusters-crossover/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire</em> crossover</a>, and prior to that, Bungie teamed up with CD Projekt Red for a <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/destiny-2s-next-crossover-adds-the-witcher-cosmetics/"><em>Witcher</em> crossover</a> (though <em>Cyberpunk</em> would have made more sense).</p>
 <p data-characters="434" data-current-count="434" data-injectable="false">In a world where corporations are teaming up to milk their audiences for all they’re worth, it’s not shocking to see collaborations. However, all I ask is that they try to fit the theme of one another. <em>Destiny</em> is a series set in the far-flung future, so when medieval properties get thrown in, it feels very out of place. But, enough of my grousing, let’s focus on the real issue: the lack of an Astarion Hunter set.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24168066/minecraft-tricky-trials-update-mace-bogged-breeze-chambers<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="9JkhCK"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/minecraft-guides">The next <em>Minecraft</em> update</a> is on the way, and it’s called Tricky Trials. <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/tricky-trials-update-official-release-date">Tricky Trials is set to launch on June 13</a> for both the Bedrock and Java versions of the game, and as you may have guessed from the name, it’s about creating new challenges for the player. There are also new decorations, a new mace weapon, and an auto-crafter powered by redstone.</p>
<p id="y0oMKy">As part of this update, players will be able to discover trial chambers, which are full of hostile mobs. There are two new creatures that can be encountered here. The first is the breeze, a fast-moving tornado that might just send you airborne. Then there’s the bogged, which are poisonous skeletons ridden with moss and mushrooms. </p>
<p id="LKWfr8">The challenge trials will be tricky, but the rewards are well worth it — and players can scale the difficulty up by exploring one with friends by their side. Every player gets to claim rewards from the chamber’s vault, and there will be plenty of cosmetics around to break down and bring home to decorate a base with.</p>
<p id="O9Rc6v">If you want to turn the difficulty up even further, players can find and choose to chug an ominous bottle. Doing so applies a status effect called Bad Omen. This means that entering an overworld village will trigger an ominous raid, and entering a trial chamber with Bad Omen starts an ominous trial. These challenges have stronger enemies with enchanted weapons — and defeating them can also reward you with the items you need to build a new mace.</p>
<p id="MjkHSh">Making things easier on the homefront, Mojang has added an auto-crafter. Players can set up a contraption powered by redstone that automatically crafts items. There are also 20 new paintings, which will be perfect for those among us who just want to create a cozy home full of lovely art. </p>
<p id="2xBcrG">Don’t forget — there’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24022852/minecraft-movie-jack-black-steve">a <em>Minecraft</em> movie</a> and<a href="https://www.polygon.com/24167807/minecraft-netflix-animated-series-tv-show"> <em>Minecraft</em> animated Netflix show</a> in the works, so truly, our cups runneth over with all things <em>Minecraft</em>.</p>

Specifcally, voice lines for the game’s various characters that seem to indicate future additions to the roster. Here’s a video, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/@easternunit2009/videos&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/@easternunit2009/videos" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">from easternunit200 on YouTube</a></span>, that includes all of Agent Smith’s voice lines. </p><p>That brings us to the weird scenario of Pickle Rick leaking the news that characters from <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RWBY&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RWBY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rooster Teeth’s anime series <em>RWBY</em></a></span><em> </em>might be coming to MultiVereus in a future update.

It seems WB doesn’t mind looting a fresh corpse. </p><p>Other leaked voice lines seem to indicate that DC hero Aquaman and Marceline from <em>Adventure Time </em>will be added to the online fighter, too. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/5kbQsHQH8xA&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/5kbQsHQH8xA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rick and his Pickle Variant also have voice lines</a></span> that seem to confirm the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Krusty4Multi/status/1795867990992338986&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Krusty4Multi/status/1795867990992338986" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Powerpuff Girls will soon join the game</a></span> as well. This makes sense as the young superheroes were recently spotted in a <em>MultiVersus </em>trailer and Townsville—where the show is set—is already featured in the game as a level. It should be noted that any or all of this could change as developing games is hard and plans shift all the time.&nbsp;</p><p>Anyway, what a weird timeline we live in where Pickle Rick is now a solid source for video game news.</p><p> .</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Though The Sims team might be hard at work on series' next title, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-sims-project-rene/" data-ref-id="5000-574132">Project Rene</a>, that doesn't mean they aren't taking some time to implement some big changes to the series' current iteration. EA has announced that <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/the-sims-4-events" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">limited-time events are coming to The Sims 4</a>.</p><p>According to an <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/the-sims-4-events" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">EA blog post</a>, these events will reward players for logging in daily with free items, traits, and more. Font, a senior game designer on The Sims 4, wrote that the newly-added events feature is focused on adding "new opportunities to your game."</p><p>"Our team created a platform for these new events to live. Something that is flexible, easier to update, and will be easy for you to find and claim those rewards," Font said. "Our designers have been busy making this new system shine and preparing for the first Event, while our artists have been creating new objects and Create-a-Sim pieces."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DH7ReVsC6xA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="94">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/DH7ReVsC6xA?start=94" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The game's first event, The Sims 4 Happy at Home Login Event, kicks off today and is scheduled to run for four weeks. The event contains a handful of items that "will help create a comfortable hangout space for your Sims," as well as the Practice Makes Perfect trait, which will allow your Sims to learn skills faster. A full list with descriptions of all eight rewards coming can be found over the <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/the-sims-4-events" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">official EA blog</a>.</p><p>Considering The Sims 4 is known for its ever-expanding (and costly) catalog of DLC, the studio has already assured players that all the items included in events are entirely free. According to Font, all players have to do is engage with the event. Once a reward is claimed, it can be found within the Base Game.</p><p>However, Font also explained that the requirements for unlocking items will differ. While Happy at Home just requires that players login, some events might take players on "quests" where they will have to complete goals to earn rewards.</p><p>Font also explained how joining an event late will work, writing:</p><p>"There's plenty of time during the event to jump in if you are coming in late. Each day you launch the game counts as a login to unlock the next available reward. If you come in late to the event there's still time to catch up, but it will take eight days of logins to unlock all of the rewards. We've provided an extra week to login and claim those remaining rewards."</p><p>With that in mind, Happy at Home should run through the first week of July. EA has not yet announced what event will follow, or how frequent events will be.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/science-fiction-books-like-dune/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=science-fiction-books-like-dune<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="369" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The <em>Dune</em> series from Frank Herbert has unbelievable influence on the science fiction genre of novels, but there are only so many of these books to go around. Fans of the <em>Dune</em> series will inevitably get through the six mainline books and couple of adaptations in a decent amount of time. If that happens to be you, here are 10 science fiction books like the <em>Dune</em> series.</p> <p data-characters="395" data-current-count="395" data-injectable="false">These particular sci-fi books carry elements or ideas similar to the classic millennia-spanning series from Herbert. Some of them carry the heavy political themes, while others focus on the “chosen one” ideas. Still more carry some of the weirder features of the Dune series, such as strange powers and characters. Any <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/frank-herbert-dune-reading-order/">Dune</a></em> fan should check out the 10 science fiction books and series below.</p> <figure data-current-count="695" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Amazon</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-hainish-cycle-series" data-injectable="false"><em>Hainish Cycle</em> Series</h2> <p data-characters="411" data-current-count="411" data-injectable="true">This series of sci-fi novels from Ursula K. Le Guin takes place in a far future setting where humanity evolved in space, rather than just on Earth. This resulted in some rather wild and odd groups of people in the solar system, such as one colony that has dreams while awake. The connections and communication between the various interstellar colonies leads to the rich political elements <em>Dune</em> fans might enjoy.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Amazon</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-hyperion-cantos" data-injectable="false"><em>Hyperion Cantos</em></h2> <p data-characters="508" data-current-count="808" data-injectable="true">This sci-fi series from Dan Simmons encompasses four core books and a number of short stories. The main series divides itself between the <em>Hyperion</em> half and the <em>Endymion</em> half, telling different parts in the history of this futuristic civilization. It also has one of the most flexible and weird storytelling systems, with writing styles changing between novels. For instance, the first book has a <em>Canterbury Tales</em>-style split between main characters while the second books is told through a series of dreams. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Amazon</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-a-canticle-for-leibowitz" data-injectable="false"><em>A Canticle for Leibowitz</em></h2> <p data-characters="379" data-current-count="679" data-injectable="true">This fascinating book from Walter M. Miller Jr. could almost feel like a spiritual predecessor to <em>Dune</em>, at least in its historical and thematic sense. The novel is best experienced without knowing much about it, especially in regards to its unique twists, but it centers around a monastery in the United States after a nuclear war and the monks trying to rebuild humanity there. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Amazon</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-valis" data-injectable="false"><em>VALIS</em></h2> <p data-characters="451" data-current-count="751" data-injectable="true">Pretty much Philip K. Dick novel is worth a look if you like the <em>Dune</em> series. However, if there is one we recommend in particular, it is <em>VALIS</em>. It has the stranger parts of science fiction but kicked up to an unfathomable notch. It its equal parts pseudo-autobiography and bizarre religious sci-fi. There is even a sequel in The Divine Invasion, though it lacks Dick’s memorable alter ego protagonist, Horselover Fat (yes, that is the actual name). </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Amazon</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-lord-of-light" data-injectable="false"><em>Lord of Light</em></h2> <p data-characters="330" data-current-count="630" data-injectable="true">Roger Zelazny came out with Lord of Light in 1967 as a collection of seven different short stories following a crew of humans who mutated their bodies to gain supernatural powers to survive upon their new world. The heavy imagery and symbolism makes for a complex tale with several different characters and ideas to keep up with. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Amazon</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-the-expanse" data-injectable="false"><em>The Expanse</em></h2> <p data-characters="457" data-current-count="757" data-injectable="true">James S.A. Corey’s award-winning series begins with <em>Leviathan Wakes</em> and continues through nine different hefty books. The series has a wide cast of characters, much like <em>Dune</em>, and several different point of views throughout the books. There is enough variation in the story to keep fans engaged, including a more detective-style plot with Joe Miller and even interactions with an alien civilization. Like <em>Dune</em>, it also has a fantastic adaptation as well. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Amazon</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-remembrance-of-earth-s-past-trilogy" data-injectable="false"><em>Remembrance of Earth’s Past</em> Trilogy</h2> <p data-characters="379" data-current-count="679" data-injectable="true">Also known by the name of its first novel, <em>The Three-Body Problem</em>, this series from Cixin Liu takes place throughout human history as Earth discovers and engages with the Trisolaran alien race. The series is trippy and can be hard to keep up with as it shifts back-and-forth between eras, but it has some of the most compelling and thoughtful science-based fiction in the genre. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Amazon</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-safehold-series" data-injectable="false"><em>Safehold</em> Series</h2> <p data-characters="431" data-current-count="731" data-injectable="true">This heavily underrated sci-fi series from David Weber doesn’t get talked about enough. It follows the last remaining humans taking refuge on a distant planet after the near-annihilation of humanity at the hands of the Gbaba aliens. What follows is a tale of a corrupt new religious society that wiped out history and technology to stay hidden. Its deep religious and political themes are some of the most gripping in the genre. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Amazon</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-culture-series" data-injectable="false"><em>Culture</em> Series</h2> <p data-characters="400" data-current-count="700" data-injectable="true">Iain M. Banks came out with this series, beginning with <em>Consider Phlebas</em>, in 1987. It focuses on the war between a utopian alien society and the other civilizations that surround it. The series spans thousands of years and each book pretty much acts as its own standalone tale within the overarching history. This provides a wide selection of different genres, writing styles, and even protagonists. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Amazon</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-pandora-sequence-series" data-injectable="false"><em>Pandora Sequence</em> Series</h2> <p data-characters="439" data-current-count="739" data-injectable="false">Anyone who loved the <em>Dune</em> series from Frank Herbert might want to see the other novels he wrote in his time. Perhaps the closest in style to his iconic series is the <em>Pandora Sequence</em> set of novels. These start with <em>Destination: Void</em>, which follows a group of isolated clones bred and put in a stressful situation to create the first true artificial intelligence. It feels just familiar enough while forging its own trippy sci-fi universe. </p>

<p data-characters="332" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">There have been some controversial <em>Fortnite</em> seasons throughout the years, but perhaps none have caused as much controversy as Chapter 5, Season 3: Wrecked. After spending some time with this patch, I think it’s by far the worst that Epic has ever dropped, losing sight of what even made <em>Fortnite </em>enjoyable in the first place. </p> <p data-characters="292" data-current-count="292" data-injectable="false">Think back to your favorite <em>Fortnite</em> memories. How many involve getting run over by a guy in a vehicle? I know that that number is zero for me, and I’d guess for many of you, it’s the same. Yet for some reason, Epic has decided that <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/all-fortnite-wrecked-season-3-battle-pass-cosmetics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 3: Wrecked</a> should be all about the cars.</p> <p data-characters="372" data-current-count="664" data-injectable="true">In truth, that’s what every single match I’ve played has been so far. Sooner or later, I hear the roar of a vehicle speeding my way, and I spend my time jumping and running out of its way, trying to take potshots at the driver whenever I can. Inevitably, you have two options: Get flattened by your opponent, or get in a car yourself and fight fire with fire. </p>
 <p data-characters="356" data-current-count="356" data-injectable="false">Why is this happening? Well, with Season 3’s <em>Mad Max</em>-esque Wrecked theme, there are more vehicles than ever before on the map. That’s not all though, as Epic has introduced even more vehicle mods to make them more dangerous than ever, from Machine Gun Turrets to Spiked Bumpers that send you flying and deal huge damage if you get hit by them. </p> <p data-characters="316" data-current-count="672" data-injectable="true">Then, for a final added bonus, the new Nitro barrels can give your car an extra speed boost, explosive power when ramming opponents, and a buff to any mod you have attached. It’s no wonder then that players are skipping guns and going straight to vehicles—they’re the best weapon in the game right now.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Nothing like getting repeatedly crushed by a jeep. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="495" data-current-count="795" data-injectable="true">That shouldn’t be what <em>Fortnite</em> is about though. At its best, <em>Fortnite</em> gives you multiple ways to play, with items that lend themselves to different playstyles. Yes, I would complain when I got sniped by a distant enemy, but at least I understood that not everybody is a “run-and-gunner” like me. For the past week, I’ve spent match after match being squished by cars over and over again, to the point that I don’t want to play the game for the rest of the season. </p>
 <p data-characters="414" data-current-count="414" data-injectable="true">This season of <em>Fortnite</em> is reminiscent of the horrible days of the X-4 Stormwing plane or the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/fortnites-maligned-mechs-crash-land-in-recent-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">B.R.U.T.E mech suit</a>, which both bombed their way through anyone and everyone in their path. During those times, guns were essentially useless too, and anyone who didn’t find a plane early or get themselves locked into a mech suit were at such a disadvantage that you might as well have quit to the lobby yourself. </p>
 <p data-characters="352" data-current-count="352" data-injectable="false">There is no enjoyable gunplay in Season 3 because you rarely face enemies on foot. The map changes are irrelevant because half the player base spends their time driving around, avoiding the buildings. I’m not saying there isn’t room for vehicles in <em>Fortnite</em>, but making them all-powerful killing machines is too far in the wrong direction. </p> <p data-characters="728" data-current-count="1080" data-injectable="true">This season doesn’t feel like <em>Fortnite</em> at all, it almost feels like a weird game of <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> when you would unlock a tank and just destroy everything and everyone in your path. And look, I get it, for some people that sounds like fun, but it’s different when the people you’re blowing up are actual players, not NPCs. Getting squashed, shot, and blown to smithereens by an opponent in an armored vehicle is not battle royale gameplay, and it actively makes the game unfair. Yes, your odds are often dictated by the guns you find, but if you land beside a vehicle and don’t get it first, you have no hope of survival at all, and when that happens game after game, it’s hard to keep playing. </p>
 <p data-characters="432" data-current-count="432" data-injectable="true">It’s not just me who feels this way, either. Tyler “Ninja” Blevins has already quit <em>Fortnite</em> for this season, <a href="https://x.com/FNcompReport/status/1794501903600267497">saying</a>: “If I was a five-year-old that still loved cool cars I would be having the time of my life. I’m a 32-year-old grown man who likes to fucking shoot things in video games, and now I have to drive a vehicle around and pray that I run into people that have a worse vehicle than me.”</p>
 <p data-characters="371" data-current-count="371" data-injectable="false">None of this feels like <em>Fortnite</em>, and if it was an entirely different game, I wouldn’t play it again. Epic should be praised for its creativity and the willingness to try new things, but it should always <em>feel</em> like <em>Fortnite</em>. When you get off that path, it’s time to look back and readjust, and I believe that’s where the developer finds itself right now.</p> <p data-characters="344" data-current-count="715" data-injectable="false">With the season themed around this <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/all-the-mad-max-movies-ranked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mad Max</a></em>-esque vehicular warfare, presumably due to the timely release of <em>Furiosa</em>, there’s little chance that Epic will decide to remove the cars entirely. I just hope that Epic goes back to basics when Chapter 5, Season 4 rolls around, because this is, by far, the least fun that <em>Fortnite</em> has ever been.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24167467/league-of-legends-risen-legend-ahri-bundle-fan-reaction<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="VxH6Rf"><em>League of Legends </em>is free to play, but Riot Games makes money off in-client purchases. If you’re a fan of a specific champion, you can purchase alternate cosmetic skins with new lore. In the mainline lore, Ahri is a nine-tailed fox looking to find the secrets of her people... but with skins, she can be an international star, an evil witch in the woods, or a magical girl squad captain. One new skin has raised a furor among fans, because at its top tier, it costs a whopping $500.</p>
<p id="ZT6qJR">Riot has started a new initiative to honor the <a href="https://halloflegends.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/">best of the best of the <em>League of Legends</em> esports scene in the Hall of Legends</a>, a commemorative list of the game’s greatest figures. The first player to be inducted is an obvious choice: Faker, a multi-time world champion widely considered to be the GOAT. The Hall of Legends comes with an in-game pass, with 100 levels of unlockable rewards. This includes a Risen Legend LeBlanc skin, a ward, banner, and other emotes and icons.</p>
<p id="UKB1LW">The second skin associated with Faker is the one garnering all the controversy. There are three tiers of Ahri skins: Risen Legend, Immortalized Legend, and the Signature Immortalized Legend. These skins can only be unlocked through collections, and the Signature Immortalized Legend Collection is 59260 RP, which is equivalent to around $500. It comes with banners, borders, Faker’s signature on the splash art, a complete event pass, and in-game upgrades to Immortalized Legend Ahri.</p>
<p id="3G2ExI">That’s a hefty price tag, and understandably, fans are shocked. “Sorry to my rioter friends but riot is absolutely batshit with this, NO digital cosmetic is worth 30K or 60K RP. None. Faker is NOT that cool bro,” wrote one player on X. <a href="https://x.com/Kapban2/status/1795623388251344986">Another player posted a Discord convo</a>, in which one participant asks: “Does it come with a fucking handjob from Ahri herself?”</p>

</div>
<p id="9loIMB"><a href="https://x.com/KenApplepi/status/1795474762421948779">Other fans noted that it’s ironic to have such an expensive skin</a> to honor Faker, as the player is known to play without any skins. There have been esports skins in the past, but none have ever hit this price tier — and even with their comparatively modest prices, Faker has stated that he <a href="https://x.com/WhatleyLeague/status/1795869047130579204">waits to purchase skins like SKT T1 Ryze when they’re on sale</a>. It’s hard to see the value behind a macrotransaction such as this, especially when $500 could purchase a full console, or several incredible triple-A games. Some fans have joked that they’ll start permanently banning Ahri from their games, ensuring that <em>no one</em> can use the skin, no matter how much it costs.</p>

</div>
<p id="9zAEoh">Ahri is a popular champion, and Faker is an icon of <em>League of Legends, </em>but the price point has many fans outraged. Polygon contacted Riot for comment, but did not receive any additional information. It remains to be seen how many superfans pony up for this purchase — and if they end up catching any heat from the rest of the playerbase. </p>

        </h3>
        <p>A pet harness has to be strong enough to survive years of an energetic dog tugging their human on daily walks. But it also needs to be soft enough to be comfortable for the pup. And ideally, it needs to look nice, because it will be a dog’s daily fashion statement. The Puppia harness does all of the above and comes in a wide variety of styles and colors. Plus, it’s competitively priced. Our first harness lasted six years, and we only bought a new one because the original — while still sturdy and soft — was looking a bit grimy after half a decade of neighborhood hikes. —<em>Chris Plante</em><br> </p>

        </h3>
        <p>While there are a number of styles available, each Fi collar works the same way, using any nearby LTE network to keep tabs on your dog via GPS. AirTags can tell you where your dog is provided they're within 200 feet of an iPhone, but the Fi collar will let you know where they are, no matter how far. While the collar itself is free, the app requires an annual subscription to function. However, if you visit the great outdoors with your dog, or regularly let them off leash, the Fi dog collar is an extra bit of insurance that can pay real dividends. <em>—AJ</em></p>

        </h3>
        <p>A cat scratcher is essential if you own a cat. To keep my cat from destroying every fabric surface in my house, I like to keep a cat scratcher in basically every room. There’s always a better option available than the couch, daybed, curtains, headboard... I can go on. That means I have a lot of cat scratchers — so why not have some fun? My personal favorite is the Boston Bruins hockey rink scratcher, which has a plush puck to play with, a jingling ball to push around the rink, and a scratching board. <em>—Nicole Carpenter</em></p>

        </h3>
        <p>You need pet insurance, and you need to get it early. Most pet insurance carriers are quite similar: They cover most issues, unless they are preexisting. For instance, I took my dog to the vet to get treated for allergies before I got Trupanion, so allergies are considered a preexisting condition. But anything that developed after is fair game. The hot tip is to get it early: Trupanion has saved me spending thousands — like, a lot of thousands — on treatment. <em>—NC</em></p>

        </h3>
        <p>My most prized possession is a necklace engraved with my dog’s photo. The Pet Photo Engraved Necklace from Kolohe is pricey, but worth every penny. It’s more unique than just his name; I love having a little photo of him around my neck. The engraving is surprisingly readable on the small necklace pendant. This would make a great gift for a pet owner! <em>—NC</em></p>

        <p>Kongs are the ubiquitous and invaluable chew toy for dogs of any age. Fill them with treats and peanut butter to keep your dog busy while you're away, or freeze them with wet food inside to satisfy a teething puppy. Kongs are available in a variety of sizes, but they're tough enough to handle even the strongest of chewers, and their rubber construction is dishwasher safe.<em> —AJ</em></p>

        </h3>
        <p>Our cat, Eartha, is what you’d call a micromanager. She’s always watching us work, making sure we’re not oversleeping, and she keeps us on our toes. It should come as no surprise that she loves the Cloud Nine Window Hammock from Tuft and Paw. During summer, she loves sunbathing on this super attractive hammock in the summer months. The hammock attaches with these barely there suction cups that are equal parts supportive (up to 30 pounds) and easy to remove (in case Eartha gets bored of us and wants to watch birds outside instead). <em>—Tercius Bufete</em></p>

There’s also now an option to pause the game in single-player in case you need to take a minute away from the game without fear.</p><p><em>Redfall</em>’s final update also revamps a few of the game’s major systems to be more rewarding and streamlined. The neighborhood system has been retooled and equipped with a new meter called Community Standing, which increases upon “​​unlocking a new Safehouse, completing Safehouse missions, rescuing civilians, or killing an Underboss.” The community standing meter has six ranks that players can blast through, and there are 39 rewards to be earned from completing all of them.</p><p>The updates also introduces elder nests to <em>Redfall</em> which, akin to the heart nests already in the game, are boss-focused arenas that “challenge you to destroy dangerously modified special Vampires.” Completing an elder nest will grant players rewards as well as a temporary buff called a heart shard, which scales in effectiveness to the difficulty of the game. The harder the elder nest encounter, the longer the buff lasts.</p><p>Though the patch notes available aren’t complete, the final update also brings new enemy encounters, improvements to enemy AI, a new weapon, accessibility options, and more. As the update’s been promoted, many Arkane Austin developers, including former creative director <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/arkane-austin-dishonored-closure-harvey-smith-1851463271&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/arkane-austin-dishonored-closure-harvey-smith-1851463271">Harvey Smith</a></span>, have begun spreading news of its arrival and bidding farewell to <em>Redfall</em>, its dedicated community of players, and fans of Arkane Austin.</p><p>Some outside developers, including <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/microsoft-xbox-arkane-evil-within-3-prey-2-layoffs-1851461099&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-xbox-arkane-evil-within-3-prey-2-layoffs-1851461099">Dinga Bakaba</a></span>, director of sister studio Arkane Lyon, have also chimed in to congratulate the team on its hard work and pay respects to the studio as it closes.</p><p><em>Redfall</em>’s final update is obviously a bittersweet one. Arkane Austin was clearly in the middle of addressing the concerns that players raised about the game when it launched last year. If the update is any indication, the team was fully ready to overhaul the game and its systems to improve the experience and make <em>Redfall </em>into the game that many hoped it would be. Now, as it pushes one last update out and closes its doors for good, <em>Redfall </em>will never get the shot to reach the height of its ambitions, and it’s nothing short of tragic.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Nintendo Switch owners who still adore the GameCube controller design for Smash Bros. and other games can take advantage of great deal on a unique gamepad right now. The NYXI Wizard controller reimagines that classic device for the Switch and adds a few modern touches, and if that sounds like a good time, you can <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Switch-Controller-Nintendio-Programmable-Mechanical-Nintendo/dp/B0CLNF52FF?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">save up to 25% off the regular price in this Amazon Lightning Deal</a>. This <strong>deal is only available today until 5:30 PM PT / 8:30 PM ET (May 30)</strong>.</p><p>The NYXI Wizard acts as an alternative to Joy-Con controllers. You can attach them to your Switch just like Nintendo's official controllers for handheld mode, or you can keep them connected together to have a chunky GameCube-style controller for docked play.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4310301-switchcube-controller.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4310301" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4310301-switchcube-controller.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4310301"></a><figcaption>NYXI Wizard Controller</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4310301-switchcube-controller.jpg"></figure><ul><li><a title="https://www.amazon.com/Switch-Controller-Nintendio-Programmable-Mechanical-Nintendo/dp/B0CLNF52FF" href="https://www.amazon.com/Switch-Controller-Nintendio-Programmable-Mechanical-Nintendo/dp/B0CLNF52FF?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">NYXI Wizard Controller (Black)</a> -- $52.49 ($<strike>70</strike>)</li><li><a title="https://www.amazon.com/Switch-Controller-Nintendio-Programmable-Mechanical-Nintendo/dp/B0CPSBQQ1K" href="https://www.amazon.com/Switch-Controller-Nintendio-Programmable-Mechanical-Nintendo/dp/B0CPSBQQ1K?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">NYXI Wizard Controller (Orange)</a> -- $56 ($<strike>70</strike>)</li><li><a title="https://www.amazon.com/Switch-Controller-Nintendio-Programmable-Mechanical-Nintendo/dp/B0CLNVTN1L" href="https://www.amazon.com/Switch-Controller-Nintendio-Programmable-Mechanical-Nintendo/dp/B0CLNVTN1L?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">NYXI Wizard Controller (Purple)</a> -- $59.50 ($<strike>70</strike>)</li></ul><p>Beyond the familiar shape and input arrangement, the controller also comes with Hall Effect joysticks, which are far more durable and more resistant to drifting than the sticks on a typical Joy-Con. The ABXY face buttons feature customizable color effects that sync with your gaming actions, there are two programmable back buttons, and six-Axis gyroscope motion-sensing technology for games that require twists and turns. Pretty useful for Mario Kart 8!</p><p>Additionally, the programmable buttons have adjustable turbo response and vibration intensity and the mechanical triggers can be fine-tuned to provide rapid-fire accuracy in competitive games. Overall, this makes for a robust and feature-packed controller, especially for when you want to play ports of classic GameCube titles on your Switch. For the colors, you can choose from black, orange, and purple models.</p><p>For a more conventional alternative for handheld play, Switch owners will want to check out the Nitro Deck, a slick cradle for your Switch when you're on the move. This connects to the Switch via the USB-C port on the bottom of the console for faster response times, and other features include Hall Effect joysticks, four programmable back buttons, Bluetooth support, and more. Normally $60, you can grab one now for $45 from a selection of five different colors.

                <p>The final patch for Redfall--the much-maligned co-op shooter from Arkane Austin--has <a href="https://bethesda.net/en/article/57LBTGVNF2rYof6K3yMGLP/redfall-game-update-4-available-now" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">arrived</a>, and it brings a large number of new changes and systems to the game. These include a "Community Standing" mechanic that rewards you for completing objectives, a new type of vampire nest to take down, and the introduction of an offline mode.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/Harvey1966/status/1796203861448983007" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Redfall's final patch is live. Months of work by the team on this, the ReVamp version, and a Herculean effort by all involved over the last few weeks. Big systems refactor, more encounter types. Have fun, always. <a href="https://t.co/ZOBYXMI8jx" rel="nofollow ">https://t.co/ZOBYXMI8jx</a></p>  — Harvey Smith (@Harvey1966) <a href="https://twitter.com/Harvey1966/status/1796203861448983007?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 30, 2024</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">Community Standing is arguably the biggest addition here, as it affects many aspects of Redfall from the ground up. Players will now earn this reputation by unlocking Safehouses, completing Safehouse missions, rescuing civilians, and killing an Underboss. You can then spend this reputation to unlock rewards from the Safehouse Skill Tree, which has 39 different rewards that are tiered through six different ranks.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Redfall Review - Half-Staked</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The new Elder Nest is the other headline inclusion, which are boss-focused encounters that challenge players to defeat particularly difficult vampires. Once you defeat the powerful boss within, you'll receive big rewards, as well as a temporary buff called a Heart Shard, which gives you and your party members a randomized bonus, like holstered weapons regenerating ammo.</p><p dir="ltr">This update also brings a number of quality-of-life changes to the game, including the inclusion of offline mode, which allows you to play the game without being connected to the internet. It adds single-player pausing, so that players no longer have to find a safe corner to hide in to adjust their kit.</p><p dir="ltr">Notably, there are no full patch notes for Update 4, and that the update text states that it has other additions for players to find. This makes sense, given that this is the final patch for Redfall due to the closure of its developer Arkane Austin. Microsoft <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-is-shutting-down-four-studios-including-arkane-austin-and-tango-gameworks/1100-6523227/">shuttered the studio</a> as part of a wave of closures that included Hi-Fi Rush studio Tango Gameworks. Arkane Austin was reportedly pitching an "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arkane-austin-was-pitching-immersive-sim-prior-to-closure-more-cuts-at-xbox-coming-report/1100-6523286/">immersive sim</a>" similar to its previous game Prey before the hammer dropped. Microsoft has stated that Redfall will remain online.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/best-ea-fc-24-icons-for-every-position-june-2024.885321/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/best-ea-fc-24-icons-for-every-position/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=best-ea-fc-24-icons-for-every-position<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="179" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">This list of best<em> EA FC 24</em> Icons includes legendary names from the world of men’s and women’s football, providing an idea of how to cover your team in every position. </p> <p data-characters="354" data-current-count="354" data-injectable="false">Unlike the last few years, EA Sports has released many more versions of Icons in Ultimate Team. The addition of women’s cards has introduced names like Homare Sawa, Camille Abily, and more, which has resulted in plenty of choices for the players. However, few Icons are always better than their counterparts as far as the in-game meta is concerned.</p> <h2 id="h-best-ea-fc-24-icons-at-every-position" data-injectable="false">Best EA FC 24 Icons at every position</h2> <p data-characters="219" data-current-count="573" data-injectable="true">Icons are always popular choices, as they have great stats and offer bonuses to squad chemistry as well. It’s no wonder that some of the most-used items, even in the esports scene, include the best<em> EA FC 24</em> Icons.</p>
 <ul data-found-items="10" data-current-count="400" data-injectable="true"> <li>GK: Petr Cech (TOTY), Lev Yashin, Iker Casillas (Thunderstruck), Edwin Van Der Star (Birthday)</li> <li>CB: Paolo Maldini (Future Stars), Marcel Desailly (Golazo), Rio Ferdinand (TOTY)</li> <li>RB/RWB: Cafu (Golazo), Carlos Alberto Torres (Birthday), Gianluca Zambrotta (Birthday)</li> <li>LB/LWB: Roberto Carlos (Golazo), Ashley Cole (Golazo)</li> <li>CDM: Patrick Vieira (TOTY), Lothar Matthaus (TOTY)</li> <li>CM: Andrea Pirlo (Birthday), Camille Abily (Birthday), Ruud Gullit (Birthday)</li> <li>CAM: Zinedine Zidane (Birthday), Zico (Future Stars), Kaka (Golazo)</li> <li>LW/LM: Ronaldinho (Future Stars, only at LW), George Best (TOTY)</li> <li>RW/RM: George Best (TOTY), Hristo Stoichkov (Birthday)</li> <li>ST/CF: Pele (Birthday), Cruyff (Golazo), Ronaldo (TOTY)</li> </ul>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via EA Sports</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="194" data-current-count="494" data-injectable="true">Some of these Icons can also be played at alternate positions. Ronaldinho, for example, will do as well as a CAM as he will at LW. Similarly, Pele can also operate as a CAM if utilized properly.</p>
 <p data-characters="270" data-current-count="270" data-injectable="false">That said, this list of the best <em>EA FC 24</em> Icons will eventually undergo some changes. The ongoing TOTS promo hasn’t featured Heroes or Icons. However, the Euro 2024 promo is rumored to be released next in Ultimate Team, and it could feature a new version of Icons.</p> <p data-characters="373" data-current-count="643" data-injectable="false">Do note that if any of the Icons mentioned here get new versions in the future, they will undoubtedly rank among the best. Most of these names on the list of best<em> EA FC 24</em> Icons are there for a reason – they perform well, have solid stats, and they’re top-tier items. Beginners and veterans can rely on them across all the different game modes and difficulties.</p>

<p data-characters="167" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Were you holding off on grabbing <em>Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth</em> until you could get its two discs marked down? Amazon has one lined up for you. How does 20-ish% off sound?</p> <p data-characters="248" data-current-count="248" data-injectable="false">Right now, you can nab <a href="https://geni.us/lhBPaA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><em>Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth</em> from the US Amazon site</a> for $54.99. I’ve checked my home and native land Canada’s site, and it’s marked down to $69.99 Canadian Loonies. It’s also discounted on Amazon in Germany and the UK.</p> <p data-characters="484" data-current-count="732" data-injectable="true">It’s a decent price for a grand and varied adventure. It’s a lot of adventure. Maybe too much. But it’s a very different sort of adventure compared to <em>Final Fantasy VII: Remake</em>. Sure, it still features the same mechanics, characters, and feel. Sure, it’s a continuation of the previous story (and the middle part of a trilogy), but both tonally and in terms of setting, it’s an entirely new ballgame. Also, there’s lots of time to appreciate Barrett. Barrett’s so great.</p>
 <p data-characters="103" data-current-count="103" data-injectable="false">Don’t take my word for it, you can also <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-final-fantasy-7-rebirth/">check out Destructoid’s own Chris Carter’s 9.5/10 review</a>.</p> <p data-characters="333" data-current-count="436" data-injectable="true">There’s no doubt this won’t be the last time you’ll be able to grab it at a discount, but if you’ve been itching to get it without completely depleting your funds, it’s a good opportunity. It probably won’t be permanently reduced for quite a while, especially with ports to other platforms that might be coming next year.</p>
 <p data-characters="140" data-current-count="140" data-injectable="false"><em>Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth</em> is currently available for PS5. Amazon doesn’t say how long the sale will go on, so you may want to jump on it.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/united-states-government-ukraine-game-jam-esports<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Disinformation is the mother of all tricky subjects. How do you counter it in a day and age when anybody can say anything and theoretically gain traction? How do you debunk something millions of people have already seen? And who even decides what constitutes “good information” in the first place? The United States government thinks games can be part of the answer.&nbsp;</p><p>In April, the US Department of State began accepting submissions for <a href="https://www.grants.gov/search-results-detail/353456" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a $1,000,000 grant</a> to help a nonprofit develop “an evergreen game in a sandbox platform, with an existing fan base, in which participants play a game that builds cognitive resilience to authoritarianism and promotes democratic norms and values.” Around the same time, the Department of State also started offering <a href="https://grants.gov/search-results-detail/353454" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a $250,000 grant</a> for a nonprofit to spin up a Ukraine-based esports program in which “athletes will receive counter disinformation/conflict resolution training to confront foreign propaganda and disinformation in competitive online gaming spaces.” While the submission period for those two grants ended on May 22, the government continues to offer $800,000 for a “<a href="https://grants.gov/search-results-detail/353831" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">United with Ukraine game jam</a>” with the goal of creating games that will “increase player skepticism of foreign propaganda and disinformation.”</p><p>These joined other recent government-backed programs that include <a href="https://grants.gov/search-results-detail/353455" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">research of</a> “the scope and scale of foreign propaganda and disinformation occurring in games and game-adjacent platforms in Eastern Europe” and <a href="https://grants.gov/search-results-detail/352956" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an experimental learning program</a> in Turkmenistan that, among other things, aims to organize a Network of Academic and Scholastic Esports Federations (NASEF) “<a href="https://www.nasef.org/farmcraft" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Farmcraft</a>” competition for students ages 10-18. This program “uses the popular game <em>Minecraft </em>to introduce the basics of agricultural science, food security and climate change.”&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>NASEF</figcaption></figure><p>These programs largely focus on Eastern Europe and especially Ukraine due to Russia’s ongoing invasion of the country, which the United States has <a href="https://www.crfb.org/blogs/congressionally-approved-ukraine-aid-totals-175-billion" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spent over $100 billion</a> in aid and military assistance to counter.</p><p>“Since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, so much of the country has been mined and menaced that it is not always safe for children to play outside. For the time being, the future of play in Ukraine will largely be indoors. One popular avenue for safe, indoor play is video games,” a State Department official told Aftermath. “The ability to communicate in games and game-adjacent spaces is an important vector for engaging with hard-to-reach audiences targeted by disinformation narratives, especially Russian youth, to advance our efforts to counter Russian disinformation and propaganda. Russia clearly already understands the power of gaming, as they have deployed their propaganda and disinformation apparatus to spread pro-Kremlin and anti-Ukraine narratives <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/30/technology/russia-propaganda-video-games.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on games</a>. These funding opportunities offer a way to empower Ukrainian storytellers, developers, and gamers to recognize propaganda and disinformation that is commonly spread through games and harness their design skills and playing abilities to effectively push back against it.”</p><figure><blockquote><p>The ability to communicate in games and game-adjacent spaces is an important vector for engaging with hard-to-reach audiences targeted by disinformation narratives, especially Russian youth, to advance our efforts to counter Russian disinformation and propaganda.</p></blockquote></figure><p>These are <a href="https://eca.state.gov/cultural-heritage-center/highlight/UnitedwithUkraine-Game-Jam" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not the first</a> games-focused grants offered by the United States government, but the official told Aftermath that they represent the “largest investment to-date in gaming and digital media literacy” on the part of the Global Engagement Center, an agency within the Department of State that <a href="https://www.state.gov/about-us-global-engagement-center-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">aims to</a> “recognize, understand, expose, and counter foreign state and non-state propaganda and disinformation efforts aimed at undermining or influencing the policies, security, or stability of the United States, its allies, and partner nations.”</p><p><a href="https://www.gamesforchange.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Games for Change</a>, a nonprofit that seeks to use games as a means of achieving social good, has worked with and received funding through the United States government for about half a decade.&nbsp;</p><p>"There have been a couple really effective people within subgroups in the State Department who've championed games, and they've been listened to,” Games for Change executive director Susanna Pollack told Aftermath. “And there's a number of opportunities that have arisen out of the championing of these kinds of opportunities."</p><p>Pollack said that some of those prior government-backed projects took place in Ukraine before Russia’s invasion, including a 2020 game design workshop on how to create “impact games” that offered Ukrainian developers access to US-based experts and culminated in a game jam, as well as an opportunity to pitch projects to potential investors. (One winning team, according to <a href="https://gamesforchange.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/G4C_Ukraine_Serious_Games_Case_Study_v3.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a case study of the event</a>, received a prize of $5,000 to support their game further, along with “$500 USD in Amazon Credits.”)&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Games for Change</figcaption></figure><p>But how effective are<em> </em>government-backed video game programs at achieving their stated goals? Connecting developers in different nations to share tricks of the trade seems straightforward enough, but what about higher-minded concepts like diplomacy and dispelling disinformation? Can games act as a means to achieve those ends?&nbsp;</p><p>The US government’s recent disinformation-related games initiatives draw on the science of “<a href="https://inoculation.science/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prebunking</a>,” which researchers like University of Cambridge professor of social psychology Sander van der Linden suggest can inoculate people against disinformation – unlike debunking, which often, well, doesn’t work.&nbsp;</p><p>"Once you're exposed to a falsehood, it settles in your memory,” Van der Linden said in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jqt7B857ooM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a Cambridge University video</a>. “It makes friends with other things that you know to be true, and people tend to retrieve false info from their memory even when they acknowledge a correction. And so prebunking – trying to preemptively protect people before that damage occurs – is much more effective than debunking."&nbsp;</p><p>The idea, then, is to preemptively expose people to a “weakened” version of false information or a demonstration of the techniques underlying it. Games from the University of Cambridge’s Social Decision-Making Lab, including the US State Department-backed <a href="https://inoculation.science/inoculation-games/harmony-square/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Harmony Square</em></a>, do this by putting players in the shoes of a malicious disinformation agent. In a fictitious setting, they ruin a peaceful, democracy-loving town by posting hyperbolic headlines and stoking online flame wars between citizens. Another State Department-backed game, <a href="https://catpark.game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Cat Park</em></a>, iterates on this idea, again casting players as a media-manipulating sower of chaos, but in a full-blown visual novel with recurring characters and a collection of app-based tools. These games hammer home a series of relatively simple lessons: emotional content over facts, lies are fine as long as they accentuate the feeling of the moment, and memes must be vaguely coherent, if nothing else.&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p>Prebunking – trying to preemptively protect people before that damage occurs – is much more effective than debunking.</p></blockquote></figure><p>These single-player games already come across as a little dated – Twitter tends to be their main point of reference when it comes to interface – and unfold in a linear fashion that sometimes feels like lecturing. They also try not to be too specifically political, opting for lighthearted fantasy scenarios to cast their nets as wide as possible. Of them, <em>Cat Park</em> is the most effective; it lets you mess around with headlines and memes, and it eventually reveals the opportunistic motivation of the forces that have been coaching you through the process of dismantling an otherwise-harmless city park for cats. The game is clear in what it’s trying to convey, where other, similar games get so bogged down in details as to become boring or overwhelming.&nbsp;</p><p>Studies of both<em> </em><a href="https://misinforeview.hks.harvard.edu/article/breaking-harmony-square-a-game-that-inoculates-against-political-misinformation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Harmony Square</em></a> and <a href="https://americanspaces.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/292/22-Cat-Park-Lesson-Plan.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Cat Park</em></a> conducted by the University of Cambridge found that players were more likely to spot disinformation after playing, with the former game leading participants to “find misinformation significantly less reliable after playing,” become “significantly more confident in their assessment” of disinformation, and come away “significantly less likely to report sharing misinformation,” while the latter game resulted in players who were “19 percentage points more likely than a control group to spot disinformation and 15 percentage points less likely to want to share disinformation.”&nbsp;</p><p>That said, these games’ focus on broad, obvious examples makes them feel ill-equipped to inoculate players against what is increasingly becoming the reality of the modern internet: misinformation and disinformation oozing from all cracks, baked not just into contentious or emotional subject matter, but seemingly innocuous memes or entertainment news, with the goal of <a href="https://aftermath.site/sweet-baby-detected-conspiracy-theory-steam" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leading you down whatever the far-right rabbit hole of the week might be</a>. At one point, another, similar game studied by the University of Cambridge, <a href="https://www.getbadnews.com/en/play" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Bad News</em></a>, balked at my decision to deem the headline “Celebrity Accused Of Inappropriate Behavior” as misleading. <a href="https://aftermath.site/its-exhausting-trying-to-read-video-game-website-headlines" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I beg to differ</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The State Department official told Aftermath that <em>Harmony Square</em> and <em>Cat Park</em> have been deployed in educational settings overseas, boasting that the former is available in 18 languages, the latter in 9, and that the two have been played “well over a half million times.” These games will function as a blueprint for more ambitious projects going forward, like the aforementioned “evergreen” game for which the Department of State recently offered $1,000,000.</p><p>“We have been extremely pleased with the success of <em>Cat Park </em>and <em>Harmony Square </em>in reaching foreign audiences, and now see an opportunity to expand this work through the wider world of online gaming overseas,” the State Department official said.&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;</em></p><figure><figcaption>Cat Park</figcaption></figure><p>Mattie Brice, an assistant professor at UC Santa Cruz’s Performance, Play, &amp; Design Department who has <a href="https://www.playistheantidote.com/work" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">helped nonprofits create games and interactive workshops</a>, has her doubts about the broader direction of some of these efforts. She believes they’re too rooted in traditional notions of what constitutes a video game. That, she thinks, will always interfere with their ability to have their desired impact, just as many attempts at so-called gamification teach people to care more about gamified systems than specific skills or subjects. (How else do you explain, for example, <a href="https://kotaku.com/duolingo-app-cheats-hacks-leagues-xp-why-duohacker-1850506482" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Duolingo’s cheating problem</a>?)</p><p>“The majority of game developers who make work for these [nonprofits and non-governmental organizations] are using entertainment product design for video games as their methodology, since frameworks on how to design games at all are relatively new and mostly stem from professional networks and the crossover between game devs and academia,” Brice told Aftermath. “This kind of game design is suited for creating conventional games, but is problematic when you apply this to work that is supposed to literally affect people, such as engaging folk with a particular stance on foreign propaganda.”</p><p>Arguably, many of these programs teeter precariously atop the knife’s edge of <em>being </em>propaganda. Who decides, after all, what constitutes disinformation or propaganda? And who benefits most from these interventions, especially when countries with spotty human rights records are involved?&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2022/07/08/game-exchange-program-games-for-change/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A recent project</a> backed by the Stevens Initiative – which is funded by the State Department and the Bezos Family Foundation, <a href="https://www.stevensinitiative.org/about-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">among others</a> – saw 450 students across the US, Israel, United Arab Emirates, and Bahrain <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2022/07/08/game-exchange-program-games-for-change/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">participate in a 10-week game design program</a> that was meant to “bring these young people from different cultures together as a way to foster communication and understanding,” according to Games for Change’s Pollack.&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p>This kind of game design is suited for creating conventional games, but is problematic when you apply this to work that is supposed to literally affect people, such as engaging folk with a particular stance on foreign propaganda.</p></blockquote></figure><p>"From a US perspective, kids had never heard of a country in which they were paired and where their peers were living, and it gave an opportunity to offer a different lens to four different cultures,” said Pollack.&nbsp;</p><p>She also mentioned that Games for Change has partnered with the US Consulate in the United Arab Emirates to run a Games for Change summit in Abu Dhabi, which is funded by the US State Department and a UAE-backed initiative called Abu Dhabi Gaming. Each year, the event welcomes over 400 developers for talks about topics like “the industry itself, about distribution, about how AI is affecting the games industry, as well as more Games For Change impact-type topics.”</p><p>Broadly, Games for Change hopes to foster diplomacy and a global game development culture, but the aforementioned locations – UAE, Bahrain, and Israel – are eyebrow-raising, to say the least. The former two are notorious for human rights violations, with UAE investing in “a strategy to paint the country as progressive, tolerant, and rights-respecting while carrying out repression against dissent” <a href="https://www.hrw.org/middle-east/north-africa/united-arab-emirates" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to Human Rights Watch</a> (on top of its contributions to the humanitarian crisis in Yemen, <a href="https://www.actionagainsthunger.org/story/after-9-years-of-conflict-yemen-is-still-one-of-the-worlds-worst-humanitarian-crises/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one of the worst of our time</a>), while Bahrain’s authoritarian monarchy, an ally of the United States, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/05/world/middleeast/bahrain-political-prisoners-freed-pardon.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">crushed a pro-democracy uprising</a> in 2011, and <a href="https://www.hrw.org/middle-east/north-africa/bahrain" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">continued</a> to torture, imprison, and kill critics of the government afterward. Israel, meanwhile, has maintained an apartheid state in Gaza for decades and, following a Hamas attack last year that claimed over 1,000 lives, has retaliated with a genocidal assault that has <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/longform/2023/10/9/israel-hamas-war-in-maps-and-charts-live-tracker" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">killed over 35,000 Palestinians</a>. It shows <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/29/world/middleeast/gaza-israel-corridor-rafah.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">no signs of stopping</a>.</p><p>UAE, like Saudi Arabia, has been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/04/arabian-fights-inside-the-ufcs-long-term-partnership-with-the-uae" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">accused of “sportswashing” its atrocities</a> – that is, buying its way onto a sanitized global stage via a popular, ethically compromised medium. Saudi Arabia’s playbook has recently expanded to include video games, with the country investing billions in <a href="https://savvygames.com/savvy-games-group-completes-acquisition-of-scopely/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">video game companies</a> and <a href="https://www.jacobwolf.report/p/saudi-statebacked-esports-world-cup-host-league-legends-tournament" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">esports</a> and – as of last week – even <a href="https://aftermath.site/rolling-stone-glixel-savvy-gaming" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">helping Rolling Stone launch a gaming vertical</a>.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Abu Dhabi Gaming</figcaption></figure><p>Despite the potential of video games and game design programs to further countries’ goals of depicting themselves as more humane than they actually are, Games for Change views itself as politically neutral.&nbsp;</p><p>"There's a game developer community in Israel and a much smaller one in <a href="https://aftermath.site/making-a-skating-game-set-in-palestine-has-become-an-act-of-resistance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Palestine</a>. There's one in Ukraine. There's one in Russia,” said Pollack. “There's a universal game developer community that we embrace, regardless of where they are, as long as they are working on games that have some positive impact on the world. That's what really unifies us as a community."</p><p>When it comes to countries with human rights abuses on their records, Pollack hopes Games for Change and other nonprofits working with the United States government can push for improvement from the inside.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>"When we think about working in regions where there are human rights issues, our perspective is that we'd like to be part of the change, and we'd like to help and encourage and empower others to be part of positive influences that could change things culturally,” she said. “So when we come in as Games For Change, we are making a point of bringing women and people of color to speak and positioning them as experts in the field. I think there's a meaningful approach to demonstrating best practices and ways in which we see this industry and how we want to encourage changes that could take place in those regions."</p><figure><blockquote><p>There's a thin line between 'spreading awareness' and propaganda for many social impact games.</p></blockquote></figure><p>Brice, however, is skeptical of this approach.</p><p>“There's a thin line between 'spreading awareness' and propaganda for many social impact games, a huge ethics problem that largely remains unsolved – or not cared about, frankly – by the nonprofit sector of games,” Brice told Aftermath. “Nonprofits that make or commission social impact games instrumentalize games rather than seeing them as a form of expression, though of course they use the aesthetics of games in order to influence people who play them, much like any game designer who is typically trying to influence the player to feel a range of emotions that is often summarized as fun. So you can see why there are not many radical activists in a space that claims to be about social change.”</p><p><em>Thanks to Aftermath subscriber CookieMom for the tip that eventually blossomed into this story.</em></p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/videos/24167860/beasts-of-balance-overboard-jenga-stacking-board-game<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="9TTLyl">A tower of precariously placed objects presents a classic board game conundrum. <em>Jenga</em> is the famous example, but <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/193042/junk-art">many others</a> <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/218129/catch-the-moon">also put dexterity</a> <a href="https://www.polygon.com/videos/23780048/tokyo-highway-table-top-board-game-overboard-lets-play">to the test</a> as players build and deconstruct towers until they inevitably fall over. <em>Beasts of Balance</em> uses that foundation to make something new: a cooperative (or competitive) building game designed around a companion tablet app and RFID reading pedestal. The result is engaging at just about any age.</p>
<p id="BB5Dus">Playing the game is simple: Just grab an artifact (as the game’s pieces are called), scan it on the plinth, and add it to the tower. You can choose from polygonal beasts like eagles and octopi, point juicing elements, or maybe a “cross” piece that combines the points and DNA of two beasts in play. The tablet app helpfully illustrates this by showing you the “hawktopus” you’ve just created, adding it to your compendium of crossbred creatures.</p>

<p id="4gy1IJ">The app works almost seamlessly and we only encountered a few hiccups getting pieces to scan. Most of the time the app integrates well into the experience, tracking your score, showing off your chimeric critters, and even adding additional building challenges. For example, you might need to keep one finger on the app while you place your artifact with your other hand (for extra points, of course).</p>
<p id="2YzlaE">The most thoughtful designs in the game are the artifacts, which are designed to be stacked, hung, and yes, <em>balanced</em> on top of each other. The animal pieces are especially fun to handle, with striking angles and soft-touch plastic. Even without the added gameplay elements of the app, the simple act of stacking pieces is immensely satisfying.</p>
<p id="szLCfK">The game can be played cooperatively, with everyone taking turns selecting artifacts and adding them to the tower. If the tower falls, players have a short time to put it back together before the game ends. Alternatively, players can go head-to-head, swiping each others’ beasts or even making them go extinct.</p>
<p id="OxdD1Y">You can see how both modes work in our Let’s Play at the top of this post.

  <p id="l0iLc1">There’s yet another new SMG in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/modern-warfare-3-guides"><em>Modern Warfare 3</em></a>, this time in the form of the <strong>Superi 46</strong>. While it’s a very solid all-rounder. the Superi 46 doesn’t immediately stand out as having best-in-class stats, but with the right attachments it can compete with some of the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/modern-warfare-3-guides/23912779/best-weapons-guns-call-of-duty-mw3">best guns</a> in the game.</p>
<p id="A6ExzC">This versatility means it can be built out to support any type of playstyle, though in our testing we’ve actually found keeping it as an all-rounder is the best option. It means you can deal with enemies up close while also taking foes down from afar after reducing the recoil and increasing the bullet velocity.</p>
<p id="UM7afK">Here’s the <strong>best Superi 46 loadout in </strong><em><strong>Modern Warfare 3</strong></em><em> </em>and details on how to get your hands on it to begin with.</p>
<hr id="awoEr8">
<h2 id="Zn4o8R"><strong>How to unlock the Superi 46 in MW3</strong></h2>
<p id="kgxUP4"><strong>To unlock the Superi 46 in </strong><em><strong>Modern Warfare 3 </strong></em><strong>Season 4, you must complete Sector 6 in the battle pass. </strong>This is over on the far left of the grid, so the quickest path there from the start is to complete Sectors 1, 2, and 4, followed by 6 above it. As always with new weapons, the Superi 46 is completely free, so you don’t need to fork out money on the battle pass. You just need to play the game enough to earn a sufficient amount of tokens.</p>

<p id="zBrRa8">Here is the <strong>best Superi 46 loadout</strong> in <em>Modern Warfare 3</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li id="c0heS4">
<strong>Barrel: </strong>Houndguard Heavy Barrel</li>
<li id="gjiWwK">
<strong>Underbarrel: </strong>FTAC RS-9 Stealth Angled Grip</li>
<li id="z4Pacx">
<strong>Optic: </strong>Holo Craft Optic</li>
<li id="U2Y507">
<strong>Stock: </strong>Rescue-9 Stock</li>
<li id="trvce5">
<strong>Rear Grip: </strong>Phantom Grip</li>
</ul>
<p id="WOBIJk">Kicking things off is the most impactful attachment here, the <strong>Houndguard Heavy Barrel</strong>. This is the attachment that will allow you to compete in long-range gunfights, as it gives a significant buff to bullet velocity and range. However, the trade-off is that it nerfs a lot of the mobility you’ll get with the Superi 46, so the rest of your loadout will need to account for that.</p>
<p id="eorLPg">The <strong>FTAC RS-9 Stealth Angled Grip</strong> may seem like a slightly unorthodox pick, but it’s for one good reason: The <a href="https://www.polygon.com/modern-warfare-3-guides/23955189/mw3-tactical-stance-tac-stance-get-use-controls">tac stance</a> spread buff. With this build, you’ll want to use the tac stance whenever fighting up close because the <strong>Holo Craft Optic</strong> is geared towards longer-range engagements.</p>
<p id="tmV8Uh">Then we have the <strong>Rescue-9 Stock</strong>, which is a huge help for some of the mobility-based offerings, including your movement speed. It also helps manage recoil, while the <strong>Phantom Grip</strong> is essential for reacting to surprise fights up close. The only downside is the nerf to your flinch resistance, so when you’re fighting at range, you’ll want to be ducking in and out of cover constantly to avoid getting hit.</p>

<p id="SOUMHo">Here is the <strong>best Superi 46 class</strong> in <em>Modern Warfare 3</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li id="7KcwXR">
<strong>Vest: </strong>Modular Assault Rig</li>
<li id="NB8wID">
<strong>Secondary: </strong>Renetti</li>
<li id="o8oCp6">
<strong>Tactical: </strong>Flash Grenade</li>
<li id="VD1Ybt">
<strong>Lethal: </strong>Frag Grenade</li>
<li id="0rjjdS">
<strong>Field Upgrade: </strong>Dead Silence</li>
<li id="Q31stu">
<strong>Gloves: </strong>Marksman Gloves</li>
<li id="yOGKum">
<strong>Boots: </strong>Stalker Boots</li>
<li id="MXzWtS">
<strong>Gear: </strong>Ghost T/V Camo</li>
</ul>
<p id="2ri9qv">The <strong>Modular Assault Rig</strong> is a vest that allows you to carry two lethal and tactical grenades, and you can have equipment in every slot. You also spawn with max ammo and you can resupply your grenades from dead players, so you’ll basically never run out, even when you’re on a streak. In the secondary slot, go for the standard <strong>Renetti</strong> because it’s so reliable. Do the same for both grenades: You can’t beat the classics, so the <strong>Flash</strong> and <strong>Frag Grenades</strong> are your best bet.</p>
<p id="qU5rQa">In the field upgrade slot, equip <strong>Dead Silence</strong>. This may seem like a slightly odd choice, but footsteps are quite loud in <em>Modern Warfare 3</em>, so making them as quiet as possible is helpful, especially with a build like this where you’ll often be flanking and moving from one position to the next.</p>
<p id="1FxScI">The <strong>Marksman Gloves</strong> assist at long range, especially in helping to regain some of that flinch resistance lost with the Phantom Grip, while the <strong>Stalker Boots</strong> improve your movement speed while strafing and aiming down the sights. Finally, much like Dead Silence, the <strong>Ghost T/V Camo</strong> assists your stealthiness as it means you can’t be seen by UAVs or enemy radar sources when you’re moving.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24167466/cuckoo-director-tilman-singer-preview-interview-hunter-schafer<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="ISa1Jd">Sam Levinson’s drama series <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22950817/euphoria-recaps-memes-social-media-internet-watch-party"><em>Euphoria</em></a> has been a spectacular launching pad for new movie stars, with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24091605/dune-2-zendaya-movie-star-best-performance">Zendaya</a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24099874/immaculate-review-sydney-sweeney-nun-movie">Sydney Sweeney</a>, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24030564/saltburn-what-happens-fandom-explained-tiktok">Jacob Elordi</a> all seeing their film careers take off after the show’s first season. Hunter Schafer is the latest <em>Euphoria</em> player heading for film stardom, with her first leading role coming up in Neon’s late-summer horror movie <em>Cuckoo</em>. Schafer plays Gretchen, an American teenager reluctantly joining her father, stepmother, and mute half-sister at a remote German resort run by a deeply creepy man (<em>The Guest</em>’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24133463/abigail-review-horror-comedy-vampires-scream">Dan Stevens</a>) whose excessively friendly front is obviously hiding some deeper motivations.</p>
<p id="E2d89T">It’s a dark, strange movie, built around a central character who’s initially hard to like, then impossible not to root for as she takes more and more physical abuse and the odds stack up against her. And given the distinct gap between how the first trailer portrays the film and what’s really going on, <em>Cuckoo</em> is likely to be a significant surprise for a lot of viewers. Avoid spoilers if you can. (You won’t find any below.)</p>

<p id="3AiTyn">Writer-director Tilman Singer, a German-born filmmaker making his second feature-length project after 2018’s horror-mystery <em>Luz</em>, told Polygon in a pre-release interview that he cast Schafer for the movie years ago, before the first season of <em>Euphoria</em> had even aired. When COVID-19 delayed his production, though, he was gratified to see her building a fan base through the series — because while <em>Cuckoo</em> is an R-rated movie, he’s stealthily hoping that younger teenagers find ways to slip into a theater and see it.</p>
<p id="TXuMqX">“We had to push [production] one more time because <em>Euphoria</em> was shooting season 2, and by then, it was super hype,” Singer said. “We knew all of that was really, really good for us. It made me happy, because first and foremost, I thought, <em>Wow, she has a </em>lot<em> of young fans, and these young people may go watch our weird movie.</em> I remember when I was a young teenager, the first really weird, strange movies I saw, that kind of overwhelmed me, that I didn’t fully understand at the time — I was so thankful that happened to me. I was fantasizing that something like that happens to other young people now, with our movie.”</p>
<p id="raL4zb">While <em>Cuckoo</em>’s initial festival run produced a number of reviews comparing it to movies like Stanley Kubrick’s <em>The Shining </em>and Ari Aster’s <em>Hereditary</em>, Singer would rather people didn’t call it “2024’s <em>Hereditary</em>” — he says he’d rather people call it “2024’s film that young people managed to sneak into and see too early.”</p>

<p id="wpGt6J">Singer looks back with a particular joy at movies that he saw “too early,” like Alex Cox’s 1984 cult movie <em>Repo Man</em>. “I love that movie,” he said. “I was, like, 14. My uncle gave it to me on VHS in English. My English was really bad. But I was into punk music, and I just watched it over and over. I had no fucking idea what was going on. The other one — around the same age, I watched David Lynch’s <em>Lost Highway</em>. And these just opened me up. So that’s a beautiful thing.”</p>
<p id="1lm7LR">He compares the sensation of this kind of formative, often illicit cult-movie experience to having your heart or brain torn open. “Sometimes, something hits you with a force, because you’re not used to hearing or seeing [anything like] that, and it just cracks open your skull,” he said. “[…] I think that’s one of the most formative and beautiful things.”</p>
<p id="9W0B7Z">Will <em>Cuckoo</em> hit young viewers that way? It’s certainly possible. Singer’s horror movie is a singular film, full of narrative surprises, an intense and emotional central performance from Schafer, a terrific mystery in Stevens’ character, and vivid images that stick in the memory long after the final shot. Singer shot <em>Cuckoo </em>on 35mm film because, as he told Polygon, he prefers the “big choices” of having to pick lighting and framing in advance for a limited number of shots over “all the little trial-and-error choices” of real-time, on-set digital manipulation. That gives the film a lush, hyper-real look that, again, may remind viewers of <em>The Shining</em>.</p>
<p id="ny6qwB">Singer is fine with the comparison — he says<em> The Shining</em> was just one of the influences pressing on him as he made <em>Cuckoo</em>, but it was certainly an influence. “I absolutely watched it a billion times,” he laughs. “Then when we were on location, scouting, and I found this large hall that we turned into our hotel reception lobby, <em>The Shining</em> just <em>washed</em> over me. I was like, ‘Oh my God, we <em>have</em> to shoot here, <em>we have to shoot here</em>!’ Our production designer was like, ‘This place is in disarray. This place will fall apart.’ And I was like, ‘We don’t even have to do anything! The patina is already there!’ They were like, ‘Yeah, we do have to do <em>one or two things</em> here.’”</p>

<p id="ve7lOE">Singer says all old hotels “always have something ominous to them,” and anything shot in an old hotel is likely to take longtime horror fans back to Kubrick’s movie. But he hopes horror fans see his other influences in <em>Cuckoo</em> as well.</p>
<p id="4SPFJS">“Especially with a movie that feels so much like it wears its influences directly, you know, on its face,” he says. “I think that’s just what I do. I tend to write really unconsciously, to tap into my subconscious and let it flow, and then later understand what [I’ve written], and form it together with the actors. With that process, it’s just like a ton of visuals and sounds and structure pours out of my head.” </p>
<p id="iRpXDF">One thing he approaches a little more consciously, though, is a conviction that horror movies need some sense of hope. “I wanted to make a horror film, or a thriller with horror elements, or however you want to call it, that is not as grim, and not as spiraling down into an absolute doomsday scenario,” he told Polygon. “I think horror is a very beautiful genre, because horror is effectively forcing you to face death, or all the incarnations of death. It could be violence, sexual violence, all of this stuff? And the only remedy to death is a form of religion.”</p>
<p id="A3XNOA">Singer was quick to clarify that he doesn’t mean organized religion: “I’m not talking about Christianity or Islam or something. I’m talking about a higher sense for humans. How to deal with death. You could call it love, you could call it music, whatever. I think <em>Cuckoo</em> has a lot of that idea — we can overcome death, or if not overcome it, just live with it. I’m not going to spoil the last shot, and it’s not that crazy if you just described it. But that very last shot for me is the essence of the whole movie.” </p>

<p>Wouldn’t it be nice to live in a world where exclusivity was eliminated altogether? When a game launches, it is released to all available systems so that everyone can enjoy the experience. Unfortunately, that’s an idealistic dream. There’s money to be made by launching a console-exclusive title. That brings us to Stellar Blade. Will Stellar Blade come to PC?</p>



<h2 id="h-is-stellar-blade-coming-to-pc">Is Stellar Blade Coming to PC?</h2>



<p>Currently, there is no confirmation or information surrounding a PC release of Stellar Blade. Of course, it’s likely to happen, as most console exclusives wind up coming to the PC, but it’s a matter of time and money. Will Sony want to port the game to another platform? Yeah, likely.</p>



<p>We suspect Stellar Blade will eventually be on Steam. Most PlayStation exclusives wind up on the Valve-owned platform; we must remain patient and show Sony that we don’t mind waiting.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-long-does-it-take-for-playstation-exclusives-to-launch-on-pc">How Long Does it Take for PlayStation Exclusives to Launch on PC?</h2>



<p>For the most part, a PlayStation-exclusive title takes approximately one to two years to launch on PC. If we look at games such as Horizon Forbidden West, it was around two years before the console exclusivity ended. That said, it took Ghost of Tsushima four years to launch on PC. </p>



<p>There is, unfortunately, no concrete window. I mean, look at Bloodborne. There’s likely more going on behind the scenes, but Bloodborne on PC is one of the most requested titles in history, but it’s still not happening.</p>



<p>We could wait two or more years before Stellar Blade comes to Steam!</p>

                <p>Ahead of the launch of The Final Shape expansion next week, Bungie has unveiled a Dungeons &amp; Dragons crossover for Destiny 2. Like previous collaborations, players will be able to don stylish armor sets inspired by the popular tabletop game franchise, including Faerûn inspired armor for all classes. The new armor sets include the Apex Draconic set for Titans, the Spectral Displacer set for Hunters, and the Flayer’s Dominion set for Warlocks. There'll also be an Owlbear Chariot, Queen of Dragons ship, the Eye Tyrant Ghost Shell, and more added to Destiny 2 when the crossover rolls out.</p><p>It's worth noting that these are purely cosmetic pieces of armor and they have no effect on your gear's stats or properties. These premium armor ornaments typically require you to spend some cash to own them and previous collaborations have been priced at 2,000 Silver, or around $20 in real-world cash. This isn't the first time Destiny 2 has crossed over with another popular franchise, as previous team-ups have seen <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-mass-effect-crossover-brings-some-stylish-n7-fashion-to-the-game/1100-6520702/" data-ref-id="1100-6520702">Mass Effect</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-adding-the-witcher-skins-with-season-of-the-wish-launch/1100-6519381/" data-ref-id="1100-6519381">The Witcher</a>, and Fortnite armor sets added to the game for a limited time.</p>

<p data-characters="270" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">I’ve always looked past <em>Call of Duty </em>Blackcell bundles, mostly because I don’t feel like breaking the bank with its paywall. But, with the release of <em>MW3</em> and <em>Warzone</em> <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/mw3-season-4-early-patch-notes-new-maps-modes-killstreaks-and-equipment-items/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 4</a>, that has since changed with the thieving abilities of the Copy and Dupe Operators.</p> <p data-characters="430" data-current-count="430" data-injectable="true">What makes them so extraordinary is their Identity Theft Finishing Move, which can steal another player’s skin and place it on to your own Operator. So, if you see someone causing havoc as <em>The Boys’</em> Homelander, you can put ’em in their place by taking and using their skin. <em>Call of Duty</em> reposted a snippet of what it looks like in action, where the player Speros copies the skin of an unfortunate <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/warzone-and-mw3-players-question-not-banning-ranked-play-cheaters-completely/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Warzone </em>player</a>.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="221" data-current-count="521" data-injectable="true">While the result of copying the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/yes-its-real-gundam-is-coming-to-call-of-duty/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Operator skins</a> is the primary show-stopper, it doesn’t hurt that the ability just looks cool. It’s as if Copy or Dupe are sucking the life out of someone, using a cloudy effect.</p>
 <p data-characters="257" data-current-count="257" data-injectable="false">The only downside is that the Blackcell Operator’s stealing technique is temporary. That means you’ll immediately lose out on the skin upon death. However, it could bring about a challenge to see how long you can last with a particular Operator.</p> <p data-characters="169" data-current-count="426" data-injectable="true">The Blackcell bundle will also still cost you, going for a price of $29.99 in the COD shop. This comes with the Season 4 Battle Pass, too, and a few more valuable gear. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="211" data-current-count="511" data-injectable="false">Despite its paywall, getting ahold of Copy and Dupe in <em>MW3</em> and <em>Warzone</em> could be worth it. You could think of it as an investment, since it gives you other exclusive skins for free, at least in a temporary sense.</p>

<p data-characters="177" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">In collaboration with Treyarch, Sledgehammer Games made substantial changes in the past two <em>Modern Warfare 3 </em>updates, which have major implications for the <em>Call of Duty League</em>. </p> <p data-characters="504" data-current-count="504" data-injectable="true">As part of the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/mw3-season-4-early-patch-notes-new-maps-modes-killstreaks-and-equipment-items/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 4 update</a>, <em>Modern Warfare 3 </em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/mw3-season-4-change-pushes-players-away-from-using-covert-sneakers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">decreased footstep sounds</a> for enemies, reworked the Hardpoint hills on 6 Star to exclude the pool point, removed exploding propane barrels on Highrise, buffed the MCW headshot multiplier, buffed Rival-9 damage ranges, and buffed the Cruise Missile damage range. Going back even further, the Trophy System was reworked in the Season 3 Reloaded update to be destroyed in two shots instead of three and the entire Boots Perk category saw a massive overhaul. </p>
 <p data-characters="384" data-current-count="384" data-injectable="false">Dexerto’s Jacob Hale <a href="https://x.com/JakeHaleee/status/1795827934571508109" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">says</a> <em>Call of Duty League </em>Major 4 will be played on the latest patch. This means all of these changes will be present in league matches starting on Friday. Previously, the <em>Call of Duty League</em> used an old patch and didn’t use the Season 3 or Season 3 Reloaded updates, and there was no guarantee that the pro players would use the latest update either. </p> <p data-characters="558" data-current-count="942" data-injectable="true">Because enemy footsteps make less noise, we will likely see professional players experiment with new Boots since Covert Sneakers eliminating footstep audio is no longer as important. And there will be plenty of options given the buffs to other Boot options in Season 3 Reloaded. In addition, it will be interesting to see how the Rival-9 and MCW changes have on SMG and AR players and how they stack up statistically against each other. Lastly, matches should flow better, given the 6 Star rotation changes, and players will die less frequently on Highrise. </p>

Treyarch has been much more active during the <em>Modern Warfare 3</em> season, keeping the viewing experience fresh and exciting. It all started in late March, as Ranked Play hosted a <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/call-of-duty-league-makes-massive-map-pool-changes-ahead-of-major-3-qualifiers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">public playtest</a> to experiment with new potential maps. </p>
 <p data-characters="381" data-current-count="381" data-injectable="false">A mix of player and professional player feedback resulted in the<em> Call of Duty League </em>adding Vista and 6 Star in place of Invasion and Skidrow. Then, Treyarch held a public playtest in Ranked Play to test out new weapons to potentially replace the Rival-9 and MCW. This trial didn’t amount to any changes, yet its still promising to see future changes aren’t ruled out. </p>
