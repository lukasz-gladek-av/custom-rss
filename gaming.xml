            <p>
If you've been itching for an excuse to get back out on the road again - by which I mean to sit in front of the computer playing <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/american-truck-simulator">American Truck Simulator</a> again - there's some good news. Developer SCS Software has announced its latest state expansion - this one providing access to the highways and byways of Missouri - launches next Thursday, 3rd April.
</p>
<p>
Missouri, if you haven't been keeping tabs, brings American Truck Simulator's current US state tally up to 17, following on from Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Oregon, Texas, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming, and Arkansas. It's not the only expansion waiting in the wings, either; SCS has also previously confirmed it's working in Illinois, Iowa, and Lousiana - although these are further out.
</p>
<p>
Back to Missouri, though, American Truck Simulator's digital rendition of the Show Me State promises "vibrant cities" - including Saint Louis and its iconic Gateway Arch - as well as "diverse and beautiful" vistas, "from the rolling Ozark hills to charming small towns and vast farmlands."

<p>
"Experience the beauty of Missouri's sunrise and sunset as you drive through this picturesque landscape," SCS writes over on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2730870/American_Truck_Simulator__Missouri/">the expansion's Steam page</a>. "New depots and underground warehouses typical for this state add depth and realism to your trucking adventures. Engage in the heartbeat of Missouri's agriculture, transporting farm produce amidst fresh crops and rural vibes. Whether you're navigating urban streets in Saint Louis or cruising through serene countryside, Missouri offers a diverse and exciting trucking experience."
</p>
<p>
Ahead of Missouri's 3rd April arrival on Steam, SCS Software has released American Truck Simulator's 1.54 update. This introduces an overhauled cargo system - which the developer says "improves efficiency [and] saves disk space and memory by eliminating the need to store countless pre-made combinations" - and there's a more intuitive truck adjustment system, making it easier to tweak your in-cabin experience.
</p>
<p>
That's on top of NVIDIA PhysX physics implementation, which promises "more precise collision detection results and more robust behaviour during scenarios involving collisions", plus Driving Academy awards, and more - as <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/270880/view/537723186574262495?l=english">detailed in SCS' patch notes</a>.

            <link>https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-severance-season-two-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/severance-season-two-stuck-the-landing.1148583/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-severance-season-two-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It’s Friday, which means there should be a fresh new episode of <em>Severance </em>waiting for you when you get home from your un-severed job. But alas, season two is over. That we’re eagerly awaiting more instead of breathing a sigh of relief is a testament to the show’s quality. Despite the weight of years’ worth of expectations, season two strode more than it stumbled. On the latest Aftermath Hours, we reflect on the highs and lows of a good TV show.</p><p>We begin the episode by briefly talking about our true passion, shirts, before elegantly segueing into a conversation about Ubisoft’s extremely eventful week: The embattled publisher announced that it’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/637775/ubisoft-tencent-carveout-assassins-creed-far-cry-tom-clancy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spinning off its most successful series</a>, including <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>, <em>Far Cry</em>, and <em>Rainbow Six</em>, into a separate subsidiary thanks to a $1.25 billion investment from Chinese conglomerate Tencent. What does this mean for those remaining aboard the Ubisoft mothership? And will this lead to even more heads rolling following layoffs and studio closures in December?&nbsp;</p><p>Then we move on to <a href="https://aftermath.site/studio-ghibli-ai-art-openai-gpt-sam-altman-is-just-the-biggest-pile-of-shit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the AI abomination of the week</a>: an image filter based on the works of Studio Ghibli, whose most famous creative, Hayao Miyazaki, once called AI “an insult to life itself.” After that, we give our final appraisal of <a href="https://aftermath.site/severance-reviews-criticism-roundups" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Severance </em>season two</a>, which was not perfect, but which managed to hit some impressive high notes and benefited from largely focusing on characters over mystery box shenanigans. Gita doesn’t love Ben Stiller’s directorial style, and Riley doesn’t think <em>Severance </em>is necessarily a Smart Show, but those things don’t prevent it from being good, if that makes sense. If it doesn’t, listen to the episode!&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, we come up with a simple solution to the problem of mass media illiteracy: change all of society. Seems like something we can knock out in a day or two, so let’s get cracking.</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can follow in the footsteps of the many, many <em>Severance </em>recap podcasts and create After-Aftermath Hours, in which we’ll provide essential commentary about our own show mere moments after it airs.</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation:</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>Why do we think the show became so zeitgeisty this season, but not during season one? Why did it become the show everyone was talking about every week this season?</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> I think we needed something, especially right now. At least there was one bright spot that I could rely on in the last ten weeks. And I think the long, long wait for it [played a role].</p><p><strong>Gita: </strong>I think that’s true. People discovered it during the three-year break, and then they realized [how good it is]. I was watching the first season week to week, so I was having the same experience everyone else had three years ago, where I was screaming, crying, throwing up waiting for each new episode of <em>Severance</em>. But I do think part of it is also, a lot of the analysis of the first show assumes it was about anticapitalist politics. I do not know if I agree with that assessment now, having seen the second season. But I do think it’s a show about alienation – about the ways we are alienated from ourselves and why we do it and what it does to us. I think that is just a very common state of being in our world, especially right now.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>I’ve trained Instagram to only show me cat videos and anticapitalist memes, and one of the memes that pops up a lot is this idea of everyone feeling alienated from what they do but not connecting the dots and recognizing that capitalism is the problem, so they just blame individual issues. They say “I hate my job” or “I hate Mondays.” I think that something like <em>Severance </em>– because it is not explicitly anticapitalist – can appeal to those people too, even the ones who are like “I would never take the name of capitalism in vain, though I do hate everything about my life.” Those people can watch <em>Severance </em>and agree with it.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gita: </strong>It is Marx’s theory of alienation for babies, in a lot of ways. The visual metaphor is so useful. I think that is really what people have latched onto: the idea that when you go to work, you are a different person, and you are not supposed to bring things from the outside world to work with you in service of the machine that you are working for. But also, that’s literally impossible. That is just not possible to do! Eventually you will reintegrate. There will be bleed-through. You’ll be dozing. It is a function of being in our modern world that makes us feel like we are separated into different pieces, and in order to be a healthy person, you have to bring those pieces together.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> I found what seems to be Lumon’s ultimate plan to be compelling in the grand scheme of all of that. It appears that what they’re trying to do is make it so that you can avoid any unpleasant moment or anything that would feel inefficient. Meanwhile, the people who are ruling over us right now are trying to make everything <a href="https://doge.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as “efficient” as possible</a>, tech bros are all about automating everything, and then we’ve got Lumon creating an innie for when you use the fucking bathroom. Getting rid of every bit of friction in your life no matter what it is. It feels like the show really called what all these people are going for.</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> The Ghibli AI stuff is an example of that. “I can be a good artist without having to do any of the work of being an artist. I can draw like Miyazaki without putting in the hundreds of thousands of hours of training that he did in order to learn how to draw like that.”</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Now we’re also starting to see the tangible downsides of that. You hear about people who’ve become reliant on ChatGPT and who suck at all those soft skills or hard skills they’ve offloaded onto it. I’ve even seen people be like “Man, not gonna lie, even typing things into ChatGPT is really hard.” That’s the end result of all of this: If you remove every last bit of friction, you wind up with a person who’s this inert blob who cannot really do anything and who is no longer a contributing member of society – or an interesting person to interact with.&nbsp;</p><p>And then at that point, why be a human? Why exist? What is the point of your life if you’ve automated all of it? Because then, you really have made the case that you should be replaced by robots – not that we all should. But you <em>have </em>replaced yourself with robots, so what are you doing here?&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/4x-game-climate-capitalism-civilization-future"><h3>Give Me A Future Worth Fighting For</h3></a><p>I want to build a better world, not live in the ruins</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/images-from-respawn-bit-reactors-star-wars-turn-based-tactics-game-have-leaked/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Ahead of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-bit-reactor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the game’s official unveiling at the upcoming Star Wars Celebration in April</a>, images from the the turn-based tactics game from Respawn Entertainment and Bit Reactor have appeared online. The XCOM influences are abundant, which is unsurprising given <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/strategy/bitreactor-has-a-star-wars-tactical-strategy-game-in-the-works-15-xcom-veterans-on-its-team-and-an-ambitious-vision-for-the-future-of-the-genre/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the number of XCOM veterans</a> at Bit Reactor.</p>







<p>The images were first <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/respawn-bit-reactors-star-wars-turn-based-tactics-game-leaked" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discovered by gaming news outlet MP1st,</a> who found the images within a Bit Reactor artist’s portfolio. The gameplay shown is reportedly dated to mid-2023, when the game went by the internal code name Bruno.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The screenshots show gameplay very reminiscent of the tactical, turn-based squad combat genre that XCOM: Enemy Unknown and XCOM 2 revitalized in the 2010s. In this kind of game, the player controls a squad of characters in turn-based combat, where each character has a limited number of actions and moves they can make. Even the iconic Mario franchise dipped its toes into the turn-based tactics genre with Mario + Rabbids: Kingdom Battle and Mario + Rabbids: Sparks of Hope.</p>



<p>The images of gameplay show the player controlling a Mandalorian character and targeting a Republic clone trooper, with a “95% hit chance” window above the enemy trooper. The window at the bottom of the screen shows a number of other combat actions the player could take, including the use of a thermal detonator (the Star Wars equivalent of a powerful grenade). Another images shows players using an ability taken straight from XCOM: overwatch. When a player activates overwatch on their turn, they wait for an enemy to move into their line of sight and fire automatically. An animated image also shows a makeshift headquarters, where the player can interact with an Armory, Holotable, Special Ops, or Black Market.</p>



<p>Respawn has been collaborating with Bit Reactor on the Star Wars tactical game project. The developers of the critically acclaimed Jedi series were previously working on a Star Wars shooter about a Mandalorian bounty hunter, before that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-mandalorian-game-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">project was canceled in February 2024</a>. </p>

              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>As pleasant as it might be for us if the world were exclusively full of nice people, that's not necessarily the right formula for an entertaining life sim video game. If all the characters in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/inzoi/" data-ref-id="5000-610765">InZoi</a> only gave each other compliments, it would get boring immediately--fortunately, that's not what InZoi is like at all. Here's a full explainer of how InZoi karma works.</p><h2 id="InZoi_karma_explained">InZoi karma explained</h2><p dir="ltr">In InZoi, you can be a good Zoi or a bad Zoi, and your behavior is reflected by your karma level. InZoi's karma is not something that has a direct parallel in The Sims 4--the closest mechanic would be its reputation system, but that's based on what other characters think of you, and this karma system is more like the game's judgment of your behavior.</p><p dir="ltr">With that being the case, it's best to think of InZoi's karma as akin to a dark side/light side meter in a Star Wars game, or the renegade/paragon system from Mass Effect. The more your karma slides one way or the other, the more options you'll have to do things that correspond with your alignment. If you have bad karma, you'll unlock new methods for being a jerk, like picking fights and shoving people to the ground for no reason. You'll even be able to start committing crimes, like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-rob-an-atm-in-inzoi/1100-6530448/" data-ref-id="1100-6530448">robbing ATMs</a>. You can <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-get-out-of-jail-in-inzoi/1100-6530449/" data-ref-id="1100-6530449">go to jail for that kind of thing</a>, though, so be careful.</p><p dir="ltr">On the flip side of that, having good karma will unlock a bunch of new friendly and encouraging interactions that will get other Zois to like you more.</p><p dir="ltr">While there's not any sort of immediate inherent consequence to having bad karma--it doesn't give you horns or anything like in Fable--there <em>is</em> a spiritual one. If your <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/inzoi-death-the-afterlife-and-ghosts-explained/1100-6530456/" data-ref-id="1100-6530456">Zoi has terrible karma when they die, they'll be forced to become a ghost</a> who roams around the world dealing with unfinished business. Unfortunately, the ghost mechanics haven't actually been added to the game yet, so we don't know how those will actually work.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="How_to_get_good_or_bad_karma_in_InZoi">How to get good or bad karma in InZoi</h2><p dir="ltr">So now you know what karma does, but we haven't discussed how you actually gain or lose it. In the abstract, obviously, the idea is mean-spirited  interactions with other Zois will make your karma worse, and nice interactions will make it better. But, more specifically, there is a section of the dialogue and interaction box in InZoi dedicated entirely to actions that will mess with your karma. It looks like this.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4467526-inzoikarmaactions.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4467526" data-ratio="0.56246759979264" data-width="1929" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4467526-inzoikarmaactions.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4467526"></a><figcaption>Choose interactions with the circular karma symbol if you want to increase or decrease your karma.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4467526-inzoikarmaactions.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">That little circular icon on those options on the right side of the image is InZoi's mark for karma, with a <strong>blue circle marking a good karma action, and a red circle marking a bad karma action</strong>. To make your karma go up, do the blue actions as much as you can. To make your karma go down, do the red actions. It's exactly that simple.</p><p dir="ltr">There are two ways you can boost the process a bit, however. The first is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-get-inzoi-donuts-and-what-they-do/1100-6530400/" data-ref-id="1100-6530400">with donuts</a>. There are a pair of karma-focused donuts you can buy using the coins you earn for achieving your life ambitions, one which resets your karma to neutral, and one that gives you very bad karma. There's no donut for getting good karma, though--you'll have to do that the hard way.</p><p dir="ltr">The second boost you can give your karma gains is in the city management menu, which has sliders that allow you to globally increase, or decrease, the rate at which all Zois' karma goes up and down. If you set that slider to the fast end, you can have your karma maxed out (or min'd out) in minutes.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Is_there_any_benefit_to_having_neutral_karma_in_InZoi_">Is there any benefit to having neutral karma in InZoi?</h2><p dir="ltr">Not that I can tell, but as you can tell by the ghost thing, this system isn't all fully fleshed out yet. It's likely that neutral options will be added in the future.</p><p dir="ltr">For much more on your new life in Krafton's life sim, don't miss our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/inzoi-guides-hub/1100-6530475/" data-ref-id="1100-6530475">InZoi guides hub</a>.</p>

            <p>
After Netflix's tentative first few years in games - which has seen it grow its mobile library, acquire studios, and dabble in triple-A development before dramatically changing course - the streamer's new gaming boss, Alain Tascan, has laid out the company's latest vision. This, he says, is less about the console model and more about phone-controlled party games.
</p>
<p>
Tascan - a 30-year industry veteran who most recently served as executive vice president of game development at Epic Games - joined Netflix last July, taking over the role from Mike Verdu, who <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/netflixs-mike-verdu-reveals-new-role-as-vp-of-genai-for-games">briefly transitioned to vice president of generative AI at Netflix</a> before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-netflix-gaming-boss-departs-following-move-to-ai-role">departing the company</a>. And with nine months at the streaming service now under his belt, Tascan recently outlined his vision for Netflix gaming at this year's GDC.
</p>
<p>
As <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/netflix-games-strategy-evokes-the">reported by The Game Business
</a>, that vision takes a four-pronged approach, focusing on narrative and transmedia projects, on big mainstream IP, on being a trusted destination for families, and on party games played on TVs using mobile phones as a controller.
</p>
<p>
The latter, as Tascan sees it, is Netflix's attempt at Wii-style industry "disruption". "I love the Wii," he told The Game Business. "I am very vigorous about lowering friction and eliminating it if we can. I see that the subscription is friction as well. Maybe good friction because it makes business sense... But the other friction is having enough controllers for family. Having a piece of hardware that might be expensive... Waiting for a game to download... I am [looking at] all the obstacles, and asking if we can reduce them as much as possible."
</p>
<p>
As such, it's perhaps not surprising to hear Tascan's dismissal of the classic console model. "[When it comes to] console, we started to look at the future where the platform is agnostic," he said. "Look at the younger generation. Are eight year-olds and 10 year-olds dreaming of owning a PlayStation 6? I am not sure. They are wanting to interact with any digital screen, whatever it is, wherever it is, even in the car. With console you're thinking about high definition, you're thinking about the controller... If we look at this older model, I think it will restrain us."
</p>
<p>
Tascan also seems unconvinced classic console-style games have much value for Netflix - which might go some way to explaining why the streaming service <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-culls-staff-at-oxenfree-developer-night-school-studio">recently culled staff at respected Oxenfree developer Night School Studio</a>, and why it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-closes-aaa-internal-studio-led-by-halo-creative-head-joseph-staten">closed its high-profile triple-A studio</a> before it could release a game last year. "Does it really need to be these super complicated RPG-style games?," he posited to The Game Business. "There is a place for them, for sure. But this for me this is what's interesting... What do we give [Netflix subscribers], and in what way, so they can enjoy and engage with [games] over and over?"
</p>
<p>
The answer to that question is, apparently, party games. "I believe we can give instant fun, using the phone controller as a very innovative controller," Tascan explained. "On every phone you have a gyroscope, you have a microphone, you have a speaker, you have a touchscreen... if you give that to creative people, what do they do? Whether you're alone, or with two people, or 20 people, why not? Can we do something really engaging?"
</p>
<p>
"We need to push the vision more than anything else and try to disrupt," he continued, "because I believe the threshold you need to hit for people to be entertained by games is very high... In terms of the disruption we can bring, distribution is one and the other is the phone as a controller. The communication between the phone and the TV. The IP. The transmedia aspect... I don't know exactly which one will work, but we have a few cards to play that are very unique."
</p>
<p>
"We have some very special competitive advantages," Tascan added. "We've just scratched the surface. For instance, for Squid Game, you watch the show and you unlock some currency in the game. But that's just the beginning. Imagine places where you watch something and then something special appears in the game, and maybe in the future you do something in the game and then you watch something – because of AI or what have you – and something happens there. We have a lot of things that we can imagine and reimagine."
</p>
<p>
No matter how Tascan's vision of mobile-driven party games, unlockable currency, and "AI or what have you" pans out, he insists Netflix is in the gaming business for the long haul. "If you look at our two co-CEOs... and look at where Netflix was 10 years ago in terms of their core business... they know the path of being stubborn, hard-working, innovating, having a vision and going after it... I believe them when they told me that gaming was important, because if [Netflix] wants to entertain the world then there's no-way around it, we need to be in games. When I look at these two leaders in particular... I believe in their full commitment."

One of these is InZoi's Ambitions system, which is essentially identical to The Sims' Aspirations. You choose an ambition, like becoming an expert artist, and then you'll have to complete a series of related tasks that award a currency that will allow you to buy upgrades. But while these systems <em>look</em> the same, in execution they actually function very differently. Here's what to know about InZoi Donuts and hoe to get more of them.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#InZoi_donuts_explained">InZoi donuts explained</a></li><li><a href="#InZoi_donut_list">InZoi donut list</a><ul><li><a href="#Donuts_that_fill_a_need_gauge">Donuts that fill a need gauge</a></li><li><a href="#Donuts_that_add__5_to_any_emotional_state_for_6_hours">Donuts that add +5 to any emotional state for 6 hours</a></li><li><a href="#Donuts_that_add__30_to_any_emotional_state_for_12_hours">Donuts that add +30 to any emotional state for 12 hours</a></li><li><a href="#Donuts_that_cause_individual_need_gauges_to_deplete_at_1_5_the_normal_rate_for_two_days">Donuts that cause individual need gauges to deplete at 1/5 the normal rate for two days</a></li><li><a href="#Donuts_that_prevent_individual_need_gauges_from_depleting_at_all_for_one_day">Donuts that prevent individual need gauges from depleting at all for one day</a></li><li><a href="#Donuts_that_completely_empty_an_individual_need_gauge">Donuts that completely empty an individual need gauge</a></li><li><a href="#Increase_individual_skill_gains_by_30__for_one_day">Increase individual skill gains by 30% for one day</a></li><li><a href="#Other_donuts">Other donuts</a></li></ul></li></ul></div><h2 id="InZoi_donuts_explained">InZoi donuts explained</h2><p dir="ltr">If you've spent time with The Sims 4 lately, InZoi's Ambitions will be very familiar. When you're creating your Zois, you pick an Ambition for each of them, and each Ambition includes three waves of tasks. If you pick the Pro Musician Ambition, you'll start by buying an instrument and playing it three times; wave two requires you to play drums ten times, and play any instrument while feeling sentimental; and wave three requires you to max out your instrument skill (all instruments fall under this one skill) and play guitar 20 times.</p><p dir="ltr">Each wave of tasks that you complete will award you with NyanCoins, with each successive wave of tasks giving more than the previous wave. And then you'll spend those NyanCoins on donuts, which you can purchase from the "Meow Coins" menu on your Zoi card. But these aren't just any donuts--these donuts come with a timed buff.</p><p dir="ltr">There are a bunch of different donuts with many different buffs. There's one that allows you to know everything about anyone you meet within the next hour. There are donuts that will prevent one of your needs from depleting for an entire day. And there are donuts that will boost your skill gains for a day as well. Unlike the aspiration rewards in The Sims, however, all of the boosts you will get from the donuts are temporary, so there's no way to, for example, permanently free yourself from the need to sleep like some dystopian military experiment.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4466051-20250326113054_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4466051" data-ratio="0.56260720411664" data-width="1749" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4466051-20250326113054_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4466051"></a><figcaption>Buying donuts can make your Zoi's life a lot easier.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4466051-20250326113054_1.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The most useful donuts may be the ones that imbue you with an emotion--it's much more difficult to complete your ambitions without them. For example, the music ambition requires you to play music while sentimental, and there's a donut that will make you sentimental for six hours. Without the donut, you might simply have to wait until you get the emotion you need naturally, and that might never happen when you actually need it. Fortunately, the emotion donuts are the cheapest available, at only 30 NyanCoins each.</p><p dir="ltr">Ambitions are not the only way to get NyanCoins, though they are by far the fastest method because they reward quite a lot if you actually finish all three stages of an Ambition. But you can also earn small amounts through more mundane methods, by completing your Zoi's wants (these are random impulses like "I want to catch a fish and eat it"), and by completing your work objectives at your job.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="InZoi_donut_list">InZoi donut list</h2><p dir="ltr">While you can pull up the list of donuts you can buy at any time, the tooltips on them frequently leave out key details, like how long the donut's effects will last, or even that they're temporary at all. Fortunately for you, you're in the right place to find out more, because below you'll find the full list of donuts as well as more detailed descriptions of what they do than you'll get from InZoi itself before you buy one, along with the price you'll pay in NyanCoins for them. If the effect is timed, the timer begins the instant you buy the donut.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Donuts_that_fill_a_need_gauge">Donuts that fill a need gauge</h3><ul><li dir="ltr">Sleep-Filling Donut - 80</li><li dir="ltr">Hunger-Filling Donut -

This adds a cinematic feeling to the mini-game and makes playerss aware of the other players and their cards, as cheating and bluffing is a major part of the game. Players can even call upon their companion to sneak around the table to peek at the cards of rival players—at the risk of being seen and subsequently placed under suspicion for the rest of the round.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/why-your-next-game-needs-a-babygirl" target="_self" data-discover="true">Why your next game needs a babygirl</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Given the nature of Kessel Sabacc and the scoundrel fantasy, it was quite appropriate to learn that the developers also played a trick on players when presenting the game. According to Siraudin, Kessel Sabacc is a 2D game, with a UI placed over the animated visuals of the scoundrels sitting at their table—all with the goal of adding a heightened sense of clarity and immersion for the mini-game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We knew that in the long run, it would benefit us [to make the pace faster] because players would be willing to engage a bit more with this activity," said Siraudin. "We talked about the game, but it's time to reveal the truth because Sabacc is actually a 2D game. Why do I say that? Because all of the gameplay and interactions you see in the game are actually on the UI layer, on top of everything else. I often said that Sabacc is truly a 2D game, which is really cool. [...] I focused on two main ideas for the UI design: the idea of it being a toy and the importance of players feeling responsive and fidgeting with it. Also, focus on clarity to create context for every choice you make."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Upon release, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Star Wars Outlaws</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> earned a lot of praise for its side activities, which included the Kessel Sabacc mini-game and its underworld experience.

"We saw many people online were trying to recreate their own setup, printing tokens and stuff like that.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-pocket-just-added-a-shiny-mewtwo-ex-card-locked-behind-a-23-paywall<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokemon TCG Pocket's recent expansion, Shining Revelry, just dropped this week. And while fans are enjoying the new line-up of shiny Pokemon cards in all the colors of the rainbow, there's one that's causing some division: a shiny Mewtwo ex card that's only available to players who pay $23 in real money.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here's what's going on: Mewtwo ex is a card that already exists in the game in several forms. It was added in the very first set, Genetic Apex, which has a "regular" version, an "immersive rare" version with Mewtwo bursting out of containment, and a "gold crown" version of Mewtwo against a gold background. All three versions have the exact same moves and power levels, so in a match, it doesn't matter which one you use. But they're all varying degrees of rare, so for those who want to "catch 'em all" so to speak, it's critical to track down all three.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Mewtwo ex in question here is another version of that same card, with the same effects. The difference is a cosmetic one: this Mewtwo ex is a "shiny", so it's green instead of pinkish, and has a different background. However, it also takes up a separate slot in your card collection in the "Promo" set of cards, meaning collectors need it if they want to 100% complete their collection.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here he is, in all his shiny glory:</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/28/screenshot-20250328-123453-1743183331940.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">A screenshot of Pokemon TCG Pocket's new Mewtwo ex card.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, the card is only available through one method: by paying $22.99 in real money for a shop bundle containing Poke Gold, a bunch of other Mewtwo-themed cosmetic items (like a coin, a playmat, etc), and the card itself. There's no other way to get it, not through packs or Wonder Pick or anything else.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some players are not reacting well to the news.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Their frustration is understandable. Pokemon TCG Pocket has been out for several months now and has gone through four different expansions of varying sizes, as well as multiple events. While players who pay real money have up til now had certain advantages in terms of how fast they can grow their collections and other cosmetic rewards, this is the first time a card has been locked behind a gold bundle paywall. What's more, it's a bundle that's worth far more than the card by itself presumably would be, as it includes other items like currency.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, some fans are rolling their eyes a bit at the controversy. Several have pointed out that the card is purely cosmetic - it doesn't do anything different from the other Mewtwo exes you can obtain, and if you don't toggle on a certain option in your settings, you can't even see it's missing from your collection. Others are pointing out that in the past, certain other promo cards have been locked behind having a Premium membership, which is itself a monthly paid subscription (albeit $12/mo, with other benefits).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Probably the biggest concern from players, though, is the slippery slope of it all. If Pokemon TCG Pocket is willing to gate a Mewtwo ex this way, will it gate other cards? What if the game eventually starts locking brand new cards with new effects behind paywalls, effectively requiring players to pay money if they want that specific effect in their decks? Even though there's no sign of that happening just yet, some are still concerned that, with time, it may.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN reached out to The Pokemon Company for comment on this change, the criticism, and the possibility of future cards being behind paywalls.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <p>
Following last week's news of a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nightdives-long-awaited-system-shock-2-remaster-finally-arrives-in-june">June release date for Nightdive Studios' long-in-the-works System Shock 2 remaster</a>, the developer's been talking about the future of the beloved series - suggesting a full-blown <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/system-shock-2">System Shock 2</a> remake could potentially also be on the cards.
</p>
<p>
A System Shock 2 remaster was initially announced back in 2019, midway through the development of Nightdive's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/system-shock">System Shock</a> 1 remake. And while the remake's road to release was a rocky one, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/system-shock-review-shodan-steals-the-show-in-this-faithful-remake">end result was very positively received</a> - to the point there's now enthusiasm for fully fledged System Shock 2 remake too. Something Nightdive's well aware of.
</p>
<p>
"I've been asked twice earlier today why we didn’t do a remake," Nightdive director of business development Larry Kuperman <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nightdive-offers-hopeful-update-on-system-shock-3s-future/">told VGC in a recent interview</a>. "And I said, 'Are you somehow under the impression that because we do a remaster that we won't be able to do a remake in the future?'" Kuperman's comments could, of course, be easily dismissed as purely hypothetical, if he hadn't then added, "That might be something that I can either confirm or deny. But there's going to be content coming out."

<figcaption>Here's a look at Nightdive's upcoming System Shock 2 remaster.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEY0utFag38" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
What that "content" might be is unclear, but given Nightdive owns the rights to the System Shock franchise, it's technically free to build on the games however it pleases. Where things get murkier, however, is the situation surrounding the series away from System Shock 1 &amp; 2. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/system-shock-3">System Shock 3</a>, for instance, is currently in limbo, with the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nightdive-studios-says-the-fate-of-a-third-system-shock-game-lies-in-tencents-hands">rights to the game now with Tencent</a> following a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warren-spectors-otherside-studio-hasnt-worked-on-system-shock-3-since-2019">complicated series of events</a> that saw the project fall off the rails.
</p>
<p>
Speaking to VGC, Kuperman acknowledged the "situation around System Shock 3 is very complicated", but suggested there might be some clarification on the project "potentially within a year... or it could take longer". But regardless of how System Shock 3 plays out, Kuperman confirmed Nightdive still has "visions of what we can do within what we control".
</p>
<p>
"We'll see what happens," he added. "I mean, there's stuff that we can do within the first and the second [games]." Which does, of course, brings us full circle, back to a potential System Shock 2 remake, or some unspecified new "content" for the first two titles at the very least.
</p>
<p>
Before all that, though, there's Nightdive's System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster. This long-in-the-works spruce-up of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bioshock">BioShock</a> developer Irrational Games' critically acclaimed 1999 FPS/RPG sci-fi horror hybrid promises enhancements to characters, weapon models, textures, cinematics, and animations. That's alongside quality of life improvements, optimised controller support, updated co-op multiplayer, and achievements - all of which players can experience when the remaster launches for PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC on 26th June.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/tech/638729/lenovo-legion-go-s-steamos-price-increase<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338028/lenovo-legion-go-s-steam-windows">SteamOS-powered version of Lenovo’s Legion Go S</a> handheld gaming PC debuted at CES 2025 with a somewhat attractive $499.99 price tag. At that price, <em>The Verge</em>’s Sean Hollister considered it a true Steam Deck rival, wedged neatly between the cost of Valve’s $399 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23513517/steam-deck-long-term-test-valve">LCD</a> and $549 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23951655/steam-deck-oled-review">OLED</a> models. The handheld recently went up for <a rel="sponsored" href="https://howl.link/ece286x5lo0wy">preorder at Best Buy</a> with a higher $549.99 price (and a May 25th release date), and Lenovo communications director Jeff Witt confirmed to <em>The Verge</em> that this is the new cost for the base model.</p><p>What’s done is done, I suppose, but the $499.99 price seemed right for the Legion Go S. Despite its perks over both the Steam Deck LCD and OLED models (Hall effect joysticks, a larger 8-inch screen with variable refresh rate, a cozy design, adjustable triggers), its Ryzen Z2 Go chip didn’t blow us away. In fact, the Windows-based Go S models that Sean and I tested were outperformed by the Steam Deck. Simply swapping the OS will cure some headaches (mainly, that Windows on handhelds is an atrocious experience), but it’s unclear whether it will somehow let the Z2 Go do more.</p><p>A $50 price jump probably won’t spell failure for this device, but it makes the arrival of the first third-party SteamOS handheld a little less exciting. It’s not the only third-party handheld getting SteamOS this year; Valve confirmed it’s working on adding support for the Asus ROG Ally. Pierre-Loup Griffais, one of the lead designers of SteamOS and the Steam Deck, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338405/valve-steamos-beta-other-handhelds-beyond-steam-deck">shared with <em>The Verge</em></a> at CES 2025 that a beta experience will “ship after March sometime.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It’s a taste, a teaser of what’s to come, what with his ability to smash through doors and gates, lift enemies off the ground, and slam opponents like paper dolls. But once you unlock more of Yasuke’s best early game skills in<em> Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em>, you’ll find you don’t want to return to Naoe.

Developed by Build A Rocket Boy Games, a new story trailer shows off the game’s setting, Redrock City, and provides a glimpse into the story and antagonists.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Redrock City, a fictional desert metropolis ruled by AI, consumer-grade robots, and other cutting-edge technology, is the stage for protagonist Jacob Diaz. He’s a former soldier carrying the MindsEye, a neural implant plaguing him with mysterious memories from a life-changing mission. His fight to find the truth pits him against both the government and Big Tech, namely Redrock mayor Shiva Vega, who may be a little too eager to establish complete control in her city, and Marco Silva, an eccentric tech CEO with big plans for altering the course of human evolution. Check out the trailer below.&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oprmuMXtfAo" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>MindsEye first became known as part of <a href="https://gameinformer.com/gamescom-2022/2022/08/23/heres-the-first-look-at-everywhere-led-by-ex-rockstar-producer-leslie">Everywhere</a>, Build A Rocket Boy’s yet-to-be-released game-making platform first announced in 2022. Last October, the studio announced a publishing partnership with IOI Partners, the publishing arm of Hitman developer IO Interactive, for MindsEye. The title was formally revealed during the PlayStation State of Play in February.</p>

<p>Build A Rocket Boy tells <em><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-new-thriller-from-former-gta-producer-and-hitman-publisher-gets-release-date">Eurogamer</a></em> that while MindsEye can be accessed through Everywhere, it will be available as a standalone title. You can purchase it on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC for $59.99.</p>

		<p>The live-action film adaptation of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/11/08/the-legend-of-zelda-to-be-turned-in-to-a-film-developed-by-shigeru-miyamoto/">The Legend of Zelda</a> will debut in cinemas on 26th March 2027, Nintendo and production partner Sony Pictures have announced.</p>
<p>The news came via Nintendo’s freshly launched Nintendo Today news app, which was released during yesterday’s Nintendo Direct stream with the promise of daily news, game tidbits and other niceties. Just so long as you’ve signed in with a Nintendo Account.</p>


<p>The movie is a collaboration between legendary game creator Shigeru Miyamoto and renowned film producer Avi Arad – he led Marvel back from bankruptcy in the mid 90’s pushing licensing deals for film and television, prior to the company’s sale to Disney, and has continued to have producer credits on Sony’s extended Spider-Man universe of films, while Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes and The Maze Runner trilogy’s Wes Ball is on board as director.</p>
<p>Announcing the project in late 2023, Miyamoto said on social media, “I have been working on the live-action film of The Legend of Zelda for many years now with Avi Arad-san, who has produced many mega hit films.</p>
<p>“I have asked Avi-san to produce this film with me, and we have now officially started the development of the film with Nintendo itself heavily involved in the production. It will take time until its completion, but I hope you look forward to seeing it.”</p>

<p>Given that the Super Mario Bros. movie made $1.36 billion worldwide at the box office when it was released it is no surprise that Nintendo are turning The Legend Of Zelda into a film as well, though it’s likely to have a rather different audience. Even with a release date, there’s still a huge amount that we don’t know about the film’s production, such as who’s even being cast in the film, but being live action, it’s going to be difficult to shoehorn Chris Pratt in as Link or Zelda. Maybe he’ll be a Goron?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/bushido-passing-night-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When a Daimyo dies, his closest protectors must escort their remains to a sacred lake, with the citizens of the Isles making their forgiveness or blame known to the retainers along the route. As 4 veteran Prefecture of Ryu samurai make this journey, we&nbsp;check out this shamed procession from the Passing the Night themed warband box for <em>Bushido</em>.</p>

<p>We've been covering <em>Bushido&nbsp;</em>for years, so if you'd like to learn more about the game, check out <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/guides/bushido-risen-sun-guide" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">our guide to <em>Bushido Risen Sun</em></a>, our <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/bushido-two-player-starter-set-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">review of the <em>Bushido Risen Sun</em>&nbsp;2-player starter set</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/start-collecting-bushido-risen-sun-part-1-introduction-and-developer-interview" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">our "Start Collecting" guide to <em>Bushido</em></a>, which includes an interview with the game's developer.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/Inari%27s%20Judgement%20%281%29.jpg?itok=HIZRB8L7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/Inari%27s%20Judgement%20%281%29.jpg?itok=NZXYfWyT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Thematically Themed</h2>

<p>When selecting a warband in <em>Bushido</em>, you must first choose a faction from the 13 available to select your fighters from. Each faction also has access to theme cards, which offer special abilities but restrict the units that can be included in the warband. The Prefecture of Ryu are a faction for <em>Bushido</em>, and Passing the Night is a theme card, that restricts you to Samurai and Shisai from the Prefecture of Ryu clan, and Ronin Shisai, but allows you to select some powerful fighters that we'll talk about below, who can only be taken with the use of the Passing the Night theme card.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/passing-the-night-1.jpg?itok=eGTuTpKK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/passing-the-night-1.jpg?itok=FOVfIBaz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Shame!</h2>

<p>When a Daimyo dies, his closest protectors must escort their remains to the Shrine of the Heavenly Gate, which sits in the middle of a sacred lake. Along the route, citizens offer prayer or place a bloodied stone in the bag of the retainer they deem responsible for their Daimyo's death. Once at the lake, they are required to swim to the island wearing their armor and carrying the stones in their bag. If they survive the swim, they remain at the shrine with their lord's remains. If they don't, they are absolved in death.</p>

<p>This march is an old tradition, and rarely enforced, but Hiro, son of the slain lord, has ordered that 4 senior samurai take the march, for which he has accompanied them. Is Hiro simply a loyal and devoted son, or does this march have a political motive behind it? Along with the samurai seeking absolution, other retainers also join. These are Priests, professional mourners, and family members who make up the procession and can join the warband.</p>

<p>Passing the Night is a new themed warband for <em>Bushido</em>, and playing their theme card restricts you to certain fighter types, but allows you to make the most of the shame mechanic. 6 of the 7 models in this box can only be used when playing with the Passing the Night theme, so you won't see them outside this theme card. The theme card allows your opponent to put a shame counter on a number of your models equal to the round number each turn, which can then be removed to power your warriors abilities.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/passing-the-night-4.jpg?itok=vBGgpUAa 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/passing-the-night-4.jpg?itok=5kIXBhr3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Hida's Last Command</h2>

<p>The Passing of the Night theme card has an insanely thematic set of mechanics that make them a joy to play. The theme card means that while a friendly samurai doesn't have a shame counter, their Melee Boost is set to 2 (from 3 for the 4 boxed samurai, which, as they generate 2 ki a turn, means they could boost their melee stat every turn), they also gain +1 to melee weapon strength, they gain +1 to their ki stat for tests and finally they lose slow. These bonus affect any samurai that you take in your warband, but losing slow is of particular note for the 4 samurai that come in the themed box.</p>

<p>The 4 Passing the Night samurai, Yoshimi, Takanibu, Nagisa, and Kasu, all have slow on their stat cards (along with unstable), to represent them being weighed down with the stones they carry (and also the burden of their shame), so losing that when they don't carry shame counters makes them able to engage in combat quicker, which they do extremely well.</p>

<p>Each turn, however, your opponent gets to place a number of shame counters on your samurai depending on the turn number. The 4 Passing the Night samurai have abilities that require a shame counter to be discarded to use, so you actually want them on your samurai at certain points, but other Prefecture samurai don't have those abilities, so gaining them means they lose the theme bonuses, and can't remove the tokens themselves. Helpfully though, the rest of the warband have some support characters that can deal with that.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/passing-the-night-3.jpg?itok=RDRUo-bm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/passing-the-night-3.jpg?itok=JT-hEK8s 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>There are 3 support characters in the Passing the Night box, and another 2 also available. In the box you get Ton, who carries bags of the shame stones that are given to the samurai, and can transfer shame tokens between others and themselves as a ki feat. While Ton has a shame token though, you can't score scenario points or take scenario actions, so you need to manage the transfer of tokens carefully during your turn.</p>

<p>The other 2 support fighters are Bairei, who carries incense to purify the procession, and has the ability to heal nearby models, but the ki spent is hampered by the number of shame tokens your warband currently has. The final support unit in the box is Takashi Hida, carrying the remains and the name of the late daimyo. Hida reduces the cost of ki feats for nearby samurai with no shame counters, so you'll want to keep them close to your samurai, but if Hida takes damage in melee, all friendly models gain a shame counter, and if Hida is removed from play, then shame tokens can't be removed for the rest of the game, which impacts the bonuses from the theme card, and those you get from the abilities that remove shame tokens.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/passing-the-night-2.jpg?itok=B0UwSpxE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/passing-the-night-2.jpg?itok=2I9-3-M1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Sacrifice For Retribution</h2>

<p>The Passing the Night samurai are absolute monsters in combat, but that doesn't make them easy to pilot. The sequence you activate your models is integral to their use. Knowing when and whom to remove shame tokens from can be the difference between your fighters taking out enemies in a single hit, or failing to even reach them in combat.</p>

<p>Your opponent also gets a say, being able to place the shame counters each turn on your models, but it's not an easy decision for them. Do they put them on fighters that are close to engaging their warriors in order to slow them down, but also letting them power up their abilities, or do they put them on your support models, or fighters that can't engage, but leave some very powerful fighters able to engage at will?</p>

<p>The balance of support units is also very important, and it might be tempting to just load up your warband with heavy hitting samurai (and you should absolutely try this once), you can add in the 2 Mourners that are releasing alongside this pack, who have, amongst other abilities, the abilities to grant a virtue token to a friendly model at the start of the game, of which their use plays into the other Passing the Night support models. Or you could bring in models from the wider Prefecture of Ryu, like the Dragon Shrine Samurai, Kizoko and Ryuko, who also play into the virtue tokens and boosting mechanics, as well as being powerful and armored samurai in their own right.</p>

<p>As a Shiho player (and more than occasional ninja), it saddens me that the Passing the Night theme (as part of the Prefecture of Ryu, the moral enemies of the Shiho) is probably going to be my chosen faction for a while. They are both fantastically powerful, and frustratingly often blocked by your opponent, with agency of where that power sits split between both of you. The tactical activation sequencing is incredibly rewarding when it pays off, and they are absolute beasts in combat. The awesome thematic mechanics, which are usually what please me most, are just a bonus to a deep and inspired bit of design work by GCT Studios.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/tv/638323/apple-tv-plus-side-quest-ashly-burch-john-howell-harris-katie-mcelhenney<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Halfway through its first season, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/7/21128489/mythic-quest-ravens-banquet-review-apple-tv">Apple’s <em>Mythic Quest</em></a> threw a wild curveball with “A Dark Quiet Death” — an unexpectedly dramatic episode that chronicled the rise and fall of another video game development team. “<a href="https://decider.com/2020/02/10/mythic-quest-a-dark-quiet-death-interview/">A Dark Quiet Death</a>” was the first instance of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tv-reviews/24350444/mythic-quest-season-4-review-apple-tv-plus"><em>Mythic Quest </em>switching up its comedic formula</a> to tell an earnest story about what makes people fall in love with games. And since then, every season of <em>Mythic Quest </em>has featured a backstory episode that felt emblematic of the series’ narrative strengths.</p><p><em>Side Quest</em>, Apple TV Plus’ new <em>Mythic Quest </em>spinoff miniseries, feels a lot like a collection of “A Dark Quiet Death”-style episodes as it introduces a slew of new characters (and brings back a couple of veterans) whose lives have all been touched by one of the world’s most popular games. When I recently spoke with <em>Side Quest</em>’s co-creators, Ashly Burch, John Howell Harris, and Katie McElhenney, they told me that the new show’s stylistic similarities to <em>Mythic Quest</em>’s forays into the past were entirely intentional. But after years of focusing on characters who see themselves as larger-than-life gods, the <em>Side Quest </em>team was much more interested in telling stories about the players who made <em>Mythic Quest </em>a hit.</p><p>“When we first started writing <em>Mythic Quest</em>, we talked about how these characters are sort of like gods who are creating this virtual world,” Burch said. “So if the people within Mythic Quest HQ are the gods, then <em>Side Quest </em>is about the mortals that are being affected by the choices of the gods.”</p><p><em>Side Quest </em>wanders further and further away from Ian Grimm (Rob McElhenney) and everyone else working at Mythic Quest Studios over the course of its four-episode-long season. But the series actually kicks off with an episode revolving around the game’s art director, Phil Birch (Derek Waters), as he tries to make some time for a vacation with his girlfriend Maude (Anna Konkle). Even though working directly on <em>Mythic Quest </em>(the game) might make its fans see Phil as one of the game’s gods, Burch felt that his history of being exploited by his colleagues made him the perfect mortal to open the show.</p><p>“We wanted to lead with a transitional landing pad between <em>Mythic Quest</em> prime and<em> Side Quest</em>, and we thought that Phil, bless him, is a very good encapsulation of the choices<em> Mythic Quest</em>’s main characters have been making,” Burch explained. “From seasons 2–3, Phil is probably treated like the office toilet more than any other character, and he’s just at the whims of these deranged creatives.”</p><p>All of <em>Side Quest</em>’s characters have some sort of relationship with <em>Mythic Quest</em>, but the co-creators saw the show as an opportunity to explore different kinds of audiences that can gravitate toward popular pieces of IP as they expand into different mediums. At this point in the game’s existence, <em>Mythic Quest </em>has been adapted into a hit comic series that stores like the one featured in “Pull List” can barely manage to keep in stock. And while <em>Mythic Quest </em>employees like Phil might be desperate to get away from the franchise, Harris noted that there are countless people who are desperate to become part of it, like the professional musicians featured in <em>Side Quest</em>’s <em>Tár</em>-like episode, “Fugue.”</p><p>“At one point, it was news to me that the music from games like <em>Zelda</em> and <em>Final Fantasy</em> goes on tour all around the world to be played by full orchestras in concert halls and theaters packed full of people,” Harris said. “I was fascinated by how popular these concerts are, but also the level of musicianship required to play at that level in such a competitive environment.”</p><p>The season comes full circle in “The Last Raid,” an episode <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/633884/mythic-quest-side-quest-the-last-raid">set almost entirely within <em>Mythic Quest </em>(the game)</a>, as a group of teens log on together hoping to take on some powerful bosses only to realize that their real-world friendships are running low on HP. Burch said “The Last Raid” was born, in part, out of the team’s love for classic machinima series like <em>Red vs. Blue</em>. But the idea of taking viewers inside of <em>Mythic Quest </em>also struck them as the perfect way to illustrate how both the game and the larger brand have transformed in response to what’s been going on behind the scenes.</p><p>“Part of what’s interesting about ‘The Last Raid’ is the way you kind of see that <em>Mythic Quest</em>, the game, is changing because the brand is also expanding,” McElhenney said. “It almost feels like this group of kids is playing a throwback version of <em>Mythic Quest</em>. <em>World of Warcraft</em> is a good analogue because it’s a similar situation where you have a game that has a rabid fan base of people who are loyal to it even though it’s not necessarily being updated and maintained.”</p><p>Though <em>Side Quest </em>drops a couple of hints about how <em>Mythic Quest </em>might change after its season 4 finale, the team’s biggest goal with the spinoff was to leave viewers guessing about which kinds of new perspectives they’d be seeing this world from next. And that meant leaning into the tonal flexibility the original series has become known for by veering off the beaten path.</p><p>“I feel like that’s how it was with <em>Mythic Quest</em>’s departure episodes — especially in season 1 when no one was expecting them,” McElhenney said. “Shows just don’t do that kind of thing usually, but because <em>Mythic Quest</em> prime was able to take that leap, we had more creative freedom with<em> Side Quest</em> to embrace the anthology model and make every episode feel completely different.”</p><p>All four episodes of <em>Side Quest </em>are now streaming on Apple TV Plus.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>InZOI officially released in Early Access on Friday and one of the first viral experiences making the rounds was the fact that the game allowed players to run over children. According to the game’s developers, however, this isn’t supposed to be the case.</p>



<p>In a message sent to Insider Gaming, a Krafton representative said that it was caused by a “unintended bug” that has since been resolved.</p>

<p>“This issue was caused by an unintended bug that has been resolved in the latest patch,” the representative said. “These depictions are highly inappropriate and do not reflect the intent and values of inZOI. We understand the seriousness of this matter and age-appropriate content and we are strengthening our internal review processes to prevent similar incidents in the future.”</p>
