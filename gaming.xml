                <p>Square Enix, in partnership with Lightspeed Studios, has officially announced Final Fantasy XIV Mobile, a mobile adaptation of the popular MMORPG <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/final-fantasy-xiv-online/">Final Fantasy XIV Online</a>. The game will first launch in China, with a global release planned shortly afterward.</p><p>The mobile version of the game was unveiled in a new trailer, and aims to bring the expansive world of Eorzea to players on smartphones and tablets, offering a mobile-friendly experience that preserves the key elements of the original game.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1vk2A--ZbY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/n1vk2A--ZbY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>According to a press release announcing the game, Final Fantasy XIV Mobile will retain many of the features that have made the original game a success, including the story-driven content and combat, along with non-combat systems like crafting, gathering, and mini-games. The mobile version will also feature low-pressure minigames such as fishing, Chocobo racing, and the Triple Triad card game.</p><p>Naoki Yoshida, the producer and director of Final Fantasy XIV, noted that the mobile version will serve as a "sister" to the original game, recreating the story and combat mechanics on mobile devices.</p><p>"It has been 11 years since FFXIV 2.0: A Realm Reborn launched, and this new mobile game will be a sister to FFXIV, aiming to recreate the grandeur of the original's story and combat mechanics on mobile devices," Yoshida explained. "Non-combat features, such as Disciples of the Land and Hand, will also be faithfully implemented and we look forward to growing alongside the passionate FFXIV community."</p><p>To ensure a high-quality experience on mobile, Final Fantasy XIV Mobile will feature visuals optimized for smaller screens, while retaining the detailed art and design that characterizes the original game. Square Enix says the mobile game will include dynamic weather systems with over 600 weather patterns, and the visuals will be adapted to maintain the level of detail found in the original FFXIV, from character models to environmental designs.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4402356-ff14.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4402356" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4402356-ff14.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4402356"></a><figcaption>FFXIV Mobile includes a number of features found in the non-mobile version of the game.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4402356-ff14.jpg"></figure><p>The social aspects of Final Fantasy XIV will also be preserved in the mobile version. The game will offer a low-pressure environment for players to interact with others, focusing on meaningful, voluntary engagements. Whether it's joining a party for a dungeon or interacting with other players during casual activities, FFXIV Mobile aims to replicate the community-driven experience of the original game.</p><p>Final Fantasy XIV Mobile will soon be available for playtesting in China, with a global launch scheduled for a later date, which Square Enix has not yet shared publicly. Players can pre-register for the game on the <a href="http://www.ffxivmobile.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">official website</a> and receive updates through various social media channels, including Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok.</p>

This AI model could allow computers and robots to understand and interact with the world in new ways, the company said in a blog post <a href="https://www.garbageday.email/p/right-wing-social-networks-don-t-work">spotted by <em>Garbage Day</em></a>.</p><p>The LGM’s “spatial intelligence” is built on the neural networks developed as part of Niantic’s Visual Positioning System. The blog post explains that “Over the past five years, Niantic has focused on building our Visual Positioning System (VPS), which uses a single image from a phone to determine its position and orientation using a 3D map built from people scanning interesting locations in our games and Scaniverse,” and “This data is unique because it is taken from a pedestrian perspective and includes places inaccessible to cars.”</p><p>Niantic Chief Scientist Victor Prisacariu was more explicit in a <a href="https://nianticlabs.com/news/q-and-a-with-victor-prisacariu?hl=en">2022 Q&amp;A</a>, saying, “Using the data our users upload when playing games like <em>Ingress</em> and<em> Pokémon Go</em>, we built high-fidelity 3D maps of the world, which include both 3D geometry (or the shape of things) and semantic understanding (what stuff in the map is, such as the ground, sky, trees, etc).”</p><p>As <em>404 Media</em> points out, nobody who downloaded <em>Pokémon Go</em> in 2016 could have predicted their data would “one day fuel this type of AI product.” </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It's update time for the PlayStation Portal, and Sony's latest release offers something markedly more exciting than usual: cloud streaming is coming to the handheld device if you're a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plus-games-list-premium-extra-this-month-6300">PlayStation Plus Premium</a> member, albeit initially as a beta.
</p>
<p>
Since its launch last year, the £200 PlayStation Portal - a PS5 peripheral rather than a standalone device - has enabled owners to stream games from their console to the smaller 1080p screen, with Sony pitching it as a way to share a living room TV or play PS5 games in another room of the house. Its uses were somewhat limited then, but Sony's latest update marks the great untethering, enabling PlayStation Plus Premium subscribers to play "select PS5 games" from the PS Plus Game Catalogue via the cloud, even without a PS5.
</p>
<p>
As per <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/11/19/the-playstation-portal-remote-player-experience-to-evolve-with-new-system-update/">Sony's announcement post</a>, over 120 games will be supported during the beta, including <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dave-the-diver">Dave the Diver</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghost-of-tsushima">Ghost of Tsushima</a>, Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-rise">Monster Hunter Rise</a>, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ratchet-clank-rift-apart">Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart</a>. Games can be streamed at up to 1080p/60fps (requiring a minimum internet connection of 13 Mbps) with major DualSense wireless controller features supported alongside cloud-based saves.

<p>
"Since Cloud Streaming (Beta) on PS Portal is still an experimental offering," Sony notes, "the features available during the beta period may change over time and may not reflect the final experience." Game Trials, the ability to stream games purchased on the PS Store, system features such as Party voice chat and game invites for select games, the Create button, 3D audio, and in-game commerce are all unavailable at these "beginning stages of publicly testing", for instance. Furthermore, players will initially only have access to PS5 games, with PS4 and PS3 games remaining unsupported for the time being. 
</p><p>
Once the beta is available, it can be accessed via an updated PS Portal by going to Quick Menu &gt; Settings &gt; Cloud Streaming (Beta), and then turning the toggle to 'on'. And if that all goes as planned, players should then see a new option on their PS Portal home screen enabling them to access games via cloud streaming. Alongside cloud streaming, Sony's latest PlayStation Portal update - which is available from today - introduces various "refinements in the audio experience", as <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/11/19/the-playstation-portal-remote-player-experience-to-evolve-with-new-system-update/">detailed on the PlayStation Blog</a>.
</p>
<p>
Digital Foundry's Richard Leadbetter <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2023-playstation-portal-review-impressive-hardware-but-is-remote-play-itself-good-enough">called the PlayStation Portal</a> an "interesting gadget" when it launched last year, despite the sense "Remote Play itself isn't as good as it should be." Richard also explicitly called out the lack of cloud streaming support on the device, so it'll be interesting to see Digital Foundry's response to Sony's latest news.

Though that means the game isn't complete yet, it very quickly wears its Zelda inspiraitons on its sleeve thanks to the way you explore its fantastical open world often with a glider, can climb any surface, manage your stamina, and fight enemies with weapons that degrade. It's also inspired by Ghibli movies and features a former Ghibli artist on the development team. But it uses those major touchstones to present its big idea: a survival-crafting game that operates <em>in reverse</em>.</p><p>Most games of this sort--tree-punchers, I affectionately call them--task players with tearing down a local ecosystem to convert flora and fauna into homes and meals, eventually wiping out the natural landscape in favor of something that may be beautiful in its own way, but definitely paves over the world that was once on display.</p><p>Towers of Aghasba <em>does </em>ask you to pick apart some local resources to improve your own conditions, like making tools from trees and stones early on, but it's all done in service of nature, as you restore a brownish, barren landscape to a lush, healthy world full of critters and immaculate natural landmarks. In that way, it's almost like Spore, too, as you bring life to what is essentially a blank slate when you arrive.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j76LZRBEQ4I" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/j76LZRBEQ4I" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>If the typical survival-crafting gameplay loop has you ready for something different, you can check out Towers of Aghasba for yourself in the launch trailer or find it on PC and PS5 starting today.</p><p>As it's an early access game, the developers have already laid out a lengthy roadmap planned well into the future, so players jumping in now can come to expect these future updates. You can check out those updates below, which include features such as new regions to explore, photo mode, more quests and NPCs, and weather effects with which you'll need to contend. The game is currently planned to be in early access until at least sometime in 2026, and playing a game early often affords early adopters a chance to help shape it in ways big or small.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4402363-unnamed%2810%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4402363" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2048" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4402363-unnamed%2810%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4402363"></a><figcaption>Towers of Aghasba roadmap</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4402363-unnamed%2810%29.jpg"></figure><p>Towers of Aghasba is available now on PC and PS5. </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/reject-modernity-embrace-tradition-in-football.1040187/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/ajax-badge-crest-logo-new<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ajax, the most famous and successful club in Dutch football, have this week changed their logo (usually called a badge or crest in football) for the first time since 1991. The old one--a stylised depiction of the Greek hero Ajax made up of 11 individual lines to symbolise the 11 players on the field, and which you can see above--was great, so the news that the club was replacing it was enough to send a chill through the spines of fans the world over.</p><p>Why? Because over the last decade or two a number of proud, old football clubs across Europe have changed their badges, <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/features/why-football-logos-changing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">swapping out storied and traditional branding for minimalist logos that look more like insurance companies</a>. I'm not here to armchair the entire field of graphic design; companies and organisations and even countries always need a new look from time to time. But in the world of football, nearly every single one of these rebrands has ended up being a downgrade for reasons far beyond the visual.</p><figure><figcaption>Juventus' old badge (left) looked like an Italian football club. Their new one, on the right, looks like someone asked an AI to draw them a picture of a failed esports league.</figcaption></figure><p>This creates problems! Fans are often unhappy at <em>any </em>change to their traditions, let alone ones inspired by things like "modernity" and "commercial interests", but some of these attempts--<a href="https://www.dezeen.com/2017/01/17/juventus-football-club-faces-fan-uprising-after-minimalist-new-logo-graphics-design/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Juventus' in particular</a>--made people <em>really </em>unhappy. Sometimes fans get so unhappy that, <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/2018/01/30/leeds-united-scrap-redesigned-crest-launch-search-new-design/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in cases like Leeds in 2018</a>, the club is forced to scarp the redesign altogether.</p><p>For another example <a href="https://aftermath.site/aston-villa-fifa-pes-pro-evo-efootball-avfc-ecl-champions-league" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">closer to my own heart</a>, Aston Villa have been through three badges in three seasons (below) after the one on the left was replaced by the one in the middle, supposedly after fan consultation, but fans didn't really like it (and everyone else said <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chelseafc/comments/14g6zbv/new_aston_villa_badge_looks_a_bit_familiar/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it looked too much like Chelsea</a>), so for this season it was changed <em>again </em>by...basically reverting to the older one and just making a few border changes.</p><figure></figure><p>So you can't blame other clubs, like Bayern Munich (below), from being so adverse to any radical changes that when it comes time to modernise their badge they simply make the slightest tweak imaginable (in this case just a few colour changes, which depending on the screen you're reading this on might not even be visible).</p><figure></figure><p>Thankfully, Ajax have decided to buck this trend, introducing a new badge (below) that instead of being less detailed is significantly more so, fleshing out our tragic hero and son of King Telamon in a way that makes the crest look like a coin that has just been uncovered by a team of archaeologists. Which is fitting, because the badge <em>is </em>old; it's essentially a rebirth of Ajax's branding from 1928-1991, less of an exercise in reinventing the club, more about going back to their roots. </p><figure></figure><p>I love it! And more importantly, their fans seem to love it too; for a club based on a classical hero, that's over 100 years old and has a long legacy of success, a classical badge makes sense! This has been a great and rare triumph in modern football branding, and is something that other fields--<a href="https://paradise.london/journal/fashion-shot-the-serif-homogeneous-logos-and-luxury-branding-intertwine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I'm looking at you, fashion, with your endemic "blanding"</a>--might do well to remember as well.</p><p>Modernising and simplifying a logo might sound like a great idea across a boardroom table, but when the thing you're rebranding isn't just old as hell, but also means a great deal to average people, you don't always need to look forwards to find a fresh look.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
It'd be fair to say the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecraft-movie-trailer-gives-first-look-at-block-stars-jason-momoa-and-jack-black-in-action">live-action Minecraft movie's first trailer</a> didn't exactly arrive to rapturous applause. But now Warner Bros. and Legendary Pictures are back for a second try, this time unleashing the deep Steve lore, tree punching, teleporting Ender Pearls, an unfortunate incident involving a chicken, and even an adorable square bee.
</p>
<p>
It all kicks off with some backstory for Jack Black's gloriously bejumpered Steve, detailing how he chiselled his way to a "wonderland where anything you can imagine is possible, as long as what you imagine can be built out of blocks". One brisk dance sequence later, and we're reintroduced to our cast of more recent newcomers to this strange world: Garrett "The Garbage Man" Garrison (played by Jason Momoa), Henry (Sebastian Eugene Hansen), Natalie (Emma Myers) and Dawn (Danielle Brooks). Sadly, there's still no sign of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecraft-movie-adds-jennifer-coolidge-to-its-star-studded-cast">Jennifer Coolidge</a>, which is where my primary interest in this whole endeavour lies, but I can wait.
</p>
<p>
But even without everybody's favourite yacht evacuator, it all looks like a harmless bit of enjoyable fluff, featuring Jack Black as his usual effervescent self, some energetic CGI (although the art style is still a little jarring), and - in this second trailer at least - enough Minecraft easter eggs to sate even the most militant eight-year-old fan. It even finds time for a bit of ye olde mild peril - complete with zombies and arrow-launching skeletons - when night falls at the end.

<p>
"Four misfits," explains the official blurb if you're looking for more context, "find themselves struggling with ordinary problems when they are suddenly pulled through a mysterious portal into the Overworld: a bizarre, cubic wonderland that thrives on imagination. To get back home, they'll have to master this world (and protect it from evil things like Piglins and Zombies, too) while embarking on a magical quest with an unexpected, expert crafter, Steve."
</p><p>
"Together, their adventure will challenge all five to be bold and to reconnect with the qualities that make each of them uniquely creative... the very skills they need to thrive back in the real world." And if we can somehow ignore that second paragraph until it pops right out of existence, it doesn't actually sound that bad.
</p>
<p>
The Minecraft movie arrives in cinemas on 4th April next year, and there's also an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecraft-animated-series-announced-for-netflix">animated Minecraft series on the way</a> from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a>, if the whole live-action thing doesn't appeal.

The device, which costs $200, works like a charm and is quietly one of the best things Sony has made in some time. However, the Portal’s one big flaw was that, for some reason, it couldn’t stream games from the cloud.

Why isn’t it animated?’ I think a lot of people were expecting that, and just the fact that there was live action and directly real-life characters and physical sets didn’t feel right with them, because in their imagination, they’ve been playing it for a very long time,” Olafsson told <em>IGN</em>. “And they’ve kind of projected and seen a bunch of content obviously that’s been made both by us, the community, we’ve made a story mode. We made animated content before, and there’s a lot of it out there.”</p><p> Olafsson explained that one of the reasons to do a live-action adaptation was precisely because it was different and hadn’t already been done before. It was also something that had been put in motion long ago. Warner Bros. began working with <em>Minecraft</em> maker Mojang to produce a movie as far back as 2014, and the current version set to release in 2025 is the result of a long and messy process, with the project changing creative hands several times. </p><p> “This movie’s been in development for a very, very long time,” Olafsson said. “A lot of the people who will see it were not born when the first contracts and the first discussions were had, and there was always going to be live action.” </p><p>According to Hess, there were also a lot of things, like Momoa using the crafting table, that just didn’t come across right in the rapidly edited context of the initial trailer. The duo seem confident that the way those gameplay elements are communicated and fleshed out in the movie itself will make a lot more sense to long-time fans. </p><p>Apparently, early test audiences agree. The pair say early screenings of the <em>Minecraft </em>movie, even without completed VFX, have garnered positive feedback, unlike that first trailer. “People are like, ‘This is nothing like the trailer. This movie is awesome,’” Olafsson said. The movie is set to release on April 4 of next year. A second trailer, released today, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/minecraft-movie-official-trailer-jack-black-game-music-1851703319&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/minecraft-movie-official-trailer-jack-black-game-music-1851703319">looks a lot better</a></span>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The list <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kadokawa_Corporation#Group_companies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">goes on</a>. Hoovering up the Japanese mega-conglomerate is definitely an idea, but here’s another: Don’t!&nbsp;</p><p>Mergers and acquisitions haven’t been so great for the people who make games in recent times – both in the increasingly un-hallowed halls of <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-lays-off-another-650-people" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sony’s rivals</a> and specifically at Sony. This year alone, it <a href="https://aftermath.site/playstation-laying-off-900-people-8-of-workforce" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">laid off 900 people</a> – or eight percent of its workforce – across beloved, successful studios like Insomniac, Naughty Dog, and Guerrilla. Bungie, a relatively recent addition to Sony’s portfolio, was also <a href="https://aftermath.site/bungie-layoffs-destiny" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">forced to lay off</a> 220 people and <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/sony-carves-off-more-of-bungie-the-creative-studios-team-is-now-officially-a-part-of-playstation-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">beam up into the Sony mothership</a> to churn out live service games. Most recently, Sony <a href="https://aftermath.site/firewalk-concord-sony-playstation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shut down <em>Concord </em>developer Firewalk Studios</a>, another recent acquisition, after its costly debut game failed to gain immediate traction.&nbsp;</p><p>Sony’s reputation in the anime and manga space has also taken some recent hits. The Japanese giant owns Funimation, which acquired near-ubiquitous anime streaming service Crunchyroll in 2021, after which Funimation shut down its own streaming service, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/8/24065940/funimation-shutdown-crunchyroll-digital-library" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wiping users’ digital libraries and subjecting them to significant price hikes</a>. Crunchyroll management has also recently come under fire for allegedly <a href="https://animesuperhero.com/voice-actor-david-wald-leaves-crunchyroll-over-companys-alleged-mail-tampering/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tampering with a voice actor’s private mail</a>, causing the actor, David Wald, to drop his roles with the company. Other actors have accused Crunchyroll of <a href="https://kotaku.com/mob-psycho-100-crunchyroll-kyle-mccarley-sag-aftra-1849559684" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">anti-union behavior</a>.</p><p>What if we <em>didn’t </em>feed the aforementioned Kadokawa subsidiaries into the mashing maw of that infernal machine? What if, instead, we broke up both Sony and Kadokawa? Wouldn’t that be fun? More fun, perhaps, than even a sequel to <em>Bloodborne</em>? Alas, this deal will probably sail through without issue, but I can dream.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

More people are happy about that—people love those daggone <em>Equalizers</em>.”</p><p>Yes, we do love those daggone <em>Equalizer</em> films. That’s why each of the three films in the franchise has averaged a hefty $190 million at the box office. Typically, when actors of Washington’s esteemed pedigree do these wildly successful but artistically unchallenging films, it’s to fund projects they actually want to make. Do you think Robert Downey Jr. spent a decade inside a red fake robot suit in hopes of winning an Oscar? Washington subscribed to this same thinking, until he realized the impact of films like <em>The Equalizer</em>.</p><p>“I’ll sometimes say to myself, ‘One’s for me, one’s for them.’ So, for example, <em>Othello</em>: We’re doing it on Broadway and then a movie. That’s for me. But I’ve come to realize that the <em>Equalizer</em> films are for me, too, because they’re for the people,” he explains. “They want me to go get the bad guys. ‘We can’t get them, so you go get them.’ And I say, ‘Okay, I’ll get them! Just wait right there. I’ll be right back!’”</p><p>Is it irrational to have such an emotional attachment to a movie character that you yearn for them to fight bad guys who don’t exist? Sure, somewhat. Is that attachment the core reason why putting moving images on screens is a multi-million dollar business in America? Absolutely! And Denzel understands that.</p><p>This revelation from Washington all but ensures that he’ll be a leading man in an action film in his 70s. It’s not unheard of. Heck, Charles Bronson was 72 years old and still playing a similar vigilante in another long-standing action film franchise when he starred in <em>Death Wish V: The Face of Death</em>.

<p>I don’t play bingo, so I didn’t have a bingo card available specifically for this situation (sorry!), but it appears Sony wants you to play more video games within its ecosystem, so the company’s pushing a new update for the PlayStation Portal today. The update includes cloud streaming, which is still in beta, with support for 120 PlayStation 5 titles available via the PlayStation Plus Game Catalog. Of course, you must subscribe to PS+ Premium to enjoy a cloud streaming performance of 1080p resolutions in 60 frames per second. Fancy!</p>



<p>That said, according to the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/11/19/the-playstation-portal-remote-player-experience-to-evolve-with-new-system-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation Blog</a>, several features are available during the beta, some that aren’t available, and a number of locations where you can check out the cloud streaming beta. We’ll start there:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Republic of Cyprus, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, and United States.</p>
</blockquote>



<h2 id="h-beta-features">Beta Features</h2>



<p>As for new features available as part of the PlayStation Portal cloud streaming beta, you can enjoy:</p>



<ul>
<li>Stream select PS5 games in the PlayStation Plus Game Catalog
<ul>
<li>Over 120 PS5 games from the PS Plus Game Catalog, including Dave the Diver, Ghost of Tsushima, Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales, Monster Hunter Rise, and Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart, will be accessible on PS Portal via cloud streaming*</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Streaming up to 1080p/60fps**</li>



<li>DualSense wireless controller features, including haptic feedback, adaptive triggers, speakers, touchpad (emulated on the touch screen for PS Portal), and motion sensor***</li>



<li>PlayStation Plus Cloud storage
<ul>
<li>Save data and game progress can be stored up to 100GB and will be automatically synced with your PS5 console, making it easy to switch seamlessly between local and streaming gameplay, and between multiple devices.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>







<h2 id="h-how-to-join-the-cloud-streaming-beta">How to Join the Cloud Streaming Beta</h2>



<p>If you want to participate in the beta, you require an active PlayStation Network account, an active PS+ Premium subscription, access to high-speed broadband internet, and the PlayStation Portal. Once you have everything, you can access the new update and activate cloud streaming by:</p>



<ol>
<li>Open “Quick Menu” and access “Settings” on your PS Portal.</li>



<li>Select the “Cloud Streaming (Beta)” button</li>



<li>Switch the Cloud Streaming (Beta) toggle on (this will be off by default).</li>
</ol>



<p>Unfortunately, per the blog post, some features will not be readily available for this beta. This includes Game Trials, system features like party voice chat, the create button, 3D audio, and in-game microtransactions.</p>

The controller has an integrated 2000mAh power bank and charging pad, so you can charge your phone while you play. It's perfect for playing games via Xbox Game Pass Ultimate or other cloud streaming apps, or native Android/iOS games that support controllers. You can also collapse the controller down and use it separately with your phone, Xbox, or Windows.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4402348-poweracontrollerhero.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4402348" data-ratio="0.552" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4402348-poweracontrollerhero.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4402348"></a><figcaption>PowerA MOGA XP7-X Plus Bluetooth Controller</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4402348-poweracontrollerhero.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">If you're looking for a more traditional form factor, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B081C1DMZG?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PowerA's MOGA XP5-A Plus</a> is also on sale for just $36 (was $70).

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</a> is cleared for takeoff, ready to give aircraft fanciers and digital globetrotters another jaunt across its beautiful world. But in a turn of events almost exactly mirroring the launch day woes seen by its 2020 predecessor, Flight Simulator 2024 is struggling to gt off the ground, with players complaining of lengthy post-install download times, installation freezes, and more as Microsoft's servers buckle under the demand.
</p>
<p>
Already, Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 has been <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2537590/Microsoft_Flight_Simulator_2024/">tarred with the Overwhelmingly Negative brush on Steam</a>, with players reporting a range of issues - all of which are eerily familiar to those seen back in 2020. Mostly, the finger is once again being pointed toward developer Asobo's insistence that players download the bulk of the game - equalling approximately 50GB - through the in-game interface, utilising Microsoft's servers instead of Steam's. That's traditionally been a languid pursuit at the best of times, but on launch day - when everyone is struggling to get in at once - it's proving even more glacial.
</p>
<p>
Some users are seeing their downloads stall at 97 percent, while others, having successfully cleared that first hurdle, then report being stuck in lengthy log-in queues. Additionally, Flight Simulator's reliance on streaming means plenty of people are having a miserable experience even if they do get in, with reported issues including sluggish world loading and even invisible planes. "I can only marvel at the depth of the simulation," wrote one Steam reviewer, "as it now feels like Boeing was actually involved in building the servers."

<p>
"I enjoyed the short movie about a man and a plane," added another frustrated user. "However, it seemed quite expensive for its length - around one minute. I would wait until the loading screen is on sale before purchase because it does get quite samey after the 70th loop." As for the Microsoft's Flight Simulator subreddit, it's currently awash in some <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MicrosoftFlightSim/comments/1gv54xo/status_update/">top</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MicrosoftFlightSim/comments/1gv3nhh/server_loading_times/">class</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MicrosoftFlightSim/comments/1gv5ekg/msfs_2024_will_use_cloud_streaming_the_cloud/">memes</a>.
</p><p>
Over on Flight Simulator's support page, Microsoft has <a href="https://x.com/MSFS_Support/status/1858932444260421714">acknowledged the issues</a> players are experiencing. "We are aware of user reports of long initial loading times into Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024," it wrote. "With so many users initialising the sim concurrently, we have a large number of server requests. We are working to help resolve the issues as soon as possible."
</p>
<p>
"For users whose initial load is past 90 percent and no longer progressing, we recommend a reboot," it added, immediately eliciting a collective scream from everyone without a high-speed internet connection. "Otherwise we advise waiting to allow the loading to proceed as normal." The Xbox support page, meanwhile, <a href="https://x.com/XboxSupport/status/1858954069924065751">acknowledged</a> "slow download and install times", suggesting players keep an eye on its <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-live-status">live status page</a> while it investigates.
</p>
<p>
Some Steam customers have also expressed concern that Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024's lengthy in-game install solution means downloads are eating into the platform's two-hour refund window. Back in 2020, Valve moved to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/steam-users-want-microsoft-flight-simulator-refund-time-extended">assure customers only actual play time would be counted</a>, but it's not yet confirmed the same applies in 2024.
</p>
<p>
Developer Asobo has, of course, been talking a big game for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 ahead of launch, promising a frankly staggering list of activities, including aerial firefighting, search and rescue, helicopter cargo transport, crop dusting, skydive aviation, hot air balloon tours, and more. It's also teased "literally trillions of trees", even the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-will-let-you-climb-out-your-plane-walk-a-trail-and-watch-the-sunset">ability to get out your plane and walk a trail</a> - all of which sounds like it'll be marvellous, as long as Flight Simulator navigates its launch day turbulence on PC, Xbox Series X/S, and Game Pass, and sticks the landing.

The adorable DreamWorks fantasy adventure about Vikings and Pokémon-style pet dragons is being re-shot with actual humans this time around. Based on the first trailer, at least the reptilian star of the movie looks great. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195281" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="11 Minutes With Baldur’s Gate 3’s Character Creator" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="684" data-playlist="195281,195618,197298" data-current="195281"><div><p>11 Minutes With Baldur’s Gate 3’s Character Creator</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195281/195281_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195281/195281_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195281/195281_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195281/195281_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20744.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The movie is about a village chief’s young failson named Hiccup and how he redeems himself through quick wits and a budding but forbidden friendship with a black dragon named Toothless. Gerard Butler is reprising his role as Hiccup’s father but the rest of the cast is completely new, including Mason Thames (<em>The Black Phone</em>) as Hiccup and Nico Parker as fellow village kid Astrid. The remake’s first teaser shows Hiccup refusing to wage war on dragons as his father demands, and his pivotal first meeting with Toothless. </p><p>Toothless, the main draw of the movie, looks excellent. Imagine taking the creature from the original 2010 movie and giving him an Unreal Engine 5 makeover, just without all the uncanny valley stuff. The rest of the movie looks less spectacular, with dense fog and heavy special effects begging the question of why, exactly, you should make a live-action version of a cartoon about epic battles and fantastical creatures in a mythical land untouched by time. </p><p>Profit motive, for one, and a creatively bankrupt Hollywood for another. Even Butler basically just looks like someone cosplaying the CGI version of the character instead of giving audiences something genuinely new and different. Maybe as we get closer to the remake’s release, what Universal shows will get more convincing. At the very least, kids will love another reason to watch Toothless be cute and ferocious in equal measures all over again. </p><p>The live-action <em>How To Train Your Dragon</em> is out on June 13, 2025. In the meantime, the original version—an all-time classic—is streaming on Max, Hulu, and other platforms. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/blasphemous-board-game-brings-penitence-to-gamefound<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Blasphemous: The Board Game</em> is coming next year. Publisher The Game Kitchen and tabletop developer Ludus Magnus Studio have announced a tabletop adaptation of the dark fantasy indie action game will be coming through a crowdfunding campaign on Gamefound.</p>



<p>According to the Gamefound <a href="https://gamefound.com/en/projects/lms/blasphemous-the-boardgame#/section/project-story" rel="nofollow">campaign page</a>, <em>Blasphemous: The Board Game</em> is a competitive tabletop experience based on the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/blasphemous-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Blasphemous</em></a> videogame.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/blasphemous-the-board-game-miniature-artwork.jpg?itok=k29tMlsN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/blasphemous-the-board-game-miniature-artwork.jpg?itok=kv-0IUw9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The game is set in the dark fantasy world of Cvstodia. It is a dark, gothic world inhabited by highly religious followers of a devout order. An order that believes that all diseases, afflictions, and supernatural events are the cause of something called the Miracle and that acts of extreme penance, pain, and sacrifice can lead to salvation from its influence.</p>

<p>It is a setting highly influenced by The Game Kitchen's home region of Seville, themes of Catholic guilt, and the methods of torture inflicted by The Spanish Inquisition.</p>

<p>In <em>Blasphemous: The Board Game</em>, 1-4 players take on the role of zealous warriors known as Penitents. Players will explore the land of Cvstodia, fight enemies, and complete quests, all in preparation to face down deadly bosses.</p>

<p>While the game is competitive in nature, players will need to work together to take down these terrifying foes. Each boss has a unique victory condition, which can be achieved through different strategies, adding potential replay value to the game.</p>

Penitents of Abdon are straightforward bruisers, Penitents of Crimson Dusk are cunning and swift strikes. As you complete quests, you will gain custom dice, prayers, and beads that will improve your abilities.</p>

<p>Those quests are presented in narrative booklets. Each quest in the game contains up to four booklets: one general booklet and 3 specific ones.</p>

<p>Finally, <em>Blasphemous: The Board Game</em> will contain miniatures based on enemies from the videogames. The preview page confirms the Esquilon, Flagellant, Shieldmaiden, and Phalaris are in the game with more to be announced.</p>

<p>The Gamefound campaign for <em>Blasphemous: The Board Game</em> will go live in Q1 2025. If you follow the campaign beforehand, you will get an exclusive Penitent One miniature with your pledge at no additional cost.</p>

<p>Like many, I gave Warhammer 40,000: Darktide a fair shake. I spent nearly 100 hours leveling multiple classes, completing every mission, and checking out the most recent updates. I’ve thoroughly enjoyed my time with the game recently, and it appears the experience will improve vastly in December. The launch of Warhammer 40,000: Darktide Grim Protols offers a new game mode, missions, weapons, and limited-time events across all systems.</p>



<h2 id="h-new-features-in-warhammer-40-000-darktide-the-grim-protocols">New Features in Warhammer 40,000: Darktide The Grim Protocols</h2>



<p>As mentioned, the brand-new update for Warhammer 40,000: Darktide features a new game mode, mission, weapon families, limited-time events, quality-of-life improvements, bug fixes, and more. There’s even a fantastic narrative trailer to help get you in the mood for its launch!</p>

</p></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>New Game Mode – Havoc:</strong>&nbsp;Think you’ve mastered the threat over Tertium? Think again. Havoc is a new end-game experience that will test the resolve of the most seasoned operative. Be ready to face daunting challenges and earn new cosmetic rewards.</li>



<li><strong>New Mission – Dark Communion:</strong>&nbsp;Return to the Carnival and explore its darkest corners. Steel yourself as you face hordes of cultists who will stop at nothing to achieve their dark communion.</li>



<li><strong>Three New Weapon Families:&nbsp;</strong>tear through waves of enemies by wielding the destructive might of the Two-Handed Force and Power Swords, and the Ogryn Heavy Stubber.</li>



<li><strong>Anniversary Special Event:</strong>&nbsp;to celebrate the second anniversary of Warhammer 40,000: Darktide, the game will host an event that will reward players with a unique weapon trinket.</li>



<li><strong>And more:</strong>&nbsp;including the expansion of the Penance progression track with new challenges and rewards, as well as quality of life improvements such as an extension of the Party Finder feature.</li>
</ul>







<h2 id="h-when-does-the-next-darktide-update-come-out">When Does the Next Darktide Update Come Out?</h2>



<p>Darktide Grim Protocols launches alongside the PlayStation 5 release on December 3. The first-person horde shooter is now available on PC and Xbox Series X|S, and it’s an enjoyable time if you don’t mind paying $40 for admission. It does go on sale frequently, though, especially with the upcoming holiday sales Steam intends to run for Fall and Winter, so keep an eye out for a deal!</p>

The trailer predominately features Jack Black as Steve, the silent protagonist players embody in <em>Minecraft</em>. In the trailer, Black’s Steve is way more chatty, giving us his backstory as a child who quite literally yearns for the mines. As an adult, Steve finds a special blue cube that transports him to the <em>Minecraft</em> world where, “anything you can imagine is possible.” </p><p>It should come as no surprise that the movie, like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23669598/super-mario-bros-movie-review"><em>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</em></a> before it, is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isekai">isekai</a>. A group of unsuspecting folks including Danielle Brooks, Jason Momoa, Emma Myers, and Sebastian Eugene Hansen are magically transported to the world to find a blocky paradise of Steve’s making. The trailer features another look at the movie versions of popular <em>Minecraft </em>devices like redstone-powered minecarts, crafting tables, and ender pearls. There’s even a reference to the crazy contraptions players can create in the game with an automatic chicken cooker that uses lava as a heating element.</p><p>In conjunction with the trailer’s release, Xbox has published a blog that goes into detail about all the devices seen in the trailer. Check it out <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/11/19/minecraft-movie-official-trailer-game-features/">here</a>. And you can watch Jack Black and Jason Momoa chew the scenery when <em>A Minecraft Movie</em> releases April 4th.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The next iteration of Valve’s Steam Controller appears set to enter mass production. According to a <a href="https://x.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1858925211363553316" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">new claim from Valve insider</a> Brad Lynch, Steam Controller 2, codenamed “Ibex” is in deep development.</p>



<p>According to Lynch, Steam Controller 2 is “being tooled for a mass production” in factories and is in a “later [stage] of productization”.</p>



<p>In addition to the production news, Lynch says that the new controller from Valve will have symmetrical sticks and that it’s “not far off from Steam Deck input”.</p>



<h6 id="h-help-insider-gaming-take-our-2024-reader-survey">HELP INSIDER GAMING:&nbsp;<a href="https://forms.gle/wvT7oBtvjZLVmrEv9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Take Our 2024 Reader Survey</a></h6>



<p>Aside from from the Steam Controller 2, Lynch touched on a controller codenamed “Roy” for Valve’s “Deckard” VR headset. Not only is that device also heading for mass production, but he says that it will have a directional pad, bumpers, grip buttons, triggers, ABXY buttons, and a system button. That’s lead to speculation that it will be able to work as a stand alone controller away from “Deckard”.</p>



<p>Lynch didn’t give a timeline on when players could expect to see or hear something official about either the Steam Controller 2, “Deckard”, or “Roy”.</p>



<p>Valve also hasn’t commented on the latest rumors or confirmed the existence of any of the devices.  </p>

Or at least, they're trying.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players are taking to social media to report initial loading screens that are lasting for two hours or more. Its propensity for hanging at around 97 percent has led to memes about "Microsoft Flight Simulator 97" and other jokes. Some fans aren't even that lucky, getting stuck at around six percent. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a href="https://x.com/MSFS_Support/status/1858932444260421714" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post on X/Twitter</a>, Microsoft said that it's aware of the problems and working on a solution. "We are aware of user reports of long initial loading times into Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024. With so many users initializing the sim concurrently, we have a large number of server requests. We are working to help resolve the issues as soon as possible. For users whose initial load is past 90% and no longer progressing, we recommend a reboot. Otherwise we advise waiting to allow the loading to proceed as normal."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 is the follow-up to 2020's Microsoft Flight Simulator. Among its additions are a brand-new career mode and new aircraft types such as gliders and hot air balloons. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-the-first-preview">We wrote in our preview</a>, "I am suitably impressed with what I saw, and I didn't think they'd be able to improve on MSFS 2020 much more than an iterative update, but this is a reimagining of the entire franchise. Everything good… is better now, and everything new looks awesome and fun."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 is available now on Xbox Series X|S and PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Kat Bailey is IGN's News Director as well as co-host of Nintendo Voice Chat.
