            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Although the release of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/mario-kart-world/">Mario Kart World</a>, the first proper new entry in the series in over 8 years, already made 2025 a great year for fans of kart racers, those looking for a slightly more traditional approach to the genre have Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds to look forward to. Appearances, however, can be very deceiving, as this more traditional approach is only the tip of the iceberg for a game that manages to combine spectacle with a tight balanced combination of different mechanics that not only make the game a joy to play, but also one that can be enjoyed to the fullest by players of all skill levels.</p>



<p>During Gamescom 2025 last week, I was able to try out Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds for around 30 minutes, which, right from the onset, looked like they wouldn't be enough to truly understand the depth of the many options on offer, ranging from a massive character roster featuring a lot of characters taken from series besides the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise such as Steve and Alex from Minecraft, Spongebob and Patric, Pac-Man and the Ghosts, Joker from Persona 5 and Ichiban Kasuga from the Like a Dragon series, the vehicle selection and customization options, which ranged from cosmetic to performance options, and a perks system which provided further depth. Having little time to check everything out, I simply picked out Sonic and the first vehicle that provided a balanced performance, a basic set of perks, which included the ability to store an additional item during a race, and went to race in one of the available cups, which comprised four different tracks.</p>



<div><p>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds is setting out to be an excellent kart racer balancing accessibility with depth</p></div>



<p>Up until this point, Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds looked as traditional as a kart racer could get, and the first lap through the first track only reinforced this feeling. As soon as the second lap through the first colorful track ended, however, the new entry in the series showed how unique the experience is setting out to be. Instead of continuing on the same track, the player in first place has the chance to pick between two other tracks, which adds an incredible element of unpredictability to a race. In the blink of an eye, every player is seamlessly transported to a new track with its own set of gimmicks, which made each of the four tracks included in the cup exhilarating to play. With the final lap being set in the original track, however, Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds has everything in place to be accessible to every sort of player, even those who are only looking for some casual fun, casual fun that is easy to have in the game also thanks to some rather tight racing mechanics which feel great even if one were to ignore drifting, the vast item selection and the customization and perk systems outlined above.</p>



<p>Having only the time to play through a single cup, my time with Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds was somewhat short, but the little taste of the experience I had was more than enough to make me hunger for more and see for myself how all of these advanced mechanics will come together at higher difficulties and in online play. Thankfully, it won't be long for anyone to have a taste of the experience, as an open beta will be held later this week on August 29 ahead of the game's release on September 25 on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch, with a Switch 2 version to follow later in the year. One thing, however, already seems to be certain. Sonic Team managed to create a great kart racer with a solid balance between accessibility and depth that is sure to please all sorts of players.</p>

		<p>Cosy games are in right now and one new announcement looks like a very pleasant and comfortable experience, with that game being Tony The Mole. Tony The Mole is an adventure game in which you play as Tony, a mole that helps the people he comes across while wearing a variety of hats. While this is his main goal, he will be helping the people of Pebblegrove with their requests.</p>
<p><iframe title="Tony The Mole Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lkNzrnQTAkQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>As you can see from the trailer, Tony gets around the world by tunnelling underground to get past obstacles like fences, and he can also climb upwards though has limited stamina when doing so. The gameplay consists of exploring different areas, platforming and collecting items to complete tasks. There is also some interaction with the people of Pebblesgrove as they give requests and some advice to Tony too. Tony also has the ability to sniff out things like hidden areas, earthworms, and secret treasures that are not in plain sight. The earthworms give Tony upgrades to increase his stamina so he can climb walls for longer, allowing him to scale new heights.</p>
<p>A release date for Tony The Mole is yet to be confirmed by Lucktape Games, and the game has only been confirmed for PC via Steam.</p>

<p>A huge blow for Capcom</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Lightspeed Japan" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/996cc2a85ec6e/lightspeed-japan.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>From left: Bingo Morihashi, Hideaki Itsuno, and Daigo Ikeno — <em>Image: Lightspeed Studios</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Lightspeed Japan Studio, a subsidiary of the Tencent-owned company Lightspeed Studios, has announced a key expansion with the opening of a new office in Osaka.</p>
<p>Under the leadership of Hideaki Itsuno – who perhaps most famously spearheaded the development of the <strong>Devil May Cry</strong> series following his introduction as a replacement director for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/devil_may_cry_2">DMC2</a> – Lightspeed Japan Studio has also made three new significant hires.</p>
<p>All three are Capcom veterans. The first is narrative designer Toshihiro Nakagawa (Bingo Morihashi), who has previously worked closely with Itsuno in creating scenarios for the Devil May Cry franchise. The second is Daigo Ikeno, an illustrator famed for his work on the <strong>Street Fighter</strong> series (most notably <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/games/dreamcast/street_fighter_iii_3rd_strike_fight_for_the_future">3rd Strike</a>). Ikeno also made significant contributions to Devil May Cry as a character artist.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067qxpnvz&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>Finally, illustrator 'Gouda Cheese' (who might be better known as 'Bengus') has also been hired. 'Cheese' has contributed to a number of high-profile fighting titles, including <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/megadrive/super_street_fighter_ii">Super Street Fighter II</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/darkstalkers_the_night_warriors">Darkstalkers: The Night Warriors</a>, and <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/games/dreamcast/marvel_vs_capcom_2_new_age_of_heroes">Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes</a>.</p>
<p>Lightspeed Japan Studio is currently hard at work on creating a 'cross-platform' AAA action game. It's still early days yet, so no details have been shared as to what it might entail, but we think it's safe to say that it will be quite similar in design to the likes of Devil May Cry and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/bayonetta">Bayonetta</a>.</p>
<p>Whatever happens in the months and years ahead, Capcom can't be pleased at the loss of three key veterans. Nakagawa, Ikeno, and 'Cheese' have made some truly invaluable contributions to the success of the company, and we'll be keen to see what they all come up with over at Lightspeed Japan Studio.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/first-battlefield-6-camos-have-leaked-its-claimed/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>FPS weapon skins is always a divisive topic. Call of Duty’s reputation as a serious military shooter has been increasingly questioned in recent years due to its outlandish camos and Operator skins. Battlefield 6 appears to be curbing this zaniness, and the new BF6 weapon skin leaks suggest this.</p>



<p>Adding <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-adding-beavis-butt-head-operators/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Beavis and Butt-Head to Black Ops 6</a> jumped the shark for many CoD fans. The franchise has incorporated anime characters and larger-than-life Kaiju characters such as Godzilla in recent years. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-cod-next-2025-schedule-where-to-watch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty</a> fans are becoming disillusioned with the series’ lack of seriousness and self-awareness, and this seems to be something <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/this-made-me-pre-order-battlefield-6-fans-react-to-black-ops-7-gameplay-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a> is trying to steer away from.</p>



<h2 id="h-here-s-a-look-at-battlefield-6-weapon-skins">Here’s a Look at Battlefield 6 Weapon Skins</h2>



<figure><figcaption>No floating dragons here, yet. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p>Battlefield 6 devs have already hinted that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-dev-hints-that-game-wont-have-unrealistic-skins-cosmetics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BF6 won’t have unrealistic skins and cosmetics</a>. EA and Battlefield Studios <em>seem </em>to know what the people want.</p>



<p>A new leak from <a href="https://x.com/TheBFWire" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Battlefield Wire</a> reveals many Battlefield 6 weapon camos. Honestly, they’re quite normal, and it’s refreshing!</p>



<p>We’ve seen hundreds of camos from FPS games over the years. You’ve likely seen or equipped these skins if you play FPS games like CoD regularly. The Battlefield 6 camo leak shows an assortment of leafy woodland camos, minimalistic makeovers, more artistic and complex designs, and some that resemble classic Call of Duty Digital and Blue Tiger colors.</p>



<div><article><p><span>LEAK: Here are some of the Weapon Camos coming to Battlefield 6

W or L?</span></p></article></div>



<p>This is a leak at the end of the day. Don’t be surprised if some of these don’t make it to the final game. They could be subject to change, as we don’t know at which stage of development these leaked designs come from. So keep this in mind before you start dreaming about your favorite camo.</p>



<p>Are you hoping and praying that Battlefield 6 keeps it on the straight and narrow and doesn’t start throwing in lucrative tie-ins left, right, and center? Let us know through the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <p>
Demonschool, the forthcoming RPG Eurogamer described as "Persona meets Buffy", has been delayed once again due to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksong-finally-gets-release-date-out-next-month">surprise release of Hollow Knight Silksong</a>.
</p>
<p>
The game was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/persona-inspired-demonschool-gets-release-window-following-last-years-delay">originally intended for a release last year</a>, but was delayed until 3rd September this year. Now it's moved back to 19th November thanks to "brutal" market conditions.
</p>
<p>
The decision appears to have been made by publisher Ysbryd Games. "With 11 years under our belt as an indie publisher, we at Ysbryd Games are reasonably qualified to say that any point of 2025 on balance, has been or will be as brutal as market conditions can get when it comes to releasing a game," it wrote in a statement on social media. "Crueler still, that we should find out with such short notice that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight Silksong</a> will launch just one day after our planned release for Demonschool."

<p>
Visibility is of prime importance for the publisher; as such "we would not be doing our game any favours by wading into waters we can clearly see are blood red". Instead, it wants to allow Silksong to have its moment, and for Demonschool to follow.
</p><p>
The publisher has also confirmed there will be no more delays after this. Until release, more time will be spent polishing and enhancing the game experience, with more endings and minigames originally planned for a post-release patch to be included at launch.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Sonic is heading back to the race track this September, giving himself the handicap of having to drive a race car to compete with a wide set of opponents, with a new dimension-hopping twist for both the races and the full game roster. But racing doesn’t always have to be so straight forward, and we went hands on with Sonic Racing: Crossworlds at Gamescom to check out the new Race Park modes.</p>
<p><iframe title="Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds | Competition Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1nIhfo2X0oI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Throughout this latest hands on, the arcade kart racing was completely on show. The handling is tight and snappy, the drifting is more sideways, and as you pull tricks while grabbing some airtime off a ramp, the car will flip in any and every direction with wild abandon. It’s got that oft touted Sega style to it, and you could absolutely imagine this game appearing on arcade cabinets…. if those were still really a thing.</p>


<p>Taking a half step away from the main Grand Prix racing, Race Park provides a bunch of additional team-based modes, to go alongside the core racing experience. Playable online or offline with challenge bots to face off against, you do still have a standard 12-character race mode available to you, but there’s also the option to have that with all items at their highest power, if you want races to be more chaotic.</p>


<p>What’s more interesting is having the lobby split down into two teams of six or three teams of four, each then with various additional objectives and goals. Your team’s score is a combination of points for finishing position and how well you do at those additional goals – in a Eurovision style, the final total sees the racing score added first before the objective score is lumped on top to, quite possibly, flip the result around.</p>
<p>For the three team modes, Ring Grab is the more straight forward, as you do your best to follow the strings of coins laid out through the stage and gather as many as you can, but Tap Boost is sure to be much trickier, as your prime bonus and task here is actually to race closely with your teammates, bumping into them to give you speed boosts and hopefully propel you to the front together. On the two team side of things, you then have Shoot Out to push the combat angle a bit further, and Dash where you need to hit as many boost pads and boost rings as possible. You can also fiddle with these modes even further, if you want, with the ability to create custom ruleset beyond what’s on offer by default.</p>

<p>While dipping into these various modes at Gamescom, we also got to play some newly revealed tracks, and one of these really, truly stood out to me. The standard form of a Crossworlds race will see you do one lap around the chosen track before passing through a portal to an alternate world for the second –&nbsp;the choice of this is handed to the first placed racer –&nbsp;before returning to the original track in a somewhat ramped up form.</p>
<p>This was most obvious to me in the Wonder Museum track, racing through a history museum with countless exhibits for the first lap, but with a grin spreading across my face when returning for the third lap to discover everything had come to life, Night at the Museum style. It’s a really fun track, and I hope there’s plenty more inventive gems to find throughout the rest of the game.</p>

<p>The other surprising element will be the depth of customisation offered by the Gadget Plate, giving you modifier gadgets to slot into place to boost or tweak everything from speed and acceleration, to item counts, how boosting works, item types and more. You can save these in loadouts, so you have quick access to a time trial build, a team mode build, something for different racers and karts, and on. It’s an aspect that we’ve really only had the lightest touch on, but has potential for the full game.</p>
<p>Is Sonic Racing Crossworlds going to be able to shine as brightly as a certain plumber’s karting escapades? You’d doubt it, but I certainly appreciate how different it looks and feels. This game is trying to put its own stamp on the genre, the visuals are right out of the classic blue sky Sega arcade game style, the racing is fast and snappy, and the customisation potential for the Gadget Plate is crazily broad. Adding various twists and spins on the core racing is just the icing on the Sonic-shaped cake.</p>

<p>It doesn’t seem to happen as often as it used to, but physical copies of games can still occasionally be sent out too early, and players get games several days ahead of launch. This is exactly what’s happened with Lost Soul Aside, and you should be on alert for spoilers, according to the game’s social media team.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lost-soul-aside-release-date-platforms-editions-and-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lost Soul Aside</a> continues the recent trend of pure action games instead of the relentless march toward Soulslike supremacy. The new ARPG is in the same vein as a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/phantom-blade-zero-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Phantom Blade Zero</a>, and if you’re excited for it, you might want to watch out for spoilers.</p>

<p>Lost Soul Aside doesn’t officially release until August 29. This applies to digital editions and physical launches. However, unlike digital copies, it’s harder to keep a lid on physical pre-orders. Retailers can send out orders early, for example.</p>



<p>The official <a href="https://x.com/Lost_Soul_Aside" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X account</a> for Lost Soul Aside has become aware of this very act happening: “It has been brought to our attention that some people may have gotten their hands on physical copies of Lost Soul Aside. Please do not spoil the game online, out of respect for each other!”</p>



<p>People are always keen to be first to everything. You can bet that YouTube is probably already filled with Lost Soul Aside videos and walkthroughs for content that’s not supposed to be seen by the public eye yet. I won’t check, as I also don’t want the game to be spoiled for me!</p>



<p>I advise you to block and avoid all mentions of ‘Lost Soul Aide’ on social media until the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sonys-lost-soul-aside-release-date-delayed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release date</a>.</p>



<div><article><p><span>It has been brought to our attention that some people may have gotten their hands on physical copies of Lost Soul Aside.

<p>How do you avoid spoilers for upcoming games? Or are you not bothered and are quite happy to get the early leaks before launch? Let me know through the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<figure><a title="Bananza" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7f46311a19f74/bananza.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>The latest UK charts are in, and with no major releases in the last week, the top ten looks pretty familiar. <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/mafia_the_old_country">Mafia: The Old Country</a> has taken a bit of a tumble to land at number 7, which means that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> both sit pretty at the top of the pile.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-plus-4">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4</a> has also seen a healthy boost in numbers, taking it all the way from number 29 up to number 10. Most sales were for the PS5 version, taking in a total of 58% of the platform split, but combined together, Switch and Switch 2 managed a reasonable 34%.</p><div><figure data-videoid="_PuEn0ZOn5c" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_PuEn0ZOn5c?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_PuEn0ZOn5c?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_PuEn0ZOn5c?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38f036osgtzm&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PuEn0ZOn5c" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>It's a similar story for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-x-shadow-generations">Sonic X Shadow Generations</a>, which re-entered the charts at number 14. Although the PS5 achieved the most sales again for a single platform at 43%, Switch and Switch 2 combined made up 47%.</p>
<p>Of course, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-star-crossed-world">Kirby and the Forgotten Land - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Star-Crossed World</a> launches later this week, so we'll see how that affects things next time. We're honestly not expecting gangbuster sales, but it would be nice to see it sat alongside Mario Kart World and Donkey Kong Bananza.</p>
<p>That's a brief overview of the numbers, but here's the full top 40, with platform breakdowns for games available on Switch, Switch 2, and other consoles:</p>

            <p>Well, it happened again: the Maw devoured a Monday. My recent, highly suspicious news article about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/its-a-uk-bank-holiday-please-talk-amongst-yourselves">a sudden "bank holiday"</a> was, of course, a hasty PR smokescreen to avert a stock market crash. In Horace's name, we have now forced the Maw to sick up the missing Monday, but locating the gag reflex of a cosmic monster has its risks, and there have been a few casualties.</p>
<p>Mark has theoretically been "on holiday" since last Wednesday, returning tomorrow, but that's another piece of disinfo - he's actually stranded somewhere in the Cretaceous period. James, meanwhile, has come down with a case of the Schrödingers, neither away at Gamescom nor back at his desk. I am going to email him shortly - fingers crossed the quantum binary collapses in a way conducive to preview write-ups. As for this week's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/new-pc-games">new PC games</a> - here you are. I've included the regurgitated Monday, but please handle with care as it's still rather radioactive and, er, talkative.

<p>As always, let us know if there's any must-plays we've missed. My plans for this week include making sense of a big, tangly interview-driven feature and maybe writing something about liminality that would secretly be a love letter to a particular videogame level. Providing the superposition resolves in our favour, I imagine James will be Jamescomming it up with sundry impressions articles and interviewage. Assuming he overcomes the giant Venus flytraps and makes it past the Ankylosauri to the time portal, Mark should be on regular news and possibly a review. I seem to remember him bagsying something in the spreadsheet before he disappeared into the vortex. What are you up to this week?</p>

<p>Helldivers 2 is hurtling into a long-awaited Xbox release, which comes alongside a huge collaboration with fan-favorite Microsoft title Halo. If you can’t wait to get your hands on the ODST Legendary Warbond, we’ve got all the details for your countdown.</p>



<p>Announced <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-collab-with-halo-odst-lands-with-xbox-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">earlier this month</a>, the ODST crossover with Helldivers 2 comes amid a big turning point in the game with the introduction of Xbox players, who can enjoy <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/does-helldivers-2-have-cross-progression/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">crossplay with PlayStation and PC players</a>.</p>



<p>For all the details on exactly when the new Legendary Warbond releases, look no further than our guide.</p>



<h2 id="h-helldivers-2-halo-odst-warbond-release-date-amp-start-times">Helldivers 2 Halo ODST Warbond Release Date &amp; Start Times</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Dropping in hot. Image via Arrowhead</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Helldivers 2 x Halo ODST Warbond releases on August 26, with an official start time of 5am PT.</strong></p>



<p>The start time coincides with the release of Helldivers 2 on Xbox, a seismic moment as it marks the first time a Sony title has made the jump to the rival platform. Naturally, that big move has been celebrated in style with the special Halo ODST Warbond, revealed by the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/19/helldivers-2-x-halo-odst-legendary-warbond-arrives-august-26/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation blog</a>.</p>



<p>For those in America, the Warbond will be available early in the morning, while those elsewhere in the world will have to wait until later in the day to jump in.</p>



<p>We’ve created the table below for easier viewing, which shows start times for the Legendary Warbond in Helldivers 2 in various time zones.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>I’ve played </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/summer-game-fest-previews-sonic-resident-evil-play-days-1851784271"><i><span>Sonic Racing: Crossworlds</span></i></a> <span>twice now, and both times, I had the same fleeting thought: “What if </span><i><span>Sonic</span></i><span> outruns </span><i><span>Mario Kart </span></i><span>and has the better kart racer this year?” </span><i><span>Mario Kart World </span></i><span>is pretty good. It is a really solid One of Those, and it will no doubt be a mainstay in the Switch 2’s long lifetime–but it plays things safe, has several frustrating things going on under the hood, and by God, 24 players is too damn many.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>After playing about a dozen hours of </span><i><span>World </span></i><span>with friends since the Switch 2 launched in June, playing </span><i><span>Crossworlds </span></i><span>for even an hour was refreshing, as it feels like Sega is not only taking some cool risks to shake up the formula, but also making calculated choices that rein in chaos and allow for more strategic racing.</span></p> <p><i><span>Crossworlds</span></i><span>’ biggest shake-up is the introduction of the Gadget Panel, which is essentially an overhaul of </span><i><span>Team Sonic Racing</span></i><span>’s Bonus Box system. Before each race, you can use your panel to create a loadout of upgrades, usable items, and stat boosts to fit your playstyle. Some upgrades take up more space than others on your panel. My typical arsenal included the option to start each race with a monster truck transformation item that gives you a significant speed boost and also lets you trample over enemies in your path. Having something like that takes up multiple slots on your panel, but it’s an excellent way to get a head start at the beginning of a race.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>While that’s a one-and-done boost, a lot of the upgrades help you throughout a race, such as performing speed boosting air tricks faster, making your drift a little smoother, or offensive-based upgrades like giving yourself a boost every time you collide with an enemy kart. You can race in cars or the Extreme Gear hoverboards, which will define your playstyle, but your Gadget Panel lets you fine-tune it into something unique and personalized. I use the monster truck at the beginning of the race, but after I’ve gotten my head start, I want to make sure I have a smooth ride as I pass the rest of these slowpokes, so I use the rest of my panel to make my drifts faster and get a speed boost when I bump into others.</span></p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds | Competition Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1nIhfo2X0oI?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><span>Having all those spinning plates on screen at once would overwhelm </span><i><span>Crossworlds </span></i><span>if it had taken </span><i><span>Mario Kart World</span></i><span>’s 24-player races as a challenge. However, </span><i><span>Crossworlds </span></i><span>maintains a 12-player limit on its races, and after all the </span><i><span>World </span></i><span>I’d been playing, it’s become pretty clear to me that this is the sweet spot.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Yeah, having 24 players on a track at once is a good technical showcase for the Switch 2 and feeds into the usual “bigger = better” mentality that permeates through most video games, but it has also turned out to be one of </span><i><span>World</span></i><span>’s biggest frustrations. By design, if there are more racers on a track, the slightest setback will inherently give more players a chance to pass by you. One well-timed blue shell can send a first-place winner back a dozen placements with not enough time or resources to regain the lead. So much of </span><i><span>Mario Kart </span></i><span>is determined by the luck of the draw. If you get the right item, you can Bullet Bill your way to the front of the pack, but you might get something less useful. </span><i><span>Sonic Racing: Crossworlds </span></i><span>has the same item-based play, but its Gadget loadouts leave your playstyle less to chance, and its 12-player races mean that the slightest misstep isn’t punished by being tossed down the rankings into an oblivion you can’t drive out of. It adds fun complexities without becoming chaotic and convoluted to the point where only the sweatiest among us can reach first place.</span></p> <p><i><span>Crossworlds</span></i><span> is doing a lot of things right, and in light of a relatively lukewarm reception for its biggest competitor, </span><i><span>Mario </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Sonic </span></i><span>are potentially on an even playing field, and the blue blur could come out on top for the first time in a while. I may not be thrilled with the crossover slop this time around, but I’m eager to get on my board as Shadow when </span><i><span>Crossworlds </span></i><span>launches on September 25.</span></p>

Each race across the 24 different tracks is three laps, with the second taking place in an entirely different world after the racers teleport through a travel ring. Whichever competitor is in the lead as the racers approach the second lap chooses which world everyone hops over to, with two options given at random from a total pool of 15 other worlds.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> 8 Minutes of Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds Gameplay</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">It's an interesting gimmick, best seen in the Grand Prix mode that was the focus of both the SGF preview and my latest hands-on. In that mode, you're awarded a number of points depending on your place, which are added up at the end of a series of races to determine the ultimate winner. Each Grand Prix is four races, with the fourth and final race taking place across the three previous tracks--the first lap is on the track from the first race, the second lap is on the track of the second race, and so on.</p><p dir="ltr">As was the case at SGF, I crushed the computer-controlled competitors handily on the hardest available difficulty (there is one that's even harder, but it has not been available in either preview). As fun as it is to win, it's been hard to enjoy the game without the challenge of needing to try. I still believe that challenge will come when given the chance to play with other humans, but until then, CrossWorlds feels lacking compared to what came before.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4556068-sonic2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556068" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4556068-sonic2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556068"></a><figcaption>Anyone else miss Sonic Riders?</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4556068-sonic2.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The game borrows mechanics and features from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/team-sonic-racing/" data-ref-id="5000-482784">Team Sonic Racing</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/sonic-riders/" data-ref-id="5000-25205">Sonic Riders</a>, but lacks the teamwork-oriented relay racing of the former or fuel management and character abilities of the latter. Those aspects made Team Sonic Racing and Sonic Riders distinct enough from Mario Kart to give them more identity, and also make them more challenging--it was rewarding to win at those games and I remember playing them (especially Riders) for hours upon hours and wanting to push myself to get better. I haven't gotten that sensation from CrossWorlds yet.</p><p dir="ltr">Like all of the other characters, Hatsune and Ichiban have their own stats that affect the minutiae of play--making slight adjustments to how each kart handles in a race. It must be very slight though, as I didn't notice any discernible difference between them, nor any change from my time with Jet the Hawk and Amy Rose at SGF. Changing up the plate loadout of the kart is a far more noticeable adjustment. I tinkered around with the kart plate system--which allows you to create several established loadouts to change how your kart behaves--a little more this time around, creating plates that let me start off with the monster truck transformation so I could run over everyone from the very start, or draft off others more easily and overtake the competition by stealing their rings, or spin like an unstoppable top while drifting to bash other racers and build extra speed boost.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4556069-sonic3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556069" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4556069-sonic3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556069"></a><figcaption>With 24 tracks and 15 other worlds to explore, you'll see plenty of strange sights throughout the race.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4556069-sonic3.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">These plate builds are fun and zany, and I wish they had a bigger impact on my performance to encourage me to spend more time tinkering in the shop. But I won with them all and I didn't really have to adjust my strategy for how I raced with any of them. I still needed to collect rings to build speed, pick up items to mess with opponents, dodge other racers' items, and drift around corners. Like everything else, the customization features don't help CrossWorlds differentiate itself from its competitors--nothing (so far) about this experience feels like it belongs solely to CrossWorlds.</p><p dir="ltr">I'm still hopeful that I'm just missing something. I generally enjoy the Sonic games that focus on racing, so this one not connecting with me feels like I'm somehow lying to myself. I'm sure that as soon as I sit down on the couch with my closest friends and we're screaming at each other for the bullcrap that we manage to pull off, I'll recognize in that moment what makes CrossWorlds special. Until that moment, however, I'm choosing to remain cautious of this one.</p><p dir="ltr">Sonic Racing CrossWorlds is launching for Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and Switch on September 25. The game will be released for Switch 2 during the 2025 holiday season.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Renowned game designer Hideaki Itsuno famously <a href="https://wccftech.com/devil-may-cry-dragons-dogma-series-director-hideaki-itsuno-is-leaving-capcom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">left CAPCOM</a> around a year ago after a thirty-year career at the Japanese company. A couple of months later, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragons-dogma-creator-hideaki-itsuno-joins-tencents-lightspeed-to-work-on-aaa-action-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">learned</a> that he would become the head of a new Japan-based team at Tencent subsidiary LightSpeed Studios, which would create action games, per his expertise.</p>



<p>Now, as <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/capcom-veteran-itsuno-hires-devil-may-cry-street-fighter-royalty-for-new-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported by VideoGamesChronicle</a>, LightSpeed has announced new milestones for the studio: the hiring of several key developers from CAPCOM and the opening of a new office in Osaka (Japanese developers will be able to choose whether they'd like to keep working from the Tokyo office or move to the new one, <a href="https://x.com/__lightspeed___/status/1960146677844861325" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to the official X account</a>).</p>



<p>As for the new hires, they're all former colleagues of Hideaki Itsuno:</p>



<ul>
<li>Writer Toshihiro Nakagawa, also known as Bingo Morihashi, has worked on Devil May Cry 2, 3, 4, 5, and both Dragon's Dogma games</li>



<li>Daigo Ikeno, an artist whose works include Street Fighter, Devil May Cry, and Dragon's Dogma</li>



<li>Gouda Cheese/Bengus(both fictional names), another artist who has worked on Street Fighter and Power Stone</li>
</ul>



<figure></figure>



<p>Actually, the new LightSpeed Japan Studio has roughly a third of its employees (around 40 in total for now) who came from CAPCOM, and Hideaki Itsuno highlighted the benefits of this choice in a statement shared with VGC: </p>



<p><em>Although we’re a new studio working on a new game, it’s good to be able to work with people who I trust like Mr. Nakagawa. I have been working with him for decades, since Devil May Cry 2, and he’s one of those core members who understands me very well. Ikeno-san is also participating as an art director this time, and Bengus-san has a very high level of understanding and is a very unique man – he was a legendary designer at Capcom.</em></p>



<p><em>It’s all about a sense of trust… we know exactly what each of us want. And it’s not just these three people: I also hired some other people I worked with from before at Capcom, so even though this is a new studio, I’ve gathered those people who I trust to make sure that this is going to be a successful game.</em></p>



<p>Hideaki Itsuno and his team are working on an original IP. Earlier today, Itsuno-san <a href="https://x.com/tomqe/status/1960151714423865732" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said on X</a> that the team will work on a prototype that will 'delight players around the world', though they are still seeking creative directors. As such, it would be wise to expect a long wait before we hear concrete details on the game.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/the-division-2-saved-by-team-five-developers-ubisoft/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-division-2-was-%E2%80%98saved%E2%80%99-by-a-team-of-five-developers-%E2%80%98we-weren%E2%80%99t-supposed-to-exist%E2%80%99.1280397/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Ubisoft recently appeared at Gamescom to present the future of The Division 2, including the unveiling of ‘a big project’ that turned out to be The Division 2: Survivors. As the game approaches its tenth anniversary, more content has been lined up, but for a while, things looked a little sketchy for Ubisoft’s once-iconic third-person shooter MMO.</p>



<p>In a post on social media, Palle Hoffstein, art producer at Massive Entertainment, revealed that a micro-sized team stumped up the courage to ‘resurrect’ The Division 2 when it was in a slump and content delivery had effectively ended, and the turnaround was something incredible.</p>



<h2 id="h-something-bigger-and-lasting">‘Something Bigger and Lasting’</h2>



<p>Ubisoft posted a timeline to social media on August 22, unveiling the immediate and long-term future of The Division franchise, including the string of expansions coming to The Division 2. The team also discussed The Division: Resurgence, an all-new mobile experience set at the heart of The Division’s <em>borderline </em>post-apocalyptic universe.</p>



<p>In a line of comments responding to that post, art producer <a href="https://x.com/Palle_Hoffstein/status/1959275482462953660" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Palle Hoffstein revealed</a> how The Division 2 almost slipped out of reach, but a dedicated team of just <strong>five developers </strong>clawed it back from the zero-content abyss:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>We had 5 people to restart Division 2. Five! What were we thinking? Ah that was fun.</em></p>



<p>When a few of us made a small team to resurrect TD2 I had zero interest in adding a year or two, just to sunset the game again. The goal, what we believed we could do, was to <strong>build something bigger and lasting</strong>. This is fun to see but there’s still so much more we want to do.</p>



<p>I figured the biggest challenge would be staffing and yeah. Studios plan staffing years in advance to keep everyone allocated and busy. We created a problem of being a team that needed positions filled that weren’t on anyone’s spreadsheet. <strong>We weren’t supposed to exist.</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<p><em><span>(</span>Thanks to <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/ubisoft-allocated-5-devs-restart-the-division-2-build-something-bigger-lasting" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">MP1st</a> for the spot)</em></p>



<p>The Division debuted in 2016 and turned heads thanks to a solid marketing campaign and a great launch that plunged players into a desperate fight to reclaim New York from looters, shooters, and organized criminals. The Division 2 was released in 2019 and has become a staple of Ubisoft’s live-service lineup, even if things went wavy for a while.</p>



<p>Palle later revealed that when a 2024 crossover event that introduced Resident Evil to The Division aired, he might have been ‘the last person’ on the D2 team:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I might have been the last person actually on the D2 team, to launch the Resident Evil stuff. We were done. Then a few weeks later I was asked if I could do another apparel event for D2. Despite having no artists I said, “sure.” I assumed I could figure something out lol.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Are you glad that this team of five developers got their heads down to ‘save’ The Division 2? Let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>In March of this year, the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_music">Nintendo Music</a> app received an update adding songs from the Switch title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/kirby_and_the_forgotten_land">Kirby and the Forgotten Land</a>.</p>
<p>At the time, Nintendo mentioned how the rest of this album was coming "later this year", and now, ahead of the launch of the Switch 2 Edition of this title, additional tracks have been added to this album.</p>

<p>Ahead of Tokyo Game Show (TGS) 2025 in September, PlayStation has announced its lineup for the expo. The convention, held yearly, has already shown promise this year with contributors like Capcom and Koei Tecmo showing up with huge games. Now, PlayStation has joined in on the fun with two of its biggest upcoming titles.</p>



<p>This is the company’s second year in a row showing up to TGS after being absent from 2020-2023.  Last year, the biggest games were Monster Hunter Wilds and the GOTY winner Astro Bot. Death Stranding 2: On The Beach also held a showcase, where a new trailer was unveiled. While no showcases are revealed just yet, the two titles on display are sure to make fans happy.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>As of right now, only two brand-new titles will be available for attendees to play on the show floor. Those titles, according to <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/08/sony-interactive-entertainment-announces-preliminary-tgs-2025-lineup" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the press release</a>, are Sucker Punch’s Ghost of Yotei and ARC System Works’ Marvel TOKON: Fighting Souls. More games will be announced closer to the expo’s start on September 25th, 2025. </p>



<p>This marks the first public demo of Ghost of Yotei, which launches a week after TGS on October 2nd. Meanwhile, many fans at EVO got their hands on Marvel TOKON: Fighting Souls, with many more when the closed beta comes on September 6th. Still, both games are some of the studio’s and are sure to make a splash with attendees.</p>

<p>Following an announcement earlier this month, Nintendo's free Switch eShop and smart device application <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hello_mario">Hello, Mario!</a> is now available to download.</p>
<p>This game is designed for parents and their children and is only available in Japan right now. If you want to download the game on your Switch or Switch 2, you'll need to have access to a Japanese Nintendo account.</p>
<p>When you boot up the application, the message "play together with an adult!" appears on the screen and from there, Mario's face will pop up and you can interact with it. You can also use the block in the corner of the screen to access items and other interactive objects.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067qxpnvz&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

</blockquote>

<p>According to the eShop page, Hello, Mario! is only playable in handheld mode and requires 156 MB on Switch and 166 MB on Switch 2 to install.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>As part of the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/category/action_tps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam TPS Fest</a>, the multiplayer 5v5 shooter Last Flag released a surprise demo today. The fest, which celebrates Third-Person games with sales and demos, started today. While many demos were already available, like Star Wars Outlaws, Last Flag is one title nobody expected to see. </p>



<p>Last Flag, scheduled for 2026 for Steam (with console versions in the works), is a 5v5 multiplayer shooter by Night Street Games based on the infamous Capture the Flag mode. With a unique 70s art style and fun gameplay, it definitely stands out from other titles like Call of Duty and Battlefield. Therefore, the surprise release of a limited-time demo is sure to get some attention, especially after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-record-stats/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6’s success</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-last-flag-s-free-demo-lasts-from-august-25th-to-september-1st">Last Flag’s Free Demo Lasts from August 25th to September 1st</h2>







<p>As per a press release, a free demo for Last Flag is available now on Steam for players to try. The demo will only be up for a week, ending September 1st. To get the demo, head over to the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2721340/Last_Flag/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official Steam page</a> and download the demo. </p>



<p>With multiple characters to choose from, with a wide range of abilities, you’ll work together with your team to hide the flag and capture it. In addition, music for the game has been worked on by Dan Reynolds (Imagine Dragons), Grammy-nominated producer/writer JT Daly (Benson Boone), and Dave Lowmiller (Call of Duty: Modern Warfare). It seems like the perfect mix for players to create an unforgettable experience on and off the battleground.</p>



<p>Do you plan on playing Last Flag this week? If you have, how are you liking it? Let us know in the comments and on the forums!</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/rpg-designer-goes-missing-after-crowdfunding-award-winning-game.1280304/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The perils of backing a crowdfunded game <a href="https://rpggeek.com/geeklist/160421/controversial-or-fraudulent-kickstarters?itemid=7809913" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">are nothing new</a>; a successfully-financed campaign failing to deliver is hardly an outlier, and is often down to the team behind it being inexperienced. In the case of the RPG <em>Grimwild</em>, however, the lack of a delivered project is for potentially more serious reasons.</p><p>The tabletop RPG, which<a href="https://www.backerkit.com/c/projects/OddityPress/grimwild" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> was originally supported in 2024 on crowdfunding site BackerKit by 590 people for $40,000</a> (before<a href="https://www.backerkit.com/c/projects/OddityPress/grimwild-hardcover-reprint" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> a later hardcover version was backed by 597 for a further $47,000</a>), promised a "cinematic narrative rules system" which eschewed the finer points of rules in favour of a game that was more "concerned with the dramatic over the realistic". After a few updates to the rules and some production delays, both physical editions of the rulebook<a href="https://www.backerkit.com/c/projects/OddityPress/grimwild/updates/21610" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> were supposed to be delivered to customers in July</a>.</p><p>That window has obviously come and gone, with no books delivered. In an <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/1meaho5/grimwild_designer_missing/?share_id=rCU9CP0TaWK4YjRZMMkjd&amp;utm_content=2&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ioscss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">update</a> delivered to backers on the game's community Discord server last month, a moderator explained why, revealing that nobody involved with the book's production had been able to get in touch with Grimwild's designer, J.D. Maxwell, for weeks.</p><p>"As many of you have noticed, Max has been absent for nearly two months", the statement says. "Initially, we weren’t too worried. We knew he needed a break. Launching a successful crowdfunding campaign and a project like this is as rewarding as it is exhausting, and Max had also been going through some real-life changes that we hoped he was taking time to adjust to and enjoy."</p><p>Maxwell's colleagues on the game's design and production, Per Janke and Luke Saunders, have been "doing everything they can to reach Max or at least someone who can confirm he’s okay", and acknowledge that they "understand how confusing, frustrating, and even worrying this situation is".</p><p>A crowdfunded game designer cutting off all contact after getting their money would normally be cause for concern among the backer community, sparking fears the game would never be completed. In this case, however, things are different; not only is the game finished and the manufacturing costs reportedly already paid for--fans have been able to play a downloadable edition of <em>Grimwild </em>for months now, it's only the physical book deliveries that are being held up--<a href="https://ennie-awards.com/2025-winners/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">but just a few weeks ago both Maxwell and <em>Grimwild</em>'s free pdf version were nominated for, and won, an award at the Ennies</a>.</p><p>Yet physical deliveries have been unable to proceed because the manufacturing accounts are in Maxwell's name, while Janke and Saunders (who are just freelancers on the project, not employees of Maxwell's company) have run into the same issue with the game's Backerkit page, so they're unable to publish updates there either. Meanwhile the website for Oddity Press, Maxwell's publishing entity responsible for the game, is now down and showing a "website expired" error.</p><p>"None of us were involved in the actual process of the crowdfunding or order of the printing", Janke tells Aftermath. "So we’re trying to make any effort to figure out the situation around J.D. Maxwell and the current state of the crowdfunding campaign. I got in contact with the printer and as far as we know the order for the <em>Grimwild</em> print did go through to them. But without a final go from J.D. as the only legal entity from Oddity Press, the printing process can’t be started, unfortunately."</p><p>As a result, the remaining team say in their update that until Maxwell can be located, "Fulfilment of the project appears to be on hold indefinitely". "Until a few months ago it looked like everything was on track for the expected delivery of July this year", Saunders tells Aftermath, "but Max has been gone for a while now and there’s nothing we can do on our side to help with fulfilment I’m afraid."</p><p>A couple of days after I spoke with Janke and Saunders, the latter posted an update on the game's Discord saying they had "submitted a detailed report to the BackerKit Trust &amp; Safety Team regarding the current situation", and that the team's hope is that "BackerKit will be able to move things forward as they have much greater legal capacity and resources than we do."</p><p>The <em>Grimwild</em> community are asking anyone who may know how to get in contact with Maxwell to reach out to the game's Discord mods privately.</p><p><em>[Thanks James G]</em></p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/overwatch-2-interview-pvp"><h3>Overwatch 2 Developers Say They’re Leaning Into What Works</h3></a><p>'We are trying to take bigger swings, bigger risks, and bring more change to the game faster than we did in the past.'</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/silksong-indie-delays"><h3>Indie Devs Are Delaying Their Games Because Of Silksong [Update]</h3></a><p>'I feel like a little krill trying to not get eaten by a blue whale,' wrote one developer</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/video-game-trailer-capture-director-maker"><h3>A ‘Game Capture Director’ Is The Person Who Gets The Gameplay Footage For A Video Game Trailer</h3></a><p>'The coolest thing I’ve ever done is probably put references to both Jaws and Pac-Mac in a single trailer'</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/grimwild-backerkit-ttrpg-rpg-designer-missing]]></content:encoded>

It's "incredibly exciting and original," and "bold work that deserves to be encouraged," at least, according to our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review">review</a>. As a result, fans might be hoping for an eventual third game in the series. But for right now, Kojima isn't planning to make Death Stranding 3...even though he already has a concept written.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Kojima said this in an interview in Riyadh, Saudia Arabia, as a part of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/AwQDoD9TK6w" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Death Stranding 2 World Strand Tour</a>. When asked by the interviewer about Death Stranding 3, he replied with the following:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I'm not planning to do that at the moment, because the ending of Death Stranding 2 was my finale of 1 and 2.

                <p dir="ltr">Without being hyperbolic--and as someone who has been an on-and-off again Overwatch fan since the original game's release back in 2016--I don't mean it lightly when I say that I believe Overwatch has never been better.</p><p dir="ltr">I've critiqued the series quite a bit throughout the years. In my <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/overwatch-2-review-same-as-it-ever-was/1900-6417972/">Overwatch 2 review</a>, I wrote at length about how it felt "detached from the principles and charm of the original," was seemingly struggling to retain its identity, and how its new monetization models felt disingenuous and "at odds with the spirit of the original Overwatch." Harsh words, yes, but I meant them. I was frustrated by what one of my all-time favorite games had become, and worried that I'd be chasing the same bliss I felt playing in 2017 endlessly and to no avail.</p><p dir="ltr">So, with all that said, how did we get here?</p><p dir="ltr">I recently had the opportunity to discuss the state of Overwatch 2 with game director Aaron Keller and associate game director Alec Dawson in an exclusive interview for GameSpot, and it seems a lot of this dramatic turn-around boils down to two things: an increased emphasis on responding to player feedback, and a sharp pivot away from the "conservative" mentality the Overwatch 2 team once clung to. The result is a vastly improved game that is taking big swings with more efficiency.</p><p dir="ltr">Be it Stadium mode, Perks, the inclusion of heroes with never-before-tried mechanics, map voting, hero bans, or one of the many other tweaks and additions made to the game, Blizzard is not shying away from shaking up Overwatch 2's core gameplay loop; Season 18 is no exception. And according to Keller and Dawson, all these changes are just the beginning of the studio's push to "explore how big" Overwatch can become.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>GameSpot: A lot of changes have happened this year in Overwatch 2, so I would love to start by unpacking that with you both. How do you think things are going? How are you feeling about the overall health of the game?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Keller: </strong>When you look at the way that 2025 has gone for the game, we've done a lot of big releases. Earlier this year, we released our Perk system, which was a pretty substantial game mechanic that changed the way moment-to-moment gameplay can happen. It gave players more strategic choices that they could make over the course of a match and put more emphasis on what a hero can do and [fulfilling] that power fantasy.</p><p dir="ltr">In Season 16, we released Stadium. It's probably the biggest new game mode we've ever introduced to the game and there was a lot of player excitement there. We've done a lot of other things, too. We introduced hero bans this year. We introduced map voting this year. We've introduced a new hero as well, with another one soon to come.</p><p dir="ltr">A lot of players are now telling us that this is the best state that Overwatch has ever been in and we think that some of that is because we're making bigger changes to the game than we typically would have in the past. If you look back on the history of Overwatch, you could say that maybe we're a little bit conservative, but we have a new mindset and a new vision for how we operate the game. [We want] to be taking bigger swings and bigger bets with Overwatch, and I think you'll see that when we get to Season 18.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4556086-ow2_s18_stadium_abilities_brigitte_kaptensweden.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556086" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1024" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4556086-ow2_s18_stadium_abilities_brigitte_kaptensweden.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556086"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4556086-ow2_s18_stadium_abilities_brigitte_kaptensweden.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>That's great to hear. Touching on that, I would love to hear a little bit more about what's coming tomorrow in Season 18.</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Dawson: </strong>We look at Season 18 as sort of the next steps for a number of the big swings we've taken this year. There's around 60 new Perks that are brand new--every hero gets [a refresh]. Quick play is coming to Stadium, and then you have four new heroes coming: Brigitte, Winston, Farah, and then Tracer.</p><p dir="ltr">A lot of what we're doing in [Season] 18 [stems from] evaluating what's in the game currently and evolving it in some way and/or even revamping it. Our progression system is a great example. It's been one of those things that's been in the game for a bit now, but there's a lot of screen space that players weren't really caring about; a lot of bars going up, a lot of things you're leveling up. We want to simplify it--make sure it's a lot more visible, make sure it's a lot more surfaced.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Keller: </strong>We are doing a total revamp to our progression system. When you looked at our progression system before, it kind of just felt like there were just a bunch of bars going up all the time. It was pretty complex and so we've simplified it. But the exciting thing about it is that, not only is it easier to understand, but it has a lot of cool new rewards too.</p><p dir="ltr">There's a whole rewards track where you're updating things like emotes and Play of the Game [intros]--even loot boxes and legendary loot boxes. There's a whole Ascended State where you get a really cool icon with VFX on it that lets you and other players know just how much time you've put into each one of your heroes. We have a new Hero [Skill Rating] system coming out, so you're going to know how good [you are] not just at a [particular] role, but how well you play each of your heroes in Competitive. You can see which ones you're better at, and which ones you're worse at. We also have a new advanced hero info panel, where you can look up stats on what all of the different heroes do.</p><p dir="ltr">We're bringing Stadium to Quick Play, which is one of the biggest requests that our players have for the mode, and that's coming with cross-play enabled. We have four new heroes coming to Stadium, a new game mode, Payload Race, and two brand new maps for it. You mentioned Wuyang, our new support hero, is coming, and we have changes to Roadhog too. Lucio Ball is back--this time in third-person--and there's mouse and keyboard support coming to console.</p><p dir="ltr">We even have [things] on the cosmetic side. Kiriko's getting this skateboard emote [that lets her] travel around the maps riding a skateboard. The Mythic [Character] skins and Mythic Weapon skins are really cool this season… It's a huge update to Overwatch. This is going to be one of the biggest seasons we've ever had for the game.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Is this the biggest update in terms of sheer content? Because I feel like, based on what you're saying, I don't know if there's ever been an update quite this big.</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Keller: </strong>I don't want to jump into hyperbole and say like this is the biggest one coming, but man, it's… it is big.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Dawson: </strong>There's truth to that, though, to some degree. I think our team has been getting better and better about structuring our seasons to where, now, we can create some really big beats. Season 9 felt like a big change in the game, and then they went to Season 12 which had Juno and a bunch of competitive updates. 15 and 16 [added] Perks and Stadium. And now 18, is another massive update for Overwatch. We've been getting a lot more efficient and a lot better at planning over time, which has led to these big moments for Overwatch. [We can now] decide, like, "Hey, how do we want to change the game for the middle of the year?"</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4556085-ovr_pk_s18_h44_aqua_beautyshot_001.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556085" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1024" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4556085-ovr_pk_s18_h44_aqua_beautyshot_001.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556085"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4556085-ovr_pk_s18_h44_aqua_beautyshot_001.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>I can sense that. Even with your newest hero, Wuyang--he feels extremely different.</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Keller: </strong>Yeah, there's a lot of unique mechanics and abilities with Wuyang that I just think it'd be great to touch on. He can surf on his own private wave and cruise around the map. He gets this speed boost with it, too, and is able to jump over gaps and things like that. He can use his staff to create this wave of water in front of him that knocks down enemies, and can turn himself or allies basically into ticking time bombs by imbuing them with water. But what I'm most excited about with Wuyang is his primary fire. He shoots out this orb, and you can kind of do it rapid fire, but at any moment, you can also take control of it and steer it, turning it into a guided missile. Even if they take cover, you can actually bend it around a corner. There's some skill expression here. It takes a little bit of practice to actually be able to do it, but once you get it, it feels so satisfying.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Dawson:</strong> I think he's one of the best support heroes we've ever made. He's an example of what a support is in Overwatch 2, where you can have a ton of impact through your offense and can make game-changing plays. Wuyang is dynamic in the sense that he has to go from offense to defense quite quickly. All of your attention is gonna be on the primary fire, landing some of those shots, and tracking people down, but then you have these defensive options that you're going to [need to] be really timely with. His guardian wave is this big wave that gives healing and gives heal boosts--it can change the fight instantly.</p><p dir="ltr">I think players are going to really love him. I know we're not supposed to play favorites, but he's a joy to play with and I think he's really special.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>I think he's also one of the first heroes where his skills and powers feel almost more magical rather than technological, right? I feel like Overwatch historically has always leaned more into tech rather than magic. Was that a conversation that had to be had when developing him?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Keller: </strong>Oh yeah, and we have those conversations all the time. We had those conversations a lot with both Hanzo and Genji, you know, because when they summon the dragon, that feels like a pretty magical thing there as well. We do have our own internal explanations for that that we'll actually get into at some point with our players, but we're not quite ready to yet. I guess all I can really say right now is that Overwatch is a science fiction game, and so there is an explanation behind the way those work.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>At this point, do you feel like you're still fighting that initial nature of being conservative? Like you both said, for a long time, Overwatch was more conservative. Are you still fighting that hesitation or is it like, "Nope, we're all in"?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Keller: </strong>I think the team has left a lot of the hesitation about being conservative behind. The question for us really is, how big do we go with releases for Overwatch? Because there's two sides of this coin. There's an active player base that really appreciates the way that the game plays right now, you know. But we also see that, anytime we do make a big release for the game, players respond to it really positively.</p><p dir="ltr">So we want to keep going big. I think what we want to do is explore how big we really can go for Overwatch. And I think as we hit seasons like 18 here, and we see players' excitement, that gives us the confidence to know this isn't just the right direction--this is something that we can expand on in the future. We can keep pushing the boundaries of what a release for Overwatch can be.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>With the implementation of Stadium, did you see a spike in people playing Overwatch 2? If so, how is retention following that?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Keller: </strong>There was a <em>huge</em> spike of people jumping into Stadium when it first came out. I think we went public at one point saying that over 50% of play hours in Overwatch were in Stadium. And when we do have new modes for the game, we do always see that initial burst of excitement and then it'll kind of taper off after that. And Stadium did taper off, but not to the extent that our other modes have. It's still, I think, our third most popular mode in the game right now, just behind Quick Play and Competitive.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Dawson:</strong> We view Stadium as one of the main ways to play Overwatch, and Season 18 as almost Stadium's 1.0 launch. A lot of players are clamoring to have Quick Play in there. They're clamoring for something that's a little bit more brief and doesn't have a rank associated with it. So with Quick Play, it's a best-of-five round structure and you power up your hero even faster as well.</p><p dir="ltr">And then the other main piece of feedback from players is, "Hey, my favorite hero isn't here." So we're continuing to release new heroes into Stadium. We're going to be doing that throughout the rest of the year and there's four this season who I'm really excited about. Tracer in particular. I think… She's a little wild.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Keller: </strong>I'm super excited about Winston jumping into Stadium. I love playing as him and using his mobility. Sometimes with Winston, you just feel like you're holding down primary fire a little bit too long to actually be doing what you want to do. [With Stadium], you can really juice his gun and it feels so satisfying.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4556087-ow2_s18_stadium_3pview_winston.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556087" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1024" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4556087-ow2_s18_stadium_3pview_winston.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556087"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4556087-ow2_s18_stadium_3pview_winston.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>How did you land on those four heroes and what are some other heroes who you see people clamoring for and are on the docket? If you can't say right now, can you share what gameplay styles you're focused on bringing in?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Keller:</strong> There's a lot of things we look at when we're looking at heroes for Stadium. First and foremost is how well we feel like we can make a really cool set of abilities for them. We want every hero in there to really double down on "hero fantasy." We want to make sure that comes across to our players.</p><p dir="ltr">For the first few seasons of Stadium, we really tried to have at least a few heroes per role. Eventually, I think we're going to have to break that pattern and start moving into other patterns. I think we'll start seeing, you know, maybe different numbers of heroes coming to Stadium with different role ratios.</p><p dir="ltr">We want to make sure that heroes that we know a lot of people play are available there. Like Alex said, you know, we have a lot of people saying things like, "Hey, I'm just sitting on the sidelines, waiting for my hero to join the cast." So we want to make sure that we're opening up that funnel.</p><p dir="ltr">There's also a few heroes we're avoiding, you know? Like Widowmaker, who is a controversial hero that's designed around a one-shot [kill]. I think that there's probably some learnings we need to do with how we build those heroes--how we build counters for some of the sharper mechanics.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>There was a recent IGN article in which you said that you'd "dropped the ball with story in Overwatch 2," and I thought that was interesting to bring up this far removed from the announcement of PvE being dropped. So do you have plans to course-correct going forward?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Keller:</strong> Yeah. When you look back at the history of Overwatch, there are moments where there was more or less lore--where we were developing more or less story for players. And one of the things that we hear from our community--and we've been hearing it a lot lately--is that they just want there to be more of that in the game. That it feels like we're doing less of it.</p><p dir="ltr">So I think I'm actually really excited for the Wuyang hero trailer to come out and for people to get a glimpse at that hero and maybe how they tie into the bigger, broader universe. It's something that I can't really go into a lot right now, but I'm excited for players to be able to get in touch with more lore over the coming seasons this year.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Based on that, do you plan on having more heroes come from similar factions or the same countries? I know that, for a while there, there was more avoidance since you're trying to represent a lot of different backgrounds. But at the same time--and with the lack of PvE--do you find yourself thinking "Well actually let's add this person's best friend and have more storytelling through voice lines?" Or "Let's try to add folks from the same factions."</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Dawson: </strong>Yeah, there's a delicate balance to it. We don't want to make it feel like heroes are appearing out of nowhere and like [players always have] this brand-new thing to learn. I think we've created a universe over quite some time that is very rich with tons of different characters from different factions, and we want to lean into that more and more.</p><p dir="ltr">Even some of the things you saw in the Freya story trailer earlier this year link back to some of the things we've already built in the world. We want to make sure that we're pulling from that world because there are characters that people have only gotten glimpses of, that they love, or that could end up as heroes one day.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Keller: </strong>As far as where our heroes hail from, we do still like to spread heroes out across like all over the globe. That's a really important value that we've got. We do like our heroes to feel like they represent Earth, but not in the strictest sense. We don't have 40% of our heroes from China and India, which is maybe what a true representation of the global population would be.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4556088-ovr_pk_s15_h43_freja_002.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556088" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1024" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4556088-ovr_pk_s15_h43_freja_002.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556088"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4556088-ovr_pk_s15_h43_freja_002.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>Has the team considered any other avenues for more large-scale storytelling? I'm sure you see the success of series like Arcane and Castlevania on Netflix, and I wonder if that has been something that you're interested in pursuing.</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Keller:</strong> The team would love to have something like that come out. You know, we're also fans of those shows and fans of those universes. To have something like that for Overwatch would be really, really cool. But I can't really discuss the plans for future stuff like that.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>I completely understand. I just ask because it's something that I want to manifest into the universe. But on the subject of Overwatch's story--and now that we're a little bit more removed from what happened--do you want to go into a little bit more detail on why things didn't really work out with story missions?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Keller: </strong>I know Blizzard holds their cards kind of close to their chests sometimes. But I don't think we really saw the critical success that we wanted and it forced us to really analyze where we were putting our time and resources. At the end of the day, what we've been telling our players is that we want to make the game that they want to play. And the game that our players have been playing is this competitive, PvP-focused hero shooter. We really realized that that was the game that we needed to invest our time into.</p><p dir="ltr">Following the release of our sole campaign, we did a really big pivot internally on the team. We wanted to focus on what it means to be a best-in-class hero shooter. What are the competitive systems that we need in order to do that? What are some of the other systems?</p><p dir="ltr">In the year since that, we've focused on evolving the game our players play--on how we turn it into the best version of Overwatch it can be. That's why we started doing these much bigger systems, like Perks and Stadium. Now that we've corrected the course, it gives us the opportunity to make bigger steps with the game. And some of those are things that players are asking for, but then some of them are really big surprises. That's the future for Overwatch right now.</p><p><em>The above interview has been lightly edited for clarity, readability, and brevity.</em></p>

By contrast, Astro Bot also launched last year to universal acclaim, winning multiple awards and <a href="https://alineaanalytics.com/blog/astro-bot/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">selling 2.3 million copies as of March 2025</a>, one of the best-selling games on PlayStation 5.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The differences between the two games are myriad, certainly, and their development stories are quite different as well. But what Hulst has taken away from this is that there needs to be more supervision of Sony's owned studios to ensure that games veering in the direction of Concord are spotted before they become expensive failures, so they can be canceled or corrected in time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We have since put in place much more rigorous and more frequent testing in very many different ways,” Hulst said. “The advantage of every failure . . . is that people now understand how necessary that [oversight] is.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Financial Times spoke to multiple Sony studio heads, who said that this oversight means more focus on group testing, more communication between internal Sony studios, and closer relationships between the studios' top executives. “If we’re heading towards a giant landmine, like there’s another studio making exactly the same game, that’s good information,” said Jason Connell, art director at Ghost of Yōtei studio Sucker Punch.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That comment rings especially poignant in light of Concord's failure, which analysts say occurred for a number of reasons, including an oversaturation of multiplayer, live service shooters. Hulst suggests in the interview that PlayStation isn't as intent on churning out live service games as it used to be. That said, PlayStation does have Bungie's Marathon coming up before March 2026, a game that has<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/after-concords-failure-and-marathons-delay-sony-admits-playstations-live-service-strategy-is-not-entirely-going-smoothly"> a number of Bungie fans concerned</a> amid <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-admits-marathon-feedback-has-been-varied-but-insists-it-will-avoid-repeating-concord-mistakes-and-commits-to-launch-by-end-of-march-2026">delays</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/destiny-developer-bungie-cuts-220-staff-some-of-the-most-difficult-changes-weve-ever-had-to-make-as-a-studio">staff layoffs</a>, and a general lack of information as to what the game entails.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But there's another strategy Hulst also wants to pursue: he wants more, massive Sony IP. Astro Bot's success has come about over the course of multiple games, with the little robot icon growing in popularity each time. According to Financial Times, Hulst wants studios to be thinking about how their IP can be turned into bigger and bigger franchises over time, following in the footsteps of The Last of Us and Uncharted. “We take a very intentional approach to IP creation . . . understanding how a new concept can turn into an iconic franchise for PlayStation, that can then again become a franchise for people beyond gaming,” he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Currently on the docket, PlayStation has Ghost of Yōtei and Lost Soul Aside coming this year, with Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls and Housemarque's Saros for 2026. Other games such as Fairgames, Marvel's Wolverine, Naughty Dog's Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, Marathon, and more remain in the works.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

                <p>Fans of cooperative climbing game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/peak/" data-ref-id="5000-682347">Peak</a> know that ticks aren't the only bug in the game, and for the last week they've been subject to a particularly frustrating one that developers are now aware of and working to resolve: the brand new biome, the Mesa, has been missing for the last week, with only the original Alpine biome showing up in the game's seed-generated maps.</p><p>"For the last 7 days, every map has had the ALPINE," developer Team Peak wrote in a post on the game's Steam page. "Players are starting to wonder if the MESA was a dream all along. A mirage."</p><p>The developers chalk this up to one of two potential causes. One is that "[the game's map generator] randomly rolled ALPINE 7 days in a row which has a 0.78% chance of happening." While that's possible, they submit another potential cause: "Orrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr its (<em>sic)</em> a bug."</p><p>For the last week, climbers have been subjected to the bitter, whipping cold of the Alpine biome. But sometimes you'd rather free solo El Capitan than the north face of the Eiger. To give us all a break from the cold, the team is forcing Mesa as the game's third biome "until further notice," which they specify will be later this week.</p><p>On the beta side of the game, the developers are working on reenabling rising lava in the final level, the Kiln, and testing a photosensitive mode.</p><p>Previously, the team has been working to quickly update the game with new features, with the most recent being getting the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/peak-is-now-steam-deck-verified-and-the-cannon-glitch-is-fixed/1100-6534220/" data-ref-id="1100-6534220">Steam Deck Verified checkmark</a> on their game, as well as adding optional cannibalism to the game in the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cute-climbing-game-peaks-latest-totally-normal-update-adds-in-totally-not-normal-cannibalism/1100-6533552/" data-ref-id="1100-6533552">Totally Normal Update</a> and adding the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-peak-update-adds-a-hot-biome-that-will-have-players-packing-sunscreen/1100-6533840/" data-ref-id="1100-6533840">aforementioned Mesa biome</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Ahead of Gamescom 2025, NVIDIA <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-geforce-now-blackwell-rtx-5080-pc-like-latency-image-quality-install-to-play-new-games-same-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> what it has been calling the largest upgrade ever made to its GeForce NOW cloud gaming platform. The backbone is, of course, the advent of the Blackwell architecture previously seen in the GeForce RTX 50 Series graphics cards.</p>



<p>The Ultimate tier will be updated with RTX 5080-class (a server equivalent to the desktop GPU) GPU hardware and AMD Zen 5 CPUs. The new server hardware will deliver 62 teraflops of compute performance and a 48GB frame buffer, not to mention a performance uplift of up to 2.8x compared to the previous generation, partly thanks to NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation.</p>



<p>While important, though, this hardware upgrade is just a portion of the enhancements coming to GeForce NOW that NVIDIA showed off to press, Wccftech included, at a dedicated Gamescom 2025 event. One of the new features, Cinematic Quality Streaming or CQS, is actually a set of features that includes additions like YUV 4:4:4 chroma sampling and 10-bit HDR, AV1 support with RPR (Reference Picture Resampling), new AI-based sharpness filters to reduce noise and artifacts and make games' heads-up display (HUD) clearer, and DPI awareness. The latter is important, NVIDIA Product Marketing Manager Michael McSorley explained, because sometimes GeForce NOW didn't quite catch the correct native resolution of a user device (especially laptops) and started the streaming at a lower resolution. As a result, the user got a blurrier image that certainly didn't impress them with sharpness.</p>



<p>Overall, Cinematic Quality Streaming makes quite a bit of a difference when viewed in person side-by-side, especially in a highly detailed game like Game Science's Black Myth: Wukong, which supports full path tracing. The finer details, such as vegetation and the main character's hair, were a lot sharper with CQS enabled, reducing one of the long-standing visual downsides of cloud gaming when compared to local gaming: image compression. Of course, the difference will likely be better appreciated on a large 4K display. It should be noted that, barring the first two CQS features, the rest will also be available on non-Blackwell servers.</p>



<p>NVIDIA then flexed the power of the Blackwell-enhanced GeForce NOW experience directly against the most powerful console on the market, Sony's PlayStation 5 Pro. The game selected was CD Projekt RED's Cyberpunk 2077, which the new Ultimate tier can handle easily with path tracing enabled and 4K@120FPS streaming. By comparison, the PlayStation 5 Pro version of the game was set to the Ray Tracing mode, which, however, locks the frame rate to 40FPS, and is also much inferior visually compared to the PC version's path tracing. With three times as powerful hardware as the PS5 Pro, NVIDIA boasts that the best console-like experience can be streamed via its upgraded cloud gaming service.</p>

<iframe title="GeForce NOW Gamescom 2025 Demo Tour" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/K1kk8coHbg0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>GeForce NOW is also evolving when it comes to latency, another inherent problem with cloud gaming. The NVIDIA servers already supported Reflex, but they are now being updated with <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/networking/rivermax" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rivermax</a> hardware packet pacing, an NVIDIA technology that enables direct data transfers to and from the GPU, delivering 'best-in-class throughput and latency with minimal CPU utilization for streaming workloads', according to the GeForce company. </p>



<p>In addition to that, NVIDIA has been working in the last couple of years with various ISPs to persuade them to add L4S (Low Latency, Low Loss and Scalable Throughput). This network protocol has the potential to reduce latency when sending and receiving packets. Unfortunately, L4S has to be adopted by the ISPs; so far, Comcast, T-Mobile, and BT Group have done it, but there's many more to go across all the countries supported by GeForce NOW. Moreover, the router you're using must support L4S, too, which means even if your ISP has added L4S to its network, you may have to change the router if you've got an old one. It is, of course, far from guaranteed that ISPs will issue everyone a new compatible router for free.</p>



<p>On the local devices, NVIDIA is adding support for 90FPS streaming on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-gets-native-steam-deck-app/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">native Steam Deck app</a>, 120FPS streaming on the new <a href="https://wccftech.com/lenovo-legion-go-s-handheld-amd-ryzen-z2-soc-priced-lower-than-legion-go/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lenovo Legion Go S</a>, 4K@120FPS streaming on LG TVs via the native GFN app, 5K@120FPS on LG OLED monitors, and 1080P@360FPS or 1440P@240FPS. At 360FPS streaming, NVIDIA showed an end-to-end latency (not just network latency) of less than 30ms, with peaks of 15-17ms, making it more than viable to play competitive shooters via GeForce NOW. Of course, there's always room for improvement, and we asked Michael McSorley whether NVIDIA would ever try to shelve a few more milliseconds of latency by creating a direct connection from the wireless gamepad to the GeForce NOW servers, like Stadia did. The Product Marketing Manager said it could happen, though they'd have to find a suitable partner on the gamepad side.</p>



<p>There's more, as NVIDIA is also extending the GFN support of racing wheel devices as well as expanding accessibility through the 2200 new Steam games that will benefit from the new Install-to-Play feature, not to mention a limited-time GFN trial available to stream Fortnite directly via Discord.</p>



<p>One thing is clear: NVIDIA already offers the best cloud gaming experience, and all these improvements can only bring it closer to the experience of playing locally. We'll need to do private testing of the new Blackwell-architecture GeForce NOW servers to say exactly how much. The rollout will gradually begin next month with only 20 games supported, though that list is expected to grow rapidly.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/gamescom-onl-2025-resident-evil-silent-hill-silksong-2000618460">Gamescom 2025</a> was the biggest on record. Maybe your eyes began to glaze over from the multi-day barrage of new game announcements, trailers, and interviews. Now that the dust has begun to settle, we can finally reflect on a few of the fresh looks at cool, upcoming projects that may have gone under the radar. The following games didn’t catch the Gamescom spotlight, but they did catch my eye. Here are six neat trailers you probably missed.</p> <h2><em>Katanaut</em> is a cosmic horror slash ’em up</h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Katanaut - Release Date Reveal - FGS Live From gamescom" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bCRCTGSTaBQ?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3032830/Katanaut/"><em>Katanaut</em></a> is a 2D pixel art roguelite about killing tons of abominations in a post-apocalyptic urban hellscape. You run, slash, dodge, and find lots of power-ups along the way. Will survival be rewarded with some cooler sci-fi story reveals than your average roguelike? I hope so. It comes to PC on September 10.</p> <h2><em>Wild Blue</em> brings back classic Star Fox vibes</h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Wild Blue | Gameplay Trailer | PC &amp; Xbox Series X|S" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mFzYMGiSrfw?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1921490/Wild_Blue/"><em>Wild Blue</em></a> is an on-rails shooter starring anthropomorphic animals trying to save the world one blown-up enemy ship at a time. It’s being developed by Chuhai Labs, founded by Giles Goddard, one of the original programmers of <em>Star Fox</em> on the SNES. While we’ve gotten a few other spiritual successors like <em>Whisker Squadron: Survivor</em>, a new Star Fox doesn’t seem in the cards anytime soon, so the more the merrier. There’s no release date yet.</p>

 <h2><em>Kaidan</em> is a samurai extraction game</h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="KAIDAN - World Premiere Trailer - FGS Live From gamescom" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h7fpiG0gzqs?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3744040/Kaidan/"><em>Kaidan</em></a>‘s trailer might be giving some people Soulslike flashbacks, but it actually seems like it might have more in common with the quick, arcade action of a 3D <em>Ninja Gaiden</em>. You play as a samurai in feudal Japan fighting Cthulhu-infused horrors, but the real twist is that it’s an extraction-lite. You’ll prepare for missions, select from multiple characters, and head into them solo or with an online group to fight mythical Yokai and try to come out the other side alive. It’s confirmed for a release on PC, but there’s no timeframe yet.</p> <h2><em>Project Bloomwalker</em> is a Studio Ghibli-looking cozy sim with a twist</h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Project Bloomwalker - Official Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZsmRAs0GJEo?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/08/21/project-bloomwalker-gamescom-hands-on-preview/"><em>Project Bloomwalker</em></a> is about removing blight from the world with a magical house that’s moved around by robotic legs. Once you settle down somewhere, you forage for materials, craft crystals, and try to get everything you need to restore the area to its natural splendor before moving on again. There are more than a few hints of <em>Howl’s Moving Castle</em> in the air, and the best part is that you get to recruit cute little creatures called Oddlings to help you with your survival crafting chores.</p> <h2><em>Lost Hellden</em> has the PS2-era JRPG charm</h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Lost Hellden - Gameplay Trailer | PS5 Games" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ouvf7HwjuD0?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2355020/Lost_Hellden/"><em>Lost Hellden</em></a> is an old-school Japanese RPG with shades of PS2 classics like <em>Rogue Galaxy</em> and <em>Dragon Quest</em> 8. There’s a job system, skill tree, and painterly backdrops to the areas you’re exploring. <em>Final Fantasy</em> veteran Hitoshi Sakimoto is helping with the music, and <em>Gravity Rush</em> artist Takeshi Oga is involved with the character art. Combat blends turn-based decision-making with real-time mechanics. There’s even a card-based mini-game. It’s all there on paper, though I’ve seen enough of these kinds of games fail to stick the landing to keep me cautiously optimistic.</p> <h2><em>Morsels</em> is a <em>Pokémon</em>-like collectathon in the sewers</h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="MORSELS | Release Date Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fy4A0vHr6GU?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1719040/Morsels/"><em>Morsels</em></a> has you play as a mouse who transforms into strange creatures mutated by sewer life and has access to unique abilities. Structured as a roguelite, you can swap between the creatures you encounter on demand in order to fight your way back up to the surface and defeat the ruling regime of cats. Some are calling it a cross between<em> The Binding of Isaac</em> and <em>Atomicorps</em>. It looks really pretty and is mixing together enough different ideas to have a shot at distinguishing itself in a crowded genre. It’s set to launch on console and PC on November 18.</p>
