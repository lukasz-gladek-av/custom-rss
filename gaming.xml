			<p>Today, ArenaNet has unveiled Guild Wars 2: Janthir Wilds, the fifth expansion (following Secrets of the Obscure, which just <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-midnight-king-the-final-content-update-for-guild-wars-2-secrets-of-the-obscure-is-out-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">got its final content update</a> for the MMORPG originally released in 2012.</p>
<p>Janthir Wilds will be released on August 20, priced at $24.99, with <a href="https://buy.guildwars2.com/en-us/janthir-wilds" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pre-orders open now</a>. Bonus<br>
items include a Serpent’s Wrath weapon set, the Whispering Serpent Pauldrons shoulder armor, the Homesteader character title, a shared inventory slot, and a level 80 character boost. The Deluxe Edition is priced at $49.99 and comes with the standard edition bundle plus another batch of exclusive items: the Wayfinder’s Versatile Table, a set of Eldritch Gathering Tools, an additional character slot, and an Identity Repair Kit. Finally, the Janthir Wilds Ultimate Edition ($74.99) includes the exclusive Standard and Deluxe Edition items, plus 4,000 Gems, the premium in-game store currency.</p>
<p>Guild Wars 2: Janthir Wilds will add several new features and content, such as proper player housing called Homesteads, which will feature a brand new customization and decorating interface so that heroes may create and adorn their very own housing space for their friends and guild mates.</p>
<p>The expansion also adds the first new endgame PvE Raid to Guild Wars 2 since 2019, featuring challenging boss battles. On August 20, two new explorable maps will be available: the bucolic Lowland Shore and the stormy Janthir Syntri. A third will follow in future updates.</p>
<p>All professions (classes) will also finally get the chance to wield land spears. This new weapon type will be available during a limited time beta test between June 27 and 30. The Warclaw mount will also break out of PvP's World vs. World mode to join the player's mount stables as a new option for exploring the mountains and river valleys of Janthir, using its unique double-jump ability to navigate difficult terrain. Guild Wars 2: Janthir Wilds will also feature Titans, vaguely described as mysterious magical beings native to the land. They can channel the energy of the land itself.</p>
<p>Players looking for new legendary items to farm will find a spear and backpack item, along with a variety of new non-legendary armor and weapon sets.</p>

<p>Josh Davis, Guild Wars 2 Game Director, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>From the beginning we wanted to bring together many of the items that have been on both our and the community’s wishlist for years. Janthir Wilds is proof of our commitment to continue to surprise and delight while improving the Guild Wars 2 gameplay experience in unexpected ways, and to support game modes for both the cooperative and competitive communities.</em></p>
<p>ArenaNet also announced that Guild Wars 2 is coming to the Epic Games Store (after launching on Steam) later this Summer.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24171308/hogwarts-legacy-summer-update-harry-potter-exclusives<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="FCgDHc"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23603142/hogwarts-legacy-review-harry-potter-jk-rowling-transphobic-ps5-pc-xbox"><em>Hogwarts Legacy</em></a> is getting a substantial free update this week, more than a year after the game set in the wizarding world of Harry Potter debuted on PlayStation 5, Windows PC, and Xbox Series X. Developer Avalanche Software will release its summer 2024 update on all platforms on June 6 — here’s what <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em> owners can expect. </p>
<p id="PJ7OT3">The biggest new addition to <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em> is photo mode, which will let players take customized screenshots of their gameplay. The game’s new photo mode looks like what we’ve come to expect from other games with similar features, letting players snap pics and apply various effects, including frames and filters inspired by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/hogwarts-legacy-guide/23581208/house-sorting-quiz-test-gryffindor-slytherin-ravenclaw-hufflepuff-daring-curiosity-ambition-loyalty">Hogwarts’ famous houses</a>. You can put your young wizard or witch in various poses — including <em>sitting</em> — and change time of day and seasons for photos.</p>
<p id="LmA16m">A new quality of life feature will let players easily reset talent points from the Field Guide, but at the cost of 200 in-game gold per talent point. </p>
<p id="FV03HN">And for players who want to see and do it all, the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23352072/hogwarts-legacy-ps5-exclusive-mission-quest">Haunted Hogsmeade Shop quest</a> and its rewards will become available for all players of <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>. Previously, that quest was a PlayStation platform exclusive.</p>
<p id="ecri12">Avalanche Software is unlocking other exclusives as well: The onyx Hippogriff mount, previously a pre-order exclusive cosmetic item, will be available to all players, as will the Felix Felicis potion recipe, another PlayStation exclusive. The update will also give players some new cosmetics, including the Azkaban coat and prisoner’s outfit, and taped-up spectacles.</p>
<p id="5x75On"><em>Hogwarts Legacy</em> is available on Nintendo Switch, Playstation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X.</p>

This might lead you to try all sorts of wild maneuvers to uncover what these mysterious locations mean. Trust me, do <em>not </em>bother taking the M. Disc and trying to slot that in a recess while the ghost dog chases you.</p><div data-video-id="196923" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="355" data-playlist="196923,196922,196918" data-current="196923"><div><p>Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22494.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><p>In actuality, each Circular Recess is a gate that leads to an optional area in <em>Animal Well</em>.

<p>As someone who genuinely enjoys lengthy role-playing games, even those with a bit of grind, I cannot wait to see more about Dragon Age: Dreadwolf. I adore Inquisition, as do many of you, and it’s high time we receive a direct sequel. But will we see Dragon Age: Dreadwolf at Summer Game Fest?</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-the-dragon-age-dreadwolf-reveal">When is the Dragon Age: Dreadwolf Reveal?</h2>



<p>According to insider reports, which we’re working to corroborate, Dragon Age: Dreadwolf will receive a full reveal this week, likely during Summer Game Fest. Whether it happens during the Summer Game Fest Showcase, Xbox Games Showcase, or elsewhere, however, remains to be seen.</p>



<p>According to the report, the game will be unveiled in Summer 2024. It makes the most sense to showcase the open-world RPG at SGF 2024!</p>







<h2 id="h-does-dragon-age-dreadwolf-have-a-release-date">Does Dragon Age: Dreadwolf Have a Release Date?</h2>



<p>We don’t yet have a full unveiling, so there’s no official Dragon Age: Dreadwolf release date. However, Insider Gaming received reports regarding a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dragon-age-dreadwolf-will-reportedly-launch-by-march-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launch by March 2025</a>. We’ve previously heard the RPG will launch sometime this year, but an early 2025 release date seems more likely and appealing for EA to focus on.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-dragon-age-dreadwolf-a-direct-sequel">Is Dragon Age: Dreadwolf a Direct Sequel?</h2>



<p>Yes! It’s been revealed that Dragon Age: Dreadwolf, the fourth game in the long-running RPG franchise, is a direct sequel to Dragon Age: Inquisition. Players will take on the role of a hero, likely with full customization like in Inquisition, as we fight to stop Solas from ripping a hole in the Veil.</p>

Whether you're jumping back into the base game before release or starting from scratch altogether, the hype is slowly building.

That's at least $4.81 savings and 12% off one of the most anticipated DLCs ever.

Players will be able increase their power by seeking out minor bosses and defeating them, so this will be an additional factor to consider besides your level when entering the Land of Shadow.</p><p>If you're keen on saving a few extra dollars elsewhere, we also have a slew of other gaming deals roundups worth checking out, including the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-xbox-deals">best Xbox deals</a>, the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-playstation-ps5-deals">best PlayStation deals</a>, and the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-nintendo-switch-deals">best Nintendo Switch deals</a>.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dead-by-daylight/">Dead By Daylight</a> developer Behaviour Interactive has announced plans to lay off up to 95 employees as part of "several strategic structural changes" within the company that are meant to "draw upon [Behaviour Interactive's] historical strengths to craft an ambitious vision for its future success."</p><p dir="ltr">The announcement was made via <a href="https://media.bhvr.com/behaviour-interactive-implements-strategic-changes-for-future-growth" rel="nofollow ">a lengthy post on the company's website</a>, in which Behaviour Interactive acknowledged that the company's employee count had increased from 575 to 1,300 over the last five years.</p><p dir="ltr">"Over the same period, the greater gaming industry has also witnessed remarkable growth," the post reads. "However, the industry’s unprecedented popularity has also led to unprecedented competition."</p><p dir="ltr">"To pursue this clarified vision, Behaviour will implement multiple strategic changes to its corporate structure, improving the distinction between its product, production, business development, and marketing resources," the post continued, adding that the aforementioned "strategic changes" include laying off "up to 95 employees." Behaviour Interactive's Montreal studio seems to have been hit the hardest, with 70 employees being removed from their posts.</p><p dir="ltr">The announcement stated that the development of the studio's biggest IP, Dead By Daylight, will not be affected by the reduction in staff.</p><p dir="ltr">"I would like to express my deep personal appreciation for any employee affected by today’s changes," co-founder and CEO Rémi Racine said of the layoffs. "While changes to our structure and strategic vision have led to challenging decisions, we are confident that these decisions will position us for continued success. As we begin the next phase of Behaviour’s growth, our commitment to excellence in our products and workplace culture remains steadfast."</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-industry-layoffs-are-worse-than-ever-how-did-we-get-here/1100-6521799/">Layoffs in the gaming industry are at an all-time high</a>, and the announcement of Behaviour's layoffs comes just a day after Just Cause developer Avalanche Studios revealed it would be closing two studios--including its Montreal location, which had <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/just-cause-developer-closing-two-studios-including-one-thats-only-been-open-since-october/1100-6523899/">only been open for eight months</a>.</p>

                <p>If you don't live near an Ikea, we've got good news: The furniture outlet is bringing its many charms to Roblox. Ikea is launching <a href="https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/newsroom/corporate-news/ikea-is-opening-a-new-store-on-roblox-pub8a9272d0" rel="nofollow ">a virtual experience</a> called "The Co-Worker Game" that aims to simulate the experience of working in one of its real-life stores, complete with paid co-worker roles that the company will begin hiring for later in June.</p><p dir="ltr">To work at this virtual Ikea, you must reside in the UK or Ireland and you have to be 18 or older. Employees will be paid 13.15 GBP per hour, which is apparently the standard pay for a London Ikea co-worker. Applications for these roles opened on June 3 and will close on June 16. The announcement claims that this is the first instance of paid work from a major brand on Roblox as a platform.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1596/15969599/4312770-coworker.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4312770" data-ratio="0.72110552763819" data-width="796" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1596/15969599/4312770-coworker.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4312770"></a><figcaption>A look inside the virtual Ikea.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1596/15969599/4312770-coworker.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The virtual Ikea store launches on June 24, and it'll allow players to explore and redecorate Ikea showrooms, while also stopping for some of its famous Swedish meatballs at the food market and bistro. Players can also win exclusive Ikea-themed cosmetics and other user-generated content.</p><p dir="ltr">In other Roblox news, studio head Stefano Corazza <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/roblox-boss-talks-teens-making-money-on-the-game-disputes-exploitation-claims/1100-6522420/">recently stated</a> that the "majority" of those making money on the platform are 18 or older. He also said that the company has hired teenage developers that had "millions of players" on their content, and those developers didn't feel "exploited."</p>

The reveal is advertised for June 7, the day of the Devolver Direct showcase.</p>

<p>Heart Machine is currently working on <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/03/31/heart-machine-announces-hyper-light-breaker-enters-early-access-in-2023">Hyper Light Breaker</a>, a 3D third-person co-op action game that is the spiritual successor to Hyper Light Drifter. Gearbox is publishing that game, confirming Devolver's teaser is for something different. Based on this brief clip, it’s hard to gauge the nature of this game. It shows a sunset cityscape with a silhouette of a figure, the scene emblazoned with Heart Machine's logo. But given the studio’s impressive pedigree, we’re excited and surprised to see a new title so soon.</p>

		<p>Bungie have, after a three month delay, launched The Final Shape in Destiny 2. The servers are up and a queuing system is in place to throttle users so you will probably get to play it at some point this week.</p>
<p>Here’s the launch trailer, and after that the massive patch notes. Enjoy!</p>

</ul>
<h3><strong>CROTA’S END</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue preventing completion of the All for One challenge and associated Triumph.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>THE PANTHEON</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where The Pantheon emblems appeared in the General category rather than the Raids category in Collections.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>UI/UX&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>GENERAL</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Added a gameplay subtitles option that displays the speaker’s name before their dialog.
<ul>
<li>This option is off by default. To activate it, navigate to the Options menu and toggle it to on.</li>
<li>This feature does not affect cinematic subtitles.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added Reputation Boost information for ritual activities to the Director.

</ul>
<h2><strong>GAMEPLAY AND INVESTMENT&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>ABILITIES</strong></h3>
<p><strong>All Subclasses</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>All Super abilities now use the same damage-based recharge parameters.
<ul>
<li>Previously, energy gained through damage dealt and received was scaled based on the passive recharge rate of the Super, resulting in a broader delta between long-recharge Supers and short-recharge Supers than intended.</li>
<li>This will, for example, bring the real-world uptime of Ward of Dawn and Well of Radiance closer to the uptime of a Super like Arc Staff or Fists of Havoc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Arc Subclasses</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Arcstrider
<ul>
<li>Arc Staff:
<ul>
<li>Heavy palm strike attacks and heavy air slam blind enemies.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Disorienting Blow:
<ul>
<li>Decreased base cooldown time from 100 seconds to 90 seconds.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tempest Strike:
<ul>
<li>Added additional damage resistance vs. PvE combatants when activated, lingering for a short duration after the attack.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Striker
<ul>
<li>Knockout
<ul>
<li>Increased bonus damage granted to powered melee attacks vs. PvE combatants from 25% to 50%.</li>
<li>Reworked healing behavior:</li>
<li>No longer unstuns health regeneration on melee defeats. Now instantly grants a chunk of healing that scales with the type of target defeated.
<ul>
<li>Player: 30 health points.</li>
<li>Minor combatant: 50 health points.</li>
<li>Major combatant: 75 health points.</li>
<li>Champion+ combatant: 100 health points.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Touch of Thunder
<ul>
<li>Lightning Grenade:
<ul>
<li>Now applies Jolt after the first damage event, rather than prior.</li>
<li>This means that the Jolt won’t instantly pop on application, and attackers will need to either wait for the second lightning burst from the grenade or deal additional damage via other means to trigger the Jolt’s chain lightning.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Storm Grenade:

            <p>
Hitman 3 is headed to Meta Quest 3 via a VR version that adds dual-wielding, and features a new cel-shaded art style.
</p>
<p>
Officially titled as Hitman 3 VR: Reloaded, the project is being worked on by Leeds-based studio XR Games in collaboration with original developer IO Interactive. 
</p>
<p>
Its addition of dual-wielding is a first for the rebooted Hitman series, allowing you to hold two weapons or items at the same time for some intriguing new quick-fire possibilities.

<p>
The game's world is said to offer a "new layer of realism" so you can wander around picking up and smashing objects to your heart's content. And there's a new cel-shaded visual style - which reminds me a little of XIII.
</p>
<p>
"We knew the Hitman audience demanded the absolute best VR experience, and only the Meta Quest 3 could power such large environments, dense crowds and emergent sandbox gameplay,"  said XR Games boss Bobby Thandi. 
</p>
<p>
"With dual-wielding, a stunning new art-style, new features and improvements, we believe Hitman 3 VR: Reloaded will set a new standard for bringing AAA franchises to Meta Quest."
</p>
<p>
Originally launched in 2021, Hitman 3 brought IO's World of Assassination trilogy to a close. The studio is now working on two new projects - including a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hitman-developer-confirms-development-of-bold-new-online-fantasy-rpg">secretive fantasy game</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hitman-studio-io-opens-up-a-little-about-its-james-bond-007-game">a new 007 James Bond blockbuster</a>.

<p id="Xe2Hlc">Prismatic is probably the wildest addition to Destiny in the franchise’s history. Normally, Guardians choose what element they want to play as on their particular class and that’s their Subclass. Every ability deals damage (Arc, Strand, Solar, etc.) until they change to a different element. Prismatic turns all of that on its head by allowing Guardians to combine abilities from multiple elements at once, allowing players to equip an Arc Aspect, a Strand Aspect, a Void grenade, a Stasis Super, or any other combination of elements.</p>
<p id="A9MIW4">That’s all great, but the real kicker there is Transcendence, which is a kind of bonus Super players can get by dealing Dark and Light damage in equal measure. When activating Transcendence, Guardians will gain bonus weapon damage, bonus ability charge rate, and a brand new grenade that’s exclusive to their class.</p>

<p id="LgZP2b">In addition to Prismatic, each class is also getting a new Super and a new Aspect for one of their Light subclasses. Titans are getting Twilight Arsenal — which lets them throw massive axes that their teammates can pick up. Hunters are getting Storm’s Edge, a kind of teleporting knife twirl. And Warlocks are getting Song of Flame, which supercharges their normal Solar abilities.</p>
<p id="LHkTPH">These new Supers are available in the base forms of the Light subclasses they belong to, and Prismatic.</p>

These new Exotics let Guardians combine perks from two Exotics into a single item. They’re randomly rolled and will come from a mysterious activity that takes place somewhere inside The Pale Heart.</p>

<p id="2xBGJq">After years of players waiting and complaining, Bungie is finally giving Guardians a truly new race: the Dread. These Darkness enemies have some unique combatants — like the Grim, which Bungie’s own devs refer to as “gun bats” — and enemies that can give Guardians a taste of their own medicine with Strand and Stasis.</p>
<p id="aCQSy8">These new combatants join forces with The Hive and a variety of other enemy types to ensure The Pale Heart is packed full of stuff for Guardians to kill.</p>

But in addition to some truly wild newbies — like Still Hunt, a sniper that very literally shoots Golden Gun shots — there are a couple returning faces getting a big glow up. </p>
<p id="UNPhct">The first gun Guardians ever pick up in the Cosmodrome, Khvostov, is finally back as an Exotic in <em>Destiny 2</em>. And despite having already been reimagined as the hand cannon Crimson back in 2018, the Red Death pulse rifle is also back with <em>The Final Shape</em>. </p>

<p id="33nsae">Destiny has been around for 10 years now, and while the series certainly wasn’t known for its story in the beginning, the narrative team has really turned it around in the past few years. Now, as Guardians step up to face The Witness, Bungie is promising an answer to questions players have had for a decade, as well as a satisfying conclusion. </p>
<p id="VR1EY5">However, <em>The Final Shape</em> is not the end for <em>Destiny 2</em> or Destiny — despite the feeling the name conjures. Instead, <em>Destiny 2</em> will continue on with a new kind of content delivery system, detailed below.</p>

Instead of four different seasons per year that dole the game out into mini chunks every Tuesday, there will only be three episodes per year that focus on more direct content drops. Each episode is broken up into three distinct acts, each lasting six weeks. Every time a new act comes out, Guardians will get new story, quests, activities, weapons, and even artifacts to play with. </p>
<p id="tAeF4l">The idea here is to ensure Destiny feels both consistent and less formulaic than seasons.</p>

<p id="wN0th9">Finally, one of the more exciting changes for players looking to bring their friends in <em>Destiny 2</em> is Fireteam Power and the leveling changes. With <em>The Final Shape</em>, Guardians will be able to share their Power with Fireteam members of a lower level in most activities. The Guardian with the highest Power will be anointed the leader of the group, and everyone else will be brought up to the leader’s Power minus five. This allows anyone to drag their friends through some of the game’s best content without needing to have that awkward “we have to get your Power up first” conversation.</p>
<p id="y5kwID">This change comes paired with sweeping fixes to how Bungie assigns difficulty to activities. Only certain activities, like raids, will use Power anymore. Other activities, like the campaigns, will have a fixed difficulty, meaning Guardians can’t over- or under-level it.</p>

<p id="PvyIi3"><strong>All Subclasses</strong></p>
<ul>
<li id="5ohStP">All Super abilities now use the same damage-based recharge parameters.</li>
<li id="OxlGAt">Previously, energy gained through damage dealt and received was scaled based on the passive recharge rate of the Super, resulting in a broader delta between long-recharge Supers and short-recharge Supers than intended.</li>
<li id="ESuwiz">This will, for example, bring the real-world uptime of Ward of Dawn and Well of Radiance closer to the uptime of a Super like Arc Staff or Fists of Havoc.</li>
</ul>

<p id="SCTg0G">Touch of Thunder</p>
<p id="ReZz52">Lightning Grenade:</p>
<ul>
<li id="GpkEmd">Now applies Jolt after the first damage event, rather than prior.</li>
<li id="xyOTYr">This means that the Jolt won’t instantly pop on application, and attackers will need to either wait for the second lightning burst from the grenade or deal additional damage via other means to trigger the Jolt’s chain lightning.</li>
</ul>
<p id="nnWIkU">Storm Grenade:</p>
<ul><li id="5F7gh5">Increased tracking travel speed when targeting PvE combatants by between 0.5 and 1 meters per second, increasing with the storm’s lifetime.</li></ul>

<li id="AThVj2">This is intended to help players survive during the final lightning strike performance until the player returns to first person and can maneuver out of danger</li>
</ul>
<p id="KvAzQM">Ball Lightning</p>
<ul>

<p id="MHXdio">Cure</p>
<ul>
<li id="YhoC9D">Cure’s healing now takes place over 0.1 seconds rather than instantly.</li>
<li id="MzIKno">This change is unlikely to affect Cure’s efficacy in a meaningful way but is primarily intended to improve the readability of Cure’s heal in the middle of combat in the UI.</li>

<li id="fIeL03">Reduced suppression time between throws, so both knives can be thrown very quickly back-to-back.</li>

                <p dir="ltr">Just ahead of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-the-final-shape-release-date-new-exotics-and-everything-we-know/1100-6517377/" data-ref-id="1100-6517377">Destiny 2: The Final Shape</a>'s launch today, Bungie has released the patch notes for update 8.0.0.1. While that update number may make it sound like a smaller one, this is in fact the full set of changes coming as part of The Final Shape--and the number of tweaks is downright staggering. Numerous areas of the game have been touched, and while many of these changes have been previewed over the last few months, this is our best look yet at exactly how Destiny 2 will be changing, both in terms of the moment-to-moment action and some of the bigger-picture areas.</p><p dir="ltr">Exotic armor has been changed so that you can now upgrade it in a new way. Once it's been fully masterworked, you can spend an Exotic Cipher and 10,000 glimmer to grant it an Artifice mod slot, letting you squeeze out an extra +3 to any stat you desire, which can be useful for rounding out your attributes. Many pieces of Exotic armor have also been tweaked, some to account for the incoming Exotic class items you'll soon be able to unlock.</p><p dir="ltr">A variety of Exotic weapons and general weapon archetypes have seen changes, too, such as buffing the damage most pulse rifles (20%), fusion rifles (7%), and sniper rifles (7%) do, among others. Notably, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2s-divinity-gun-is-getting-nerfed-in-the-final-shape/1100-6523497/" data-ref-id="1100-6523497">Divinity--the Exotic trace rifle often used during harder activities--has been nerfed</a>. Individual weapon perks have also been adjusted in various ways, such as Grave Robber activating when you deal damage (but don't get a kill) with a powered melee attack.</p><p dir="ltr">Power level has been changed. In addition to the power floor being raised to 1900, there is a new soft cap (1900), powerful cap (1990), and hard cap (2000). Power caps on old gear have been removed, effectively <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-finally-undoes-gunsetting-with-the-final-shapes-new-power-system/1100-6522961/" data-ref-id="1100-6522961">undoing the controversial gunsetting </a>that occurred years ago, and a new system is now in place that alleviates the need for each member of a fireteam to be at a given power level to take part in activities. That should make it easier to play with other players, including those who may not have spent as much time grinding as you. Additionally, your power level is now shared across characters, meaning you don't need to grind on each of your alts.</p><p dir="ltr">Although it's not explicitly mentioned in the patch notes, this update also reworks the UI in some welcome ways, repositioning and adjusting the position of buffs and nerfs to make it easier to keep an eye on critical information in the heat of battle.</p><p dir="ltr">Individual classes and subclasses have received numerous buffs and nerfs; those are far too numerous to outline individually, but some highlights include a nerf to Strand Titans; a new Frost Armor keyword for Stasis builds; and a nerf to the go-to Warlock Super, Well of Radiance.</p><p dir="ltr">Not everything that's new in The Final Shape is mentioned in the patch notes, as there is the new campaign, location, and Prismatic subclass, but you can read on for a look at the full list of changes as <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/destiny_2_update_8_0_0_1" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">outlined by Bungie</a>.

I was a diehard WipeOut player as a kid. Seriously, me and the boys used to roam the streets of Bradford looking for F-Zero players to bully, at least till the RollCagers rocked up and stole our lunch money. Mind you, I think I was probably less interested in WipeoUt's racing than its trackside landscapes, which remain exquisite decades on - all those sweeping album-cover facades with their animate fixtures that thickened and solidified into full-blown peripheral cities as the series progressed. 
</p>
<p>
I am similarly hooked by the worlds of Ghosts Ehf's Phantom Spark, which are a million lightyears from WiPeout in terms of their influences and atmosphere, much as the underlying hover-jockeying is a million lightyears away from WipeouT in terms of its gentleness and lack of combative elements. But these spaces are just as mesmerising to fly through and think about when not focussed on finding the perfect line through the next corner, or avoiding a patch of grass. Small wonder, given that the game's art director is Joost Eggermont, whose <a href="https://x.com/JoostEggermont/status/1790471922389557557">streaking astral contraptions</a> and <a href="https://joost-eggermont.itch.io/anywhere-the-moss-grows">"small interactive moments"</a> I've long admired, but never managed to write about until now.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
There's a Phantom Spark demo coming in Steam Next Fest from the 7th, but publishers Coatsink were kind enough to wire us a code ahead of schedule, which Ed Thorn was kind enough to pass onto me, possibly because he was busy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-hollows-out-everything-you-loved-about-elden-ring-and-its-brilliant">getting his arse kicked by Elden Ring Shadow Of The Erdtree</a>. I've played about 15 minutes of Phantom Spark, and it's a lovely, dreamy little thing, a piece of rollercoaster worldbuilding that coaxes out your sense of perfectionism while maintaining a bullet-proof air of chill. Not that there are any bullets to worry about here.

It also has the faint dusting of a story campaign. You are a ball of light trapped inside a craft that consists of flexing triangular surfaces, like an aerodynamic Xmas decoration. As you're getting to grips with your new vehicular prison, a ribbon with a face appears and tells you not to sweat the whole imprisonment thing, because look, there's a race course to run, and rising up all around it, a graceful landscape of weathered and delicately mosaicked stone - a collapsed cyclopean expanse of cubed recesses, trefoil (I think?) arches and dangling, vine-draped pillars. 
</p>
<p>
The game's universe doesn't have a population beyond the ghosts of your previous times, but it does have ancestral guardians who preside over domains encompassing several time trial courses (there are 30 in all), unlocked in order of challenge. I met one during my quick try of the demo, an affable bearded spirit who asked me if the views made me feel "insignificant", which yes, they did, but in a good way. A soothing way. The last demo I played was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mech-engineers-demo-is-for-people-who-love-hateful-interface-design">Mech Engineer</a>. This is definitely easier on the nerves than Mech Engineer, though I'm sure later trials will ratchet up the tension. Beyond that, there are leaderboards to kindle your competitive instincts, and the nowadays-endangered charms of splitscreen multiplayer.
</p>
<p>
Joost Eggermont was the name that got me playing Phantom Spark. Not till writing up the demo did I remember that Ghosts Ehf's two in-house members, Torfi and Joon, are also among the creators of the amazing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nuts-review">NUTS</a>, a conspiracy sim for photographers who distrust squirrels. I would not have drawn a straight line between NUTS and Phantom Spark, but I'm glad to find myself here at the end of it. Take me higher, Ribbon Dude. Show me what's over that blissfully cloudy horizon.

The size of the DLC sounds massive, roughly equivalent to the base game’s Limgrave, Weeping Peninsula, and a part of Caelid combined. And as in past FromSoft DLCs, enemies here will be more dangerous and faster.</p><p>Here’s what previews have to say about <em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdrtree</em>:</p><h2 id="h61751"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-first-impressions-of-the-big-dlc&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-first-impressions-of-the-big-dlc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>IGN</strong></em></a></span></h2><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>It’s hard to get a sense for just how big the Realm of Shadow actually is, but I will say that my first steps out into it were definitely reminiscent of the first time I emerged from the elevator and opened the doors into Limgrave. There were obvious areas of interest right from the get-go for me to explore, like a crypt that was directly to my left, some scorched ruins directly up ahead, a large castle far off in the distance, and the towering flaming brazier enemy from the trailer roaming around just on the horizon.</p><p>Of course, in true <em>Elden Ring</em> fashion, the very first enemy I encountered ended up murdering me, as if to reassure me that despite my level 150 character with a +25 strength scaled axe, along with 80 points allocated to strength, this DLC wasn’t going to be a cake walk for people with end game builds that have run out of things to challenge them in the base game. It wasn’t even a boss, it was just a random enemy that decided to drop down from above while I was exploring some ruins, with its dual-wielded chakrams that kept me tumbling backwards as I tried to dodge its twirling dance that never seemed to end.</p></blockquote><h2 id="h61752"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.eurogamer.net/shadow-of-the-erdtree-brings-further-depth-and-grandeur-to-fromsoftwares-masterpiece&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shadow-of-the-erdtree-brings-further-depth-and-grandeur-to-fromsoftwares-masterpiece" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Eurogamer</strong></em></a></span></h2><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>One thing that’s certain, however, is <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> already has the look and feel of an absolute epic. With its sombre atmosphere, intricate worldbuilding and cheeky level design, it has all the ingredients required for an additional chapter of <em>Elden Ring</em>’s sprawling narrative. Since putting down my controller at the end of the preview session, my mind keeps wandering back to the Land of Shadow to consider what could be hidden within its craggy cliffs and hills. There are few games that can conjure up a feeling of such vast mystery and potential. When the DLC releases in just a few weeks, I look forward to re-experiencing the trepidation of setting forth into these tantalising, unknown lands. And, of course, being stomped on once again. You’ve got to be realistic about these things.</p></blockquote><h2 id="h61753"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gameinformer.com/preview/2024/06/04/a-three-hour-trek-through-the-land-of-shadow&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gameinformer.com/preview/2024/06/04/a-three-hour-trek-through-the-land-of-shadow" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Game Informer</strong></em></a></span></h2><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>My biggest takeaway from <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> is that – surprise – it’s more <em>Elden Ring</em>. It’s the most unexciting take imaginable, but outside of the intriguing yet not immediately noticeable wrinkle added by the Scadutree upgrades, it’s a new excuse to revisit a world I love. It’s tough to get a sense of the expansion’s narrative implications and to be honest, that’s the last thing I care about in this game, as interesting as its lore is on the surface. All I want is to experience a new gauntlet of trials and surprises, and <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> seems poised to deliver that and then some.</p></blockquote><h2 id="h61754"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamespot.com/articles/shadow-of-the-erdtree-renews-the-awe-and-adventure-of-elden-ring/1100-6523901/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/shadow-of-the-erdtree-renews-the-awe-and-adventure-of-elden-ring/1100-6523901/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>GameSpot</strong></em></a></span></h2><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>So, yes, <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> is more of the same <em>Elden Ring</em> gameplay you know with new weapons, items, and areas to enjoy. But that is something that no other game has offered and no other developer has delivered. If <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>’s quality as a whole is consistent with what I played, From Software is on the cusp of reaffirming <em>Elden Ring</em> as one of the greatest open-world games ever made.</p></blockquote><h2 id="h61755"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://gamerant.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-dlc-preview-hands-on/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://gamerant.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-dlc-preview-hands-on/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Game Rant</strong></em></a></span></h2><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p><em>Elden Ring</em> is a Game of the Year award winner, a rousing sales success, and it was a conversation piece for almost all of 2022. So, for most people, the promise of more content is tempting enough. Many players, present company included, are even amid new playthroughs to either get ready for the DLC, reacquaint themselves with the world and the controls, or both. Jumping back into the boots of the Tarnished was exciting and regardless of how brief my time in the Land of Shadow, it was a reminder of just how incredible <em>Elden Ring</em> is. There is no developer out there that can do what FromSoftware does, and<em> Shadow of the Erdtree</em> looks to prove that the developers are pushing themselves just as hard for the DLC as they did for the main game. If the first few hours of pain and punishment are just as exhilarating as the finished product, <em>Elden Ring</em> fans are in for another unforgettable ride.</p></blockquote><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Everyone wants to know the start time for the Summer Game Fest schedule, specifically the timeframe for the live broadcast. I certainly do! Here’s what everyone should know about the Summer Game Fest start time!</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-summer-game-fest-start-time">What is the Summer Game Fest Start Time?</h2>



<p>If you live on the east coast of the USA, then you’ll find the start time for Summer Game Fest rather annoying, as it’s at 5 PM. That’s when most folks get off from work, and they’re usually rushing home to take care of children, finish daily chores, and cook the evening meal. But this Friday, make some time for Summer Game Fest. It starts at:</p>



<ul>
<li>2:00 PM PT</li>



<li>3:00 PM CT</li>



<li>5:00 PM ET</li>
</ul>



<p>We’ve confirmed that Summer Game Fest <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/summer-game-fest-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lasts for two hours</a>, with countless video game reveals, trailers, and details to check out live. Of course, we fully expect a good chunk of wasted time watching celebrities and the chosen few deliver an epic monologue. </p>



<p>Related: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-summer-game-fest-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">When is Summer Game Fest? – Answered</a></p>



<h2 id="h-what-games-will-we-see-at-summer-game-fest">What Games Will We See at Summer Game Fest?</h2>



<p>While there are no official reveals leaked just yet, we’ve heard word about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-summer-games-fest/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lego Horizon Adventures</a>, and there’s more to come. We expect to see the following titles:</p>



<ul>
<li>Concord</li>



<li>Black Myth: Wukong</li>



<li>Star Wars Outlaws</li>



<li>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree</li>



<li>Helldivers 2</li>



<li>Stellar Blade</li>
</ul>



<p>Personally, I hope for a few niche titles, such as The Forever Winter, Beautiful Light, and Ill. Only time will tell!</p>

<p>Speaking of upcoming games, did you hear that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-content-warning-coming-to-ps5-and-xbox-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Content Warning might launch on consoles</a>?

<p>With game file sizes increasing annually, with the likes of Destiny 2 and Call of Duty requiring many hundreds of GBs of SSD space, it’s nice knowing precisely how much space the latest hit needs. With that in mind, what is the XDefiant file size?</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-gbs-is-xdefiant">How Many GBs is XDefiant?</h2>



<p>Currently, XDefiant requires approximately 35GB of free space on an SSD, and that’s following its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xdefiant-patch-y1s02/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">most recent update</a>. If you’re playing the competitive first-person shooter on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S, then you need 45GB to 50GB of hard drive space to download and install the game. It’s slightly bigger on the consoles, but not much so.</p>



<p>When you compare XDefiant to the staggeringly impressive Destiny 2: The Final Shape, which requests you have 300GB of space available to download the expansion, the 35GB isn’t all that terrible. Of course, we’d love to see file sizes drop significantly in the coming months and years, but that’s not happening.</p>







<h2 id="h-are-the-xdefiant-servers-down">Are the XDefiant Servers Down?</h2>



<p>Following the game’s recent update, Y1S0.2, which didn’t affect the XDefiant file size too severely, the XDefiant servers went down for a brief period for the team to install the update on the server side and give everyone time to download the patch.</p>



<p>It’s a rather small but necessary patch, with numerous bug fixes, social optimizations, and miscellaneous tweaks that will certainly improve the game experience for everyone!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/bungie-devs-cryptic-tweets-spark-destiny-3-speculation-as-expansion-the-final-shape-launches<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>As Bungie launches <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> expansion <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/destiny-2-the-final-shape">The Final Shape</a>, fans think one developer has teased Destiny 3 with a series of cryptic tweets.</p><p>The Final Shape concludes Destiny’s overarching story by placing the player inside the Traveler in a face-off against the mysterious The Witness. It’s the culmination of 10 years of often bewildering Destiny storytelling, and will hopefully provide answers for the game’s player base.</p><p>But in previous videos, Bungie developers have teased that The Final Shape is not the end of Destiny 2 or even the series, with the developer - now owned by Sony - also working on multiplayer game Marathon. In a series of <a href="https://x.com/thislukesmith/status/1797745471521468585" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweets</a> marking the release of The Final Shape, Bungie executive creative director, Luke Smith, discussed the road to The Final Shape’s release and the effort its developers put in to make it happen. But it’s the mention of the word Hope three times, each capitalized, that has set the cat among the pigeons within the Destiny community.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Destiny 2: The Final Shape Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Here’s the tweet in question:</p><blockquote>Our Hope is always the same with Destiny games, expansions, seasons, DLCs, exotic missions, secret missions, in-game events, merchandise, et cetera - we genuinely Hope you enjoy the time you spend with it. Anything we've made or will make, that's the Hope. </blockquote><p>That tweet was enough to set off a number of Destiny content creators on the future of the series, and there's rampant speculation across social media and forums.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Why you capitalizing "Hope" 3 different times? 👀</p>— KackisHD (@RickKackis) <a href="https://twitter.com/RickKackis/status/1797775373314498830?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 3, 2024</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">.. can't help but notice you're capitalizing that word more than once 🧐</p>— it me: FALLOUT (@falloutplays) <a href="https://twitter.com/falloutplays/status/1797780563471778167?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 4, 2024</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-theme="light"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Destiny: 3 Hopes</p><p>Releasing Fall 2027</p></div>— Destiny Bulletin (@DestinyBulletn) <a href="https://twitter.com/DestinyBulletn/status/1797762662924976336?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 3, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Or, this could be nothing, and Smith may in fact be referencing Paul McCartney's infamous Destiny song Hope for the Future, which, if you're so inclined, can be watched below:</p><blockquote data-media-max-width="560" data-theme="light"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>For anybody who doesn’t know in 2014 to coincide with the release of Destiny 1 Paul McCartney released “Hope For The Future” McCartney provided multiple bases for the iconic Destiny themes. </p><p> Link for full song: <a href="https://t.co/14bEdZaTYP" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/14bEdZaTYP</a> <a href="https://t.co/0hW87QpQ1S" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/0hW87QpQ1S</a></p></div>— Pengu (@Pengu0290482811) <a href="https://twitter.com/Pengu0290482811/status/1796693453767938422?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 1, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>For now, the focus is on The Final Shape and its three planned episodes. Echoes kicks off next week on June 11, Revenant is set for October 2024, and Heresy rounds The Final Shape off in February 2025, although of course the plan may change.</p><p>Beyond that? Bungie is yet to say. Destiny 3 could be an opportunity for Bungie to reset the series with a potentially next-gen entry-point that would bring in a wave of new players. But, after 10 years of Destiny, the studio may decide to leave Destiny behind for new franchises, as it did when it left Halo behind all those years ago.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

The core rulebook, which will serve as an essential bestiary for dungeon masters, is one of three Fifth Edition D&amp;D books that will be getting an updated version, and marks the first such update in ten years.</p><p>So without further ado, here's a look at the front cover in all its tentacle-covered glory:</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/03/0-r5e-mm-cvrtrad-front-051724-1717447781293.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Image courtesy of Wizards of the Coast</figcaption></figure></output><p>Josh Herman, head of art for D&amp;D, told IGN, "We were inspired by the 2014 cover, including the Beholder, which is just so iconic, but we wanted to kinda pull out a bit and show the epic action of D&amp;D versus the close-up. So instead of this sorta 'run for your life' and horror vibe from the old version, we wanted to put players in the center and showcase a couple flavors of hero fighting off this army of monsters."</p><p>Veteran dice rollers and Baldur's Gate fans will also notice some familiar heroes amidst the cover's villain stew, including Minsc and his furry friend Boo (both of whom seem quite undeterred by their current predicament), but there also appears to be a less fortunate hero in the clutches of a tentacle as well. Who might that poor soul be? According to Herman, that's up to you:</p><p>"We're really trying to push open storytelling, so we took the opportunity to include the player as a concept. So the hero in the clutches of the tentacle, we thought 'Well, maybe that's you.' It's really important to us that players feel like they're a part of this universe and these stories, so, who knows, maybe this will serve as inspiration to a dungeon master out there who includes a scenario like this in their campaign."</p><p>Meanwhile, the back of the monster manual focuses entirely on the beasts themselves:</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/04/wotc-monarch-tradcvr-foil-240528-0006-1717462795628.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Image courtesy of Wizards of the Coast</figcaption></figure></output><p>Though you'll find many familiar foes among the crowd, from owlbears and dragons to hags and mind flayers, you won't find any new faces just yet, like the blob of annihilation and vampire warlock teased in the rear cover's description. It seems we'll have to wait until the 2024 Monster Manual debuts February 18, 2025 to come face-to-face with those horrors. All three of the new core rulebooks can be <a href="https://marketplace.dndbeyond.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">preordered on DnDBeyond</a> starting on June 18.</p><p>D&amp;D has seen a whole lot of renewed interest since the massive success and popularity of Baldur's Gate 3 last year, though <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/larian-studios-wont-make-baldurs-gate-3-dlc-expansions-or-baldurs-gate-4">Larian Studios won't be working on DLC or a sequel</a>.

                <p>Team Fortress 2 is approaching the age of your typical high-school graduate, but its still-vibrant community has a lot to say about its future. Now, the game's Steam Recent Reviews rating <a href="https://x.com/SteamDB/status/1798006015205785966" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">has dropped</a> to "Mostly Negative" following a flood of thumbs-down reviews from players who are sick of its ongoing bot issues.</p><p dir="ltr">These negative reviews are part of a community effort called "<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/1d14iqw/its_time_to_stop_the_bots_fixtf2_june_3rd/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fix TF2</a>," which started on June 3. The effort's <a href="https://save.tf/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">site</a> claims that the game has been "nearly unplayable" for the past five years because its official servers are overrun by cheating bots that instant-headshot any player they encounter. The site then notes that Valve has done very little to fix these issues despite the game still making a large amount of money through microtransactions, calling its lack of effort "nothing short of appalling."</p>

<p dir="ltr">This isn't the first time that TF2 players have called for Valve to solve these bot issues. Back in 2022, the official TF2 Twitter/X account <a href="https://x.com/TeamFortress/status/1529970640224018433" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">posted</a> a message of solidarity with players: "TF2 community, we hear you," it reads in part. "...We see how large this issue has become and are working to improve things." However, players say that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/1d7x24x/they_removed_the_community_note/" rel="nofollow ">little has improved</a> in the two years since.</p><p dir="ltr">First released in 2007 as part of the Orange Box, TF2 has remained one of the most-played games on Steam, often ranking in the top 10 on <a href="https://steamcharts.com/app/440" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SteamCharts</a>. We've reached out to Valve for comment, and will update this story if we hear back.</p>

      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Star Wars: Hunters sees players take on the role of a Hunter on the planet Vespaara, where high-intensity, high-stakes competitions take place in "The Arena," which features backgrounds that "evoke iconic Star Wars worlds," according to Zynga. These locations include battlegrounds set in locales ranging from a village of Ewoks to the Death Star itself.</p><p dir="ltr">Players squad up in groups of four, facing down enemy teams in third-person combat, and each player can choose from a range of varying Hunters, which can be further customized to suit individual playstyles. Hunters come in three self-explanatory classes: Damage, Support, and Tank. There are currently 13 Hunters to choose from, including Grozz the Wookie warrior, J-3D1 the one-of-a-kind droid, Sentinel the stereotypical Stormtrooper, Rieve the dark-side warrior, and a deceptively adorable pair of Jawa scrappers collectively referred to as Utooni, among others.</p><p dir="ltr">Star Wars: Hunters currently includes four game modes:</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Squad Brawl:</strong> The first team to reach 20 eliminations wins</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Dynamic Control:</strong> Teams compete to capture rotating Control Points.</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Power Control:</strong> Squads fight to maintain control of the most Control Points on the battlefield.</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Trophy Chase:</strong> Two teams aim to hold the Trophy Droid (who is named TR0-F33, naturally). The first Squad to reach 100% wins the match.</li></ul><p>For more information on Star Wars: Hunters, check out <a href="https://starwarshunters.com/game" rel="nofollow ">the game's official website</a>.</p>

<p data-characters="248" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Before bringing your frames in <em>Warframe</em> to mid-late game content, you’ll want to figure out <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-protea-prime-build-in-warframe/">a good mod build</a>. These mods completely change how the frame functions, and can skyrocket its potential for helping your team or taking down enemies. </p> <p data-characters="140" data-current-count="140" data-injectable="false">One such frame that’s used by a lot of people has a unique build to spec into. Here’s the best build for Mesa Prime in <em>Warframe</em>.</p> <h2 id="h-the-best-mods-and-arcanes-for-mesa-prime-in-warframe" data-injectable="false">The best mods and Arcanes for Mesa Prime in Warframe</h2> <figure data-current-count="440" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Destructoid.</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="236" data-current-count="236" data-injectable="false">All of Mesa Prime’s abilities are solid, but her fourth ability, Peacemaker, is easily her best. The raw damage output from the pistols is massive, and thus we want to focus on improving its stats. The following mods do just that:</p> <ul data-found-items="10" data-current-count="636" data-injectable="true"> <li>Growing Power (Aura)</li> <li>Power Drift (Exilus)</li> <li>Fleeting Expertise</li> <li>Adaptation</li> <li>Umbral Intensify</li> <li>Vitality</li> <li>Primed Flow</li> <li>Narrow Minded</li> <li>Continuity</li> <li>Transient Fortitude</li> </ul>
 <div data-characters="1035" data-current-count="1035" data-injectable="true"><p>These mods will increase Mesa’s base <strong>Ability Duration, Efficiency, and Strength</strong> while lowering her Range. Since Range doesn’t affect her ult or much in the way of her abilities, it can safely be reduced. Otherwise, the Duration and Efficiency help slow the Energy drain. Vitality and Adaptation are added to give Mesa a bit of survivability since she’s a bit of a glass cannon otherwise. If you want to <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-get-and-use-perspicacity-warframe/">Subsume</a> one of her abilities, a common choice is to <strong>replace her first ability, Ballistic Battery, with Grendel’s Nourish</strong>. Since having a single shot do increased damage isn’t great in most scenarios, the added survivability far outweighs its usefulness.</p><p>Moving over to Arcanes, the best two are <strong>Arcane Energize and Arcane Avenger</strong>. Arcane Energize is good on any frame thanks to keeping that energy value nice and high at all times. Meanwhile, Arcane Avenger grants a massive fire rate increase on pistols when hitting crits. Since your ult counts as pistols, this turns you into a fire rate machine.</p></div>
 <h3 id="h-what-about-her-regulators" data-injectable="false">What about her Regulators?</h3> <p data-characters="102" data-current-count="102" data-injectable="false">If you’re looking for a good build for her Regulators, the following mods will get the job done:</p> <ul data-found-items="8" data-current-count="422" data-injectable="true"> <li>Galvanized Diffusion</li> <li>Galvanized Shot</li> <li>Anemic Agility</li> <li>Hemorrhage</li> <li>Primed Target Cracker</li> <li>Lethal Torrent</li> <li>Pistol Pestilence</li> <li>Pistol Gambit</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="413" data-current-count="413" data-injectable="false"><strong>Barrel Diffusion </strong>and<strong> Sure Shot</strong> are decent alternatives if you don’t have the Galvanized variants. Otherwise, we’re building for Multishot and those crits, since we want a lot of those. The Toxin and Status Chance is added to help trigger the Growing Power mod we have slotted into Mesa herself. We also reduce the damage slightly using Anemic Agility, but trade that for a major increase in fire rate.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/04/behemoths-titanic-battles-and-close-combat-are-a-great-reason-to-play-vr-again/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Coming off the backs of their two excellent <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-walking-dead-saints-sinners">The Walking Dead: Saints &amp; Sinners</a> games, expectations are naturally very high for Skydance’s Behemoth. Though it was quickly overshadowed by Half-Life: Alyx, Saints &amp; Sinners was an outstanding example of what virtual reality could do, with open areas to explore, tons of interactivity, and increasingly desperate combat against growing hordes of zombies. The new and original setting of Behemoth comes with a wholly different tone, but it could be another defining, must-play VR experience across all the major platforms.</p>
<p><iframe title="Skydance's Behemoth | Gameplay Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6w7RxfyVceA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Players will take on the role of a diseased wanderer lost in the frigid Forsaken Lands, filled with ruins and dominated by the towering creatures that give the game its name. The elevator pitch naturally gives plenty of Shadow of the Colossus vibes, but the pacing and the actual experience here will be completely different to the PS2 classic.</p>


<p>The combat is at the core of this experience, leaning even further into the melee-heavy nature of Saints &amp; Sinners. It’s immensely satisfying going toe-to-toe with the human foes who stand against you, with the need for a somewhat cautious approach to blocking incoming attacks – either with a shield by holding your blade perpendicular to the incoming attack – before striking back. Time it right and you can push back at an incoming strike, staggering your enemy and opening them up to your own swipe or stab. Single-handed short swords will be a go-to for many, and you have a magic sword that will always return to your inventory slot if you walk away too far. The rest of the time you’ll be scavenging two-handed broadswords, axes, wooden shields and everything else from the environment or fallen enemies. There’s also bows and arrows if you want to try and snipe at enemies, though I struggled to get my aim quite right.</p>


<p>One thing that I was particularly happy to see was that two-handed weapons don’t wave around uncontrollably when held single-handed. You do need two hands in order to actually use them, but you don’t have the visual disconnect between your own steady hand and some heavy weapon wobbling around in front of you.</p>
<p>As is so often the case with virtual reality games, you start to play with the possibilities and see how far you can push the game’s ideas and physical limits. Yes, you can absolutely throw weapons at enemies, grab them and then stab them brutally, even grab arrows out of the sky and then fire them back! Of course, some enemies will be more heavily armoured and need more hits to bash through their helmet, or there’ll be a tougher mid-boss, fully armoured that you’ll have to whittle away at. Some even have the ability to shrug off a certain amount of damage – I mean, I literally had a thrown axe stuck into one boss human’s face, and he kept coming at me!</p>
<p>You’re not just a regular guy either, though. Sure, this horrible disease is very visible across your skin, but you also have a superhuman strength, which allows you to fling enemies around, smash through weakened walls, pull down bridges, and more. It goes hand-in-hand with the grappling hook that is your means to reach more distant parts of the world, the wrist-mounted gadget able to hook onto elements wrapped in yellow rope and pull you up, let you down gently, or pull things towards you with a two-handed yank.</p>

<p>It’s all a nice and satisfying blend of realistic and intuitive elements and video game-y elements that just make sense and will feel familiar. it’s all brought together in an almost effortlessly slick fashion.</p>
<p>The world will also invite a natural curiosity and exploration. Without the day-to-day theming of Saints &amp; Sinners, or the sandbox locations to explore, it can be more tightly constructed by Skydance. That’s not to say that it will be a totally linear journey, as while my demo was limited to a single path, there were several off-shoots and areas that were blocked off at this time – an imposing looking tower, for example, which would be optional to explore.</p>

<p>Of course, the thing that will lure most people into this game are the Behemoths. Our demo concluded with a fight against the Seal Behemoth, a creature so large that it has a snowy peak on its back with what look like tufts of grass growing on it – admittedly, this could be hair. It’s also so large that the ball and chain it flings around is around the size of a house.</p>
<p>Fighting this massive creature gave a glimpse into how Skydance has taken inspiration from Shadow of the Colossus and other traditional games featuring gigantic boss battles. You can’t just get up close and stab its ankles, which probably wouldn’t feel that great as a tactic in VR, and must instead hunt out the weak spots and put to use everything you know how to do up to this point. You’ll also be biding your time, avoiding its sweeping ball attacks and floor stomps until you can hit those weak spots, climbing up craggy sections of its hide to strike those higher off the floor. Oh, and dealing with a few human enemies at the time as well.</p>

<p>It’s a satisfying battle that I greatly enjoyed – especially with the way you finish it off – and my time as a whole was a great introduction to what this game is about. Whether your VR headset sees regular use or has been gathering dust in recent months, Behemoth is shaping up to be a great reason to pop it on and fight through its blend of human-sized and gigantic enemies.</p>

		<p>Thunderful has unveiled a new deep dive for Steamworld Heist II, showcasing early mission gameplay, an overview of the upgrade system, and turn-based combat mechanics. The footage, approximately 13 minutes long, features Art Director Brandt Andrist as he narrates the on-screen action and game features.</p>
<p><iframe title="SteamWorld Heist II | Extended Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-JArPke5KNk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>One of the first upgrade screens we see is for the submarine, the main form of transportation to explore Steamworld Heist 2’s Great Oceanic Shard. As progress is made slots can be unlocked allowing for additional weapons to be equipped. Early on in the game, you will only have access to basic weapons but as progress is made torpedoes and lasers can be purchased. All of the submarine’s weapons are automated, allowing you to focus on navigating and aiming at enemy vessels, like those of the Royal Navy.</p>
<p>The mission showcased in the SteamWorld Heist II deep dive is titled “It’s A Trap.” Players are presented with a custom difficulty slider before starting the mission, which allows for the adjustment of various level elements to accommodate for different skill levels and playstyles. Additionally, players can outfit their crew with various items to enhance their chances of completing the mission successfully. In “It’s A Trap,” characters Wesley and Daisy stumble upon an outpost, which they recognise as a trap set by the Royal Navy. The footage reveals the turn-based gameplay, where each character possesses action points used for movement or actions like firing a weapon. Characters also have unique abilities that offer extra benefits. For instance, Wesley’s Warcry boosts his own attack power and that of his nearby allies. In combat, an aiming line will appear to show the pathway of your bullet, enhancing your accuracy to inflict damage on enemies. Additionally, if you’re interested in collecting hats, you can shoot them off the heads of enemies to add to your collection.</p>
<p>Missions can be replayed, and they will not always have the same layout as enemy spawns and cover spots are placed randomly. At the end of a mission all characters that took part will gain experience points, even if they fell in combat. Your crew’s reputation will grow as more missions are completed, and this leads to be more missions and opportunities being unlocked within SteamWorld Heist II. Once players have had their fill of exploring for the day, and have exhausted their crewmates, the base will provide sanctuary. Here, goods can be traded for upgrades, the submarine will be repaired automatically, and crewmates will get a much deserved rest, ready for the next day of adventure.</p>

<p>Steamworld Heist II will be released on August 8th for PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Steam.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/indie-dev%E2%80%99s-game-shamelessly-cloned-and-released-for-free-by-grifter.889287/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/indie-dev-game-cloned-dire-decks<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Indie roguelike deckbuilder&nbsp;<em>Dire Decks&nbsp;</em>has been stolen and released on Steam under a different name by "developer" Terry Brash, and he's apparently unwilling to take his version of the game down.</p>

<p>According to&nbsp;<em>Dire Decks&nbsp;</em>developer <a href="https://x.com/kindanicegames/status/1797831974259941674" rel="noopener" target="_blank">kindanice on X</a> (formerly Twitter), Brash stole the game without their permission, and though kindanice has "tried to get him to take the game down", Brash is "unwilling to do so".</p>

<p>In case you're wondering, the game in question is&nbsp;<em>Wildcard</em>, which you can find on Steam. I haven't linked it here because I don't want to send any traffic its way, but a quick search should reveal it.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dire-decks-itch.io-indie-dev-stolen.jpg?itok=DbTDjCyO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dire-decks-itch.io-indie-dev-stolen.jpg?itok=_yGMJ2jD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dire Decks&nbsp;</em>has been stolen and put on Steam without its original developer's permission.</figcaption></figure><p>Earlier today, Brash <a href="https://x.com/terrybrash/status/1797842468098265194" rel="noopener" target="_blank">advertised&nbsp;<em>Wildcard&nbsp;</em>on X</a>, promising a "free action roguelike deckbuilder with online leaderboards". Users quickly began to fill Brash's replies with allegations that the game was stolen.</p>

<p>Brash hasn't responded directly to any of these allegations, but he has posted a couple of bizarre memes on X, including <a href="https://x.com/terrybrash/status/1797909490261745806" rel="noopener" target="_blank">an&nbsp;<em>It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia&nbsp;</em>clip</a> modded to include the line "did you copy another game?" and <a href="https://x.com/terrybrash/status/1797981318439211335" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a&nbsp;<em>SpongeBob&nbsp;</em>meme</a>.</p>

<p>He also promises that&nbsp;<em>Wildcard&nbsp;</em><a href="https://x.com/terrybrash/status/1797961921498325156" rel="noopener" target="_blank">will remain free</a> on Steam, and that it will <a href="https://x.com/terrybrash/status/1797920140828299648" rel="noopener" target="_blank">"prominently" display the names</a> of the top four players on the leaderboard, although again, these messages are flooded with responses accusing Brash of stealing the game.</p>

<p>What's strange is that Brash hasn't made any kind of attempt to refute the allegations of theft (besides the aforementioned memes, which hardly count). His strategy appears to be just brazenly leaving the game up on Steam and hoping all of this blows over.</p>




<p>Brash's repurposing of&nbsp;<em>Dire Decks&nbsp;</em>is pretty barefaced, but it's not clear what's going to happen next. There's always the DMCA takedown route, although that would only work if art assets or code were directly copied from&nbsp;<em>Dire Decks</em>.</p>

<p>In any case, if you think&nbsp;<em>Dire Decks&nbsp;</em>looks at all interesting to you, then I'd urge you to go <a href="https://kindanice.itch.io/dire-decks" rel="noopener" target="_blank">check it out on Itch.io</a>. Whatever you do, just don't play the Steam version when it comes out.</p>

While there have been head, chest, gauntlet, and leg Exotic armor pieces since Destiny 2 first launched in 2017, Exotic class items look set to shake up the status quo of the game alongside the new Prismatic subclass, when they're introduced in the second week of The Final Shape.</p><p>What makes them special is that each Exotic class item will have two random Exotic perks from a selection of existing Exotic armor perks. Even better, there's a chance for your Exotic class item to have a perk that isn't normally associated with your Guardian class. For example, Hunters can gain improved damage when surrounded with a Synthoceps perk, while Titans can ready their weapons quickly with an Ophidian perk.</p><p>While Bungie has done some balancing to ensure that things don't go overboard, the potential to create finely tuned builds with these new Exotics is hard to resist. Here's how you can get one of these Exotics when you venture into the Pale Heart of the Traveler.</p><h2 id="How_to_get_an_Exotic_class_item_in_Destiny_2__The_Final_Shape">How to get an Exotic class item in Destiny 2: The Final Shape</h2><p>Getting your first Exotic class item is going to require some patience as it can be earned as part of a new activity that unlocks after the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-the-final-shape-raid-launch-time-and-everything-we-know/1100-6522790/" data-ref-id="1100-6522790" data-mce-href="/articles/destiny-2-the-final-shape-raid-launch-time-and-everything-we-know/1100-6522790/">Salvation's Edge Raid</a> World First race is completed, at the beginning of Week 2 in The Final Shape.
