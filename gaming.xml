            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-update-1-1-a-life<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>GSC Game World has released&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>update 1.1, and it comes with an absolutely astonishing number of fixes for over 1500 of the game's bugs, including changes to the controversial A-Life system and more.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, GSC Game World <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-a-life-20-gsc-game-world" rel="nofollow">explained</a> that much like the rest of&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2</em>, the game's A-Life AI system (that's AI in the trad sense, not the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/at-least-1000-steam-games-using-generative-ai-per-new-report" rel="nofollow">generative sense</a>) is riddled with bugs, but some of those bugs have been addressed in today's update.</p>

<p>You should now encounter more roaming NPCs in the Zone, and NPCs should no longer spawn behind your back. Additionally, A-Life NPCs should now be visible at greater distances, and groups exploring the Zone should be "more diverse regarding possible factions and group sizes".</p>

Other changes have also been implemented, like a reduction in number for Pseudodog clones, which could threaten to overwhelm you in certain circumstances.</p>

<p>Rewards for "several missions" have been increased, and "multiple improvements" have been made to characters' facial animations and voice work in "several cutscenes".</p>

<p>You can also look forward (or perhaps that's the wrong phrase) to&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2</em>'s infinite money glitch being gone from the game. No more can you exploit the Zone's weird logic to make yourself rich. You'll just have to do it the old-fashioned way.</p>

<p>Since there are almost 2000 fixes in this update, there are far too many for me to list here. Be sure to check out the full&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>update 1.1 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1643320/view/525329871842312365" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">patch notes</a> if you want to see everything that's changed.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2</em>, it's the sequel to 2007's influential cult classic&nbsp;<em>Stalker: Shadow of Chernobyl&nbsp;</em>(which was the spelling being used at the time, and it hasn't been retroactively changed at time of writing).</p>

<p>The game was in development for some time; originally announced in 2010, it went through a lengthy development cycle and at least one development reboot before being <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-heart-of-chernobyl-release-date-announced" rel="nofollow">fully re-revealed in 2021</a>.</p>

<p>Following that, the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022 led to many development setbacks for Ukrainian studio GSC Game World, causing the game to be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/post-apocalyptic-shooter-stalker-2-delayed-until-december" rel="nofollow">delayed</a> numerous <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-delayed-once-again-november" rel="nofollow">times</a> before its eventual release earlier this year.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1643320/STALKER_2_Heart_of_Chornobyl/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/stalker-2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and it's also on Game Pass (for <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-game-pass-price-hike-new-tier" rel="nofollow">certain tiers</a>, anyway). Make sure to take a look at <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/stalker-2-review" rel="nofollow">our very own Robert N. Adams' review here</a> to find out how things have changed in the Zone over the last 17 years or so.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/trails-in-sky-1st-chapter-simultaneous-global-release-2025</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter-will-get-a-simultaneous-worldwide-release-in-2025.1065285/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/trails-in-sky-1st-chapter-simultaneous-global-release-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nihon Falcom and GungHo Entertainment have announced that&nbsp;<em>Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter</em>, an upcoming remake of 2004 JRPG&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky</em>, will be getting a worldwide release next year.</p>

<p>In a new trailer, the two studios confirm that&nbsp;<em>Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter&nbsp;</em>will arrive across the world in fall next year, and that it'll also be coming to PC and PlayStation 5 alongside its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-direct-august-2024-recap" rel="nofollow">previously-announced Nintendo Switch release</a>.</p>

<p>At that point, it was named&nbsp;<em>Trails in the Sky the 1st</em>, presumably in keeping with the naming convention used by <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/436670/The_Legend_of_Heroes_Trails_in_the_Sky_the_3rd/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">third instalment&nbsp;<em>Trails in the Sky the 3rd</em></a>. It looks like Nihon Falcom has abandoned that particular approach, though.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter-estelle-combat.jpg?itok=3i5GUBww 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter-estelle-combat.jpg?itok=jmK-eThI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter&nbsp;</em>is getting a simultaneous global release.</figcaption></figure><p>Nihon Falcom and GungHo are promising that&nbsp;<em>Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter&nbsp;</em>will serve as a "full 3D remake" of the original game, complete with "brand-new localizations, enhanced visuals, and refined gameplay mechanics".</p>

<p>Although it'll have a fresh coat of paint and more,&nbsp;<em>1st Chapter&nbsp;</em>will still tell the same story as the original game, in which protagonists Estelle and Joshua set out to become Bracers (essentially a sort of peacekeeping force).</p>

<p>Along the way, they're caught up in a wider conspiracy that comes with all the usual JRPG trappings; world-saving drama, twists and turns, and plenty of character moments to get you attached to your party.</p>

<p>You can check out the first major trailer for&nbsp;<em>Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter&nbsp;</em>right here. It should give you a sense of what's changed in the kingdom of Liberl since last you visited (or introduce you to it if this is your first time).</p>




<p><em>Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter&nbsp;</em>arrives on PC via Steam, as well as PlayStation 5 and Nintendo Switch, in fall 2025. We don't have a more specific release date than that yet, so stay tuned for more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-will-be-around-the-same-size-of-wild-hunt-devs-aim-for-quality-over-quantity/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>CD Projekt RED did a veritable press tour for The Witcher IV reveal after the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-gets-first-trailer-showing-off-cirilla/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trailer's debut at The Game Awards 2024</a>. After talking about Ciri as a <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-devs-comment-on-ciri-as-the-new-protagonist-explain-that-player-agency-will-be-at-the-center/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">protagonist</a>, revealing her new voice <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-ivs-ciri-has-a-new-voice-actress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">actress</a>, and confirming <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-dev-confirms-gwent-talks-about-ciris-new-powers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gwent</a>, the developers stopped by for an interview <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiYBje1qeaA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with the YouTube channel Skill Up</a>. Here, Game Director Sebastian Kalemba discussed the game's scope, which is said to be similar to The Witcher III: Wild Hunt.</p>
<p><em> I'll give you guys an anecdote first before I answer the question. I remember when we were thinking about how many hours you would need to, let's say, finish The Witcher 3: Hearts of Stone and The Witcher 3: Blood and Wine. When we threw the numbers, we were like, maybe 5 or 10 hours for Heart of Stone and maybe 10 or 15 hours for Blood and Wine, and we ended up with 30 hours. Of course, empirically, we have so much knowledge regarding the structure of The Witcher 1, 2, 3, the structure of Cyberpunk 2077 and all the expansions, so we use this data. But we look at the scale a little differently. We don't want to be servants to the numbers. </em></p>
<p><em>Yeah, the map of The Witcher IV is definitely more or less the same when it comes to the size.</em> <em>The amount of quests is also more or less the same, but again, the game is going to be big, but also, the ambition of the entire team is huge. First and foremost, we want to deliver a super compelling experience. So, again, quality over quantity. But definitely, what we can promise is that, yes, this game is going to be pretty big. It's going to be comparable to everything we've done so far, but I cannot tell you if it will be 90%, 85%, or whatever.</em></p>
<p>For the record, The Witcher III: Wild Hunt is definitely a huge game. The main story alone can take over 50 hours, and with all the side content, it goes easily above a hundred hours, even if you don't want to complete every single hunt and Easter egg. Still, Kalemba emphasized the studio's focus on quality.</p>
<p>In a not entirely unrelated addendum, the Game Director of The Witcher IV also stressed that this is not the beginning of the game's marketing campaign. It was simply a reveal of the title and the new protagonist. The game entered full production earlier this year, so there's still a long wait ahead for fans - probably a couple of years, if not more.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/11-bit-studios-layoffs-project-8</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/11-bit-studios-lays-off-staff-and-cancels-console-focused-project-8.1065243/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/11-bit-studios-layoffs-project-8<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em>developer and publisher 11 bit studios has laid off an unknown number of staff and canceled an upcoming project previously codenamed&nbsp;<em>Project 8</em>.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://ir.11bitstudios.com/en/news/11-bit-studios-ends-development-of-project-8" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">message to investors</a>, the studio confirms that its management has "resolved to discontinue the development of the game codenamed&nbsp;<em>Project 8</em>", and that this discontinuation will result in a loss of around 48.4 million Polish zloty (that's about $11 million).</p>

<p>Board president&nbsp;Przemysław Marszał says that&nbsp;<em>Project 8&nbsp;</em>was "conceived under very different conditions" for the industry, during a time when "narrative-driven, story-rich games held stronger appeal".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/11-bit-studios-frostpunk-2.jpg?itok=BLf8GgEl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/11-bit-studios-frostpunk-2.jpg?itok=NE6TQglj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>11 bit studios' most recent game is the snowy city-builder&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>He says that after an assessment of&nbsp;<em>Project 8</em>'s progress, management found "unresolved issues and challenges that would require further extensions of the production timeline and corresponding budget increases to address".</p>

<p>Together with what&nbsp;Marszał calls "revised sales forecasts, largely reflecting the changing market environment", caused management to harbor "significant doubts" about&nbsp;<em>Project 8</em>'s "overall profitability", hence its cancellation.</p>

<p>Shutting down&nbsp;<em>Project 8&nbsp;</em>will also result in layoffs,&nbsp;Marszał and 11 bit say. The studio doesn't disclose exactly how many employees' jobs are on the line, but&nbsp;Marszał does say that "more than half" of&nbsp;<em>Project 8</em>'s 37 developers will be offered opportunities to work elsewhere within 11 bit.</p>

<p>In closing,&nbsp;Marszał says that despite this setback, 11 bit has what he calls a "clear and well-defined roadmap" for its future projects, including the continuation of work on&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em>and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-alters-delayed-2025" rel="nofollow">release of upcoming sci-fi adventure&nbsp;<em>The Alters</em></a>.</p>

<p>The studio itself <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/frostpunk-2-profitable-sales-350k" rel="nofollow">said that the game was already profitable</a> just a few days after launch, but shares in the company plummeted after&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2</em>'s release, with <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/shares-video-game-maker-11-bit-studios-slump-after-frostpunk-2-release-2024-09-23/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">an analyst saying</a> the game's Steam player peak was "a negative surprise" compared to expectations.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/gsc-game-world">GSC Game World</a> has released the first major patch for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stalker-2">Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl</a>, which addresses over 1800 issues and fixes to the game's A-Life.</p>
<p>What's more, the game has now recouped its investment and has turned a profit, according to the studio's owner Maxim Krippa in an interview with <a href="https://forbes.ua/news/gsc-game-prodali-dostatnyu-kilkist-kopiy-stalker-2-shchob-vivesti-proekt-u-pributok-investor-krippa-18122024-25653">Forbes</a>. Krippa also confirmed at least two expansions and multiplayer are planned, with no further details provided.</p>
<p>The developer notes Patch 1.1 is "huge" so will take some time to download. It includes A-Life fixes and AI improvements, balance adjustments, crash fixes and performance optimisations, issues with specific story missions, and more.</p>

<p>A-Life is the game's system to ensure NPCs appear natural. An <a href="https://support.stalker2.com/hc/en-us/articles/27929320406929-Beginner-s-Guide-FAQs#h_01JCJMM3744R2TV14ME0PT3RAK">FAQ</a> from the studio reads: "The A-Life 2.0 system is responsible for ensuring that the Zone lives its own life regardless of your actions. The game world around you is changing all the time. Mutants, stalkers, bandits, and other inhabitants of the Zone move around, hunt, fight among themselves for lairs and territories, or join groups."</p><p>The system was criticised by players for feeling too scripted and not organic enough. A number of fixes have now been implemented, increasing the rate players will encounter roaming NPCs, improving the navigation of NPCs, enhancing their motivation to expand territory and actively attack, and other changes.</p>
<p>Further small AI improvements have been made to both NPCs and enemies.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, several missions have received increased rewards, an infinite money exploit has been fixed, performance has been improved in largely populated areas, and plenty more.</p>
<p>Check out a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1643320/view/525329871842312365">Steam notice for the full patch notes</a>.</p>
<p>"Thank you very much for your support and feedback," the notes read. "We will continue working on the game, listening to your comments and reviews to investigate all possible issues and solve them as soon as possible."</p>
<p>At its launch in November, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-review">Stalker 2</a> was criticised for its performance issues.</p>
<p>However, in an interview with Eurogamer, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/delaying-stalker-2-again-not-an-option-studio-says-team-worked-until-it-was-broken-by-marathon-development">GSC Game World's CEO Ievgen Grygorovych said delaying the game was not an option</a>.</p>
<p>"You're so tired that you would just die if you say let's run an additional marathon," said Grygorovych. "We didn't have a chance to say let's do it more. We just had a chance of 'let's do until this moment - the release date - as much as we can'."</p><p>Creative director Mariia Grygorovych also acknowledged issues with the game at launch. "It's not perfect, we need to fix everything, it has some problems," she said. "But it's a game! It's a game with soul, with feelings there, with love there. Even the problems, you can't fix them if you don't have a game."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/19/game-of-the-year-2024-best-independent/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/game-of-the-year-2024-%E2%80%93-best-independent-game.1065228/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/19/game-of-the-year-2024-best-independent/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>If you want games that really experiment with ideas, and take concepts and mix them up, then the indie scene is the space in which that happens. From solo developers to small teams, indies have provided some of the most memorable, interesting, thought-provoking, and fun games over the years. Just look at <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/05/08/dredge-review/">Dredge</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/12/20/game-of-the-year-2023-best-independent-game/">which won this award last year</a>. Now, we’re here to celebrate a new winner and there could really only have been one.</p>

<p>When it comes to taking something old and giving it a grand old shake up, Balatro has done it in style. Selling over 3.5 million copies, developer LocalThunk has taken poker and wrapped a roguelike experience around it that will really keep you coming back for more.</p>
<p>The concept of Balatro is so simple, and it keeps you hooked as you unlock more cards to use, slowly getting to grips with the different types available and learning how they will benefit you. Hours can be lost as you play through runs, building decks, collecting jokers, using arcane and planet cards for boosts, all to chase and play a hand that will satisfyingly score millions of points. You will also be looking at the collection of cards you have unlocked, wanting to complete the entire set, hoping a card you have not yet seen appears. This is as fun as poker can get, and all you’ll really lose is time.</p>
<h3>UFO 50 – Runner up</h3>
<p>It’s easy to look at a release like UFO 50 and assume it’s a selection of minigames with no long-term depth, but that couldn’t be farther from the truth. Each title in this massive omnibus ranges from a long-replayable arcade adventure to an hours-long RPG epic. As you dig into each of them, though, a wider story unfurls, and gives you cause to hunt for hidden details and buried easter eggs that add up to turn UFO 50 into an unparalleled game-design triumph and narrative-fueled easter egg hunt.</p>

<p>Some games in UFO 50 grabbed me more than others, but like chapters in a book or parts of a movie, even the weaker pieces of the puzzle contribute to a full experience that left my brain firing deep into the night, thinking about UFO 50 and how much I couldn’t wait to play it again.</p>
<p><em>– Miguel M</em></p>
<h3>Crow Country – Runner up</h3>
<p>In a year with a host of fantastic indie horror games, Crow Country stands out as one of the best. The unique aesthetics look like an uncanny combination of Resident Evil and Final Fantasy VII at first glance, until you realise that you have full 3D camera control rather than the traditional fixed views. This in and of itself is enough to make the game stand out, but then you add in the excellent level design, some neat puzzles and satisfying gunplay to the mix.</p>
<p>The wonderfully Twin Peaks/X Files opening sees special agent Mara Forest investigating a mysterious rundown amusement park, the titular Crow Country, but the narrative soon spirals into something far more sinister and surprise filled. I’ve played a lot of indie games this year and Crow Country is one of the best and more than deserves its place amongst these end of year awards.</p>

            <p>The CEO of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> studio Arrowhead has responded to criticism from players of the high cost of its <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/killzone-2">Killzone 2</a> crossover.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-receives-first-ever-crossover-with-killzone-2-cosmetics">crossover with Sony's Killzone 2</a>, revealed yesterday, adds a number of themed items and cosmetics to the in-game store and is the first of its kind for the game. However, players have criticised their cost.</p>
<p>Usually, extra content is unlocked through a Warbond costing 1000 Super Credits (£7.99), which includes multiple weapons, armours, and cosmetic items. The Killzone 2 items are instead available to purchase separately, with all six items totalling 1,975 Super Credits - so two batches of 1000 Super Credits totalling £15.98, essentially doubling the price.</p>

<p>Separately, the StA-52 assault rifle costs 615 Super Credits (the most expensive item) and the AC-1 Dutiful armour costs 500 Super Credits.</p>
<p>Players have since responded negatively on the game's Discord server and reddit, with <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1hgyz51/615_sc_for_a_primary_weapon_is_straight_up/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">one reddit user posting</a> "615 SC for a primary weapon is straight up ridiculous".</p>
<p>Helldivers 2 creative director Johan Pilestedt responded to a player on X who said the price "definitely felt steep".</p>
<p>"Sorry you felt the price was steep, we are looking at all feedback," Pilestedt replied. "The reason we changed it from a Warbond was actually because there were concerns that having a higher priced Warbond would carry negative sentiment."</p> <div>

<p>Over on Discord, Arrowhead CEO Shams Jorjani responded (thanks <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/third-person-shooter/helldivers-2-players-rip-into-arrowhead-for-straight-up-ridiculous-killzone-crossover-prices-ceo-defends-the-choice-the-more-of-this-we-sell-the-more-illuminate-type-stuff-we-can-keep-dropping-for-free/">PC Gamer</a>). "Hey, quick comment on the Helghast stuff. Firstly, this is our first collaboration so we'll be figuring it out as we go along. Let us know what you'd like to see in the future," he said. "Secondly it's optional. The more of this we sell, the more Illuminate-type stuff we can keep dropping for free."</p>
<p>He later added: "This was my way of saying that the better the game does the more stuff we can do."</p>
<p>Further, Jorjani noted while Arrowhead is partnered with Sony, pricing was the studio's decision. "This one is on us," he wrote.</p>

</span></p><p>As stated in the crossover announcement, the collaboration marks the start of a new five day rotation length in the store.</p>
<p>"Right now, many of you feel the items are in rotation for too short a time, and that you sometimes miss out on that killer look you had your eyes on," Arrowhead said. "At the same time, the more things we add to the store the longer it takes to come back into rotation."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-kadokawa-biggest-shareholder<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony has acquired more shares in FromSoftware's parent company Kadokawa, which will make the Japanese gaming giant Kadokawa's biggest single shareholder (although it still doesn't have a majority stake).</p>

<p>According to a GamesIndustry.biz <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sony-to-become-largest-shareholder-of-fromsoftware-parent-kadokawa-corporation" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">report</a>, Sony has agreed to acquire over 12 million Kadokawa shares in January to the tune of about $318 million. This will give Sony a stake of around 10% in Kadokawa, making it the single largest shareholder in the company.</p>

<p>It's worth noting that as GI.biz points out, Sony already has a 14% stake in Kadokawa subsidiary FromSoftware, having <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tencent-and-sony-buy-over-30-shares-in-from-software" rel="nofollow">purchased shares in the studio back in August 2022</a> alongside Chinese gaming monolith Tencent (which has a 16% stake in FromSoftware, but no stake in Kadokawa).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-fromsoftware-kadokawa-sony.jpg?itok=hK0K9CiH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-fromsoftware-kadokawa-sony.jpg?itok=dIPkn9f0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>FromSoftware parent company Kadokawa could be closer to an acquisition deal with Sony.</figcaption></figure><p>According to the GI.biz report, the acquisition deal "goes beyond the sale of shares" and also includes plans for Sony to adapt Kadokawa IP into "live-action films and TV dramas", as well as an expansion of publishing and distribution for Kadokawa's games and anime.</p>

<p>This news comes just a few weeks after Kadokawa <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-kadokawa-purchase-report" rel="nofollow">confirmed that it was in talks</a> for Sony to acquire it outright, but that no decision had been made as yet. This deal could see Sony moving one step closer towards that acquisition.</p>

<p>While Kadokawa is perhaps best known as the parent company of&nbsp;<em>Dark Souls&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>developer FromSoftware, it's also the owner of companies like <i>Zero Escape&nbsp;</i>studio Spike Chunsoft and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kadokawa-acquire-purchase" rel="nofollow"><em>Octopath Traveler&nbsp;</em>developer Acquire</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/octopath-traveler-acquire-kadokawa.jpg?itok=W4n1dMCy 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/octopath-traveler-acquire-kadokawa.jpg?itok=d9cC1QRk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Kadokawa also owns&nbsp;<em>Octopath Traveler&nbsp;</em>studio Acquire, among others.</figcaption></figure><p>Still, FromSoftware arguably remains Kadokawa's most well-known and successful subsidiary, especially if the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-sales-25-million" rel="nofollow">sales of open-world action RPG&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-sales-25-million" rel="nofollow">Elden Ring</a>&nbsp;</em>are anything to go by.</p>

<p>Other recent successful Kadokawa releases include&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero</em>, another game published by Bandai Namco, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-sales-3m" rel="nofollow">topped three million sales in a single day</a> and which also recently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-update-splitscreen" rel="nofollow">received an update bringing split-screen multiplayer to all of its stages</a>.</p>

<p><em>Sparking! Zero&nbsp;</em>isn't the only Spike Chunsoft release to land in the last few weeks, either. Roguelike RPG&nbsp;<em>Shiren the Wanderer: The Mystery Dungeon of Serpentcoil Island&nbsp;</em>also <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shiren-wanderer-mystery-dungeon-of-serpentcoil-island-pc" rel="nofollow">netted itself a PC release recently</a>, having netted itself 200,000 sales on Switch in Japan "quickly" after release.</p>

<p>It remains to be seen whether Sony's acquisition of more shares in Kadokawa will eventually lead to an outright purchase. Stay tuned for more on this.</p>

<p>Stalker 2: Heart of Chornoby’s 1.1 update and patch notes represent the first major changes to the shooter. GSC Game World has made a ton of changes to Stalker 2 to its performance and fixing lingering key issues, and we have the full patch notes to check out.</p>



<p>The launch of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stalker-2-review-heart-of-chornobyl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stalker 2</a> has been a resounding one, and successful enough to show the world wants more irradiated exploration. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stalker-2-profitable-one-month-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stalker 2 was considered profitable</a> only one month after its debut, and GSC Game World has already been hard at work, trying to repair some of the title’s technical detractions.</p>



<p>Now, the Stalker 2 1.1 update delivers the biggest and most important fixes to date. Outside of headline-making improvements to A-Life, the 1.1 update for Stalker 2 brings with it a staggering <strong>1,800 improvements</strong>, distributed across gameplay, AI, missions, the general open world, and much more.</p>



<h2 id="h-biggest-stalker-2-dec-19-update-1-1-changes">Biggest STALKER 2 Dec. 19 Update 1.1 Changes</h2>



<figure></figure>



<h3 id="h-a-life-is-alive-and-well">A-Life is Alive and Well</h3>



<p>It’s no secret A-Life has been a bit buggy and somewhat irrational since launch. Stalker 2’s 1.1 update should make this less of an issue though as the patch notes fix a variety of A-Life issues: NPC interactions feel more natural, they should be more frequent, and better optimization for NPCs in offline mode.</p>



<h3 id="h-ai-amp-balancing">AI &amp; Balancing</h3>



<p>Stalker 2 suffers from a lot of problems many games have at launch: Issues pop up that didn’t in testing, and certain aspects need appropriate buffs and nerfs. A bunch of animations and AI behavioral patterns have been amended in the Stalker 2 1.1 update, whereas rewards, item values, abilities, ammo distribution, and weapon attachments have all been tinkered with in the full patch notes.</p>



<h3 id="h-missions-were-a-main-mission">Missions Were a Main Mission</h3>



<p>A ton of missions and side quests have been addressed in the 1.1 update for Stalker 2. The tweaks include missing characters vital to the progression of quests now being present, misbehaving mission markers, absent cutscenes, and a whole host of other improvements designed to keep progression smooth.</p>



<h2 id="h-complete-list-of-stalker-2-update-1-1-fixes-amp-improvements">Complete list of STALKER 2 Update 1.1 Fixes &amp; Improvements</h2>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/writer-of-beloved-sonic-the-hedgehog-song-live-and-learn-is-suing-sega<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">The song has been used in at least 25 different games over the years.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The writer of the infamous Sonic Adventure 2 song "Live and Learn" is suing Sega, claiming he owns the rights to the song in part, and alleging the company has been using the song without his permission and making money off it over the last 20 years. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/498953/sonic-music-live-and-learn-copyright-lawsuit-crush-40-sega" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lawsuit first spotted by Polygon</a> and also viewed by IGN, John Gioeli, the writer and performer for Live and Learn, asserts that he has maintained his songwriting registration for the song for over 20 years since he first wrote and recorded it for Sonic Adventure 2. However, he says Sega has been improperly claiming it is the actual owner of the song and behaving as such, including licensing the song to "at least 25 video games, television shows, live performances/events, and films."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Specifically, Gioeli's suit claims that Sega is basing its ownership of Live and Learn off "a 2001 lyric agreement where Gioeli was paid $3000 to write lyrics for a as-yet-untitled song that would be included in Sonic Adventure 2." He did so at his home studio, using his own equipment and own vocals, allegedly without Sega's direct involvement. He did work with Sega composer Jun Senoue over the phone, with Senoue initially sending him a music demo that Gioeli was supposed to write lyrics for. But the suit claims that the scope of Gioeli's work expanded over the course of his work on Live and Learn without amendment to the initial agreement, which was only for the lyrics. Allegedly, Gioeli revised the song significantly, communicating changes over the phone to Senoue.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As a result, Gioeli says Sega claims it owns both the recording and musical composition, but argues this is not actually the case and that there is no agreement stating such. And Gioeli also claims that Sega has acknowledged in the past that the composition is "likely jointly owned", with one Sega lawyer allegedly telling Gioeli at one point that he is entitled to 50% of profits from its use.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gioeli allegedly was somehow unaware that Sega has been using Live and Learn with regularity in a number of other formats over the last 20 years. This is despite Gioeli working closely with the company on a number of songs throughout this time, all of which had far more specific agreements signed about who owned what. Per the suit, he only found out about its myriad uses through a fan telling him, and has since identified 25 video games it exists in. These include multiple Yakuza and Sonic games, Super Smash Bros, Phantasy Star Online, the maimai series, and Monster Hunter Rise). Notably, Gioeli <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-3-will-feature-sonic-adventure-2s-beloved-song-live-and-learn-band-confirms">was involved in the song's inclusion in the recent movie Sonic the Hedgehog 3</a> (which we've <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-review-jim-carrey-ben-schwartz-james-marsden-idris-elba">just reviewed</a>), and even signed the deal with Paramount for song placement. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gioeli is seeking a court decision as to the ownership of Live and Learn, as well as a restitution for any money he is owed and damages for breach of the 2001 Lyric Agreement.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

High on the surprise release of their highly acclaimed 2023 hit Hi-Fi Rush, <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-closes-redfall-developer-arkane-austin-hifi-rush-developer-tango-gameworks-and-more-in-devastating-cuts-at-bethesda&amp;sa=D&amp;source=docs&amp;ust=1734595482633524&amp;usg=AOvVaw3eYxpmlBQUvMj2RthQ0_EN" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the studio was suddenly closed down in May</a>, causing uproar among game fans around the world. Then, in August, it was announced that South Korea’s PUBG publisher <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hi-fi-rush-ip-and-tango-gameworks-acquired-by-krafton-from-xbox-studio-will-no-longer-be-shut-down">Krafton had reached an agreement to acquire Tango</a>, along with Hi-Fi Rush, granting the studio a new lease of life.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Amid such dramatic twists and turns, Tango has retained many of its staff for this new iteration. IGN spoke with studio head Colin Mack, creative director / Hi-Fi Rush director John Johanas, and development director / Hi-Fi Rush project manager Kazuaki Egashira about their plans for Tango Gameworks going forward.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/19/hfr1-1734592108151.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Hi-Fi Rush director John Johanas. Photo by IGN.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hi-fi-rush-2-dev-wants-it-to-have-a-more-open-world-type-of-experience-new-owner-says">previous reports</a> that Hi-Fi Rush 2 is in development, Mack clarified that the team are still considering their options before they commit to a sequel. That is to say, the team had previously been working on a sequel at the time of the acquisition, and it seems pretty likely that they will continue to do so, but at this stage a sequel is not guaranteed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We are considering a sequel positively,” Mack told IGN. “We are not yet at the stage where we can say specifically, ‘This is what we're going to do.' ”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Johanas added: “Many of our staff have a lot of love for [Hi-Fi Rush], so we feel like we have options. We’re currently at the stage of considering various opportunities.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Not only the game but also the characters and the world are beloved by us, so I want to cherish this IP.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">From The Evil Within to Ghostwire: Tokyo and finally Hi-Fi Rush, Tango Gameworks is known for creating brand new games, and it seems that this culture still persists in the studio’s latest incarnation under Krafton. Egashira explained that creating new experiences is “in the DNA of Tango Gameworks."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Hi-Fi Rush became popular as a new IP, but if Hi-Fi Rush were to stay the same forever, it would eventually become outdated,” he said. “I think Tango Gameworks is about taking on new challenges. I hope to continue to work in a way that puts developers at the center, without losing our passion.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Not only me, but many of the development staff have a strong attachment to Hi-Fi Rush,” said Johanas. “Not only the game but also the characters and the world are beloved by us, so I want to cherish this IP.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“On the other hand, it's important to try new things. I worked on The Evil Within, directed its DLC, and then directed the sequel The Evil Within 2. I don't think I could have made yet another horror game at that point, because there’s only so much you can do with the same material. It’s risky to try something completely different, sure — but I think a sequel to a series is also a risk in itself.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Krafton’s acquisition of Tango Gameworks came about when the studio members, faced with imminent closure, began looking for a buyer. Krafton was proactive in courting the team and moved extremely quickly to propose and finalize the acquisition, allowing many of the staff to stay together. “I’m glad that we were able to continue making games together while keeping the DNA of Tango Gameworks intact, rather than starting from scratch again,” said Johanas, highlighting how the team’s chemistry was built up over years of working together, and played a big part in the success of Hi-Fi Rush.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The studio currently has around 50 employees, and Mack says they will begin recruitment in late December or January 2025, with a view to growing to around 100 people. This will allow them to focus on making one game at a time while also experimenting with new projects on the side, much like how Hi-Fi Rush was initially created.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Johanas also recalled advice given to him by Shinji Mikami, the legendary developer who founded Tango Gameworks in 2010 before leaving in 2023 after the release of Hi-Fi Rush. Mikami was keen to foster new talent at Tango, and Johanas essentially became one of his apprentices, influencing his views on how the studio will continue into the future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I learned from Mr Mikami that it is important for a director to discuss ideas for a game with their team rather than giving orders, and to make the game together,” Johanas said. “He often said that if you make a game like a bonsai tree, it may take the shape the director had in mind, but each of the development staff will not feel their output is reflected. In that sense, freedom is very important. Of course, it is necessary for the director to decide the overall direction, but we have always valued an environment where the staff can create freely, rather than one where they are only allowed to as they are told. It's closer to the growth of a tree in nature than a bonsai tree.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Mikami places a high level of trust in his staff, which is why so many of us have stayed at Tango Gameworks for so long. I hope to continue this culture of freedom in the future.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>For information on recruitment at Tango Gameworks, check out </em><a href="https://www.krafton.com/ja/careers/jobs/?var_page=1&amp;search_list_cnt=10&amp;search_studio=TangoGameworks" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u><em>Krafton’s recruitment site</em></u></a><em>. </em><a href="https://x.com/rined1987" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u><em>Esra Krabbe</em></u></a><em> is an editor at IGN Japan.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-becomes-majority-shareholder-in-fromsoftware-parent-kadokawa-no-full-takeover-for-now<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Ring the changes.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony has invested 50 billion yen (approx. $318 million) in FromSoftware parent company Kadokawa, putting the brakes on a full takeover for now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With the investment, Sony becomes the largest shareholder in Kadokawa, with 10% of the company’s shares. Chinese megacorp Tencent is next in-line.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kadokawa and Sony have formed what the pair described as a ‘Strategic Capital and Business Alliance,’ with the goal to boost Kadokawa’s long list of intellectual properties globally.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The announcement of the deal includes vague corporate speak about how the two companies plan to work together in the future, but there is a line about adapting Kadokawa’s IP into live-action films and TV dramas globally, co-producing anime works, and further expanding the publishing of Kadokawa’s games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That line in particular has already sparked speculation that Sony may help realise a live-action Elden Ring movie or TV series of some kind, but it’s worth pointing out that much of Sony’s interest in Kadokawa has to do with its anime business, as opposed to its video game business.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony boss Hiroki Totoki commented: "Through this capital and business alliance, we will become the largest shareholder of Kadokawa, which consistently creates a wide variety of IP, including publications and books, such as light novels and comics, as well as games and anime.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“By combining Kadokawa’s extensive IP and IP creation ecosystem with the strengths of Sony, which has promoted the global expansion of a wide range of entertainment, including anime and games, we plan to work closely together to realize Kadokawa’s 'Global Media Mix' strategy, aimed at maximizing the value of its IP, and Sony's long-term vision, 'Creative Entertainment Vision.'"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-may-find-it-hard-to-buy-all-of-fromsoftware-parent-company-kadokawa-financial-report-claims">financial experts said the PlayStation maker might have been put off the deal due to the cost of having to acquire all of Kadokawa</a>, rather than the parts it was actually interested in.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kadokawa was reportedly only interested in doing a deal with Sony if it bought the entire company. Sony, however, was reportedly only interested in “extracting” assets related to anime and video games, which presumably included the developer of Elden Ring.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Buying all of Kadokawa would cost 640 billion yen (approx $4.3 billion), according to expert estimates. Sony’s cash for buyouts is apparently tight at the moment due to investments made elsewhere. As a point of comparison, Sony bought Destiny developer Bungie for $3.7 billion back in 2022. The studio has since suffered multiple rounds of layoffs and project cancelations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s also the apparent prospect of a bidding war, or scope for Sony to buy 50% of Kadokawa and turn it into a subsidiary it doesn’t wholly own.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kadokawa’s business extends into areas that fit into Sony’s broader entertainment offering, which includes anime, manga, TV, and film. Kadokawa is a prolific publisher of anime, and Sony already owns anime streamers Crunchyroll and Funimation.

            <p>Crush 40 musician and Sonic songwriter Johnny Gioeli is suing Sega of America over ownership of the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/r-sa2-dc">Sonic Adventure 2</a> theme song Live and Learn.</p>
<p>Gioeli has claimed Sega only has rights to the lyrics of the song and not the "master recording and musical composition", the <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/806228650/Live-and-Learn-lawsuit-via-Polygon">lawsuit</a> reads (as shared by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/498953/sonic-music-live-and-learn-copyright-lawsuit-crush-40-sega">Polygon</a>), but "unbeknownst" to the songwriter Sega has "exploited and licensed" the song to "at least 25 video games, television shows, live performances/events, and films".</p>
<p>Live and Learn features heavily in the latest film, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-hedgehog-3">Sonic the Hedgehog 3</a>, though Gioeli previously confirmed to <a href="https://aftermath.site/sonic-movie-live-and-learn">Aftermath</a> a deal was signed for its use with Paramount.</p>

<p>In the lawsuit, Gioeli claims he was paid $3000 to write lyrics for an as-yet-untitled song to be included in Sonic Adventure 2. He then "ended up arranging, producing, recording, and performing vocals on Live and Learn, which was produced out of his home studio in California using his own equipment without the supervision, control, or involvement" of Sega.</p>
<p>Further, Sega's assertion it owns full control over the master recording and music composition is "without basis" as there is no agreement in place with Gioeli to transfer rights beyond the lyrics.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Gioeli has "maintained his songwriting registration" for the song for over 20 years. The songwriter holds the <a href="https://publicrecords.copyright.gov/detailed-record/36292721">copyright</a> for Live and Learn, where he's listed as having authorship over the music and lyrics. The date of this registration is 2024.</p><p>Gioeli does admit the "composition is likely jointly owned", the lawsuit reads, and is therefore seeking a Court decision to determine the ownership of the song. The writer is also seeking $500,000 in damages, and a further $500,000 in restitution.</p>
<p>Gioeli has worked with Sega composer Jun Senoue on multiple Sonic soundtracks, together writing and performing under the name Sons of Angels, which was later changed to Crush 40.</p>
<p>While his work on Live and Learn was "expressly limited in scope to lyrics" as per his agreement with Sega, Gioeli received demos of instrumental portions from Senoue and a back and forth ensued with Gioeli's input.</p>
<p>Gioeli "controlled and oversaw the recording process, produced the recording, directed the arrangement and of the song, directed the recording process for other musicians, and recorded and performed the vocals", the lawsuit reads.</p>
<p>Gioeli worked with Sega for over 20 years, from 1998's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-adventure">Sonic Adventure</a> to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/team-sonic-racing">Team Sonic Racing</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-sonic-at-olympic-games-tokyo-2020">Mario &amp; Sonic at the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020</a> in 2019.</p>
<p>However, the lawsuit states he was made aware by a fan of Crush 40 that Live and Learn was present in other well-known games, including the likes of Sonic Generations, multiple Yakuza games, multiple Super Smash Bros. games, and the recent <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-x-shadow-generations-review">Sonic x Shadow Generations</a>.</p><p>"I have no comment other than my desire to maintain the preservation of a long standing beautiful relationship with Sega," Gioeli told Polygon. "I do not want fans to draw conclusions or be disrupted from the beautiful memories we have made collectively with this music. I believe and hope we will come to a peaceful settlement that will be fair and just."</p>
<p>Eurogamer has contacted Sega for further comment.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-film-review">Sonic the Hedgehog 3 film</a> releases this week, capping off Sega's Year of Shadow.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>A new version of the Bloodborne Remaster project mod is now available for download, introducing further visual improvements to the PlayStation 4 exclusive which has become fully playable on PC this year thanks to the ShadPS4 emulator.</p>
<p>The 0.8 version of the mod introduces plenty of improvements over the previous release, such as more point lights, more parallax occlusion mapping, some reflectance map changes, and more. The new features introduced by the new version of the mod are explained in great detail by the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@fromsoftserve" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fromsoftserve</a>, creator of the mod, in the video below. The mod can be downloaded from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/bloodborne/mods/45" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nexus Mods</a>.</p>

<p>Having a playable PC version of Bloodborne has been a dream for soulslike fans for a very long time, and it has finally become a reality earlier this year, as mentioned above, thanks to the fast improvement of the ShadPS4 emulator over the past few months. Emulation still isn't 100% perfect, but things continue to improve steadily, and a recent update of the emulator addressed some of the most common issues with the game, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-reduced-vram-dynamic-shadows/">RAM usage spikes, excessive VRAM usage, and frequent crashing</a>. The reduction in VRAM usage is actually a rather significant improvement, as this should allow those with older GPUs to run the game better.</p>
<p>More information on the ShadPS4 emulator that has made Bloodborne playable on PC can be found on its official website.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ys-x-proud-nordics-announced/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today has been a day of announcements for Japanese publisher Nihon Falcom, who has revealed an updated version of Ys X as well as the release window and platforms for the previously announced Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter, a remake of the first entry in the sprawling Trails series.</p>
<p>Ys X: Proud Nordics is the updated version of the tenth entry in the series, which was released only a few months ago in the West. This new version of the game will feature plenty of new features, including a new location, Aland Island, located to the north of Obelia Gulf, where Adol and Karja will meet another mysterious Mana user, learn new Mana Actions, and more. Together with the new story content, Ys X: Proud Nordics will also feature new bosses, Mana Ride races, and arena battles that will put players' skills to the test. The game has only been announced for Japan as of now and will launch sometime next year.</p>

<p>Besides announcing Ys X: Proud Nordics, Falcom revealed today that Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter, which was revealed for Nintendo Switch earlier this year, will also launch on PC and PlayStation 5 during Fall 2025. The game will be published in the West by GungHo Online Entertainment, complete with English and Japanese voice-overs and English, Japanese, French, and German subtitles. A new trailer showcasing the overhauled visuals and combat system over the original was also released today, and you can check it out below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter - Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Gd9j_NWZGG8?start=1&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While the announcement of more platforms and a release window for Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter is very welcome, the announcement of Ys X: Proud Nordics so close to the Western release of the original version of the game is far less so, even though it is a completely enjoyable experience, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ys-x-nordics-one-more-memorable-adventure/">review</a>. Hopefully, players won't need to purchase the game again to enjoy the new content, which sounds rather substantial.</p>

			<p>A new STALKER 2 major patch is now live on PC and Xbox consoles, bringing performance and optimization improvements, A-Life 2.0 enhancements, and more.</p>
<p>The massive 1.1 patch, which is a whopping 110 GB big, addresses over 1800 issues, including many of the issues that prevented the game's A-Life system from working properly in Offline, out of the player's visualization range. Plenty of AI "anomalies" were also fixed, and some balance adjustments were made, such as increased rewards for several missions, tweaked damage for PSY fields, and more.</p>
<p>The new STALKER 2 major patch also brings performance and optimization improvements. Largely populated areas of the map should run better in the new version of the game, and performance drops should no longer be an issue in a variety of scenarios and for those running the game on any RTX 3000 series card with AND FSR frame generation. You can check out the massive list of fixes introduced by the new patch by heading over <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1643320/view/525329871842312365" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here.</a></p>
<p>STALKER 2 is now available on PC, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S worldwide. You can learn more about the latest entry in the series by GSC Game World, which has already <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-is-already-profitable-says-gsc-investor-and-it-might-be-adapted-to-netflix/">become profitable and could be adapted for a TV show</a>, by checking out Alessio's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-the-anomaly-never-changes/">review.</a></p>

            <p>The developer of Catly has updated the game's Steam page with a proper gameplay trailer and screenshots, following allegations its game and trailer have been made with generative AI and blockchain technology.</p>
<p>The trailer (on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2987350/Catly/">Steam</a> but not yet YouTube) shows various cats wandering through surreal natural environments, as well as customisation options for cat types and multiple outfits.</p>

<p>Catly was first revealed at last week's The Game Awards, described as an "open-world adventure" where players build their dream island and care for cats through "dressing up, building, farming, racing, skiing, and much more", according to the Steam page.</p><p>Further gameplay details have been added. An online mode will allow players to collaborate from around the world on their cat creations and complete challenges with island residents. There will be farming sim elements as well as island building, plus templates and tools to design personalised outfits, furniture, houses, and gardens.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/catly-developer-denies-using-generative-ai-or-blockchain-technology-in-its-open-world-cat-game">SuperAuthenti came under fire following the game's reveal</a> due to allegations it used generative AI for its game and trailer, as well as suspected links to blockchain technology.</p>
<p>The studio's co-founder, Kevin Yeung, also co-founded TenthPlanet - a studio reportedly working on two blockchain games. The Steam page also includes a testimonial from known web3 investor and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a> producer Thomas Vu.</p>
<p>SuperAuthenti said generative AI had not been used for the game or trailer. "In fact we are very surprised by such speculations," it said in a statement from a PR representative. "We do not think there are any existing AI tools that can produce a video like that. Industry experts have echoed this opinion."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-accessible-games-of-2024<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">December is a big month for me. It’s a time to celebrate the holidays with friends and family, surprise loved ones with unique gifts, and attempt to reconnect with the ever-growing monstrosity that is my backlog. December is also a time for me to reflect on games that launched throughout the year – especially those that continued to demonstrate the rise in accessibility acceptance, as well as push the innovative boundary for future titles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">2024 was rife with accessible games, spanning across numerous genres and developed by various sized studios. As the industry’s understanding and implementation of features and designs continues to evolve, games are far more accessible than before. And with this year-end issue of Access Designed, IGN would like to recognize several games for their accessibility excellence. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Runner-up: Dragon Age: The Veilguard</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/18/accessible-games-2024-dragon-age-the-veilguard-1734540157261.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Bioware’s latest installment in its fantasy RPG series, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>, is the purest definition of normalizing and standardizing accessibility. Not only does it demonstrate the studio’s increased commitment to disabled players since Dragon Age: Inquisition’s release in 2014, but Veilguard’s accessibility offerings also impressively cater toward an array of disabilities.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Visual features like subtitle adjustments, colorblind filters, and both melee and ranged threat indicators allow deaf and hard of hearing users to process gameplay information without audio. For blind and low vision players, Veilguard’s options offer audio indicators for incoming attacks, dialogue options, and interactive objects – all of which are crucial for combat, storytelling, and overworld traversal. Physically disabled players can remap controls, toggle options for mechanics like blocking, aiming, and holding inputs, and even remove QTEs and combos with rapid button presses.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Veilguard’s greatest accessibility achievement, though, comes in the form of dynamic difficulty. Difficulty is not unanimous. Not only do the rules, methods and understanding of challenge vary between studios, individual games, and player experiences - the majority of difficulty settings only tackle enemy aggression, player damage output, and player health. But in Veilguard, disabled players can alter settings like enemy resistances, enemy vulnerability, timing windows for dodging and parrying, enemy health and aggression. You can even toggle player death, allowing you to remain alive no matter how much damage you take. Combine that with settings that allow players to continuously access previously learned information, have consistent waypoints for objectives and overworld items, and the capability to pause whenever you like, and disabled players are given the chance they need to process each encounter or recover stamina. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Veilguard isn’t perfect. Some features like single stick movement and robust guidance systems are missing. Yet it still acts as the quintessential modern accessible experience. The industry continues to rightfully praise games like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-part-2-is-the-new-gold-standard-for-accessibility">The Last of Us Part 2</a>, but Veilguard demonstrates it’s time to move beyond the notion that a single game deserves all the accessibility praise. Instead, accessibility is evolving across the industry, and Veilguard is one of this year’s prime examples.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Runner-up: Botany Manor</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/18/accessible-games-2024-botany-manor-1734540172274.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a common misconception that accessibility can only be achieved by companies owned by wealthy megacorporations like Microsoft or Sony. This belief that accessibility requires dozens of developers and untold amounts of money continues to plague innovation. But <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/botany-manor-review">Botany Manor</a>, a low-budget puzzle game, is proof that such a belief is a fallacy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Developed by Balloon Studios and published by Whitethorn Games, Botany Manor is a soothing puzzle solving game set in a stately home in 19th century England. This genre is, admittedly, not my favorite – I prefer action and turn-based RPGs. But the accessibility features and design of Botany Manor made this game an unexpectedly pleasant surprise. For starters, it offers full support for mouse and keyboard or controller, depending on your preferred setup. It also offers single stick gameplay, with an option to toggle the capability to look around. Finally, a toggle to sprint is also offered.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s an admittedly small selection of options, but they’re augmented by Botany Manor’s impressive use of inclusive design. There are no time limits for solving puzzles; instead players are allowed to take as much time as needed to figure out ways to grow specific plants. Furthermore, puzzles are relegated to a select number of rooms per chapter.

Some shortcomings aside, 2024 was as accessible as ever, and another fantastic year for disabled players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Grant Stoner is a disabled journalist covering accessibility and the disabled perspective in video games.

            <p>Nintendo's next console will be called Switch 2, feature magnetic Joy-Con controllers, and could be announced in January.</p>
<p>That's according to a new report from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/18/24324483/nintendo-switch-2-leak-reddit-next-handheld">The Verge</a>, after speaking with a mystery reddit leaker who claimed to have got their hands on a final version of the Switch 2 console and its dock.</p>
<p>The internet has been inundated with possible leaks of the new console recently, most notably from case manufacturer <a href="https://dbrand.com/shop/grip/nintendo-switch-2-cases">Dbrand</a> and a reddit user called <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1hdvb2d/ive_come_from_the_future/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">NextHandheld</a> who The Verge has since spoken with. "I've now heard and seen enough to think they might be legit," the report reads.</p>

<p>NextHandheld was able to show The Verge two photos of a possible Switch 2 dock and one of the inside of a possible controller rail (with certification logos and copper contacts exposed), which also shows a metal U-shaped kickstand.</p>
<p>The dock featured the same logo as the Nintendo Switch but with a 2 included, seemingly confirming Switch 2 will be the official name. NextHandheld's source claims an announcement to reveal the console will be made in January.</p>
<p>The controller rail image proves a rumour the Joy-Con controllers will attach magnetically to the console, with NextHandheld claiming there's a physical magnetic click when attached. A larger button will then release the controllers.</p>
<p>Further, NextHandheld claims the controllers will have magnetic Hall effect joysticks, which don't contain the deteriorating sensor material of the current Switch model and can be recalibrated easily. Essentially, this could mean the end of Joy-Con drift.</p>
<p>Lastly, NextHandheld claims the Switch 2 will launch in dark grey, with a white version to follow along with a model based on a Nintendo game yet to receive a themed Switch. However, they admit to not being able to turn on the console or play games, so there's plenty we still don't know.</p>
<p>For instance, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-confirms-backwards-compatibility-for-switch-2">Nintendo has officially confirmed backwards compatibility</a> for the new console, we don't know if this will be via physical cartridges or digital-only.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-cases-screen-protectors-already-for-sale-via-chinese-sellers">Switch 2 accessories were already made available</a> at the start of the month via Chinese sellers, while accessories manufacturer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-accessory-maker-pulls-trailer-showing-blurry-mockup-of-nintendos-next-console-design">Satisfye removed a trailer</a> showing the blurry outlines of the console.</p>
<p>At the least, it's clear we're edging ever closer to a full reveal.</p>

			<p>Circana (former NPD) Executive Director and Video Game Industry Analyst Mat Piscatella <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:bhqrrxt7yyfpwguioa7rwa7x/post/3ldljjx7lak2o" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> in a BlueSky post that the Nintendo Switch has surpassed PlayStation 2's lifetime console sales in the United States.</p>
<p>It's undoubtedly a huge milestone. To this date, the PlayStation 2 remains the best-selling console of all time, with around 160 million units sold, although that's a global figure. In the United States, the PlayStation 2 has sold 53 million units, which means the Nintendo Switch is now slightly over that number. There's actually another console that sold even more: the Nintendo DS, with its 57 million units. However, the DS was a handheld-only console, whereas the Switch is a hybrid console, making it directly comparable with the PS2.</p>
<p>Globally, the Nintendo Switch is still a bit far from the PS2. Around three months ago, we learned that the hybrid hardware had sold 146 million units, and its sales have been slowing down over the past year or so. With the Switch 2 about to be <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-march-2025-release/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a>, it's unlikely the original will be able to gather enough momentum to push past the PlayStation 2 and sit on the throne of all-time console sales.</p>
<p>Even so, it remains a smashing success for Nintendo, and it wasn't at all a given. Looking at Nintendo's history, they've gone from successful consoles like the Nintendo Entertainment System and Super Nintendo Entertainment System (which sold 61.91 million and 49.1 million units, respectively) to much less fortunate projects, like the Nintendo 64 (32 million units) and the GameCube (21.74 million consoles). The Wii returned Nintendo to its glory days and broke the milestone of a hundred million consoles sold, partly thanks to the motion control fad. But then the Wii U was another big flop, selling only 13.5 million units, the lowest ever for Nintendo.</p>
<p>It's hard to gauge what will happen with the upcoming Nintendo Switch 2, although the fact that it's rumored to carry over the same concepts as the Switch makes fans hopeful it will be another success story. Analysts are already <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-sell-17-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bullish</a> about it, that's for sure.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
It's been rumoured for a while that Sony are about to buy Kadokawa Corporation, a monolithic Japanese media conglomerate that means nothing to the bulk of you unless I append the magic words "parent company of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a> developers FromSoftware" and possibly also, "parent company of Spike Chunsoft". Sony and Kadokawa were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sony-is-in-talks-to-buy-dark-souls-and-elden-ring-parent-company-kadokawa">reported to be in talks last month</a>, fomenting all sorts of speculation about, say, the PC version of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bloodborne">Bloodborne</a> being ritually sacrificed to consecrate the PS6-exclusivity of Dark Souls 4. Now, the pair have emerged from the Cave of Haggling and announced... "a strategic capital and business alliance agreement". What does this mean? Is it safe to scream yet?
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Under the terms of the deal, Sony will acquire 12,054,100 new shares in Kadokawa totalling 50 billion yen by 7th January 2025. Together with the Kadokawa shares they already own, this will make them Kadokawa's largest shareholder, with around 10% of Kadokawa shares overall. So, not quite an acquisition, then. But it does give them a lot of say over Kadokawa's direction.
</p>
<p>
Kadokawa and Sony have collaborated on projects in the past. The agreement paves the way for more of that collaboration. According to <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/News/Press/202412/24-1219E/">an announcement release</a>, future team-ups might include "potential joint investments in the content field, joint discovery of new creators, and joint promotion of further media mixes of both companies' IP". More specifically, they're looking at "initiatives to adapt Kadokawa's IP into live-action films and TV dramas globally, co-produce anime works, expand global distribution of Kadokawa's anime works through the Sony Group, further expand publishing of Kadokawa's games, and develop human resources to promote and expand virtual production."
</p>
<p>
In short, they're going to adapt and sell each other's stuff worldwide, which could involve any number of games, but also, may apply predominantly to non-game works and especially anime. I'm a bit mystified by the phrase "develop human resources to promote and expand virtual production". On-set virtual production, I gather, is when you use LED panels as a backdrop during the making of a film or TV show, allowing computer-generated graphics to appear in real-time. I'm not clear whether the press release is referring to this, however.
</p><p>
Kadokawa CEO Takeshi Natsuno is cock-a-hoop about the agreement. "This alliance is expected to not only further strengthen our IP creation capabilities, but also increase our IP media mix options with Sony's support for global expansion, allowing us to deliver our IP to more users around the world," he observed, with a slap of his thighs and a twinkle in his eye. 
</p>
<p>
Sony group chief operational officer and chief financial officer Hiroki Totoki is similarly tickled. "By combining Kadokawa's extensive IP and IP creation ecosystem with the strengths of Sony, which has promoted the global expansion of a wide range of entertainment, including anime and games, we plan to work closely together to realize Kadokawa 'Global Media Mix' strategy, aimed at maximizing the value of its IP, and Sony's long-term vision, 'Creative Entertainment Vision,'" he enthused. Is it safe to scream now?
</p>
<p>
I can't speak to Kadokawa or Sony's recent handling of such things, as we've been more focussed on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-worrying-about-timed-exclusives-and-worry-more-about-games-industry-consolidation">events in North America and Europe</a>, but the non-merger is presumably good news for sustainability in the short term, inasmuch as no Kadokawa or Sony developers will lose their jobs to post-acquisition "due diligence", aka cost-cutting. As of August, Kadokawa had <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/fromsoftware-and-spike-chunsoft-parent-company-kadokawa-has-26-new-games-in-development/">26 games in development</a>.

		<p>Sony has made a big investment in FromSoftware parent company Kadokawa, forming a new capital and business alliance through the acquisition by Sony of a 10% stake in the media conglomerate. This includes shares previously purchased by Sony in 2021.</p>
<p>Sony President, COO and CFO Hiroki Totoki said, “Through this capital and business alliance, we will become the largest shareholder of Kadokawa, which consistently creates a wide variety of IP, including publications and books, such as light novels and comics, as well as games and anime. By combining Kadokawa’s extensive IP and IP creation ecosystem with the strengths of Sony, which has promoted the global expansion of a wide range of entertainment, including anime and games, we plan to work closely together to realize Kadokawa’s ‘Global Media Mix’ strategy, aimed at maximizing the value of its IP, and Sony’s long-term vision, ‘Creative Entertainment Vision.'”</p>


<p>While all the buzz here is about Sony getting closer ties to FromSoftware – mainly because a prospective Bloodborne remaster has become something of an internet meme – Kadokawa’s media empire is much, much broader than that. In game development they are the parent to Acquire and Spike Chunsoft, they also have an array of Japanese film-making companies, from animation to post-production localisation, and a books and manga arm as well.</p>
<p>This will be as much about games as it is about extending Sony’s reach within anime and other media – Kadokawa holds over 100,000 IP that can be tapped in various ways. Sony already has a near monopoly on global anime distribution, thanks to buying both Funimation and Crunchyroll in the past decade and combining the two, but now seems to be looking to gain more of the means of production, as it were.</p>

<p>The news follows <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/19/sony-kadokawa-fromsoftware-elden-ring-bloodborne/">rumours and public statements that Sony was exploring a wholesale acquisition of Kadokawa</a> – reports were that Kadokawa wanted either a complete buyout or for Sony to leave them alone,&nbsp;though it’s not clear whether those reports were a slight exaggeration of the actual negotiations or if they’ve compromised to this investment.</p>

<h2 id="h-what-about-the-acquisition">What about the acquisition?</h2>



<p>According to the statement, <strong>Sony Group does not intend to acquire any more shares after this move</strong>, which indicates that the Japanese company has given up on acquiring the conglomerate. At least for now.</p>



<p>The strategic alliance will also strengthen the two companies’ IPs. The two companies will sit down in the future to discuss the production of live-action adaptations of prominent IPs, co-produce anime, and expand the distribution of Kadokawa anime globally. In games, Sony is to become a publisher for some of Kadokawa’s games. FromSoftware’s next original IP could become a Sony second party game, for example.</p>



<p>Hiroki Totoki, Sony President and CFO, said:</p>



<p>“<em>Through this capital and business alliance, we will become the largest shareholder of KADOKAWA, which consistently creates a wide variety of IP, including publications and books, such as light novels and comics, as well as games and anime. By combining KADOKAWA’s extensive IP and IP creation ecosystem with the strengths of Sony, which has promoted the global expansion of a wide range of entertainment, including anime and games, we plan to work closely together to realize KADOKAWA’s ‘Global Media Mix’ strategy, aimed at maximizing the value of its IP, and Sony’s long-term vision, ‘Creative Entertainment Vision.</em>’”</p>



<p>The move also helps protect Kadokawa from acquisitions by other companies. The company attempting a hostile takeover will need Sony to agree to sell its shares, which makes the process more difficult (and expensive).</p>

            <p>Sony has increased its shares in FromSoftware owner Kadokawa as the two companies agree to form a "strategic capital and business alliance".</p>
<p>Sony already held shares in the company, but with the increase it now holds approximately 10 percent of the company's shares to become its largest shareholder, though this is not a full acquisition as previously suspected.</p>
<p>The two companies will adapt Kadokawa IP into live-action film and TV dramas globally, co-produce anime works, expand global distribution of Kadokawa's anime works, further expand publishing of Kadokawa's games, and develop human resources.</p>

<p>As a <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/News/Press/202412/24-1219E/">press release</a> from Sony reads: Kadokawa and Sony "intend to further strengthen [their] collaboration to maximise both companies' IP value globally and facilitate wider and deeper collaboration", joining forces for content, discovering new creators, and "media mixes of both companies' IP".</p>
<p>Sony has acquired 12,054,100 new shares in Kadokawa for approximately 50bn yen, around £251.7m. Chinese conglomerate <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a> holds 6.86 percent of shares compared to Sony's 10 percent.</p>
<p>Kadokawa is a major name in anime publishing, meaning Sony globally will now be a strong force in the industry.</p>
<p>Further expanding Kadokawa's games is the exciting bit for players, though, with the potential for more Bloodborne and Demon's Souls games with Sony, as well as big screen adaptations of FromSoftware's games.</p>
<p>Eurogamer has contacted FromSoftware for further comment.</p>
<p>"We are very pleased to conclude this capital and business alliance agreement with Sony," said Kadokawa CEO Takeshi Natsuno. "This alliance is expected to not only further strengthen our IP creation capabilities, but also increase our IP media mix options with Sony's support for global expansion, allowing us to deliver our IP to more users around the world. We are confident that this will greatly contribute to maximising the value of our IP and increasing our corporate value in the mid- to long-term. We intend to do our utmost to ensure that our collaborative efforts with Sony produce great results in the global market."</p><p>"Through this capital and business alliance, we will become the largest shareholder of Kadokawa, which consistently creates a wide variety of IP, including publications and books, such as light novels and comics, as well as games and anime," said Sony president, COO and CFO Hiroki Totoki. "By combining Kadokawa's extensive IP and IP creation ecosystem with the strengths of Sony, which has promoted the global expansion of a wide range of entertainment, including anime and games, we plan to work closely together to realize Kadokawa's 'Global Media Mix' strategy, aimed at maximizing the value of its IP, and Sony's long-term vision, 'Creative Entertainment Vision'."</p>
<p>News of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-in-talks-to-buy-elden-ring-dark-souls-developer-fromsoftware">Sony potentially acquiring Kadokawa</a> broke in November, from a report from Reuters. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fromsoftware-owner-kadokawa-acknowledges-takeover-interest-from-sony">Kadokawa followed up to officially acknowledge Sony's takeover interest</a>, which Sony also later confirmed.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/employees-at-fromsoftware-owner-kadokawa-reportedly-thrilled-about-possible-sony-takeover">Employees at FromSoftware were reportedly "thrilled"</a> at the possibility of a Sony takeover, due to disappointment with current management's response to a ransomware cyberattack earlier this year.</p>
<p>In addition to its 14 percent stake in FromSoftware specifically, Sony has ownership of the Bloodborne and Demon's Souls franchises. FromSoftware owns the rights to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> and Sekiro.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, FromSoftware publisher Bandai Namco revealed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-has-now-sold-286m-copies-outselling-the-dark-souls-series-combined-prior-to-release">Elden Ring has sold 28.6m copies</a>.</p>
<p>At last week's The Game Awards, FromSoftware announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fromsoftware-is-making-more-elden-ring-after-all-with-the-co-op-elden-ring-night-reign">Elden Ring spin-off Nightreign</a>, a co-op roguelite in a parallel world.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
