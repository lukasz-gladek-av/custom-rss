			<p>Sony recently filed a patent for a new type of PlayStation controller that could solve some of the biggest issues of current wireless controllers, such as losing power right at the worst possible time.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://tech4gamers.com/sony-patents-solar-power-controllers/?fbclid=IwY2xjawJIDShleHRuA2FlbQIxMQABHVwVHGQueVMZZupV-8DT_-KIESWvFQMimNqN7_WL90EACfvjRBhqzmNO1g_aem_pn2iGOc8pztrFDDWfs47hQ">Tech4gamer</a>, Sony recently filed a patent called <a href="https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2025046814&amp;_cid=P21-M80ZRL-19120-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Operation Device</a> which outlines a PlayStation controller sporting a plurality of photovoltaic elements located on its housing and a storage area that accumulates power that will essentially charge the controller with solar energy. The drawing accompanying the patent shows a DualSense controller and where the photovoltaic elements will be placed.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/PlayStation-controller-solar-power.png"></a></figure>

<p>While a solar-powered PlayStation controller sounds nothing more like an interesting idea without any sort of revolutionary application, Sony is aiming to address one of the biggest issues of current wireless controllers: preventing the controller from losing power at the wrong time. With solar power, a wireless controller's battery would never get drained, which would definitely make it enticing over a traditional controller with a limited battery life.</p>
<p>Even though it is hardly a revolutionary controller, Sony has already attempted to evolve the classic PlayStation DualShock controller with the DualSense controller, later bringing further innovation with the premium DualSense Edge controller. Sporting the same adaptive triggers and haptic feedback support of the base version alongside new features, such as swappable sticks, three levels of trigger pulls for the L2 and R2 triggers, and more, the DualSense Edge is the ultimate form of the PlayStation 5 controller. You can learn more about it by checking out Kai's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dualsense-edge-playstation-5-wireless-controller-a-cut-above-the-rest/">review.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-showcase-march-25th<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Capcom has announced when the first&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>Title Update showcase will air, giving you a glimpse of some of the new stuff coming to the phenomenally popular action RPG as part of its inaugural update.</p>

<p>As revealed in a Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2246340/view/534345486851637348" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a> earlier today, Capcom will unveil Title Update 1, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-1-april-announced" rel="nofollow">due to arrive sometime in April</a>, on March 25th. You can catch it at around 7am Pacific (that's about 10am Eastern and around 2pm GMT).</p>

<p>The showcase will see&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>producer Ryozo Tsujimoto revealing more about what's coming as part of Title Update 1, including returning monster Mizutsune, as well as "a host of other new additions", according to Capcom.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-showcase-roaring.jpg?itok=H_JmSTVt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-showcase-roaring.jpg?itok=WhBFyHxk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>' first Title Update showcase is airing next week.</figcaption></figure><p>If <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-rise-sunbreak-title-update-5-release-date-and-more-revealed" rel="nofollow">previous</a>&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>Title Update showcases are <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-world-iceborne-title-update-4-receives-early-july-release-window" rel="nofollow">anything to go by</a>, we'll probably get some more endgame activities for&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>as part of its first update, plus more cosmetics and perhaps a little more paid DLC to tempt you.</p>

<p>Just in case you're not familiar with it,&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>is the latest game in Capcom's&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>series of action RPGs. The game features a more direct narrative focus than its predecessors, but at its core, it's still built around slaying monsters and using their parts to upgrade your gear.</p>

<p>The game has proven phenomenally popular since launch, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-8m" rel="nofollow">racking up eight million sales</a> in its first three days and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-steam-player-record" rel="nofollow">breaking records</a> for both the series and Capcom as a whole on Steam.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that it was released on the very last day of February,&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>instantly topped the month's chart for best-selling games <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/circana-us-sales-data-february-2025-monster-hunter-wilds" rel="nofollow">according to analyst firm Circana</a>, so it's safe to say Capcom has a hit on its hands (talons?) with this one.</p>




<p><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>' first Title Update showcase airs on March 25th at 7am Pacific (10am Eastern, 2pm GMT). You can buy the game right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246340/Monster_Hunter_Wilds/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/monster-hunter-wilds/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/monster-hunter-wilds/9NMT6XFN0LVD" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and you can read <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/monster-hunter-wilds-review-new-frontier" rel="nofollow">our Tyler's review right here</a>.</p>

Thanks to the locals and an abundance of treasure hidden across each island in the game, you’ll soon find yourself stacking pirate gold like a wealth-hoarding dragon in no time.

These islands, represented by a treasure chest on the map, offer on-the-ground combat against various criminals and unknown pirates, usually a boss and mini-boss along the way, and then a treasure chest at the very end. If you make it that far, opening up said chest will often grant you a ring or other lore item, the former of which you can wear to boost your abilities, along with resources to sell and money.</p><figure id="" data-id="2271ae2d24db7f5d30dffe7ffff60087" data-recommend-id="image://2271ae2d24db7f5d30dffe7ffff60087" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The treasure chest description in Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The treasure chest description in Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2271ae2d24db7f5d30dffe7ffff60087" data-recommend-id="image://2271ae2d24db7f5d30dffe7ffff60087" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The treasure chest description in Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Lastly, if you need a few dollars, roam landmasses to encounter random groups of enemies, most of which drop a handful of cash upon defeat.

                <p dir="ltr">Disco Elysium is coming to mobile devices for the first time later this year, and we got exclusive hands (and thumbs) on with the new version of the RPG. This isn't a simple port whatsoever. In fact, GameSpot's Lucy James admits that "it is very different to what I thought it was going to be."</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DHcM71FPjPH/?igsh=MW1ib3hlNnE1Znd0bw%3D%3D" rel="nofollow ">On Instagram</a>, James shows off Disco Elysium running on Android and how the RPG is making the transition to smartphones. The game originally launched on PC in 2019 before coming to other consoles in the years that followed, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disco-elysium-releases-on-nintendo-switch-october-12/1100-6496489/">such as Nintendo Switch in 2021</a>. But with this new port, how you engage with Disco Elysium is different. "It's meant to be played in these shorter bursts, rather than sitting down and really committing to a very dense RPG," said James.</p><p dir="ltr">As for the controls, Disco Elysium is embracing how people use their smartphones. "The way you interact with it is how you interact with your phone," James said. Basically, you're swiping and tapping with your thumb while your smartphone stays in portrait mode.

<p>Epic Games continues to give people what they want. More OG Fortnite content is on the way thanks to OG Season 3, and there’s plenty of love for this early season, meaning the anticipation is already building.</p>



<p>OG Fortnite Season 3—AKA Meteor Strike—is next up for the battle-royale title in 2025. Fortnite has a plethora of game modes at this point with regular battle royale, LEGO Fortnite, a Rocket League crossover, and so much more. But Fortnite OG is another shrewd move from Epic: Giving us all a chance to enjoy the earlier years.</p>



<p>Fortnite OG Season 3 was first released in February 2018, and yet we’re celebrating it again in 2025—possibly with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-mortal-kombat-mythics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mortal Kombat Mythics</a> and maybe some <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-is-receiving-yakuza-skins-soon-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yakuza skins</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-fortnite-og-season-3-releases-in-march">Fortnite OG Season 3 Releases in March</h2>



<figure><figcaption>How did we get so Lucky? Credit to Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>A message on the <a href="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/1903099532868505615" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Fortnite X social media channel</a> has confirmed <strong>Fortnite OG Season 3 gets underway on March 25</strong>. One of its standout additions was a new POI—Lucky Landing (shown in the screenshot above).</p>



<p>Lucky Landing is characterized by its Asian-themed buildings and lush, eye-popping Cherry Blossom tree in the center. The majority of the season’s storyline focused on a meteor heading for the map. </p>



<div><article><p><span>Why crash out when you could crash in?

Back to where it all started…OG Season 3 launches March 25 🚀 </span></p></article></div>



<p>The map slowly started altering as the season progressed, and we were beginning to see the creativity of the Fortnite map and how your experience would dynamically change as the weeks went on. I also fondly remember the Battle Pass having the “Take the L” emote which I unashamedly dropped on fallen enemies after I two-tapped them with Pump Shotguns.</p>



<p>It was a simple time. Long may the OG Fortnite map trend continue.</p>

<p>Dave the Diver’s Like a Dragon DLC, Ichiban’s Holiday, will release on April 10, 2025.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-new-in-dave-the-diver-s-ichiban-s-holiday-dlc">What’s New in Dave the Diver’s Ichiban’s Holiday DLC?</h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/03/dave-the-diver-x-like-a-dragon-collaboration-dlc-ichibans-holiday-launches-april-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gematsu</a>, Dave the Diver’s Ichiban’s Holiday DLC will see the beloved character, Ichiban Kasuga, and his favourite bartender from Survive Bar arrive at Blue Hole for a vacation. However, things never go smoothly for Ichiban, and during his vacation time, he gets into a conflict with Sea Blue when he realises that they are capturing dolphins.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-classic-arcade-brawler-experience">Classic Arcade Brawler Experience</h3>



<p>To remedy the situation, Ichiban decides to infiltrate Sea Blue’s base. However, things will not be easy for him, and he needs a partner. Cobra joins on the journey, and as soon as you reach the base, the game turns into a classic arcade beat ’em up title, with players having to switch between both characters during the fights. Players should keep an eye out for a special reward at the end of this stage.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-karaoke-minigame-and-more">Karaoke Minigame and More</h3>



<p>Moreover, Ichiban’s Holiday DLC will add more content to Dave the Diver. In the spirit of Like a Dragon, players now have a new Karaoke minigame where they can sing along with their favourite characters. Also, some unique characters from the Like a Dragon series will be introduced as Bancho Sushi staff.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Players should know that Ichiban’s Holiday will be the first paid DLC for Dave the Diver. Also, the DLC will be only available for a limited time of six months on all platforms once it arrives, as this is “a special collaboration with a big game”, revealed game director Jaeho Hwang.</p>

It’s full of cool little touches, whether it’s throwing something at an enemy with the grappling rope or dropping from your glider onto your horse. Unfortunately, it’s also a game full of map clutter, bloated systems, and a truly absurd amount of junk loot, and the time I spent clearing out everything that didn’t spark joy and dealing with all these non-essential systems made me pine for a leaner, meaner, more focused game. Rise of the Ronin is excellent when it has the courage to be itself and lean into its challenging, rewarding fighting; too often, however, it feels stuck in indecision, torn between what it wants to be and what it feels it’s expected to be, and not even the best samurai can overcome that."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Jesse is a mild-mannered staff writer for IGN.

                <p>Baldur's Gate 3 actor Samantha Beart, who played Karlach, has spoken out against artificial intelligence technologies being used for short-term gain. Speaking to <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/edge/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Edge</a>, Beart said CEOs want to use AI to "save money," but long-term reputational damage may be coming for those who take this approach.</p><p>"In the long term, it'll destroy their reputation, their company, everything," Beart said, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/baldur-s-gate/baldurs-gate-3-karlach-actor-says-ceos-just-want-to-save-money-with-ai-itll-destroy-their-reputation-their-company-everything/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">as reported by GamesRadar</a>.</p><p>Beart went on to say that actors are unlikely to back down in the fight against AI because doing so would mean, "You've just signed your way out of any sort of job or career."</p><p>"We have an industry of highly artistic people who've had a calling to do this stuff, and then you've got these people with money, who don't play games, who see it as an easy way to make a return on investment," Beart said.</p><p>Video game voice actors in the SAG-AFTRA union are currently on strike against video game companies, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mass-effect-actor-on-why-ai-is-existential-issue-in-ongoing-strike-negotiations/1100-6528710/" data-ref-id="1100-6528710">issues around AI said to be the final sticking point in the talks</a>.</p><p>"The dream of the tech industry is to sell off your company at an overinflated price and retire," Beart said. "And I feel that's being done with game studios right now."</p><p>Video game voice actors have been on strike since July 2024, meaning the strike has now stretched beyond seven months. SAG-AFTRA video game performers also went on strike in 2016, with a work stoppage spanning 18 months.</p><p>A recent study found that the majority of game developers worldwide use AI technologies to make games, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/study-finds-majority-of-game-dev-companies-use-generative-ai-already-despite-worker-concerns/1100-6528919/" data-ref-id="1100-6528919">despite workers raising major concerns</a>. AI has been a controversial topic in video games and beyond, in part over fears about job losses with fears about generative AI being used to potentially take jobs. Electronic Arts CEO Andrew Wilson has said the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-ceo-on-how-ai-will-impact-video-games-and-the-people-who-make-them/1100-6513969/" data-ref-id="1100-6513969">rise in AI will lead to job losses in the short term</a> but will ultimately create more jobs total, just like what happened with previous labor revolutions.</p><p>In other news, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-uses-horizons-aloy-to-demonstrate-new-ai-tech-and-its-about-as-impressive-as-youd-expect/1100-6530023/" data-ref-id="1100-6530023">a recent video showed Horizon's Aloy in a tech demo for an AI assistant</a>--and people quickly voiced their concerns about this. Even Aloy's actor, Ashly Burch, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/horizon-actor-ashly-burch-worried-in-wake-of-ai-aloy-video/1100-6530163/" data-ref-id="1100-6530163">spoke out to criticize it</a>. </p>

The event also included first-time reveals for previously unannounced games, of which many looked really neat. My personal favorite was a cozily bleak isometric survival crafting game called <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2604490/I_Hate_This_Place/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2604490/I_Hate_This_Place/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>I Hate This Place</em></a></span>. <br></p><p>We are now practically inundated with quarterly showcases and festivals from all the major events and platform holders, and they can’t always be revealing brand new games. So a lot of the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsFTvIsRYbw&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsFTvIsRYbw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2.5 hour-long Future Games Spring Showcase</a></span> consisted of reminders of titles that was already announced, but so many continue to look cool, well worth a place on your radar. </p><p>That includes Brazilian roguelike ARPG <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1782460/Hell_Clock/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1782460/Hell_Clock/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Hell Clock</em></a></span>, grimdark sci-fi adventure <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2154070/INDUSTRIA_2/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2154070/INDUSTRIA_2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Industria 2</em></a></span>, atmospheric puzzle platformer <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1928690/Bionic_Bay/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1928690/Bionic_Bay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Bionic Bay</em></a></span>, and cyberpunk shooter <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/990380/METAL_EDEN/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/990380/METAL_EDEN/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Metal Eden</em></a></span>.

A bunch of games also have recent demos out, including the evocative retro pixel-art JRPG <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1864000/Artis_Impact/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1864000/Artis_Impact/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Artis Impact</em></a></span>. </p><p>In the meantime, here are nine games we didn’t know about until they were revealed during yesterday’s showcase. </p></div></div><div><p><em>Outriders</em> developer People Can Fly is taking a stab at a mix of the hottest live-service genres around. <em>Lost Rift </em>is a base-building survival shooter that combines PvE coop with PvPvE extraction gameplay. The crudest way I can describe it is mashing together <em>Far Cry</em>, <em>Fortnite</em>, and <em>Rust</em>. </p></div><div><p>Based on the Kyle Starks’ comic by the same name,<em> I Hate This Place </em>is about surviving in the woods by collecting resources in the day, and navigating occult horrors at night. What helps set it apart form similar survival crafting loops is the inky art-style and ‘80s analogue horror vibes. </p></div><div><p>Don’t be fooled, <em>Elsewhere Electric</em> is not a van life adventure game. It is instead a co-op first-person exploration game where you solve puzzles in a strange facility. It supports virtual reality headsets and will show each player different things, forcing them to communicate to overcome obstacles. </p></div><div><p>This one is a bonkers mashup. <em>Shelf Heroes</em> is an FPS with roguelike elements, and card-based perk powerups, and multiplayer co-op. You have to assemble your perfect action figure to take back your home from rogue toys. <em>Risk of Rain</em> <em>2</em> meets <em>Toy Story</em>?<br></p></div><div><p>What if you could ponder the Roman Empire from the cozy comfort of a <em>Stardew Valley</em>-like? <em>Romestead</em> looks the part, but will offer less chill with up to eight players battling for dominance across limited resource maps. So maybe less slice-of-life farming sim than <em>Age of Empires </em>clash of civilizations?<br></p></div><div><p>A robot with a gun awakens on an abandoned oil tanker and searches for meaning. <em>The Last Caretaker</em> calls on players to “craft, explore, and battle rogue machines” as they try to bring humanity back from apparent extinction. There’s a choose-your-own-adventure tag on Steam though, so maybe you can decide to leave humans behind in the end. </p></div><div><p>Kickstarted over four years ago, the table-top dark fantasy tactical RPG <em>Frosthaven</em> is getting a video game adaptation. It’ll feature single-player, co-op, and online multiplayer, with a closed beta happening soon, ahead of its Early Access release. </p></div><div><p><em>Raev</em> is a kingdom builder that blends RPG elements with 4X strategy. You guide a civilization of furries on their way to environmental harmony, architectural beauty, and societal greatness. It’s coming to PC in 2026. </p></div><div><p>Old-school first-person shooter <em>Painkiller</em> is being revived by Saber Interactive. The <em>Doom</em>-inspired fast-paced gothic gorefest will offer co-op as players battle the fallen angel Azazel and his army of demons using steampunk-looking weapons. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Microsoft has recently revealed a new UI mockup for Xbox that shows what games players own across a variety of devices and storefronts, including Steam.</p><p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/633478/microsoft-xbox-steam-games-support-ui" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Verge</a>, Microsoft posted a new blog post that had a picture of the proposed UI, but it was subsequently removed. In the picture, you can see games like Diablo IV and Microsoft Flight Simulator in the "recently added" in the UI. However, you can also see the "Steam" and "Game Pass" tabs, indicating that you'll be able to see sort games based on which platform you purchased them on.</p><p>It seems like the UI is just a mockup for now, as the "owned" and "action-adventure" tabs are listed twice.

			<p>Ukrainian developer Frogwares is currently <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-sinking-city-2-shows-off-gameplay-and-launches-kickstarter-campaign/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seeking funds</a> for The Sinking City 2 on Kickstarter. After two weeks, and with another two left before the end, the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/frogwares/the-sinking-city-2/description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">campaign</a> has so far gathered over €383K, nearly four times the minimum amount of €100K. Of course, the studio hopes that the momentum continues; according to <a href="https://kicktraq.com/projects/frogwares/the-sinking-city-2/#chart-exp-projection" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kicktraq projections</a>, it could land anywhere between €424K and €483K.</p>
<p>It has not been smooth sailing for Frogwares in the past few years. In 2019-20, their games were delisted from digital stores twice in the span of a year due to problems with French publishers <a href="https://wccftech.com/frogwares-claims-to-be-endangered-by-focus-home-interactive-policy-games-being-delisted/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Focus Home Interactive</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-sinking-city-delisted-from-storefronts-frogwares-cites-breach-of-contract-with-nacon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nacon</a>. Then there was the pandemic, of course, which affected everyone. Just as things were looking better, the Russian invasion of Ukraine suddenly happened in early 2022.</p>
<p>We <a href="https://wccftech.com/frogwares-ceo-talks-about-the-wars-tragic-impact-on-the-ukrainian-game-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">talked with them</a> just a few days after the war started, learning of all their fear and day-to-day troubles. Thankfully, Epic <a href="https://wccftech.com/frogwares-receives-epic-games-megagrant-to-help-support-ukranian-developers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">awarded the studio a MegaGrant</a>, offering them a reprieve of sorts. Even so, they had to re-evaluate their roadmap and decided to develop <a href="https://wccftech.com/frogwares-announces-project-palianytsia-game-project-for-sinking-city-and-sherlock-holmes-fans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Project Palianytsia</a>, which turned out to be Sherlock Holmes The Awakened, a reboot of the first entry in the franchise that was funded via Kickstarter. The ongoing war <a href="https://wccftech.com/sherlock-holmes-the-awakened-delayed-due-to-continued-russian-strikes-in-kyiv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">caused</a> a short delay, but the studio still managed to release a solid game, as outlined in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/sherlock-holmes-the-awakened-the-only-way-forward-is-the-abyss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our review</a>.</p>
<p>Now, the studio has returned to what it really wanted to make: The Sinking City 2. This one <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-sinking-city-2-announcement-ue5-horror-frogwares-deliver-ukraine-war/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will be a full-fledged horror game</a>, whereas the first entry was more of an open world investigation game with horror undertones. Right in the middle of the Kickstarter campaign, we reached out once more to Sergiy Oganesyan, Publishing Director at Frogwares, to discuss how the project evolved over the past couple of years (including the switch to Unreal Engine 5), what fans can expect from it, and how the war is still affecting the development team.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'Our vision for The Sinking City 2 is a Lovecraftian survival horror game with deep investigation mechanics, and that hasn’t changed much. But there’s still a huge difference between the first vertical slice we created back in 2023 and the recent playable footage that we published for Kickstarter, and that, thanks to the feedback from playtests, has definitely shown us where we need to adjust our priorities.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Exactly a year ago, you <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-sinking-city-2-goes-to-kickstarter-soon-as-frogwares-needs-a-safety-net-from-the-war/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told</a> fans the Kickstarter campaign would open up soon, but then you went dark for a while. Can you disclose what happened?</strong></p>
<p>A few things really. Over the past year, we made the decision to focus on giving ourselves some time to develop the game so we could showcase real gameplay for Kickstarter, rather than just concept art. Along the way, we also refined some of our designs to better fit actual gameplay, ensuring a stronger experience.</p>
<p>When we announced it in 2024, we had some closed playtests very soon after that with a group of our closest fans. Through their feedback, we started refining even more on where we should place our focus and efforts, which dictated a lot about how we’d present the game in our campaign. Much of what we showed in the gameplay and dev diary we just released is due to our work with our fans. Additionally, we took the time to carefully map out and design physical rewards for the campaign, making sure they are meaningful and high-quality for our backers. It’s the first time we've done something like that, and there was a lot of fog of war to deal with.</p>
<p>Lastly, we are all still mostly working remotely as a team due to the war. So, we work more around our team and their needs. We didn’t want anyone to feel rushed on the campaign. Progress on the game was the priority, and then getting what we needed for the launch of the Kickstarter came when everyone felt ready to help. So these factors all stacked up, but we’re glad we could take our time.</p>
<p><strong>How has your vision for The Sinking City 2 evolved since the game's announcement?</strong></p>
<p>Our vision for The Sinking City 2 is a Lovecraftian survival horror game with deep investigation mechanics, and that hasn’t changed much. But there’s still a huge difference between the first vertical slice we created back in 2023 and the recent playable footage that we published for Kickstarter, and that, thanks to the feedback from playtests, has definitely shown us where we need to adjust our priorities.</p>
<p>If you take combat, for example, we spent a lot of time improving the overall feeling of it. How enemies behave, how they react to being shot, how impactful the shotgun is, that kind of thing. There’s still a lot of work ahead, but we are happy to see that most people are satisfied with where this particular mechanic is going.</p>
<p><strong>How recent is the Pre-Alpha gameplay footage that you just shared? How much more polished do you expect the full game to be?</strong></p>
<p>Well, this is sort of the downside of a Kickstarter campaign—you often have to launch it at a time when you can’t really show anything totally final. Much of what we showed was recorded in&nbsp;late 2024, but in order to really understand how much things can change, we need to take into consideration how game development works.</p>
<p>For example, we create our levels in a vacuum of what we call Vitaras (visual targets) - separate maps inside the engine where you don’t have any real gameplay. So while the work on those continues, inside the real game you have placeholder assets, which, as you can imagine, are very far in terms of the quality of what we want to achieve. But when those Vitaras are fully migrated to the real game, you suddenly have beautiful meshes, materials, lighting and so on and the difference is like night and day. The same goes for your enemies and everything else, really. What I’m trying to say is that there wasn’t anything in the trailer that was truly final, locked, and won’t ever be touched again. Once we fully integrate our locations, combat, and other gameplay together, you’ll see the difference for the better.</p>
<p><strong>One of the big areas of focus for this sequel is combat. Can you talk about some of the improvements fans will see compared to the first game?</strong></p>
<p>Where do I even begin? I have already mentioned that we are putting a lot of emphasis on how combat feels because it must feel fun and convincing. You must enjoy landing a shot, and this is achieved through a number of things, primarily VFX, sound design, recoil, enemy hit reaction, etc. We mentioned a wound body system for our enemies in our recent dev diary - it’s essentially a second layer of muscle, ligaments, and blood mass underneath the skin, which reacts when hit. It’s all a bit gory, but in my opinion, very satisfying to see working under the hood.</p>
<p>So, a lot of work is being done on enemy visuals, animations, attacks, and, of course, enemy placement around each map to make this all come together. I’m not going to lie; combat is probably the most challenging aspect for us, especially since this is now a core focus of the game compared to the original. One enemy can take months of work, and that’s just the visual design, without any gameplay. But so far, the results we and our closed playtesters have seen prove we’re on the right track. We’ve still got a lot more work to do, and we’ll likely be refining this right to the end, but we’re really happy with the progress so far.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'You must enjoy landing a shot, and this is achieved through a number of things, primarily VFX, sound design, recoil, enemy hit reaction, etc. We mentioned a wound body system for our enemies in our recent dev diary - it’s essentially a second layer of muscle, ligaments, and blood mass underneath the skin, which reacts when hit. It’s all a bit gory, but in my opinion, very satisfying to see working under the hood.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Will players be able to dodge out of the way and perform some melee actions in combat?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, we are experimenting with some dodge and “last-resort” melee mechanics.</p>
<p><strong>In terms of narrative and atmosphere, how is The Sinking City 2 going to set itself apart from its predecessor? Are there going to be any easter eggs or even returning characters for fans of the original?</strong></p>
<p>So, the two games are set in the same universe and time setting. 1920s United States drenched in a gloomy, Lovecraftian horror vibe. And just like before, a supernatural flood has taken hold of a city and is changing it in unfathomable ways. But that’s mainly where the similarities end. The Sinking City 2 features a new, stand-alone story entirely separate from the one told in the original game. So we’re not going back to playing as Charles Reed, nor are we going back to the city of Oakmont in any way, and we made all these narrative and atmosphere choices for a reason. We wanted to create a story and setting that wasn’t burdened by what we created in the original game, especially since players have various endings they favor or consider the “true ending” to that story.</p>
<p>This way, we can let existing fans come back into this familiar world fresh, while anyone who never played the original can also step in without feeling like they are missing a big chunk of the story. So while we might have some small Easter eggs or hints here and there, they will be there mainly as a wink and nudge for us and our most devoted fans.</p>
<p><strong>You've said that while this isn't an open-world game, it will feature plenty of secrets and large explorable zones. Considering side content, how long should we expect the game to be?</strong></p>
<p>That’s not something we can answer right now, as there are still parts of the game we haven’t finalized yet. However, it’s a survival horror game, so it would be fair to look at some recent releases in the genre to get a ballpark idea.</p>
<p><strong>The Kickstarter campaign appears to have gone very well so far.</strong></p>
<p>Yup. Just yesterday we unlocked another stretch goal - a new giant monster type, the Shoggoth. Now, just to be clear, we already did promise a Shoggoth encounter in the game, but these are two very different enemies, both visually and mechanically. We’ll probably hit one more stretch goal after this one is funded.</p>
<p><strong>Will the game launch in early access or straight to full release?</strong></p>
<p>The game will launch in full on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox X/S at the same time. At one point, we considered the Early Access route but decided we were better off using Kickstarter and closed playtests to help develop the game.</p>
<p><strong>Was it hard to transition to Unreal Engine 5? Are you leveraging all their technologies (Lumen, Nanite, etc.) to elevate the visuals?</strong></p>
<p>There was a learning curve for sure, but it was quite smooth. It was really helpful that we knew from the start that The Sinking City 2 was going to be made in Unreal 5. Speak to any team who made the transition, and almost all of them will tell you to make the switch at the start if you can. It will save you so much time and effort in the long run. So, we finished our last game on UE4 and started pre-production for TSC2 from scratch. All our internal tools were developed as separate plugins, so although the migration took some time, it was fairly straightforward. This also provided a great opportunity to get rid of a bunch of legacy code and finally perform a long-overdue refactor.</p>
<p>The tools UE5 brings have been amazing, for sure. Lumen has significantly improved our lighting and reflection systems, creating a more immersive and visually stunning environment. For us, especially where The Sinking City 2 has many wet surfaces, Lumen allows us to achieve much more realistic and dynamic lighting effects that were previously really difficult to attain.</p>
<p>With Metahuman, we were astonished at how fast, simple, and realistic the results were. After our initial tests, we reviewed our entire cutscene and dialogue creation process and reworked everything to better utilize these tools.</p>
<p>Nanite significantly changed our approach to asset creation, allowing us to use highly detailed models without compromising performance. This has been particularly beneficial for creating the much more detailed environments that were required for this game. Since we are going for that feeling of isolation and a more contained play space, we need the environment itself to do a lot of the immersion heavy lifting.</p>
<p>That said, while new technologies are fantastic and help solve old problems, they can also bring new issues to tackle. Nanite was no exception. For instance, in our previous projects, a single Static Mesh asset did not take up more than 200MB of disk space, but now it is pretty common. So, managing the increased asset sizes and optimizing our workflows to accommodate this change has been a significant task.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'The tools UE5 brings have been amazing, for sure.

For us, especially where The Sinking City 2 has many wet surfaces, Lumen allows us to achieve much more realistic and dynamic lighting effects that were previously really difficult to attain. [...] Lumen already supports software ray-tracing out of the box. Our team is also looking at the hardware one, but it’ll depend on the optimization.'</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Will you support ray traced effects like global illumination, reflections, etc.?</strong></p>
<p>Lumen already supports software ray-tracing out of the box. Our team is also looking at the hardware one, but it’ll depend on the optimization.</p>
<p><strong>Do you plan to prepare enhancements for the PS5 Pro console?</strong></p>
<p>It’s likely, but I can’t say which enhancements yet.</p>
<p><strong>Would you like to share anything about Ukraine's situation and how it's still impacting your daily work?</strong></p>
<p>Missile strikes and drone attacks almost every goddamn night. Just yesterday, around 20 drones attacked the city of Kropyvnytskyi. In Kyiv, you can’t fall asleep without listening to air defense fighting off another swarm of Russian drones. In a way, we have become used to it, but not exactly in a healthy way. You have to just accept it and try to keep living, not knowing if your luck will run out soon.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time, and stay strong.</strong></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-movie-report<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new report has emerged which claims that a&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>movie is in the works, and that several major Hollywood studios are already engaged in a bidding war over the rights to said movie.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/split-fiction-movie-video-game-adaptation-1236344367/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Variety</a>, media company Story Kitchen is currently scouting writers and directors, as well as cast members, for the project. You might also recognize Story Kitchen's name from the likes of the&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/live-action-dredge-movie" rel="nofollow"><em>Dredge&nbsp;</em>movie</a>, which was announced last year, as well as the upcoming&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/it-takes-two-movie-and-tv-adaptations-in-works" rel="nofollow"><em>It Takes Two&nbsp;</em>movie adaptation</a>.</p>

<p>Citing "sources at the Game Developers Conference (GDC) in San Francisco", Variety says that a number of "top Hollywood studios" are currently making offers for the rights to the&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>movie, although it sounds like nothing has been decided yet.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/split-fiction-movie-report-barriers.jpg?itok=9mK7HXCQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/split-fiction-movie-report-barriers.jpg?itok=72JyqCAo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>movie adaptation is apparently in the works.</figcaption></figure><p>Given&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction</em>'s close focus on gameplay, I'm having a bit of a hard time imagining how a movie would work; I can only imagine some of the game's uniqueness will be lost in the transition. Still, it's testament to&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction</em>'s popularity that a movie adaptation is already underway.</p>

<p>Of course, the movie makes a lot of sense from a financial perspective, too. After all,&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>managed to reach <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-sales-2m" rel="nofollow">two million sales in a single week</a>, so creating more media based around the IP is sound logic.</p>

<p>It's the same logic that drove Story Kitchen to create the&nbsp;<em>It Takes Two&nbsp;</em>adaptation, and that game recently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hazelight-josef-fares-new-ip-it-takes-two-sales" rel="nofollow">passed the 20 million sales mark</a>. It just remains to be seen whether&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction</em>'s gaming audience would also be interested in a non-interactive version of the story.</p>




<p>In case you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction</em>, it's the latest co-op adventure from&nbsp;<em>It Takes Two&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>A Way Out&nbsp;</em>developer Hazelight, led by Josef Fares.</p>

<p>The game casts you and your co-op buddy as Mio and Zoe, two writers who must learn to work together when they're thrust into a diabolical machine that threatens to steal all of their ideas.</p>

Some provide incremental buffs while others cover specific hero weaknesses or even adjust how you want to play them.

<p>A new PlayStation patent describes a controller that can be charged with solar energy, which might solve all your battery-related problems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://tech4gamers.com/sony-patents-solar-power-controllers/?fbclid=IwY2xjawJIDShleHRuA2FlbQIxMQABHVwVHGQueVMZZupV-8DT_-KIESWvFQMimNqN7_WL90EACfvjRBhqzmNO1g_aem_pn2iGOc8pztrFDDWfs47hQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Tech4Gamers</a>, Sony Interactive Entertainment has published a new patent called ‘<a href="https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2025046814&amp;_cid=P21-M80ZRL-19120-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Operation Device</a>’. The patent is for a PlayStation controller that features “a plurality of photovoltaic elements” on its housing and a storage area that “accumulates power generated by the plurality of photovoltaic elements”, which in turn will charge the device with solar energy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The diagrams provided on the website suggest that the photovoltaic elements will be placed on the top half of the body, around the analogue sticks and the different buttons. This controller can then be placed under sunlight to charge itself.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Sony Interactive Entertainment has also mentioned the problem they are trying to solve with the solar-powered PlayStation controller. Sony has stated that a conventional controller needs a replaceable or rechargeable battery to run, and without this power source, it cannot operate. With their new patent, they wish to solve this problem with technology that charges a controller’s secondary or primary battery through an external power source.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is not the first patent PlayStation has published. Last year, we saw a controller concept <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-new-patent-reveals-a-controller-concept-with-conductive-ink/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that uses conductive ink</a>. Also, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-adaptive-controller/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox’s one-handed ‘adaptive joystick</a>’ controller is now available.

<p>In recent months, the AI industry's biggest boosters have started converging on a public expectation that we're <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/ai-versus-the-brain-and-the-race-for-general-intelligence/">on the verge of “artificial general intelligence”</a> (AGI)—virtual agents that can match or surpass "human-level" understanding and performance on most cognitive tasks.</p>
<p>OpenAI is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/what-does-phd-level-ai-mean-openais-rumored-20000-agent-plan-explained/">quietly seeding expectations for a "PhD-level" AI agent</a> that could operate autonomously at the level of a "high-income knowledge worker" in the near future. Elon Musk <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/04/elon-musk-ai-will-be-smarter-than-any-human-around-the-end-of-next-year/">says</a>&nbsp;that "we'll have AI smarter than any one human probably" by the end of 2025. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei thinks it might take a bit longer but similarly <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/anthropic-chief-says-ai-could-surpass-almost-all-humans-at-almost-everything-shortly-after-2027/">says</a> it's plausible that AI will be "better than humans at almost everything" by the end of 2027.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">A few researchers at Anthropic have, over the past year, had a part-time obsession with a peculiar problem.</p>
<p>Can Claude play Pokémon?</p>
<p>A thread: <a href="https://t.co/K8SkNXCxYJ">pic.twitter.com/K8SkNXCxYJ</a></p>
<p>— Anthropic (@AnthropicAI) <a href="https://twitter.com/AnthropicAI/status/1894419011569344978?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 25, 2025</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Last month, Anthropic presented its “Claude Plays Pokémon” experiment as a waypoint on the road to that predicted AGI future. It's a project the company <a href="https://x.com/AnthropicAI/status/1894419011569344978">said</a> shows "glimmers of AI systems that tackle challenges with increasing competence, not just through training but with generalized reasoning." Anthropic made headlines by <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/research/visible-extended-thinking">trumpeting</a> how Claude 3.7 Sonnet’s "improved reasoning capabilities" let the company's latest model make progress in the popular old-school Game Boy RPG in ways "that older models had little hope of achieving."</p>
<p>While Claude models from just a year ago struggled even to leave the game’s opening area, Claude 3.7 Sonnet was able to make progress by collecting multiple in-game Gym Badges in a relatively small number of in-game actions. That breakthrough, Anthropic wrote, was because the “extended thinking” by Claude 3.7 Sonnet means the new model "plans ahead, remembers its objectives, and adapts when initial strategies fail" in a way that its predecessors didn’t. Those things, Anthropic brags, are "critical skills for battling pixelated gym leaders. And, we posit, in solving real-world problems too."</p>

<p>But relative success over previous models is not the same as absolute success over the game in its entirety. In the weeks since Claude Plays Pokémon was first made public, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/claudeplayspokemon/">thousands of Twitch viewers</a> have watched Claude struggle to make consistent progress in the game. Despite long "thinking" pauses between each move—during which viewers can read printouts of the system’s simulated reasoning process—Claude frequently finds itself pointlessly revisiting completed towns, getting stuck in blind corners of the map for extended periods, or fruitlessly talking to the same unhelpful NPC over and over, to cite just a few examples of distinctly sub-human in-game performance.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>Watching Claude continue to struggle at a game designed for children, it’s hard to imagine we’re witnessing the genesis of some sort of computer superintelligence. But even Claude’s current sub-human level of Pokémon performance could hold significant lessons for the quest toward generalized, human-level artificial intelligence.</p>

<h2>Smart in different ways</h2>
<p>In some sense, it’s impressive that Claude can play Pokémon with any facility at all. When developing AI systems that find dominant strategies in games like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/05/googles-alphago-ai-beats-worlds-best-human-go-player/">Go</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/08/ai-bot-takes-on-the-pros-at-dota-2-and-wins/"><em>Dota 2</em></a>, engineers generally start their algorithms off with deep knowledge of a game’s rules and/or basic strategies, as well as a reward function to guide them toward better performance. For Claude Plays Pokémon, though, project developer and Anthropic employee David Hershey says he started with an unmodified, generalized Claude model that wasn’t specifically trained or tuned to play Pokémon games in any way.</p>
<p>“This is purely the various other things that [Claude] understands about the world being used to point at video games,” Hershey told Ars. “So it has a sense of a Pokémon. If you go to claude.ai and ask about Pokémon, it knows what Pokémon is based on what it's read… If you ask, it'll tell you there's eight gym badges, it'll tell you the first one is Brock… it knows the broad structure.”</p>

<p>In addition to directly monitoring certain key (emulated) Game Boy RAM addresses for game state information, Claude views and interprets the game's visual output much like a human would. But despite <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/farewell-photoshop-googles-new-ai-lets-you-edit-images-by-asking/">recent advances in AI image processing</a>, Hershey said Claude still struggles to interpret the low-resolution, pixelated world of a Game Boy screenshot as well as a human can. “Claude's still not particularly good at understanding what's on the screen at all,” he said. “You will see it attempt to walk into walls all the time.”</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>Hershey said he suspects Claude’s training data probably doesn’t contain many overly detailed text descriptions of “stuff that looks like a Game Boy screen.” This means that, somewhat surprisingly, if Claude were playing a game with “more realistic imagery, I think Claude would actually be able to see a lot better,” Hershey said.</p>
<p>“It's one of those funny things about humans that we can squint at these eight-by-eight pixel blobs of people and say, ‘That's a girl with blue hair,’” Hershey continued. “People, I think, have that ability to map from our real world to understand and sort of grok that... so I'm honestly kind of surprised that Claude's as good as it is at being able to see there's a person on the screen.”</p>
<p>Even with a perfect understanding of what it’s seeing on-screen, though, Hershey said Claude would still struggle with 2D navigation challenges that would be trivial for a human. “It’s pretty easy for me to understand that [an in-game] building is a building and that I can’t walk through a building,” Hershey said. “And that's [something] that's pretty challenging for Claude to understand… It's funny because it's just kind of smart in different ways, you know?”</p>

<p>Where Claude tends to perform better, Hershey said, is in the more text-based portions of the game. During an in-game battle, Claude will readily notice when the game tells it that an attack from an electric-type Pokémon is “not very effective” against a rock-type opponent, for instance.&nbsp;Claude will then squirrel that factoid away in a massive written knowledge base for future reference later in the run. Claude can also integrate multiple pieces of similar knowledge into pretty elegant battle strategies, even extending those strategies into long-term plans for catching and managing teams of multiple creatures for future battles.</p>

    <div>
          
          

<p>Claude can even show surprising “intelligence” when Pokémon’s in-game text is intentionally misleading or incomplete. “It's pretty funny that they tell you you need to go find Professor Oak next door and then he's not there,” Hershey said of an early-game task. “As a 5-year-old, that was very confusing to me. But Claude actually typically goes through that same set of motions where it talks to mom, goes to the lab, doesn't find [Oak], says, ‘I need to figure something out’… It's sophisticated enough to sort of go through the motions of the way [humans are] actually supposed to learn it, too.”</p>

<p>These kinds of relative strengths and weaknesses when compared to “human-level” play reflect the overall state of AI research and capabilities in general, Hershey said. “I think it's just a sort of universal thing about these models... We built the text side of it first, and the text side is definitely... more powerful. How these models can reason about images is getting better, but I think it's a decent bit behind.”</p>
<h2>Forget me not</h2>
<p>Beyond issues parsing text and images, Hershey also acknowledged that Claude can have trouble “remembering” what it has already learned. The current model has a “context window” of 200,000 tokens, limiting the amount of relational information it can store in its “memory” at any one time. When the system’s ever-expanding knowledge base fills up this context window, Claude goes through an elaborate summarization process, condensing detailed notes on what it has seen, done, and learned so far into shorter text summaries that lose some of the fine-grained details.</p>
<p>This can mean that Claude “has a hard time keeping track of things for a very long time and really having a great sense of what it's tried so far,” Hershey said. “You will definitely see it occasionally delete something that it shouldn't have. Anything that's not in your knowledge base or not in your summary is going to be gone, so you have to think about what you want to put there.”</p>

<p>More than forgetting important history, though, Claude runs into bigger problems when it inadvertently inserts incorrect information into its knowledge base. Like a conspiracy theorist who builds an entire worldview from an inherently flawed premise, Claude can be incredibly slow to recognize when an error in its self-authored knowledge base is leading its Pokémon play astray.</p>
<p>“The things that are written down in the past, it sort of trusts pretty blindly,” Hershey said. “I have seen it become very convinced that it found the exit to [in-game location] Viridian Forest at some specific coordinates, and then it spends hours and hours exploring a little small square around those coordinates that are wrong instead of doing anything else. It takes a very long time for it to decide that that was a ‘fail.’”</p>
<p>Still, Hershey said Claude 3.7 Sonnet is much better than earlier models at eventually “questioning its assumptions, trying new strategies, and keeping track over long horizons of various strategies to [see] whether they work or not.” While the new model will still “struggle for really long periods of time” retrying the same thing over and over, it will ultimately tend to “get a sense of what's going on and what it’s tried before, and it stumbles a lot of times into actual progress from that,” Hershey said.</p>

<h2>“We’re getting pretty close…”</h2>
<p>One of the most interesting things about observing Claude Plays Pokémon across multiple iterations and restarts, Hershey said, is seeing how the system’s progress and strategy can vary quite a bit between runs. Sometimes Claude will show it's “capable of actually building a pretty coherent strategy” by “keeping detailed notes about the different paths to try,” for instance, he said. But “most of the time it doesn't… most of the time, it wanders into the wall because it's confident it sees the exit.”</p>

<p>One of the biggest things preventing the current version of Claude from getting better, Hershey said, is that “when it derives that good strategy, I don't think it necessarily has the self-awareness to know that one strategy [it] came up with is better than another.” And that’s not a trivial problem to solve.</p>
<p>Still, Hershey said he sees “low-hanging fruit” for improving Claude’s Pokémon play by improving the model’s understanding of Game Boy screenshots. “I think there's a chance it could beat the game if it had a perfect sense of what's on the screen,” Hershey said, saying that such a model would probably perform “a little bit short of human.”</p>
<p>Expanding the context window for future Claude models will also probably allow those models to “reason over longer time frames and handle things more coherently over a long period of time,” Hershey said. Future models will improve by getting “a little bit better at remembering, keeping track of a coherent set of what it needs to try to make progress,” he added.</p>

<p>Whatever you think about impending improvements in AI models, though, Claude’s current performance at Pokémon doesn’t make it seem like it’s poised to usher in an explosion of human-level, completely generalizable artificial intelligence. And Hershey allows that watching Claude 3.7 Sonnet get stuck on Mt. Moon for 80 hours or so can make it “seem like a model that doesn't know what it's doing.”</p>
<p>But Hershey is still impressed at the way that Claude's new reasoning model will occasionally show some glimmer of awareness and “kind of tell that it doesn't know what it's doing and know that it needs to be doing something different. And the difference between ‘can't do it at all’ and ‘can kind of do it’ is a pretty big one for these AI things for me,” he continued. “You know, when something can kind of do something it typically means we're pretty close to getting it to be able to do something really, really well.”</p>
