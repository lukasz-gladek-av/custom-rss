            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/what-avowed-gets-right-and-wrong-about-loot<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If there's one thing that everyone can agree on when it comes to game mechanics, it's that if loot is present, then it has to be enticing enough for players to actually want to loot it. Of course, what this means in practice depends on a game-to-game basis, and the results aren't always clear cut. <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/avowed-review-pillars-of-excellence" rel="nofollow">Obsidian's approach to loot in their latest RPG, <em>Avowed</em></a>, has demonstrated that even developers as experienced as they are can make mistakes.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the underlying basics are more or less the same across every RPG. The traditional approach to loot and gear progression is linear upgrades. In other words, one tier of gear will always be better than another tier. Eventually, you are funneled into a handful of equipment options which are objectively the best in the game.</p>

<p>Historically, most RPGs have linear gear progression because it's the simplest way to design gear and convey power levels to players. <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/elder-scrolls-v-skyrim" rel="nofollow">Skyrim</a> </em>demonstrates this methodology very well as it's immediately obvious that the Iron armor and weapons from the start of the game are nowhere near as powerful as Ebony or Daedric tier equipment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The downside of linear loot systems is that they are predictable. You're generally going to need an auxiliary mechanism to present the illusion of choice and variety. <em>Skyrim </em>does this via enchanting, alchemy, smithing and crafting, and semi-random loot drops. <em>Skyrim </em>is also a relatively large game, so while one can assume Obsidian might've had plans for similar mechanics in <em>Avowed</em>, it's not out of the question that this would've led to feature creep and ultimately omitted.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/avowed-garrus-companion-kai.jpg?itok=9G6sc6WJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/avowed-garrus-companion-kai.jpg?itok=ZGJa1dkm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It's somewhat appropriate that the companion that shares the same voice actor as Garrus from <em>Mass Effect</em> should have the two most aesthetically unique weapons in <em>Avowed.</em></figcaption></figure><p>The more modern approach can best be described as horizontal upgrades. This method generally has the same tier system as linear upgrades, but instead of culminating in a couple of sets of super powerful armor, it usually expands into a more diverse array of armor sets that augment certain play styles via unique effects.</p>

<p>Some games take this one step further by letting you change the appearance of your armor, adding yet another potential avenue for player retention. <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/monster-hunter-wilds-review-new-frontier" rel="nofollow"><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> is an example of how modern games should approach gear progression</a>, featuring both a transmog system and multiple armor sets that have their own bonuses, giving you the chance to dress for fashion and function alike without compromise.</p>

<p>Horizontal gear mechanics are not without their own downsides. As far as players are concerned, this typically means more complexity, which is a non-issue if the game is built around having endgame content. For a linear story-driven experience like <em>Avowed</em>, this might be beyond what the developers intend for the game, especially if the target audience is leaning towards the casual end of the spectrum.</p>

<h2><em>Avowed's</em> Unique Approach to Leveling and Player Progression</h2>

<p>To their credit, Obsidian clearly recognized what people tend to like about loot and gear progression. All the individual parts are there in <em>Avowed</em>, at least on paper. There's a transmog mechanic to change the appearance of your armor, you can find a decent number of unique items with unique effects, and there's decent weapon variety.</p>

<p>The issue is that it felt like Obsidian was trying to reinvent the wheel while awkwardly avoiding referencing what everyone likes about the wheel.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/avowed-mage-skills.jpg?itok=fE5tRzNm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/avowed-mage-skills.jpg?itok=GFBeJXiF 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Grimoires automatically upgrading your spells on casting is super cool and lets you play as a mage with minimal skill point investment.</figcaption></figure><p>Take <em>Avowed's</em> transmog system for instance. In theory, it should be a simple process of selecting a piece of armor and then pressing a button to change its appearance to another set of armor that you've discovered. Yet for some reason, you have to keep both sets of armor in your inventory for this to work.</p>

<p>Similarly, <em>Avowed </em>has a decidedly linear method gear progression. There's nothing inherently wrong with this, except for the fact that there's only four quality tiers for normal weapons which means that there's very little visual variety. Yes, your superb sword + 3 is going to look way cooler than your common sword, nevermind that you're aesthetically limited to three European-style straight swords and a cutlass.</p>

<p>However, linear gear progression starts to present a practical problem if the game's damage scaling is tied to the player's gear quality. As far as can be told, all of <em>Avowed's</em> damage calculations ignore the player's level. Instead, incoming and outgoing damage is calculated purely based on the quality tier of your weapon and armor relative to the tier of the enemy.</p>

<p>If an enemy is a significantly higher tier, represented by the color of the health bar and any skulls next to their name, then they're going to take noticeably less damage. Similarly, if your armor is not a high enough tier, then you're going to get one-shot by everything on higher difficulties. Believe it or not, the the system was even more strict until <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2457220?emclan=103582791473758406&amp;emgid=689716592460694171" rel="nofollow">Obsidian toned it down in an early patch</a>.</p>

<p>Perhaps Obsidian realized that everyone will eventually level up to a minimum level, but not everyone will constantly keep their gear upgraded. Alternatively, early feedback might've rightfully indicated that most people didn't expect to lose a significant amount of damage and damage resistance simply by following the main quest and encountering their first higher tier enemies in the second playable area.</p>

<h2><em>Avowed's</em> Unique Problems with Unique Loot</h2>

<p>Predictably, such a punishing damage model has cascading consequences. Players who are going in blind are likely going to be discouraged from switching weapons mid-playthrough because the damage loss might be too undesirable. The material cost would certainly hurt too as <em>Avowed </em>isn't exactly showering you in resources.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/avowed-unique-amulet.jpg?itok=r59geLd8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/avowed-unique-amulet.jpg?itok=pigaDeTE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This unique amulet is going to be S-tier when you fight a boss made entirely out of physical traps, or if you're Lara Croft.</figcaption></figure><p>You would think that this would encourage people to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/avowed-unique-item-locations" rel="nofollow">find unique gear and stick with it</a> to the end of the game, and you'd be right. The caveat is that a good number of <em>Avowed's</em> uniques have decidedly unspectacular effects. Annoyingly, there's no gear set bonuses either even though there's clearly gear sets.</p>

<p>This is especially noticeable in the first half of the story. No one's saying that you have to give new players the best armor in the game after their first kill, but surely Obsidian can do better than unique rings that slowly heal you when you're wet in a game where 99% of the time is spent on dry land. Other curious effects include boosts to parkour speed, health regen when walking, and the fact that <em>Avowed's</em> unique grimoires don't have any unique effect at all.</p>

<p>To put this into perspective, you can find an accessory that provides a 5% crit chance boost halfway through the game and that alone is more impressive than any other accessory that you could've looted thus far. <em>Avowed's</em> unique weapons are slightly better, though they mostly just provide a 10% bonus of a specific elemental damage type.</p>

<p>With how tame some of these unique effects are, you'd almost think that they were designed with PvP balancing in mind. Or worse, that they were designed in a vacuum since few (if any) unique effects directly interact with your skills outside of effects that activate on parry. &nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/avowed-unique-greatsword.jpg?itok=FA0KK5Kl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/avowed-unique-greatsword.jpg?itok=cVVZDQYB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The practicality of this unique enchantment really depends on what difficulty you're playing on.</figcaption></figure><p>The obvious fix would've been through set bonuses. Take the aforementioned ring that only heals you when you're wet. Functionally useless on its own, but what if it was part of a set that when worn together grants you a chance to make everyone around you wet when dodging? Suddenly you have a more consistent health regen effect that makes it easier to freeze nearby enemies with the right spells.</p>

<h2><em>Avowed's</em> Future Lies with its Uniques</h2>

<p>That Obsidian didn't go in such a direction with <em>Avowed's</em> gear progression is certainly an odd choice. If anything, <em>Avowed's</em> loot system looks increasingly peculiar the more you look at it. For a developer as experienced as Obsidian is, surely they would have realized that games have been trending towards horizontal upgrade paths for a while and adjusted accordingly.</p>

<p>There's no shortage of other games to draw inspiration from. The <em>Persona </em>series essentially lets you make custom endgame gear. The <em>Borderlands </em>games have a million examples of how unique gear doesn't need ridiculous stats to be relevant and memorable. From <em>Dark Souls</em> and <em>Monster Hunter</em> to <em>Destiny </em>and <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>, you can even find players who will hunt down weapons and armor purely for the aesthetics.</p>

<p>Make no mistake, that's not to say that <em>Avowed </em>is a bad RPG. <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/avowed-review-pillars-of-excellence" rel="nofollow">On the contrary, the RPG aspect of the game is above average at worst.</a> The major hangup is in the loot and gear progression mechanics, which feel oddly basic. Good loot is the spice that keeps combat interesting, yet it seems Obsidian has only got vanilla in their kitchen.</p>

<p>Ubisoft’s ‘Project U’, which was in development at Ubisoft Annecy has had its intro cinematic leaked online.</p>



<p>In November 2024, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-project-u-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming exclusively reported</a> that the game was put back into incubation following five years of development.</p>



<p>The footage, which was uploaded to YouTube by known leaker Shaun Weber shows off the games intro cinematic, which sets the tone for the game. You can watch the intro below (expected to soon be DMCA’d)</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="That One Ubi Game 🤫Anime IntroSequence" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LqoaT1n5vr4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Project U, which was internally called ‘Pathfinder’ was set to be a new take on PvPvE, officially being announced in September 2022 as a “new kind of session-based cooperative shooter.”</p>



<p>According to sources, the game faced constant pushbacks and delays due to the games replayability, which also saw the games budget explode in size. Five years on, the game still wasn’t up to par, and Ubisoft pulled the plug on the project.</p>



<p>However, instead of cancellation the game entirely, it’s understood that the game went back to an internal incubation team because of Ubisoft’s belief that PvE games could still be successful. The team cited Helldivers 2 as being a particularly successful PvE game that could work well in today’s climate.</p>



<p>As for what Project U will turn into or if it will eventually be cancelled remains to be seen, regardless, it is nice to see (in my opinion at least), a little bit of the project made public.</p>



<p>What do you think of the Project U cinematic? Does it interest you in the game? Let us know in the comments or on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

When bored aliens transform Earth into a giant video-game style dungeon, Coast Guard veteran Carl becomes a participant in a life-or-death tournament. Carl is accompanied by a cat named Princess Donut. Throughout the series, the duo squares off against a wide array of monsters and solves puzzles. In case the name Princess Donut didn't give it away, Dungeon Crawler Carl doesn't take itself too seriously. Despite the high stakes, the series frequently leans into the ridiculousness of the scenario with darkly humorous dialogue and over-the-top violence.</p><p>You can start your journey with Carl and Princess Donut by picking up the hardcover edition of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dungeon-Crawler-Carl-Matt-Dinniman/dp/059382024X?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dungeon Crawler Carl (Book 1)</a> for $20.30 (was $30) at Amazon.</p><p dir="ltr">The upcoming hardcover editions follow the same release schedule as the first three novels: Ace is publishing one hardcover per month for the next three months. <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0593955978?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Gate of the Feral Gods (Book 4)</a></strong> releases March 11 and is available to preorder for $25 (was $30) at Amazon.

It is easily the best <em>RoboCop </em>game ever made. And we don’t have to wait long for the new installment, as <em>RoboCop: Rogue City</em> - <em>Unfinished Business</em> is set to arrive later this year. Oh, and if you haven’t played the first game, it’s on sale right now on Steam.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196215" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Best Resident Evil Goes VR And More New Releases | The Week In Games" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="68" data-playlist="196215,195670,196470" data-current="196215"><div><p>The Best Resident Evil Goes VR And More New Releases | The Week In Games</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196215/196215_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196215/196215_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196215/196215_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196215/196215_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21757.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/robocop-rogue-city-new-game-2023-review-shooter-rpg-pc-1851000568&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/robocop-rogue-city-new-game-2023-review-shooter-rpg-pc-1851000568">2023's <em>RoboCop: Rogue City</em></a></span> is a fantastic, semi-open world action-shooter with stellar combat and a shocking amount of heart. You can feel the devs really cared about <em>RoboCop</em> and his world when crafting the FPS, which includes RPG elements and multiple endings. And now, less than two years later, the same team behind <em>Rogue City</em> are ready to release a standalone follow-up, and I’m very excited. </p><p>On March 6, publisher Nacon announced <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/3527760/RoboCop_Rogue_City__Unfinished_Business/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3527760/RoboCop_Rogue_City__Unfinished_Business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>RoboCop: Rogue City - Unfinished</em></a></span> <em>Business</em>, which the developers describe as a “new standalone adventure” set after the events of <em>Rogue City.</em> It’s arriving later this year on consoles and PC. And once again, players will hop into the metal boots of RoboCop as he takes on crime, corruption, robots, and a lot of dudes with guns. </p><p>This time around, RoboCop is sent into OmniTower, a massive apartment complex designed to help the most needy in Old Detroit. However, a group of mercs armed with “cutting-edge weapons” has taken over the entire building and turned it into a fortress. Robo has to kick ass and clear the place out. </p><p>Thankfully, RoboCop has some new weapons, including an ice cannon that can literally “freeze” enemies, and will also have access to new finishing moves involving different parts of the environment. </p><p>Perhaps the most intriguing addition to <em>Unfinished Business</em> are a series of missions where players will take on the role of Alex Murphy before he became RoboCop. The devs promise these missions will tie into the larger storyline of the sequel, while also revealing a new side of the famous police officer. But you’ll have to be careful as during these missions you are just a regular dude with neither superpowers nor a robot body. I’m very intrigued to see how these missions play, as they could be a great way to shake up the experience.</p><p>If you haven’t played <em>RoboCop: Rogue City </em>yet, well, now is a great time to check it out. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1681430/RoboCop_Rogue_City/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1681430/RoboCop_Rogue_City/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The original game is currently on sale on Steam for just $10 which is a steal.</a></span></p><p>As for the recently announced follow up, it doesn’t have a specific release date yet. Instead, Nacon says to expect<em> RoboCop: Rogue City - Unfinished Business </em>on Xbox, PS5, and PC sometime in Q3 2025. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

There have been many attempts to reboot the RTS recently, ranging from throwbacks like the recent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/age-of-mythology-retold">Age Of Mythology: Retold</a> to splicey novelties such as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battle-aces">Battle Aces</a>. I’m not sure any have managed it, but I’m always glad to see fresh blood spilled in the house of Westwood. Which brings us to Project Citadel, a new space-me-do from Last Keep, a studio founded by former staff of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stranger-things">Stranger Things</a> devs BonusXP and Age Of Empires outfit Ensemble. It pitches you against an alien empire, and blends squad mechanics redolent of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/halo-wars">Halo Wars</a> with a roguelike format that aims to support shorter play sessions, while still supposedly allowing for vintage <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> gambits like booming and rushing.

You don't know what "booming" is? Goodness, you sound just like me before I wrote this news post: turns out it's something I've been doing for years without realising. For clarity, “booming” is when you focus on building up your economy at the start of a traditional RTS match. “Rushing” is obviously when you commit to an early offensive with cheapo units. Project Citadel aims to make these approaches work across a procedurally generated, turn-based campaign, with players moving across a branching, galactic overmap of smaller RTS encounters. The construction element is supplied by your mothership, which can assemble starbases and also provide support in battle.
</p>
<p>
The missing third pillar here is “turtling”, which is when you throw up as many defences as possible to begin with, hoping that your opponent will rush you and splatter themselves all over your turrets (a boomer player, by contrast, will simply gain a headstart in production while you’re wasting time prepping for an attack that never comes). Project Citadel doesn’t do turtling, it seems, because you’re always on the assault, forever trying to bring down that dang Voltari empire.
</p>
<p>
For ex-Microsoft and Battlefy exec Yohan Sengamalay and his collaborators, who include former Ensemble devs David Pottinger and Jason Sallenbach, bringing in roguelike elements is all about "deconstructing” the strategy genre. "We've taken the traditional, lengthy campaign and broken it into shorter missions that fit a roguelike structure,” Sengamalay told me over email. “This maintains meaningful choices and depth while introducing quicker rewards and greater experimentation.” 
</p>
<p>
As for unit control, “the moment-to-moment combat retains some similarity with strategy games we've worked on, but with added combat movement and skill-shot abilities to emphasize timing,” Sengamalay went on. “You command squadrons rather than individual units, an expansion of what we started with Halo Wars, allowing us to make the game equally playable on both controllers and mouse/keyboard setups.” The ships themselves range from missile-vomming daggers to hard-wearing behemoths. Their “skill-shots” include ramming through opposing formations like a herd of buffalo.
</p>
<p>
As for how Project Citadel stands apart from other attempts to jump-start a new era in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/starcraft">StarCraft</a> &amp; Conquering, Sengamalay observed to me that “while the genre is experiencing a resurgence, it is very much centered around remakes or spiritual successors”. Last Keep are a titchy indie, numbering just 2-10 people according to their <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/last-keep/about/">LinkedIn</a>. According to Sengamalay, they're “neither interested nor have the resources to simply re-make past successes like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/age-of-empires">Age of Empires</a>”.
</p>
<p>
The pessimistic take on all this is that people have been cobbling roguelike exoskeletons onto other species of game for decades – I <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rogue-light-deck-builder-is-not-a-roguelike-deckbuilder-its-a-cry-for-help">moaned about the abundance of roguelike deckbuilders</a> on these very pages not two weeks ago. Sometimes, the combination is a symbiosis, and sometimes it’s parasitism: the repetitiveness of rogueliking overpowers other aspects of the experience.</p>
<p>The cynical read is that I've heard a pitch like this before. While at BonusXP - which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/studio-behind-stranger-things-game-and-more-shutting-down/1100-6514774/">closed in June 2023 for reasons not given at the time</a>, amid widespread games industry cuts - Pottinger and Sallenbach worked on Servo, an RTS that sought similarly to spice things up with RPG elements, and was also touted as being from former Age Of Empires developers. Released in early access in 2015, it won praise initially but never made it to 1.0.</p>
<p>All that notwithstanding, I'm always interested in attempts to "deconstruct" an established format. As an elder Age Of Mythology player who carries a candle for Halo Wars, I hope that Project Citadel fares better than Servo. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2929040/Project_Citadel/">You can read more about the game on Steam</a>. There’s no release date yet.

The first thing I thought after typing on it was: this feels amazing and I don’t want to stop using it. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The L5 HE 8K is pitched as a hyper-precise, cutting-edge gaming keyboard. It’s called that because it has a polling rate of 8,000. That’s how many times a second it’s sending inputs to your gaming rig, giving you every miniscule time advantage possible when firing off an ultimate in <em>Overwatch</em> 2 or toggling items in <em>Dota 2</em>. This is, in my experience, complete overkill, but the rest of the mechanical keyboard is so good it doesn’t really matter. </p><p>I’ve been typing and gaming on the “Dark Master” L5 HE 8K test model Lemokey sent me for review (it’s black with a red escape key) and I still get a little dopamine hit every time my fingers punch the keys. They’re firm but plucky. The strokes are surprisingly smooth yet satisfyingly responsive. They sound like fat raindrops hitting a metal warehouse roof and feel like running your hand through a barrel of rich, darkly roasted coffee beans.

The final versions will be more expensive when they join the rest of Lemokey’s lineup, the gaming brand from mechanical keyboard maker Keychron. It’s a pricey package that has the specs and looks to back it up. In addition to the 8K polling rate and 32K Hz scan rate, the key selling point is magnetic Hall Effect switches and 0.01mm actuation sensitivity. Lemokey’s browser software (online only) can be used to then customize the precise distance each key needs to travel to register input, as well as assign hotkey combinations and other shortcuts.</p><p>The result is effectively a keyboard limited only by the speed of your own fingers and the grey matter controlling them. The other way of putting this is: it won’t matter for most people. Did I play better on the L5 HE 8K? Score more goals in <em>Rocket League</em>? Get more kills in <em>Marvel Rivals</em>? Not really. But I certainly enjoyed doing all of those things more than on my current default, the no-frills Ducky Zero 6108. And the ultra-sensitive snappiness of actuation points calibrated just so does add a new layer of control. </p><p>The 75 percent formfactor means there’s no number pad and keys like Print Screen have also been jettisoned. It’s a compact layout that’s just shy of feeling cramped, though I wouldn’t have minded more room. A small, gumdrop-sized dial at the top right doesn’t feel as good as the rest of the keyboard, but gets the job done. The L5 HE 8K is wired only, and the RGB backlighting is great but can’t be adjusted on a key-by-key basis. A strip of light running across the back of the keyboard is a nice <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMT8tRrEMC4&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMT8tRrEMC4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Tron</em>-like</a></span> accent.</p><figure id="" data-id="45e71013669903cfb0f05f50783b847c" data-recommend-id="image://45e71013669903cfb0f05f50783b847c" data-format="jpg" data-width="2000" data-height="2656" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A keyboard sits on a desk.

There’s no adjusting the angle of the keyboard, which could be a deal breaker for those with palms that don’t perfectly align. Mine adjusted just fine, even if I could feel the longer sessions building up tension in my knuckles. The double-shot PBT keycaps do feel rich and durable and are hot-swappable (and were surprisingly hard to get off the switches when I pulled them off).</p><p>One silver lining to the  L5 HE 8K’s lack of wireless portability is that it sits on my desk like a long black paper weight in the best way possible. The 4.2 lbs. CNC metal case offers complete stability, like you’re typing into a mini-gravity well. It’s sleek and minimalist looking, but conveys the same premium pleasure of pulling out a heavy metal credit card at the hotel bar (and without the terrible compounding interest rates). Gasket mounting helps cushion the metal too, with the option to top mount instead. </p><p>The luxurious button feel, cool design sense, and overall quality of the package are the L5 HE 8K’s main selling points, in my opinion. The rapid input, zero-latency gaming and precise actuation customization are just the cherries on top. There are lots of magnetic Hall Effect switch options out there, including Keychron’s own Q3 Max, but the L5 HE 8K holds its own in terms of both performance, customization, and more intangibles like the underlying build-feel. The off-white option with cream keys looks especially nice. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-scavs-upgraded/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/escape-from-tarkov%E2%80%99s-scavs-have-been-upgraded-based-on-community-feedback.1128429/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-scavs-upgraded/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Battlestate Games recently carried out a survey in Escape from Tarkov geared towards gathering feedback centered on the ‘Scav’ player character. When folks play Escape from Tarkov, they can do so as a PMC, which is their dedicated character, or as a Scav, which is a randomised ‘local’ character that has many restrictions and drawbacks.</p>



<p>Following the collection of the survey results, Battlestate Games has already implemented some major changes to Scav characters. It was stressed that further changes are in the pipeline.</p>



<p>Find out below what Battlestate Games has done to upgrade Scavs.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-scav-life">Scav Life</h2>



<p>The feedback received from the recent Escape from Tarkov survey revealed that 64% of players want to be able to ‘plan and control’ where their Scav character can go, which is mostly centered around picking the map they want to explore. Additionally, 84% of players confirmed that they only play as a Scav to perform loot runs and secure items to upgrade their in-game Hideout.</p>



<p>By comparison, 30% of players said that playing as a Scav should be truly random, right down to which map the player is forced to explore. Also, 2.6% of players admitted that they never play as a Scav character, and 6.6% play as a Scav to actively seek out PvP scraps with PMC characters.</p>



<p>To improve the state of play with Scav characters since the survey, Battlestate Games has made af few key changes:</p>



<ul>
<li>Player Scavs will now spawn no earlier than 17 minutes <strong>after </strong>the start of the raid on all maps except for Reserve, Factory, and Ground Zero.</li>



<li>The Scav equipment system has been improved, and a higher fence rep will now reward a player with better Scav gear.</li>
</ul>



<p>It was then promised that more optimisations are coming to the role that 97% of Tarkov players enjoy.</p>



<p>Escape from Tarkov remains at the top of the table where extraction shooters are concerned. It has been around for almost ten years and shows no signs of slowing down. In just a couple of months, players will be transitioning <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-escape-from-tarkov-wipe/">into another ‘wipe’ event</a>.</p>



<p>Do you play as a Scav in Escape from Tarkov? What would you like to see changed? Let us know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>It has been a silly amount of time since the first trailer for GTA 6 was released by Rockstar Games. In December 2023, we got our first look at the upcoming game, and since then, things have run completely flat. Many rumours and proposed release dates for the second GTA 6 trailer have come and gone time and again, and right now, we have <strong>no idea </strong>when the next snippet will drop.</p>



<p>Recently, Rockstar Games took a break from not promoting GTA 6 to back something else entirely – a new Danny Dyer movie. It’s bizarre, but there’s a method to the madness that led to the gaming titan promoting a small British movie.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-a-proper-naughty-comedy">‘A Proper Naughty Comedy’</h2>



<p>Everyone is on tenterhooks, wondering when the next GTA 6 trailer will be released, but Rockstar is keeping tight-lipped. It seems that gamers worldwide have plundered the first trailer clean of every tidbit and detail, and there’s nothing left to be discovered – not that everyone is giving up, of course. </p>



<p>In an unexpected post on social media, Rockstar took a moment to promote Danny Dyer and Nick Love’s new British movie, Marching Powder.</p>



<div><article><p><span>From our friends Nick Love and Danny Dyer, the absolute legends behind The Football Factory…

</span><a href="https://twitter.com/MarchingPowder_" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@MarchingPowder_</a><span> — a proper naughty comedy out tomorrow in the UK and Ireland.

Get tickets now at </span><a href="http://marchingpowderthemovie.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">marchingpowderthemovie.com</a><span> and look out for details on worldwide release soon.</span></p></article></div>







<p>Fans have already theorised that this is a clear nod to Danny Dyer appearing in GTA 6, potentially reprising his ‘Kent Paul’ character, which was last seen in 2004’s GTA: San Andreas. Others more privy to the situation have recollected how Rockstar Games was a <strong>producer </strong>of the movie penned in the recent social media post – The Football Factory.</p>



<p>Given that the GTA universe split in 2008 when GTA 4 was released, it seems highly unlikely that Kent Paul is returning <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-gta-6-coming-out-confirmed/">in GTA 6</a>, but never say never, right?</p>



<p>Keep on waiting for that trailer.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/blades-of-fire-the-first-preview.1128420/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/blades-of-fire-preview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">When I sat down to play developer MercurySteam’s latest project, Blades of Fire, I expected something of a return to the studio’s Castlevania: Lords of Shadow games, updated with the modern stylings of God of War. An hour later I thought I was playing a Soulslike, albeit one where all the stats were in my weapons rather than an RPG character sheet. By the end of the three-hour hands-on session, I realised both of those observations were simultaneously true and false: this is a game that is unmistakably built on well-worn ground, but the unique arrangement of both its borrowed components and new ideas results in a fresh and interesting approach to the action-adventure genre. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While it’s not exactly a clone of Sony Santa Monica’s work, you’d be forgiven for assuming as much at first glance. With its dark fantasy world, heavy-hitting strikes, and third-person camera that stays close to the action, Blades of Fire has much in common with the Norse era of Kratos’ journey. There are certainly even more parallels that I could talk of: across a demo that took place during the game’s opening hours, I explored a twisty, treasure chest-laden map with the aid of a young companion who helped solve puzzles. Together we sought out a woman of the wilds who lived in a house mounted atop a giant creature. It can sometimes feel a bit <em>too</em> familiar, especially when you also factor in the many elements pilfered from FromSoftware’s library, including anvil-shaped checkpoints that, when rested at, both refill your limited health potions and respawn enemies.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/06/blades-of-fire-announcement-05-1741275656941.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Blades of Fire features some deeply strange enemies that feel like dark cousins of Labyrinth's puppets. | Image credit: MercurySteam / 505 Games </figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">All of this familiarity is filtered through a world that has an air of 1980s fantasy about it. You can imagine Conan the Barbarian easily blending in among its incredibly buff soldiers, while a bunch of orangutan-like enemies bouncing around on bamboo pogo sticks wouldn’t look out of place in Jim Henson’s Labyrinth. Even the story has a retro vibe; an evil queen has turned steel into stone, and it’s up to you – Aran de Lira, essentially a blacksmith demigod –  to kill her and restore the world’s metal. Despite these old-school charms, though, at this stage I’m doubtful the story, characters, or writing will prove that compelling – it’s all incredibly <em>video game-y</em>, akin to the many forgotten stories of the Xbox 360 era.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Like many of those games of yore, Blades of Fire’s best accomplishments appear to be mechanical. It boasts a combat system rooted in directional attacks that makes use of every face button on the controller. On a PlayStation pad, tapping triangle aims for the head, cross goes for the torso, while square and circle swipe left and right respectively. Through careful reading of an enemy’s stance you can use these attacks to break through defences. A soldier holding up a blade to protect their face, for instance, can be overcome by aiming low and skewering through their gut. The impact is wonderfully squelchy, with thick trails of blood erupting from the wounds you inflict.   </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are occasions when this system really shines. The demo’s first major boss, a slobbering troll, had a second health bar that could only be chipped away after dismembering the beast. The limb that’s lopped off is dictated by your angle of attack, so I could use my right-hand strike to detach its club-swinging left arm, quite literally disarming my foe. Even better: you can cut the troll’s entire face off, leaving it blind and aimlessly flailing until it can regrow its eyes and continue the fight.  </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Compared to most games, your weapons demand a huge amount of attention. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Interesting wrinkles like this can be found in many of the combat staples. Rather than automatically regenerate, your attack and dodge-fuelling stamina gauge must be manually restored by holding the block button. But despite these new ideas providing Blades of Fire’s combat with a distinctly different edge, the general tone of battle is undeniably Soulsian. Attack pattern recognition and slender dodge/block/parry windows are very much the name of the game here, and there’s the same sense of risk and reward – even if the punishment isn’t quite as severe. It’s enough to trick your brain into reaching for FromSoft muscle memory, but that sadly won’t save you here: the directional attack system demands a very different control map, the safety of blocking repositioned to the left trigger. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">After rewiring my brain to remember that none of the face buttons can be used to dodge, things began to click. The unique approaches gradually took centre stage over the Souls of it all, and I soon found the combat to be refreshingly different. Core damage dealing is elevated by a smart weapon system that allows you to wield your bladed armaments with different stances, either slashing with the sharp edge or thrusting with the pointed tip. As with the directional system, you’ll need to assess your enemy (as well as some useful HUD prompts) to determine which method is most effective.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Blades of Fire Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If the title didn’t give it away, your weapons are the very heart of Blades of Fire. And compared to most games, they demand a huge amount of attention. Edged weapons dull with repeated use, meaning each successive strike deals a minuscule less damage than the last. That all adds up over time, so you’ll need to use a sharpening stone to replenish your weapon’s blade. That, or switch to a different stance; the edge and the tip wear down independent of each other, which contributes to the sense that these are tangible items affected by your fighting style.     </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As with Monster Hunter, you’ll learn to make space to sharpen your sword mid-fight. But every weapon has a durability meter that continually depletes, no matter how well you care for it. When your weapon inevitably shatters, you can repair it at an anvil checkpoint. Or you can melt it down into its raw materials to begin crafting anew in what is undoubtedly Blades of Fire’s most significant and distinguishing innovation: the forge. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>With your weapon design complete, you must  then physically hammer out the metal on an anvil. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">To say MercurySteam has created an extensive weapon crafting system is an understatement. Rather than find new armaments in the world, every weapon’s life begins here in the forge. It starts with the choice of a basic weapon template, which Aran sketches out on a chalkboard. From here you tweak and modify. For instance, when designing a spear, I adjusted both the length of the pole and the shape of the spearhead. Each decision is reflected in the weapon’s stats; a longer pole increases the spear’s range, while the shape of the head dictates if it’s more proficient at slashing or piercing. Different materials affect weight and that in turn changes the weapon’s demands on your stamina pool. All this lends the sense that you are genuinely <em>crafting </em>your weapon. You even get to name your creation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Most crafting systems would end there. In Blades of Fire, this is only the halfway point. With your design complete, you must then physically hammer out the metal on an anvil. This is achieved via a remarkably involved minigame in which you control the length, force, and angle of every hammer strike. A curved line across the screen represents the ultimate ideal, and with each blow of the hammer you attempt to arrange a series of vertical bars, akin to a graphic equalizer, to match the shape of that curved line. Overworking the steel will result in a weaker weapon, so the aim is to recreate that line in as few strikes as possible. Your efforts are rewarded with a star rating; the more stars you attain, the more often you can repair your creation before it permanently breaks and is lost forever. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/06/blades-of-fire-forge-1741275453888.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The forging minigame is a great idea that feels a little too obtuse. | Image credit: MercurySteam / 505 Games</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I really love the idea of the forge and how it introduces a skill element to what is typically a menu-driven system. But even after several sessions at the anvil, I found the minigame frustratingly obtuse. There didn’t seem to be a clear connection between the areas that I struck and the resulting shape of the metal. Hopefully some improvements, or simply a better tutorial, are implemented before launch – it would be a shame for Blades of Fire’s most interesting feature to be marred by irritation. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The idea at the heart of the forge is something that goes way beyond the boundaries of a three-hour demo session. MercurySteam wants you to feel deeply attached to the weapons you create and carry them with you for the duration of your journey – a journey the developer claims will be “no less than 60-70 hours.” As you explore the world and find new metals, you’ll be able to reforge your trusted swords, axes, hammers, and spears to enhance their properties, ensuring they’re always suitable for new and more difficult challenges. This relationship between you and your armaments is emphasised by the death system; upon defeat you drop the weapon you were using and respawn without it. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s another mechanic inspired by Dark Souls, but built on a different, arguably more meaningful bond: lost souls can always be replenished with more killing, but a brilliant sword you’ve built a connection with is irreplaceable. Luckily your dropped weapons will remain in the world permanently, so your only challenge is to find a way to recover what you lost. I look forward to seeing how this plays out over the entire campaign, and if any kind of backtracking will reunite you with weapons from a dozen hours ago that you can reforge and rekindle your relationship with. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s unsurprising to see MercurySteam adopt multiple ideas from Dark Souls and its siblings. That’s partly due to FromSoftware’s seemingly irreversible impact on action games, but also because Blades of Fire is something of a spiritual successor to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2001/02/28/blade-of-darkness-2">Blade of Darkness</a>: a relic of the early 2000s, it was developed by MercurySteam’s founding members and is considered (by its cult following, at least) to be a precursor to the Souls series. In many ways, those developers are simply picking up from where they left off, implementing the advancements made by other studios during their time away from the genre.  </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/06/blades-of-fire-announcement-08-1741275883286.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Aran is joined by his young companion, Adso, who can help solve puzzles and comment on the world's lore. | Image credit: MercurySteam / 505 Games</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As I played, I could feel the gravitational pull of all of MercurySteam’s apparent influences – the brutal combat of this project’s decades-old predecessor, the innovations of FromSoft, and the world design of God of War. But as much as those ideas are clear to see, they fall short of defining the studio’s latest work. Rather than craft a Soulslike or a God of War-like, those firmly established systems have been reinterpreted as part of a larger canvas of ideas. Blades of Fire has a recipe of its own that successfully distances it from any of its obvious gaming touchstones.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I do have some misgivings – I’m unsure if this fairly generic dark fantasy world is up to the challenge of supporting a 60 hour adventure, and within three hours I’d fought the same gatekeeping miniboss three times, which makes me question the variety on offer. But the demonstrated depth of relationship between your forged blades and the foes you face has me totally intrigued. In a time when complex and, frankly, obtuse games like Elden Ring and Monster Hunter have become mainstream hits, I think Blades of Fire has the potential to contribute something fascinating to the scene.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Senior Features Editor. </em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/amd-says-top-tier-ryzen-9900x3d-and-9950x3d-cpus-arrive-march-12-for-599-and-699/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
          
<p>Like the 7950X3D and 7900X3D, these new X3D chips combine a pair of AMD's CPU chiplets, one that has the extra 64MB of cache stacked underneath it and one that doesn't. For the 7950X3D, you get eight cores with extra cache and eight without; for the 7900X3D, you get eight cores with extra cache and four without.</p>
<p>It's up to AMD's chipset software to decide what kinds of apps get to run on each kind of CPU core. Non-gaming workloads prioritize the normal CPU cores, which are generally capable of slightly higher peak clock speeds, while games that benefit disproportionately from the extra cache are run on those cores instead. AMD's software can "park" the non-V-Cache CPU cores when you're playing games to ensure they're not accidentally being run on less-suitable CPU cores.</p>
<p>We didn't have issues with this core parking technology when we initially tested the 7950X3D and 7900X3D, and AMD has steadily made improvements since then to make sure that core parking is working properly. The new 9000-series X3D chips should benefit from that work, too. To get the best results, <a href="https://community.amd.com/t5/gaming/how-to-set-up-your-system-with-a-new-amd-ryzen-9-7950x3d-or/ba-p/589464">AMD officially recommends</a> a fresh and fully updated Windows install, along with the newest BIOS for your motherboard and the newest AMD chipset drivers; swapping out another Ryzen CPU for an X3D model (or vice versa) without reinstalling Windows can occasionally lead to CPUs being parked (or not parked) when they are supposed to be (or not supposed to be).</p>

                <p>The beloved roguelike platformer Spelunky 2 was released in 2020 for PlayStation 4, and a native PS5 version just dropped yesterday, March 6.</p><p>While the PS4 version can back played on PS5 via backwards compatibility, the PS5 version has one crucial upgrade, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/535865/spelunky-2-ps5-ps4-upgrade-120-fps" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">as noted by Polygon.</a> It can also run at a blazing-fast 120fps, provided that your monitor or TV has the capability to show those frames. Those extra frames could be the difference between victory and defeat in an unforgiving game like Spelunky 2.</p><p><a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10001266" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Spelunky 2 costs $20 on PSN</a>. Fortunately, those who already own Spelunky 2 on PS4 can simply upgrade to the PS5 version for free. The game also has cross-play to its online multiplayer functions, so players can join up with others from different platforms.</p><p>Spelunky 2 already had a current-gen version with Xbox Series X|S, and now PS5 has joined that category. The game is also on Nintendo Switch, but it's unknown whether a native Switch 2 version will come, as Nintendo's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/is-the-nintendo-switch-2-backwards-compatible/1100-6527615/" data-ref-id="1100-6527615">upcoming console has some backwards compatibility restrictions</a>.</p><p>Spelunky 2 revolves around Ana Spelunky, the daughter of Spelunky's protagonist, Guy Spelunky. After her parents go missing, Ana goes on a journey to the moon in order to find them.</p><p>In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/spelunky-2-review-snakes-on-a-2d-plane/1900-6417567/" data-ref-id="1900-6417567">Spelunky 2 review</a>, we said, "Spelunky 2 is a successful evolution of what made the original Spelunky work; the tight controls, impressive use of procedural generation, expressive art style, and interesting stage themes are better than ever here."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/first-battlefield-6-screenshots-and-gameplay-leak-after-playtest/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today marked the first of <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-reportedly-conducting-largest-franchise-playtests-to-ensure-the-games-success/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">several public large-scale playtests</a> for Battlefield 6 and, inevitably, the first screenshots and gameplay leaked on the Web. We've embedded a couple of these leaks, which originated via Reddit, below. At the same time, the developers <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1j5jbil/battlefield_labs_community_update_gunplay_and/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> a Community Update focused on gunplay and movement philosophy for the upcoming title.</p>
<p><em>We're designing the combat experience to ensure players of all skill levels can enjoy our gunplay and movement systems. Our goal is to offer gameplay that rewards skill with precise weapon feedback and movement options for veterans while providing an intuitive experience for new players to learn and enjoy.</em></p>
<p><em>For gunplay, we're exploring designs centered on helping you learn and develop skills and muscle memory through action, as weapons naturally signal their recoil direction. This feedback loop allows you to understand and adjust your aim, making it easier to handle different weapons. This system not only adds variety but also enhances each weapon's unique feel and play style.</em></p>
<p><em>Movement is also deeply integrated with gunplay, as your actions and targets are all part of the same cohesive combat experience. We aim to make movement both feel intuitive and rewarding to move within the world and during combat, but also when playing against someone using both the gunplay and movement systems to their maximum potential.</em></p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="546"><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1j5swvw/first_look_at_victory_screen/">First look at victory screen</a><br>
by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Hingl_McCringlebery/">u/Hingl_McCringlebery</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/">Battlefield</a></p></blockquote>

<p><em>We’ve reduced the time it takes for bullets to appear on your screen from when you press fire. This change decreases input delay, makes shooting feel more responsive, and helps you better track and hit moving targets.</em></p>
<p><em>We're optimizing for a 60Hz tick rate, ensuring the game server more frequently updates the positions and actions for all players. This results in responsive gameplay across all platforms and inputs. You'll notice more precise shooting and movement, enhanced damage feedback, and more accurate representation of other players' positions and combat outcomes.</em></p>
<p><em>We've adjusted the recoil system to make the different weapon types feel unique when firing them. Through enhancements to gunplay recoil, camera shakes, and firing settles, each shot’s recoil direction now matches its gameplay angle. The weapon visually stabilizes the more accurate your handling is, making you feel like you're actually firing and controlling it.</em></p>
<p><em>To evolve the moment system we've revamped animations and reintroduced movement features such as crouch sprint, combat dive and landing roll, and added visual indicators to make it easier to understand when movements such as vaulting or leaning are possible.</em></p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="546"><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1j5sugo/5_minutes_gameplay_thoughts/">5 minutes gameplay, thoughts?</a><br>
by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/iswhatitiswaswhat/">u/iswhatitiswaswhat</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/">Battlefield</a></p></blockquote>

<p>As a reminder, Battlefield 6 <a href="https://wccftech.com/four-development-studios-working-on-new-battlefield-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has four studios</a> focused entirely on it. DICE is leading development on multiplayer; Motive (the studio behind the Dead Space remake) is crafting a 'meaty' single player campaign; Criterion is 'driving content experiences' across both single player and multiplayer; and Ripple Effect is working on what has only been described as a new experience fueled by the Battlefield DNA.</p>
<p>Following the underwhelming commercial launches of Battlefield V and Battlefield 2042, the third time has to be the charm for the franchise. The game doesn't have a release window yet, but it's likely EA will push to get it out at some point this Fall.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/625931/nintendo-switch-2-fcc-nfc-wi-fi-6-usb<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><div><p>The Nintendo Switch 2 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/23872810/nintendo-switch-2-next-generation-console-features-trailer">is already official</a>, but there’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24344718/nintendo-switch-2-specs-date-price-launch-games-mario-kart">a <em>lot</em> we still don’t know</a> — like, will Nintendo’s new handheld support the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/24/15041136/nintendo-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-amiibo-collectibles">NFC-equipped Amiibo figurines</a> that can wirelessly unlock content in games?</p></div><p>Today, it seems likely they will, because filings at the Federal Communication Commission (FCC) reveal the console will support NFC. They even specify that the RFID feature will be located in the right Joy-Con, just like it was in the original Switch.</p><p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is apparently designated the BEE-001, the company’s radio equipment test filings reveal, where “BEE” is Nintendo’s designator for the Switch 2 family of products, with “001” the main console, “014” the right Joy-Con, and “012” the left one.</p><p>Nintendo’s followed this pattern for decades; “DMG” was the original Game Boy, “DOL” was the GameCube, “RVL” was the Wii, and “HAC” was the original Nintendo Switch, as just a few examples.</p><p>You’ll also be able to charge the Nintendo Switch 2 from either its bottom USB-C port or its new top USB-C port, the filings reveal. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/23872810/nintendo-switch-2-next-generation-console-features-trailer">Nintendo’s announcement tease</a> confirmed the Switch would have an extra USB-C port up top, but I think this is the first real confirmation of charging from both.</p><p>If you were hoping for faster Wi-Fi in your Switch 2, that’s pretty likely as well: the filings show it will support Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax) networks with up to 80MHz of bandwidth, up from Wi-Fi 5 (802.11ac) on the original Switch. However, it doesn’t seem to have Wi-Fi 7 or Wi-Fi 6E, and it’s only crossed the FCC with tests for 2.4GHz and 5GHz networks, not the faster / shorter-range 6GHz band.</p><p>Just in case you have any doubts this might be some other <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/23/24251736/nintendo-mmwave-device-24ghz-fcc-filing">mystery Nintendo product</a> instead of a Switch, diagrams at the FCC show it being tested with and without attached controllers and with and without a dock:</p><p>It’s unclear from these tests whether the Nintendo Switch 2 has faster charging speed or more power when docked.</p><p>The original Switch shipped with an unusual adapter that charged at up to 15V and 2.6A. FCC filings show the Switch 2 is still rated for a maximum of 15V but also mention an AC adapter that goes up to 20V. Both or either of those could be USB-C PD, but we can’t properly guess at charging speed (in watts) without knowing the amperage.</p><p>We still don’t know exactly when the Switch 2 will be released, but Nintendo has said it’s coming sometime this year.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p><em>It's nice to have alone time, at least until you have enough of that alone time to start wondering "okay, maybe I've had enough alone time?" </em></p><p><em>All of have spent our lives in different versions of being with and without people, be they friends, family, partners, or something else. And as one gets older, as those dynamics tend to become pretty familiar. </em></p><p><em>Safe. Predictable. Satisfying.</em></p><p><em>This week, Patrick's solo parenting while his wife is on a work trip, and it got him thinking about the way shifting into old ways of doing things—I'm single, baby!—don't always hold the same appeal as you get older.</em></p><hr><p><strong>Patrick: </strong>So Rob, my wife is away this week on a business trip. When I was younger, and especially so when I didn’t have kids, these kinds of moments were always a fun free-for-all. I’d shotgun television shows, burn through hours of video games, 100% slam a beer or two more than I should while out (or in), and absolutely and under no circumstances would I eat a salad.&nbsp;</p><p>My wife would always joke “so, what did you eat <em>today</em>” and the answer was almost certainly buffalo wings. Such antics are more reigned in now, because I’m in singularly in charge of shuttling two children to daycare and/or school, packing lunches, pick up and drop off for evening activities, and then finally juggling making dinner for three people, trying to understand how 3rd grade math works, and doing whatever it takes to make sure both kids are asleep by 9pm. By the end, my friend, all I want is a beer and to try and not fall asleep on the couch.</p><p>Oh, and I basically eat a side salad with every lunch and dinner these days.</p><p>Instead, what these weeks have become about is spending time with media that I do not have time for while my wife <em>is</em> around. We get, at best, an hour-ish of time to watch a show every night, before it’s time for me to play some video games and she heads to bed. We push that window open a little bigger on Friday and Saturday nights, where we usually watch a movie.&nbsp;</p><p>She is not, for example, a huge fan of watching exceptionally sad movies. You know, the kinds that people warn you about before watching? If it’s nominated for an Oscar, she’ll do it, but otherwise, those get stacked into a queue of movies I end up sneaking in when she’s away. This is how I will probably end up watching <em>We Live in Time</em>, the sad-sounding movie with Florence Pugh and Andrew Garfield about deciding to have a kid even though she’s dying, this weekend.</p><p>But otherwise, our tastes are pretty in sync. With a few exceptions, we watch the same TV shows and watch the same movies because it means we get to spend more time together. I have a handful of shows (like, say, the terrific <em>Invincible</em>) I watch on my own because of work and she has her guilty pleasure shows (like, say, the apparently charming <em>Nobody Wants This</em>), but given our personal time constraints, finding overlap has huge benefits. It also means, however, I can’t watch shows I am deeply invested in (I’m looking at you, <em>Pitt</em>!!) until she returns.</p><p>Alas. There are other ways my life shifts, how my habits change, when my wife is gone for an extended period of time, but I’m curious what yours is like (or isn’t like) in the same situation.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Photo by </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/@anthonytran?ref=remapradio.com"><span>Anthony Tran</span></a><span> / </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit"><span>Unsplash</span></a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Rob: </strong>I go through an arc. Day 1 and maybe into Day 2, it’s Rob Time, baby! Crank up the sound system, enjoy <em>Ronin </em>or <em>The Game </em>for the umpteenth time. Sorry, poodles, but dad’s going to be playing <em>Total War </em>in the living room tonight, or calling down strikes in <em>Helldivers</em>! Maybe in the evening, I’ll enjoy the coldest martini in history with a bowl of blood oranges on the side and watch <em>Deadwood </em>again. The world is my oyster!By Day 3, though, the novelty has worn off. The dogs are acting weird and sad, and evening video calls are not getting them back to their normal poodle-ish joys. I am probably already losing touch with normal schedules because now there’s less appeal in calling it a night rather than watching another episode of TV. So now I’m running on less sleep. There are things I want to watch but, like you alluded to, can’t really watch until MK is back. I have my hands completely full with the dogs and housework and so I’m more shut-in than usual. Outside of the people at the dog daycare and the people I record podcasts with, I’m not having conversations. </p><p>And let’s be real, the conversations you have with dog daycare folks are not like, super involving: “So her poop was good? Tilly was a little off her food this morning.”If the business trip is much longer than that, everything starts to go to seed a little bit. There’s not enough dishes to run the dishwasher, so naturally I just let things start piling up. I tell myself I should cook, feel unmotivated to cook just for myself, so eventually rummage in the fridge for something or make questionable delivery decisions.&nbsp;</p>

It’s a specific phenomenon that highlights the complications of developing an animated series alongside a print version the show eventually outpaces. There are <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.animefillerlist.com/shows/dragon-ball&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.animefillerlist.com/shows/dragon-ball" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">entire online databases</a></span> built to guide those viewers who want to skip the padding and get to the good stuff. Nowadays, the term is routinely thrown at any episode of television that doesn’t drive the plot forward, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/severance-season-2-apple-tv-mark-news-1851752137&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/severance-season-2-apple-tv-mark-news-1851752137"><em>Severance</em></a></span>, Apple TV’s dystopian workplace mystery box show, is the latest series to have some of its fans slap the label on an excellent episode of television. The show’s second season is nearly complete, and its eighth episode, titled “Sweet Vitriol,” provided a key piece to its ongoing puzzle. But if you stick to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/1j5dod3/severance_2x08_sweet_vitriol_episode_discussion/?sort=top&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/1j5dod3/severance_2x08_sweet_vitriol_episode_discussion/?sort=top" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">certain sides of the internet</a></span>, you’d think it was just 37 minutes of padding meant to fill this week’s slot in the release schedule and hold us back from learning the next great revelation. It’s like we’ve lost all sense of how to experience a story if it doesn’t constantly give us theory-crafting fodder.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><figure id="" data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>In a way, this is a prison of <em>Severance</em>’s own making. The best mystery box shows are regimented and intentional, leading viewers by the hand through a dark hallway, illuminating only a few steps at a time before finally bringing us out the other side. <em>Severance</em>, not beholden to the 20+ episode season syndication deals that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/severance-season-2-explained-dan-erickson-1851743150&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/severance-season-2-explained-dan-erickson-1851743150">undermined the pacing of shows like <em>Lost</em></a></span>, feels especially methodical, showing fans exactly what it wants them to see and letting them extrapolate over the next week about what it all means. Whereas a network show may be beholden to the whims of executives who decide to keep the story and its mysteries going beyond what its creators intended, the creators of <em>Severance </em>have the creative freedom to focus on a core mystery without worrying about such external pressures.</p><p>Series director Ben Stiller has been up front about how deliberately the <em>Severance </em>team has been developing the show. In an interview with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://collider.com/severance-season-3-plans-explained/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://collider.com/severance-season-3-plans-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Collider</em></a></span>, he explained that the team doesn’t want <em>Severance </em>to become a show that drags on forever just because it’s become successful, and that’s a key part of why its mystery works.</p><p>“You have a responsibility to the audience that you’re going somewhere with it,” Stiller told <em>Collider</em>. “That’s always been a part of it for us, really understanding where it’s heading to, and Apple’s been really supportive of that and been sensitive to what the story is and not saying, ‘Okay, this is something that has to keep going as long as it’s successful.’ It should go as long as the story goes, and that’s something we have an idea of, and we’re working towards as we’re starting up our Season 3 work.”</p><p>That intentionality is what makes the accusations that “Sweet Vitriol” is mere “filler” feel like missing the forest for the trees. At just 37 minutes, it’s the shortest episode in the show’s history, and it abandons the disconcerting severed floor at Lumon Industries entirely to focus on the exemplary Patricia Arquette’s Harmony Cobel. After fleeing Lumon following attempts by the company to remove her from her original position managing the MDR crew (or perhaps Lumon had something more permanent in mind), Cobel drives to a small, out-of-the-way factory town built by Lumon that’s practically deserted. It’s a haunting, dying reminder that a corporation will build up people and places just to abandon them the second they’re no longer useful. I’m sure the ex-manager found it clarifying to see the town where she was raised by Lumon as a child laborer desecrated and left to rot, even as its former citizens still praise Lumon founder Kier Eagan like a god.</p><p>But the rot runs deeper than a town left to die by its corporate overlords. Despite all the claims by fans that the episode is “filler” and offers nothing meaningful to the broader <em>Severance </em>mystery, it actually drops one of the biggest bombshells yet on the Lumon legacy, one that was worth an entire episode’s 37-minute runtime to lead into it. Cobel returns to her childhood home, which is on the outskirts of Lumon’s town and full of its own mysteries just like the Lumon Industries office. The difference is that most of those mysteries were explained by the end of an episode, rather than spread across a season and designed with theory-crafting in mind. Cobel’s aunt Sissy, a devout Lumon follower, is still here, still praising a corporate founder who left her and everyone else in this town for dead while chastising her niece for her apparent desertion of Lumon. Cobel takes a moment to grieve her lost mother, who she didn’t get to see in her final days because she was away devoting her life and labor to the company that raised her as their work dog.</p><p>All of this culminates in the revelation that it was Cobel herself who created the Severance chip, not the Eagans who have historically taken credit for the technology at the center of the show’s entire mystery. She gave up her mind, body, and soul to this company, and all it led to was her becoming a pariah erased from its history books. As Cobel claims her old schematics and leaves her childhood home once more, she essentially receives a phone call from the A plot as the main characters ask her to betray Lumon and help them dig deeper into its mysteries. After everything Cobel’s been through, how could she possibly say no?</p><p>If someone says “Sweet Vitriol” didn’t move the plot forward, I’d say, “My brother in Christ, this <em>is</em> the plot of <em>Severance</em>.” It’s as if some viewers only understand the concept of unraveling a mystery if it’s in the form of new facts that can be made into weekly theory-crafting TikToks in which they can guess what’s coming next. In a series like <em>Severance</em>,<em> </em>whose entire lore is built upon the fraught relationships people have to things like labor, corporate exploitation, and of course trying to find ways to avoid the unpleasant things in life by bisecting your brain, worldbuilding is done on the backs of characters, not the other way around. “Sweet Vitriol” is a character piece, revealing nearly everything there is to know about one of the most enigmatic figures in a series full of them, and these insights into her aren’t just some intrusive side story detracting from what <em>Severance </em>is “really” about. If your starting point when watching an episode of <em>Severance </em>is “What is Lumon doing?” you should also be asking “What has Lumon done?” and you’re not going to find answers to that by hanging out with people whose lives, most days, are only eight hours long. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In the last few months, the concept of ‘everything being an Xbox’ has skyrocketed. Following a marketing campaign from Xbox that stressed just that notion, many have questioned the company’s future in the hardware market. It’s no big secret that Team Green has fallen behind PlayStation in recent years, and the goal to make Xbox an ecosystem without technical borders is front and centre.</p>



<p>One former executive – one of the most eccentric, by some accounts – has gone on record suggesting that Microsoft wouldn’t make consoles if the tech titan had the choice. In an ideal world, Microsoft would drop hardware and focus on delivering games to all kinds of devices.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-classic-netflix-model">‘The Classic Netflix Model’</h2>



<p>If you so desire, you can pick up an Xbox controller and play games <strong>right now </strong>without owning an Xbox console. That’s possible through Game Pass apps, cloud solutions, VR headsets… You name it. You no longer need to have an Xbox console in your home to be an Xbox fan.</p>



<p>That’s what Peter Moore, one of the most prolific former Xbox executives, said during a recent podcast appearance. He appeared on Danny Peña’s show to discuss console wars, the propagation of first-party games on other platforms, and Microsoft’s status in the console space.</p>



<p>When asked if Microsoft should keep going with hardware, Moore explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>If they had the choice, would they make hardware? No. Would they be delighted if they could be a multi-hundred-billion-dollar entity delivering content directly to your television or to whatever monitor you choose to play on? You bet.</p>



<p>It’s the classic Netflix model. No latency, no lag – you’re in, and there doesn’t need to be a box between you and your controller and the TV set. Still, consoles are – as we’ve seen particularly with Nintendo now… People love their hardware.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Thanks to <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/i-did-encourage-the-battle-playstation-vs-xbox-console-war-was-healthy-but-has-lost-its-feistiness-peter-moore-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VGC</a> for the initial quote.</p>



<p>In many ways, Microsoft is already leaning towards this future, but recently, rumours surfaced suggesting that developers <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-2026-xbox/">are already crafting games</a> for the next-generation Xbox platform. That rumour was tied to whatever Call of Duty game is coming in 2026, but as with all rumors like that, take it with a pinch of salt.</p>



<p>Do you think Microsoft should quit making consoles and focus on the software side of things? Let me know in the comments.</p>
