            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-casting-of-frank-stone-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Behaviour Interactive has announced its&nbsp;<em>The Casting of Frank Stone&nbsp;</em>release date, and the narrative-focused&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight&nbsp;</em>spinoff is set to arrive on PC and consoles this fall.</p>
<p>You can expect to get your hands on&nbsp;<em>The Casting of Frank Stone&nbsp;</em>on September 3rd, when it'll land on PC via both Steam and the Epic Games Store, as well as PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S.</p>
<p>Development on the game is being handled by none other than Supermassive Games, the studio behind narrative horror adventures like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/quarry">The Quarry</a>&nbsp;</em>and the&nbsp;<em>Man of Medan&nbsp;</em>series, as well as&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-casting-of-frank-stone-release-date-body.jpg?itok=lXPhv758 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-casting-of-frank-stone-release-date-body.jpg?itok=SCb0KPt8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Casting of Frank Stone&nbsp;</em>is a more story-focused&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight&nbsp;</em>spinoff launching in September.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Frank Stone&nbsp;</em>sees four budding filmmakers taking a trip to the town of Cedar Hills in order to shoot a horror movie known as&nbsp;<em>Murder Mill</em>, and as that name suggests, things don't quite go according to plan for them.</p>
<p>If you're a Supermassive Games fan, you'll probably know roughly what to expect from&nbsp;<em>The Casting of Frank Stone</em>; it'll feature a branching narrative in which your decisions have an impact on the direction the story takes, and it'll be pretty light on conventional "gameplay".</p>
<p>Set during the 1980s,&nbsp;<em>Frank Stone&nbsp;</em>looks like it's tailor-made for fans of both&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight&nbsp;</em>itself and&nbsp;<em>Stranger Things</em>, as well as the works of Stephen King (for such a recommendation must inevitably follow after a&nbsp;<em>Stranger Things&nbsp;</em>mention).</p>
<p>You can check out the release date trailer for&nbsp;<em>The Casting of Frank Stone&nbsp;</em>right here.</p>

<p>If you're of a mind, you can pre-order&nbsp;<em>The Casting of Frank Stone&nbsp;</em>via <a href="https://thecastingoffrankstone.com/pre-order/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the official&nbsp;website</a>, and if you do so, you'll gain access to the Plunderer's Instinct bonus, which helps to highlight collectibles in the game's world.</p>
<p><em>Frank Stone&nbsp;</em>is part of Behaviour Interactive's&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-by-daylight-crossovers-spinoffs">anniversary celebrations</a>; the studio is also celebrating the game's eighth birthday with&nbsp;<em>Castlevania&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons&nbsp;</em>crossovers, as well as a new game mode for&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight&nbsp;</em>itself.</p>
<p><em>The Casting of Frank Stone&nbsp;</em>launches on September 3rd across <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2223840/The_Casting_of_Frank_Stone/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/the-casting-of-frank-stone/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/the-casting-of-frank-stone/9pg0pmb5q0gt" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/07/16/the-casting-of-frank-stone-terrorizes-players-this-september<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p><a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/the-game-awards-2023/2023/12/07/the-casting-of-frank-stone-is-supermassives-single-player-horror">The Casting of Frank Stone</a>, Supermassive Games’ single-player narrative-driven horror game set in the Dead by Daylight universe, has a release date. This intriguing horror collaboration will arrive on September 3, and a new trailer provides a proper introduction of the main cast.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Developed by Supermassive (Until Dawn, The Quarry) and published by Dead by Daylight developer Behaviour Interactive, The Casting of Frank Stone stars five teenagers – Christine Gordon, Jaime Rivera, Linda Castle, Robert Green, and Bonnie Rivera – who film their own horror movie in an abandoned steel mill. Unfortunately, this mill has ties to a notorious murderer named Frank Stone, and the youth’s innocent art project goes horribly wrong.</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N6FODK6lwtM" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>We still don’t know much about the narrative other than that it is set within the world of Dead by Daylight and takes place in the town of Cedar Mills during the summer of 1980. Gameplay-wise, The Casting of Frank Stone follows a similar blueprint to Supermassive’s previous horror titles in that it’s a choice-driven adventure where characters can be permanently killed off based on your decisions. You can check out a recent gameplay trailer <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/05/14/dead-by-daylight-spin-off-the-casting-of-frank-stone-gets-chilling-gameplay-trailer">here</a> to see it in action.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Casting of Frank Stone is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.&nbsp;</p>

		<p>Activision has announced the dates for the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/call-of-duty-black-ops-6">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> beta, which will take place across two weekends in late August and early September.</p>
<p>The first weekend is for those who have pre-ordered the game across PlayStation, Xbox and PC – there’s no timed platform exclusivity anymore – as well as for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Game Pass</a> subscribers, and will take place from Friday 30th August until Wednesday 4th September.</p>


<p>Weekend two is then the open beta. Available for all and sundry across PlayStation, Xbox and PC, this runs from Friday 6th September to Monday 9th September.</p>
<p>The two weekends will come after the big info dump of Call of Duty: Next on 28th August, as Activision dive even deeper into what the next Call of Duty game will feature. The beta weekends will give players a chance to experience the new Omnimovement system, as well as other gameplay tweaks and changes to the COD formula, and feature a selection of the new maps that Treyarch have built. You’ll also have a limited ability to create your own loadouts, try out weapons, equipment and Perks, and sample several modes.</p>
<p>More details on what the beta will feature will be revealed in the next few weeks, and Activision have some rewards for participating.</p>

<p>Black Ops 6 leans into all of the usual tropes and expectations of Black Ops series, with double crossing subterfuge and more through the campaign, set in the 1990s after the end of the Cold War. George HW Bush is President, and there’s lies and more swirling around that you’ll dip your toes into.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/09/cod-black-ops-6-release-date-confirmed-for-october/">COD: Black Ops 6 is coming out on 25th October</a>, and will remain a cross-generation release across <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstaiton-5">PS5</a> and PS4, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a> and Xbox One, and PC. It will also launch straight into <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Xbox Game Pass</a>, though with the caveat that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/10/xbox-game-pass-gets-price-increases-drops-day-one-games-on-standard-tier/">Microsoft is shaking up the subscription service tiers</a> so you’ll need Game Pass Ultimate or PC Game Pass to get day one games.</p>

		<p>Gaijin Entertainment has confirmed that its War Thunder spin off Aces of Thunder will be available for PSVR 2 and PCVR later this year. Aces of Thunder is an aerial combat game in which players will be able to pilot over 20 different aircraft, taking part in aerial dogfights either in single player missions or online in squads.</p>
<p><iframe title="Aces of Thunder Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lp_VwoKNpC0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><em>“From the very beginning we focused mainly on VR-specific ergonomics and the immersive flight experience achievable with modern hardware. To reach these goals we have rewritten and optimized the VR-subsystem of the Dagor Engine (some of these improvements can be seen in War Thunder already, a game that uses the same engine)”</em>, said Vladimir Dranyonkov, game director of <em>Aces of Thunder</em>. <em>“We have re-evaluated our approaches to user interactions along with audio and visuals, so familiar from our previous experience with War Thunder. We also worked on addressing common comfort issues without harming the simulation aspect of aerial combat. This, we hope, will attract new pilots to our virtual skies.”</em></p>
<p>Aces of Thunder is set during World War Two with the missions spread out over Eastern Front, Western Europe and the Pacific Ocean. The planes players will be able pilot include the American P-51 Mustang, P-63 Kingcobra, the German Bf 109, Fw 190, the Soviet IL-2 attack aircraft, the British Spitfire fighter and the Japanese A6M3 Zero. Before heading into the skies, players can walk around the outside of the planes to take in the detail. Cockpits have been fully detailed too, to give that immersive feeling of being a fighter pilot.</p>

<p>Aces of Thunder is available to wishlist on both the <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10007306">PlayStation Store</a>, and on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2754090/Aces_of_Thunder/">Steam</a>. However, neither the price nor the release date have yet been confirmed.</p>

But why and how exactly did this happen?">Alpha Protocol is back! But why and how exactly did this happen?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The typical first reaction from people is, "Why </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Alpha Protocol</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">?" We're aware that when </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Alpha Protocol</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was released on May 28, 2010, it wasn't a perfect production. Obsidian Entertainment embarked on a very ambitious and extensive project, which, in many ways, can be considered revolutionary. Players received an espionage RPG with a highly elaborate storyline that drastically changes depending on their decisions. However, with such extensive projects, it often happens that ambitions begin to eat their own tail, and excessive growth of the game leads to difficulty in controlling it. That's why the developers weren't able to anticipate and eliminate all the bugs and problems that appeared after the launch. Nowadays, it's nothing extraordinary, as developers spend weeks, months, or even years fixing their productions. Titles that could be considered pulled from the depths of player disapproval include hits like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>No Man's Sky</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> or </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Diablo III</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">At GOG, we all believe that every game deserves a second chance, whether it was released a year or 20 years ago. One of our main goals, just like with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Alpha Protocol</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, is to revive titles that are not available in digital distribution and bring back as many of them as possible. Bringing all titles from the past might very well be an impossible task, but that's why our entire company was created. That's our reason to exist.</span></p><p>Images via SEGA.</p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="License to kill (a game)">License to kill (a game)</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One of the biggest challenges in bringing back classic games is sorting out their status and all the legal issues, which have become complicated over the years. In the case of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Alpha Protocol</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the biggest unknowns were the licenses for music tracks. We aim to bring to our users versions that are as close in content to the originals as possible, so we worked together with the brand owner, SEGA, to regain the rights to the tracks featured in the game. To sum up this part of the process, I can say that we were able to renew the rights to all the tracks. However, the process of resolving these issues is not always easy and smooth. Sometimes, it can drag on for months, as was the case with obtaining licenses for Star Trek games.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This is important because the content of the version currently available on GOG will remain unchanged. Such strategy aligns with our DRM-Free approach, which applies to all games in the store. The reason being that, along with the game in their library, players gain easy access to an offline installer that includes all the tracks and can remain on their drives for as long as necessary.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Bugs fixed after 14 years">Bugs fixed after 14 years</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Alpha Protocol</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, we had the comfort of working on the source code of version 1.0. It's worth noting that there was a later version, 1.1, containing some fixes, but our team didn't have access to it. Furthermore, we were eager to continue working on version 1.0 because it allowed us to add, among other things, support for achievements, a feature that had not been previously available in the PC version.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The game build we received from SEGA already included some fixes, but not all of them. For instance, we had to make sure we eliminated one of the serious bugs, which often prevented players from finishing one of the main quests. I mentioned earlier that we always strive to deliver to players a version that is as close to the original as possible, but where we see room for significant and important improvements, we always try to implement them. With </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Alpha Protocol</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, this includes adding achievements and making the game compatible with GOG GALAXY for cloud saving. We also added support for higher resolutions and optimized the default game settings to match the capabilities of modern computers.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The hardest part was to recreate the developer's environment that would allow us to recompile the game's code and add achievements/trophies. In order to achieve that, we created a period-correct machine that would ensure proper code compilation. Then, we tested some of the older Galaxy Software Development Kit (SDK) versions to see if they would work with the old compiler. They did! Then, we could move forward and implement the Xbox version of the code that handled achievements for the game. This was the most exciting part of the project for us, as we were able to do something no one had done before. We added a unique feature that no other PC version of the game has.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Of course, we have optimized the version available on GOG to run smoothly on PCs with Windows 10 and 11. Another important change is the addition of support for modern controllers such as DualSense, DualShock 4, Nintendo Switch Pro, Xbox Series, and Xbox One pads. I must admit that DualSense Edge surprised us, but we are currently working on ensuring seamless compatibility with this device as well. On top of that, we brought back official language versions that were not available in the digital release. This includes Polish, Czech, and Russian localizations.</span></p><p>Images via SEGA.</p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Shackles of DRM are thrown off">Shackles of DRM are thrown off</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The most important thing to us was removing DRM. This was particularly challenging because we didn't want to break the game itself. Fortunately, we have an experienced Reverse Engineer with 15 years of experience on board, who has often helped us out of trouble with much more complicated and convoluted projects. Considering the overall technical work, getting rid of DRM was indeed the most labor-intensive and time-consuming part of the entire process of bringing the game back.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To emphasize how important it is to us that the presence of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Alpha Protocol</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is never again compromised, we distributed 500 keys to our most engaged users.

We want to reassure you that we're doing everything we can to bring back to you as many games as possible.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/inside-the-response-to-college-football-25/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>To say the response to EA Sports College Football 25 has been positive would be an understatement. In less than 12 hours of being live for those with EA Play or the Deluxe Edition of the game, College Football 25 saw over 700,000 active users playing Monday night. That led to server issues that the studio was actively working on throughout to make sure everyone could play the game without concern. Though problems still remain, it is something that the engineers are continuing to work on as the game heads to a full release on July 19.</p>



<p>Aside from the server concerns with the game, there has been nothing but jubilation surrounding the game from those in and around the game’s development. In speaking with multiple sources close to the game, the response from players so far has been nothing short of mind blowing. </p>



<p>“We knew it would be strong, but this might be bigger than even I expected,” one source said. “It might surpass all of our expectations.”</p>



<p>“There was a feeling that we had something special based on the trailer views and interactions online, but the way it’s transitioned to actual sales and players has me lost for words,” another said.</p>



<p>Those expectations were to be in the mid-$100 million range in revenue. Based on early player numbers, the game should quickly surpass that number within months, if not weeks. Say only 500,000 of the 700,000+ of people playing Monday night had purchased the Deluxe Edition of College Football 25, that’s still roughly $50,000,000 in revenue before the game hits a full release. That obviously doesn’t include numbers for those who purchased the standard edition of the game or any microtransaction purchases from players. It also only includes those who own current-gen consoles as the game isn’t available on last-gen systems or PC. </p>



<p>“By this weekend we’ll know where things really stand, but we’re beyond happy,” Insider Gaming was told.</p>



<p>For the record, NCAA Football 14 sold roughly 1.5 million copies during the sales-tracking period (per <a href="https://www.vgchartz.com/game/231087/ncaa-football-14/?region=All" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VGChartz</a>). It should be expected that College Football 25 will hit that number, if not higher. </p>



<p>And it’s not just the game itself that is having success right away. Sources have told me under the condition the numbers not be made public right now that, over the last 24 hours, the sales numbers for the Xbox Series S have been as high, if not higher, than at any point aside from the console’s release window. As far as why it would be the Series S with such high numbers, it’s because it’s the most affordable console where College Football 25 is available. It’s unclear at this point how many Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5 systems were sold over the last 24 hours.</p>



<p>I’ve reached out directly to Xbox on what I’ve been told, but no response was received before publishing. Still, whether they respond or not, the numbers will have to make Microsoft happy.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-will-add-dynamic-splitscreen-new-evil-endings-dark-urge-fixes-and-lots-more-kissing.928626/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-will-add-dynamic-splitscreen-new-evil-endings-dark-urge-fixes-and-lots-more-kissing<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
The word "kiss" occurs 10 times in the latest blog post for the seventh major <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-class-list">Baldur's Gate 3</a> patch, while the word "bug" occurs 14 times. I think this ratio captures how BG3 updates at large walk the line between dealing with stuff like progression blockers, and sating the inexhaustible horniness of the fanbase. There's more to patch 7 than glitch-hunting and snogs, however. Due in September, it introduces dynamic splitscreen functionality, expansions for Honour mode, modding tools, new endings for evil playthroughs, and a brace of tweaks for Origin characters.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Let's start with the splitscreen stuff. Baldur's Gate 3 patch 7 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1086940/view/4240783699885624491">will introduce</a> dynamic split-screen merging when co-op players are close to each other, "because the power of friendship transcends all obstacles, including screen partitions". You can toggle this directly from the HUD or within the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>'s settings, in or out of combat. Adding to the intimacy, the patch allows for banter between characters assigned to different people in multiplayer, rather than it being limited to characters controlled by a single player.
</p>
<p>
As for Honour Mode, Patch 7 doles out Legendary Actions - that is, mode-exclusive special unique actions that become available in the right circumstances - to more creatures, "including the bulette, everyone's favourite neighbourhood surgeon, Malus Thorm, and githyanki Ch'r'ai Tska'an, Ch'r'ai Har'rak, and Ptaris". Ever the champion of the people, Larian have also given local hobgoblin Dror Ragzlin an Arachnid Compulsion ability that lets him sic a bunch of pit spiders on you.
</p>
<p>
As for the modding toolkit, this lets you fiddle with: items including weapons and armour; cosmetic stuff such as hair and textures; races, classes and subclasses, including variations on existing classes and their capacities;  the user interface and, most appetising of all, the dice you'll roll during those nail-biting skillchecks. You can read more in <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fbaldursgate3.game%2Fnews%2Fcommunity-update-27-official-modding-support_118">this official FAQ</a>. Larian are collaborating with specific mod authors to roadtest the tools ahead of the patch's September launch. The Steam blog has details of what they've done so far, together with a small landslide of notes about very specific fixes for Origin characters. Did you know, or mind overmuch, that Karlach used to brush the shaved part of her head during her idle animation at camp? Did that used to really wind you up? Well, it won't after September.
</p>
<p>
The new campaign endings, finally, apply to both Origin characters, such as the Dark Urge, and custom creations. "Each new cinematic is yours to discover through nefarious means," gloats the blog. The evil endings accompany various improvements and bug fixes for Dark Urge players in particular. For example, they've quashed the one where the rest of your party would look on blithely when you randomly murder a companion. Oh, "and Minthara will now respond accordingly if you've been stripped of Bhaal's influence." 
</p>
<p>
It's not all gravy: Dark Urgers may be displeased to know that you still can't kiss Gortash. It's been long enough since BG3 went 1.0 that I can't remember who Gortash is without checking a wiki, but I am unsurprised to hear that some players want to kiss him. Go on, show me a Baldur's Gate 3 character somebody doesn't want to kiss. I'll be back tomorrow and you'd best believe I will be Googling your answers, unless they horrify me, in which case let's forget this ever happened.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/talisman-5e-review-fast-paced-high-fantasy-adventures.928623/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/talisman-5e-review-fast-paced-high-fantasy-adventures<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Talisman </em>is one of those board games that has stood the test of time. Since it's release in the 1980s it has continued to make a name for itself and is just as relevant to the board game market with the release of <em>Talisman 5th Edition</em> this year. While being aware of <em>Talisman </em>this was my first time playing the game and as a fan of magic and quests I was delighted with what I got to experience.</p>
<p>If traditional high-fantasy adventures aren't for you but you're interested in <em>Talisman </em>you can check out our review of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/talisman-kingdom-hearts-review"><em>Talisman: Kingdom Hearts</em></a>.</p>
<p>In <em>Talisman </em>4-6 players get to take on the role of one of the twelve high-fantasy archetypes, travel the board facing monsters and becoming more powerful, and race to defeat the Elder Dragon and collect the Crown of Command. The premise sounds simple, and honestly it really is.</p>
<p>Opening the box for the first time you'll find the Gameboard, miniatures and characters cards for each of the 12 characters, three six-sided dice, a collection of different cards, tokens, gold coins, and counters representative of your characters strength, craft, and life values. After punching out all of the tokens each has a specific place to live inside the box and as always that's an incredibly satisfying feeling.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/talisman-review-open-box.jpg?itok=Tc6OnGMF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/talisman-review-open-box.jpg?itok=GWdASOwZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Talisman box has a space for every component to neatly fit</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Talisman 5th Edition</em> Gameplay</h2>
<p>Setting up the gameboard is as easy as making sure every card is shuffled into their own decks and that each player is set up with their characters starting items. All characters have starting values for their Strength, Craft, Life, Fate, and Gold. On top of that the character cards also clearly outline any special abilities your character has, as well as their default alignment.</p>
<p>In my first game I played as a Monk, this would allow me to add my starting Craft value to my Strength if engaging a physically attacking enemy. While believing this was a strategic play to start more powerful than the other players it was quickly clear how much the dice and cards can turn against you.</p>
<p>On your turn you roll the dice and move that number of spaces clockwise or counter clockwise around the board. Wherever you land you simply need to read the text on the space and follow the instructions to roll dice or draw a card from the adventure deck.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/talisman-review-starting-setup.jpg?itok=tFgfwdMw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/talisman-review-starting-setup.jpg?itok=8nQvEpwo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Players begin in their starting locations and the race to the Crown begins</figcaption></figure><p>The adventure deck is what will propel the encounters as well as how the board will change. At its most simple you might draw a creature, fight and kill it, and move on to the next turn. You can also draw cards that are equipment and followers that might bestow different positive (or negative effects) on you, or have a Stranger take up permanent residence on the board.</p>
<h2>Simple and Fast Paced</h2>
<p>After two or three rounds around the table the previously clean board was now filled with a ghost in the graveyard, a healer and a spell shop set up at neighboring fields, and one of the players had been cursed to only be able to move one space a turn.</p>
<p>It was incredibly impressive to me how quickly so many unique elements to our specific came immediately came into play, that's before you add the chaos of the players like our Ghoul realizing his best course of action was to try to attack other players as quickly as possible.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/talisman-review-character-card.jpg?itok=4IbGP5ij 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/talisman-review-character-card.jpg?itok=iw_dGHEI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A character can obtain equipment and followers to alter how they play</figcaption></figure><p>I was also impressed that with so much going on across the board the base gameplay loop was also so simple and easy to understand. We were getting through all six players turns in only a minute or two. This speed of play didn't just enhance the experience of keeping a momentum of game events, but it was also making sure that all players were engaged.</p>
<p>While many players were exploring the Outer and Inner rings on the game board one of our players had luck on his side, pulling items and followers that propelled his Craft stat to one where he was confident in his ability to fight the Chaos Dragon. This led to a strange point in the gameplay of <em>Talisman</em>.</p>
<h2><em>Talisman </em>Is A Race Until It Isn't</h2>
<p>As the player passed through the Mines, a skill check space verifying the height of your Craft skill, it felt very much like there was only one player truly in the race for the Crown of Command. There wasn't anything that anyone else at the table could do but play out their own turns while we waiting for him to make his way through the Inner Region.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/talisman-review-end-of-game-board_0.jpg?itok=8JNC_RNp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/talisman-review-end-of-game-board_0.jpg?itok=vyjzh0vP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Late game play sees Strangers at different map locations, cards discarded, and Fate Tokens spent</figcaption></figure><p>The player definitely deserved the victory, but it still felt a bit strange going about our turns waiting for the slight chance that one of the subsequent skill check spaces would hinder him.</p>
<p>Other times I played the game there were differences in the distance between those still circling the board and those heading to the Crown of Command, it just seems like it would be harder to orchestrate games that remain truly competitive throughout the whole experience.</p>
<p>While the core gameplay loop was simple and fast paced there were a number of slowdowns when needing to look up some complicated rules. There's a lot that the rulebook does very well, but there's also some important information that gets buried in text and difficult to find.</p>
<h2>Rules Need Some Work</h2>
<p>The first thing that the rulebook does that's helpful, <a href="https://www.talismanisland.com/resources/rules-downloads/">before you even open the booklet</a>, is to provide players with a QR code that leads to <a href="https://shop.hasbro.com/en-us/product/talisman-the-magical-quest-board-game-5-th-edition-fantasy-tabletop-adventure-games-12-plus/AA84B1F0-B14A-4209-94B5-21EF4C8B6A45#EnhancedPDPVideo">the store page and a ~9 minute video</a> that teaches you how to play the game.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/talisman-instructional-video.jpg?itok=v-QjFuE- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/talisman-instructional-video.jpg?itok=QzPXyXtx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This 9 minute video could save hours of prep time for new players</figcaption></figure><p>This video isn't extensive, opting to refer players to the booklet for certain processes or the minutia of individual spaces in the Inner Region, but as a 9 minute video you can send players ahead of time so everyone at least has a base knowledge of the game it's excellent.</p>
<p>As with any new board game I fight to get through teaching it succinctly, but with the video sent to my players we all sat down, could pick characters and go over some basic ground rules, and then get to player. It was a very pleasant experience to have a player ask a question that another could answer instead of having to be the keeper of all knowledge.</p>
<p>Those 'minutia' rules and experiences are mostly laid out clearly, but each section is layed out for you to be reading them in their entirety. If you're hunting for specific info though it can sometimes get lost in the text.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/talisman-review-monk-example.jpg?itok=BqxDas65 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/talisman-review-monk-example.jpg?itok=7uNCrSeN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>As a Monk you can't use weapons but you do get a buff to your Strength in combat</figcaption></figure><p>The first time I had a player cast a spell and we needed to verify if it stayed with the character or went into a discard it took time to locate the answer because on the two page spread of "Gaining and Casting Spells" it's the final bullet point on the second page.</p>
<p>Another rule that was lost, and that I even had difficulty locating again while was writing this review, is what you can do with Trophies. Obtaining Trophies is detailed within the section about defeating a monster, but if you want to know what they're used for you need to re-read the section about Enemy Adventure Cards. A simple bolded "Trophy" header somewhere in the mix would have been appreciated.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Talisman 5e </em>New Features<br>
If you've played <em>Talisman </em>before a lot will be the same but new things are denoted in the rulebook with a wheel icon. Some of these differences include changes to what happens when you die, how you can use Fate tokens to alter your movement, rewards for defeating a creature or player in battle, and how becoming a Toad functions</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While there was a fair bit of frustration about the rules these are obviously only pains that will be experienced on fresh plays. As I played the game a few more times, needing to reference the rules less and less, I just got to enjoy the speed and experience of playing <em>Talisman</em>.</p>
<h2><em>Talisman 5e </em>| Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Playing new games for the first time can sometimes be a bit of a rough experience, with each subsequent experience becoming smoother both as the person who teaches the game as well as a player. I was elated when sitting down to <em>Talisman </em>and it being a fun game from the very first diceroll.</p>
<p>The core engine of the game, rolling dice and moving around the board before heading towards the Elder Dragon, is incredibly simple to learn and repeat but features so many permutations every game gets a brand new energy.</p>
<p>Permutations begin as soon as players pick each of the twelve playable characters and possibilities continue to explode outward as Adventure Cards are revealed and the board comes to life.</p>
<p>Having never played <em>Talisman</em> before the look of it seemed intimidating, now that I've experienced it I can see it becoming a game that I frequently pull out for my experienced tabletop friends, as well as for family and new tabletop players.</p>

<p>Many players are looking forward to Omnimovement, a new feature in the upcoming Call of Duty title Black Ops 6. However, many have been confused about how this feature works for a few weeks, whether it can be turned off, and more. Activision has now come forward to clear the air about this feature through the official Call of Duty podcast, which you can see below.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-is-black-ops-6-omnimovement">What is Black Ops 6 Omnimovement?</h2>



<p>The official Call of Duty podcast was launched yesterday, and the first episode concentrated on providing details on the new Omnimovement feature. Stephanie, the Senior Director of Studio Communications, first addressed the feature, talking about how players can sprint, slide, dive, and supine in any direction they want.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Stephanie then talks about how players shouldn’t just be excited about being able to move in any direction but also chain specific movements through the Omnimovement feature and create their manoeuvres.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here’s the full video:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="COD POD Episode 1 | The Official Call of Duty Podcast" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KMFDkQ_5m1U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>We then had Treyarch’s associate director of design, Matt Ronson, explain Black Ops 6’s Omnimovement and provide much-needed clarity on the feature. Ronson first discussed the feature’s development process before discussing how it can be used in gameplay.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Omnimovement will be great for those cinematic shots that players always look forward to, but this time, they will create these themselves. They can run head-first into action, dive in through a window, and then rotate to shoot the enemies while falling, creating a sense of action movies in your gameplay.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We will also see this movement in action during Corner Slicing when a player goes around a corner or doorway. In these situations, the player’s view and weapon will rotate dynamically according to the speed and entry angle.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-omnimovement-cannot-be-turned-off">Omnimovement ‘Cannot Be Turned Off’</h2>



<p>Ronson then answered the burning question of whether there is a toggle for Omnimovement in Black Ops 6. The short answer is no, as it is a “core foundational mechanic” of the game and cannot be turned off. However, the ‘Intelligent Movement’ feature can be turned on or off.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Intelligent Movement is “a suite of player settings” focused on reducing button presses. It is similar to an auto-sprint or an auto-mantle but explicitly designed to work with Black Ops 6’s Omnimovement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These changes seem exciting, and players can form their own opinions once the Black Ops 6 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-beta-dates-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Open Beta kicks off in September</a>. Also, Matthew ‘FormaL’ Piper recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/formal-return-to-cod-black-ops-cod/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">teased his return to Call of Duty</a> with Black Ops 6. </p>



<p>What do you think about Omnimovement? Let us know in the comments. &nbsp;</p>

                <p>The next big Baldur's Gate 3 patch is arriving in September. With it comes a big quality-of-life change for split-screen play, extended evil endings, the game's modding toolkit, and a number of bug fixes. You can even register on the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1086940/Baldurs_Gate_3/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam page</a> to try out the patch ahead of time.</p><p>The patch will add an option for split-screen co-op where the split-screen will merge if both characters are in the same area. This will perhaps save you some visual headaches and confusion in battle sequences or elsewhere. You can toggle the option directly in the main HUD or within the game settings.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Why Baldur's Gate 3 Is GameSpot's Game Of The Year 2023</p>
      </div>
<p>As <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-patch-adds-even-more-evil-endings/1100-6522767/" data-ref-id="1100-6522767">previously teased</a>, the patch will add some extensive evil-ending cinematics, including new ones for Origin Characters and The Dark Urge. The new teaser GIFs show the player-character lounging lazily, surrounded by corpses and levitating above an army which stomps their spears in unison. The Honour Mode difficulty will also see some improvements. More creatures will get legendary actions, making a number of the game's bosses and encounters even more fiendish.</p><p>The same patch will also see the release of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-is-getting-an-official-modding-toolkit-in-upcoming-patch-7/1100-6523885/" data-ref-id="1100-6523885">the game's modding toolkit</a>. Larian claims the toolkit will help modders do everything they want to make new content for the game including new items, cosmetics, class/subclasses, races, and quality-of-life and UI improvements.</p><p>Finally, the patch will introduce a number of fixes to Dark Urge and Origin character playthroughs, some of which are cosmetic, alongside repairs to unactivated triggers and even kissing-related fixes.</p><p>You can read more details about the upcoming patch in Larian's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1086940/view/4240783699885624491" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>. The post also teases additions that may be coming to future patches, including cross-play and a photo mode.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/valorant-escalation-mode-disabled-indefinitely-as-patch-9-01-lands.928581/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/valorant-escalation-mode-disabled<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Riot Games has announced that it has indefinitely disabled the&nbsp;<em>Valorant&nbsp;</em>Escalation gameplay mode while it investigates "an issue".&nbsp;</p>
<p>Speaking <a href="https://x.com/VALORANT/status/1812940198076162373" rel="noopener" target="_blank">via X</a> (formerly known as Twitter), Riot says Escalation won't be available across any of the platforms on which&nbsp;<em>Valorant&nbsp;</em>is playable while the studio investigates this "issue". It doesn't provide any further information regarding what the issue might be.</p>
<p>Riot also says that Escalation will be back in Patch 9.03, but we're not sure when that will be landing either. Judging by the timing of previous&nbsp;<em>Valorant&nbsp;</em>updates, you can expect to wait around a month for it, so it looks like Escalation won't be back until at least mid-August.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/valorant-escalation-disabled-lotus-console.jpg?itok=eTN65j5m 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/valorant-escalation-disabled-lotus-console.jpg?itok=eKD8VrdE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Valorant&nbsp;</em>players on console are getting the Lotus map with the game's latest update.</figcaption></figure><p>Given that Riot hasn't provided any further details, it looks like we'll just have to wait and see what the issue was that caused Escalation to be disabled.</p>
<p>In the meantime, you can pore over the <a href="https://playvalorant.com/en-us/news/game-updates/valorant-patch-notes-901/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">patch notes for Patch 9.01</a>, which was released earlier today. This being a relatively incremental patch, there aren't many earth-shattering changes, but there are plenty of bug fixes and balance adjustments.</p>
<p>Console players, for instance, can now play on <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/valorant">the Lotus map</a> across the game's Unrated, Competitive, Swift Play, and Deathmatch modes (although Deathmatch has also been temporarily disabled on consoles, owing once again to "an issue").</p>
<p>Other minor changes include an updated Outlaw animation that makes it "more apparent when the weapon is ready to be fired", as well as tons of bug fixes and small Agent changes.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/valorant-escalation-disabled-neon.jpg?itok=duoRjXfX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/valorant-escalation-disabled-neon.jpg?itok=KaaGr7Bi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Neon is just one of the Agents to get some changes in&nbsp;<em>Valorant&nbsp;</em>Patch 9.01.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Valorant</em>, it's a free-to-play hero shooter that blends the character-based abilities of&nbsp;<em>Overwatch&nbsp;</em>with the objective-focused gameplay of&nbsp;<em>Counter-Strike</em>.</p>
<p>The game features a number of Agents, each of which has different abilities to help them triumph over their opponents. Gameplay takes place across a number of labyrinthine maps with lots of winding corridors and opportunities to ambush your enemies.</p>
<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Valorant&nbsp;</em>for free right now on <a href="https://playvalorant.com/en-gb/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S</a>.

            <p>
Xbox has revealed a whole flock of games arriving on Game Pass this month on day one of release.
</p>
<p>
That includes Capcom's Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess, Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn, and Dungeons of Hinterberg, as well as todays' release of Flock.
</p>
<p>
These join the likes of Journey to the Savage Planet, The Case of the Golden Idol, and Neon White that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-game-pass-lineup-for-july-2024-announced">arrived earlier this month</a>.
</p>
<p>
The full list of Xbox Game Pass additions still to come in July are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Magical Delicacy (Cloud, Console, and PC) - out today</li>
<li>Flock (Cloud, Console, and PC) - out today</li>

Flock is the latest from Hohokum creator Richard Hogg. "It's a game about wildlife and it's a game about collecting stuff," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/flock-review-the-art-of-noticing">Flock review</a>. "But it's also, serving as bedrock for all of that other stuff, a game about noticing. Its world is there to reveal itself to you, but only when you're ready. Only when you're in sync, only when you're properly attuned."
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dungeons-of-hinterberg-is-about-a-holiday-which-is-why-everything-feels-so-important">Dungeons of Hinterberg</a> is a hotly-anticipated indie about dungeon crawling in the Austrian alps, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/capcoms-kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-gets-release-date">Kunitsu-Gami</a> is an action tower defence game steeped in Japanese folklore. Both look absolutely worthy of your time.
</p>
<p>
The following games will also be leaving Game Pass on 31st July:
</p>
<ul>
<li>A Short Hike (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Train Sim World 4 (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Venba (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
</ul>

<p>
Xbox Game Pass is soon to undergo a big change, which will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-confirms-big-changes-for-xbox-game-pass-ditching-day-one-releases-for-basic-tier">ditch day one releases for its basic tier</a> and instead save them for Game Pass Ultimate.

Then, Criston Cole arrives back in King’s Landing parading the corpse of Meleys. This display disgusts the smallfolk who see the dead dragon as a dark omen. They realize the Gods of the sky are “just meat,” a thing they are grossly lacking due to the blockade.<br></p><p>King Aegon’s injured body is tended by the maesters, and the worst two minutes of medieval medicine ASMR ever ensues. Aemond looks on from the foot of Aegon’s bed, satisfied with himself. The Kinslayer may be upgraded to Kingslayer, to Alicent’s absolute horror.<br></p><p>The Team Black Council is up to their usual bickering. Yet, this episode focuses on how Ser Alfred dismisses Rhaenyra’s ideas and viewpoints due to her being a member of “the gentler sex.” The Team Black Council may bend the knee to the Queen, but they will not let go of the patriarchy.</p><p>Daemond’s drug-fueled gap year in Harrenhal continues. He mediates between the Blackwoods and the Brackens through sinister plots. The Brackens won’t bend the knee alongside the Blackwoods so Daemon suggests that Ser Ben Blackwood take other “persuasive” measures to get them to heel.</p><p>Rhaena arrives in the Eyrie and becomes Lady Jeyn Arryn’s ward. However, Lady Jeyn does not feel protected by the mere dragon eggs sent. While Rhaenyra lacks allies in her male council, Mysaria reminds Rhaenyra of the biggest asset in the war: the smallfolk. Since Otto Hightower lost his position on Team Green, there has not been any challenger to stoke the propaganda war. “To the discontented, rumors are feed,” Mysaria advises. Rhaenyra’s maid, Elinda, is sent to King’s Landing to start the gossip.</p><p>Alys Rivers has been augmenting Daemon’s reality in Harrenhal. She also has been reading Freud because, in this episode’s most WTF scene, Daemon dreams of bedding a silver-haired woman revealed to be his dead mother. Later on, he hears distant cries and screams of the innocent. Despite Daemon’s insecurities and anxieties being exploited by Rivers, he becomes more reckless and publicly vies for the throne.</p><p>The Green Council reports that Aegon is alive but cannot rule in a coma. Alicent offers to return to her role as regent to the King, but the men in the room reject it. Alicent’s only allies, Larys and Cole, agree that a woman should not rule and Aemond fits better. The camera zooms in slowly on Alicent as she sits, fuming at being dismissed and fearing her violent son at the head of the table. This shot is begging for a <em>Kill Bill</em> fan edit.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="fa32e2222f44cb34c4ffe3efb4e25c00" data-recommend-id="image://fa32e2222f44cb34c4ffe3efb4e25c00" data-format="jpg" data-width="1583" data-height="886" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A crowd jostles in a scene from House of the Dragon S2 Episode 5" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A crowd jostles in a scene from House of the Dragon S2 Episode 5" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ollie Upton / HBO</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fa32e2222f44cb34c4ffe3efb4e25c00" data-recommend-id="image://fa32e2222f44cb34c4ffe3efb4e25c00" data-format="jpg" data-width="1583" data-height="886" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A crowd jostles in a scene from House of the Dragon S2 Episode 5" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>We get a continuation of the blacksmith family storyline from Episode 2. The daughter is sick and the wife wants to flee King’s Landing. There is no food and the blacksmith is still waiting for King Aegon to fulfill his union demands. However, when they try to escape, King’s Landing is barricaded. The restless crowd cries and chants “meat.”<br></p><p>Cole’s strategy may have lost him the smallfolk but his strategies have all changed since seeing dragons battle. There is no choice but to succumb to the mighty beasts, and Aemond will keep the battles coming.<br></p><p>Jace meets with the Freys and strikes a deal; The Freys will inherit Harrenhal if they bend the knee for Rhaenyra. This is the worst real estate deal ever because Harrenhal barely functions.</p><p>Rhaena tells Lord Corlys that Rhaenyra wants him to be the Queen’s Hand and gives a beautiful speech about supporting Rhaenyra’s ascent to the throne. Rhaena knows her role enough to reject being the Driftmark heir. She is of blood and fire.</p><p>Rhaenyra gets the annoying Ser Alfred off her back and sends him to bring her husband back from his nightmare vacation. Daemon’s crimes against humanity strategy fails as the Brackens and Blackwoods get him out of bed to bicker with each other in his presence. Finally, the Brackens and the Blackwoods agree on one thing: they will not fight one another under the same Team Black banner. </p><p>Aemond contently sits on the Iron Throne for the first time. Our prophetic Queen Halaena chillingly asks him if the seat was “worth the price.” We’ll have to see what her comment will yield in Aemond’s future.<br></p><p>The episode ends with Jace and Rhaenyra devising a strategy to strengthen their army. Team Black is blessed with dragons but short on Dragonriders. Jace suggests going down the Targaryen bloodline in other houses to find riders.</p><p>This week Alicent has lost power while Rhaenrya took her power. But how will that play when Daemon comes back? It begs the question: Has Daemon’s time in Harrenhal been a boring waste (as some fans feel) or is it subduing Team Black’s biggest liability thanks to the witch? Or are we just building to the Daemon v Aemond fight that those characters want so badly?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>According to a variety of reports, renowned animation and VFX team Axis Studios is officially going into administration, affecting 162 employees.</p>



<p>Axis Studios contributed animation and VFX work for a range of media such as gaming, film, television, and more. The large team offered many jobs in Scotland. </p>



<p>Gaming fans will recognize Axis Studios for its iconic work on various trailers and cinematics. Some of the IP that Axis Studios worked on included Dead Island, Destiny, Halo, League of Legends, and more. Recent work includes the outstanding footage for Destiny 2 Lightfall.</p>



<p>Axis Studios’ cinematic trailer for Dead Island 2 impressed many fans and built a lot of hype in 2019.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Dead Island 2" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WKsSnEawsNo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>In a new report <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cv2gvqlezn1o" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by the BBC</a>, administrators Interpath Advisory “confirmed 162 members of staff have lost their jobs immediately, with four people being retained to help wind up the business.” </p>



<p>Alistair McAlinden of Interpath Advisory reportedly explained that “Axis has more recently been impacted by a decline in customer projects.” They also cited “increases in labour costs which have resulted in severe cash flow problems.”</p>



<p>Joint administrator Geoff Jacobs also mentioned plans to “give employees support.” They also invited parties interested in the studio’s live projects to reach out.</p>



<p>At this time, the Axis Studios website is no longer operating as it goes into administration. The studio was founded over two decades ago, in 2000.</p>

<p>Last year, with the launch of the iPhone 15, Apple announced that a slew of AAA games would be heading to the top-tier models of the next-generation phone – and the top model of the latest iPad. To that end, games like Assassin’s Creed Mirage, Death Stranding, and Resident Evil Village were all lined up to be delivered to Apple fans worldwide, but almost every game to be released on the platform has fallen flat on its face.</p>



<p>The latest estimates suggest that Resident Evil 7, the latest release on iOS, has secured fewer than 2,000 sales, netting Capcom a measly $28,140.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-small-fry">Small Fry</h2>



<p>It’s to be expected, right?</p>



<p>While mobile gaming is the most lucrative market in the wider industry, AAA games coming to the iPhone 15 Pro (and similar models) will attract few sales based on how niche that audience is. Even so, Resident Evil 7 securing just 2,000 sales (which is a generous estimate <a href="https://mobilegamer.biz/under-2000-people-have-paid-to-play-resident-evil-7-on-ios-estimates-say/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">according to MobileGamer.biz</a>) is pretty miserable. </p>



<p>It was further estimated that around 83,000 downloads of Resident Evil 7 have taken place on iOS, but the vast majority of those downloads – which give access to a demo of the game – aren’t converting into full sales.</p>



<p>Last month, figures emerged suggesting that every other game released on the super-powered iOS-backed devices has floundered. Assassin’s Creed Mirage had racked up fewer than 3,000 sales after several weeks on the market, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ios-games-sales-bombing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">despite being downloaded around 123,000 times</a>. It was a worse story with Resident Evil 4 – that zombie-slaying title was downloaded 350,000 times but fewer than 7,000 full sales were estimated.</p>



<p>Ultimately, they’re ports, they’re not perfect, and they still boast premium price tags. You’ll be hard-pressed to find people willing to pay $49.99 to play a seven-year-old Resident Evil game on a phone.</p>
