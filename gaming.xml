It gives the cities in those PS2-era games so much character and makes them feel like lived-in places filled with real people and all their junk. But all that flying trash disappeared in 2004's massive <em>GTA</em>: <em>San Andreas.</em> So what happened? Turns out, not everyone <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gta-6-vice-city-rockstar-developer-blog-secrets-1851044987&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-vice-city-rockstar-developer-blog-secrets-1851044987">developing the 3D-era <em>GTA </em>games</a></span> liked all that trash flying around. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/ObbeVermeij/status/1823703886407901506&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/ObbeVermeij/status/1823703886407901506" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In an August 14 tweet from Obbe Vermeij</a></span>, a former Rockstar North dev, the creator explained that the digital streets in <em>GTA 3</em> looked “too clean” so he “added litter.” </p><p>“[Trash in <em>GTA 3 </em>is just a] single rectangle that occasionally moves with the wind. It can also be dragged along by passing cars. The artists created four textures for it. Two newspapers and two leaves,” explained Vermeij.<br></p><p>This same system was used in <em>Vice City</em>, but with a small change. After players completed <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/wU0YaRA4F9k&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/wU0YaRA4F9k" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a specific mission</a></span>, which saw them drop flyers from a plane, one of the four textures was replaced with those flyers. This was a detail I always noticed as a young lad and something I loved about <em>Vice City.</em><br></p><p>And if you wondered why trash would sometimes phase through the ground in <em>GTA 3 </em>and <em>Vice City</em>, it’s because of how the debris detects the height of the ground while it moves around. It only checks where the ground is when it lands, so it can sometimes slip through the map during animations. </p><h2 id="h7353"><a id=""></a>Why <em>GTA 3</em>'s trash is in <em>Manhunt </em>but not <em>San Andreas</em></h2><p>When <em>San Andreas</em> was released in 2004, I remember being a little disappointed that all the trash from <em>GTA 3</em> and <em>Vice City </em>was missing. Sure, all the other cool new stuff in Rockstar’s open-world sequel was great, but I did wonder where the trash went. At the time, I thought perhaps moving paper was too much for the game to handle with everything else going on. Turns out it was just because some devs didn’t like all the debris flying around. </p><p>“Not everyone on the team liked the litter. I removed it for <em>San Andreas</em> because I eventually lost the argument,” posted Vermeij. </p><p>However, the trash appeared in <em>Manhunt</em>, a stealth game focused on murder which was also developed by Rockstar North and released the year prior to S<em>an Andreas</em>. So how did that happen? According to Vermeij, it’s because some <em>GTA </em>devs helped out during the “last months of <em>Manhunt’s </em>development.” And he took the time to add back in the “litter code” from <em>GTA 3. </em><br></p><p>Who knew a few pieces of trash blowing in the wind could be so interesting?

<p>Dr Disrespect is still playing cryptic games on social media and has been posting more images that nobody can decipher. It’s widely assumed he’s shaping up to make a grand return to streaming, but the question is, how well will he be received?</p>



<p>In the latest chapter in this sordid saga, Dr Disrespect has deleted the post on social media that he published admitting to his wrongdoing that got him banned from Twitch in 2020. This was the post that clearly stated he did inappropriately message a minor in 2017. </p>



<p>Nobody knows why he has deleted this post, but everyone has a theory.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-dr-deletion">Dr Deletion</h2>



<p>Dr Disrespect has been absent from the internet almost entirely since the news surfaced that he’d messaged a minor on Twitch seven years ago. He announced he would be taking a break from streaming as he headed off on an extended vacation, and since then, all he has posted are some mysterious and puzzling images on X.</p>



<p>Since the revelations about Dr Disrespect were made public, the charismatic and controversial streamer lost almost all of his sponsorships and was cut from Midnight Society, the studio that he helped found. He also haemorrhaged followers, losing tens of thousands in the space of a few days.</p>



<p>Despite Dr Disrespect saying he ‘takes responsibility’ for his actions, he has gone and deleted the post on social media that made clear the events from his perspective. It means little, though – the sheer number of places where his message was repeated is endless, and he’ll never escape what he did.</p>

                <p>As you get better at farming in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/stardew-valley/" data-ref-id="5000-168503">Stardew Valley</a>, you will start to unlock different sprinklers. Sprinklers allow you to save time and energy everyday by watering your crops for you, with the trade off being that you have to build your fields around the sprinklers. Each tier of sprinkler offers a different coverage area.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How to craft each sprinkler</h2><p dir="ltr">There are three types of sprinklers in Stardew Valley: sprinkler, quality sprinkler, and iridium sprinkler. The base sprinkler is unlocked at farming level 2 and requires 1 copper bar and 1 iron bar to craft. The quality sprinkler unlocks at farming level 6 and requires 1 iron bar, 1 gold bar, and 1 refined quartz to craft. Refined quartz can be made by putting either quartz or lava quartz into a furnace with a piece of coal.</p><p dir="ltr">The iridium sprinkler unlocks at farming level 9 and requires 1 gold bar, 1 iridium bar, and 1 battery pack. Battery packs are obtained from lightning rods, which can be crafted at foraging level 6. During a storm, lightning will activate the lightning rod and create a battery pack.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Sprinkler layouts</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4337303-sprinklerssetup.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4337303" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4337303-sprinklerssetup.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4337303"></a><figcaption>From left to right is the correct layout for the sprinkler, quality sprinkler, and iridium sprinkler.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4337303-sprinklerssetup.jpg"></figure><p>Each sprinkler has a specific layout, based on the number of tiles it can water. As seen in the picture above, the basic sprinkler covers four squares, to the left, right, top, and bottom of the sprinkler. The quality sprinkler covers eight squares, in a circle around the sprinkler.</p><p dir="ltr">The iridium sprinkler covers 24 spaces, in a 5x5 square, with the center space lost to the sprinkler itself. Late into Stardew Valley, you can also acquire sprinkler upgrades, including one that slightly boosts the range of the sprinklers.</p>

A seemingly simple tweak to flame effects and damage mechanics made it much harder for the weapon to melt through the alien bugs’ tough outer armor. Though frustrating on its own, the nerf ended up sparking a much bigger debate over how to balance a PVE-only game and why development teams so often feel like the fun police. </p><p>The studio now says that while it can’t necessarily walk back last week’s flamethrower changes without breaking other things in the game, it’s heard the feedback and charting a different course, including a 60-day revamp of some underlying glitches and performance issues on PC. “In short, we didn’t hit our target with the latest update,” game director Mikael Eriksson <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1erc9w5/the_message_to_the_community_from_our_game/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1erc9w5/the_message_to_the_community_from_our_game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote in a recent Reddit post</a></span>. “Some things we just didn’t get right - and other more fundamental inconsistencies in our approach to game balance and game direction.”</p><p>He continued by listing the studio’s goals for the next two months:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Our aim within the next 60 days:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Continue to re-examine our approach to balance. Our intention is that balance should be fun, not “balanced” for the sake of balance.</li><li>Update how the fire damage mechanic works to tweak how the flamethrower serves as a close range support weapon. (A quick straight revert won’t work, as it would break other things)</li><li>Rework gameplay to prevent excessive ragdolling</li><li>Re-think our design approach to primary weapons and create a plan for making combat more engaging </li><li>Re-prioritize bug fixes so that the more immediate gameplay-impacting bugs are prioritized.</li><li>Improve game performance (frame rate is a focus)</li><li>Rework Chargers </li></ul><p>Additionally, from a bigger picture perspective we will be:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Exploring creation of an opt-in beta-test environment to improve our testing processes and we consider this a high-priority.</li><li>Post regular player surveys to gather more insights and feedback from the community.</li><li>Improve our process for patch/release notes - providing more context and reasoning behind changes.</li><li>More blog posts and streams where we expand on these topics for those interested.</li></ul></blockquote><p>The big takeaway here is that Arrowhead is going to prioritize “fun” over “balance” more going forward. That’s harder than it sounds, since a big part of the fun of <em>Helldivers 2 </em>is feeling like you’re just barely scraping by in an impossible situation, or sometimes even getting completely destroyed and feeling inspired by that. While that doesn’t mean some situations can’t feel frustrating or cheap, the solution isn’t simply a matter of making players stronger and leaning more into an OP power fantasy. Maybe that’s why this isn’t the first time Arrowhead <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-dark-fluid-mission-fix-arrowhead-1851512049&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-dark-fluid-mission-fix-arrowhead-1851512049">has struggled with this post-launch tightrope walk</a></span>. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-six-months-later-arrowhead-1851617332&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-six-months-later-arrowhead-1851617332">But after six months out in the wild</a></span>, it also seems like a smart time for <em>Helldivers 2</em> to slow down the pace of its changes as the devs take stock of where the game is at and how to continue growing it together with the community that remains after the initial boom of players has quieted down a bit. And some of those players aren’t satisfied with Eriksson’s mea culpa and are waiting for more durable proof of a new direction for <em>Helldivers 2</em>. </p><p>“Nice words but this is easily the second if not third ‘ooops we made a booboo and we’ll talk and change’ community address,” wrote one player by the name of ExcelsAtMediocrity. “If you guys have a vision and want to keep the core 5000 players that’s fine and your prerogative but you need to decide what direction it’s going and clearly communicate it and then do it consistently.” </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Night Shyamalan’s latest movie, <em>Trap</em>, takes place mostly during a pop star’s concert, which is certainly a unique gimmick. The throngs of screaming girls, booming music, and shuffling crowds create a tense and frustrating atmosphere as Josh Hartnett’s character (a father who is secretly a serial killer) tries to evade the police who are monitoring the event and find a way to escape. While Shyamalan’s films often require a suspension of disbelief (why do the aliens in <em>Signs </em>whose weakness is water invade a planet that is covered in it?), <em>Trap </em>introduces us to a truly bizarre concert that would never exist in real life.<br></p><p>Ironically, M. Night Shyamalan prides himself on the music event’s authenticity, telling <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://ew.com/m-night-shyamalan-and-daughter-talk-the-concert-of-trap-8689657&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://ew.com/m-night-shyamalan-and-daughter-talk-the-concert-of-trap-8689657" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Entertainment Weekl</em>y</a></span>, “We did make a real concert, and that was part of the joy of it and the complexity. Behind Josh, there’s a real concert going on, and the extras are reacting to that. It took months and months to think about that, with Saleka [his real-life daughter who plays singer Lady Raven] and I analyzing who this woman is and how she would put on a show.” </p><p>But for all this meticulous planning, the final portrayal of this very public and chaotic setting feels nothing like a real-life concert. Usually we can chalk it up to Hollywood contrivances and just have fun and go along for the ride, but so much of <em>Trap </em>relies on this concept that’s difficult to buy into. This list breaks down all the strange parts of Lady Raven’s concert that left us scratching our heads.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="2b2a84a1cdbad24f5c32119a8abbb1f3" data-recommend-id="image://2b2a84a1cdbad24f5c32119a8abbb1f3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Trap concert venue as seen from the parking lot.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Parking at a concert is normally a lengthy ordeal where you have to navigate a maze of occupied spots to find one for yourself. Often, there’s lots of people tailgating or searching for spots. Once you do find one, it’s usually far away from the venue and you have to remember a marker to locate it after the show when the entire audience is also exiting. Many fans even leave early to avoid the post-concert crowd surge. In <em>Trap</em>, Cooper and his daughter just smoothly pull up to an empty spot that is relatively close to the arena. Obviously M. Night Shyamalan wouldn’t want to waste valuable screen time on the nuances of parking, but a longer walk to the arena could’ve been another opportunity for Cooper to notice the heightened security.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d53047ae8a7bfb0d04a24f91233becbf" data-recommend-id="image://d53047ae8a7bfb0d04a24f91233becbf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Dozens of police officers stand outside the concert.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>When Cooper and his daughter Riley arrive, the doors are already open. The line is rather chill and moves quickly, with no fussing over bag sizes or stopping to go through metal detectors. Cooper and Riley even manage to see Lady Raven arrive with her tour bus, despite it being so close to showtime. Does Lady Raven not do sound checks?<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c8505feb29bb7d3f0c4f33eb52fe9f8a" data-recommend-id="image://c8505feb29bb7d3f0c4f33eb52fe9f8a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Trap's &quot;happy&quot; family stands together.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Broadway shows and movie theaters have matinees, but not huge arena concerts. Not only would the clean-up and set-up in between be a logistical nightmare, but the tailgating, line-waiting, and other concert rituals would be rushed and impossible to execute. There’s an offhanded explanation that Lady Raven decided to add another concert in Philadelphia after the first one sold out, but second shows are almost always scheduled for a different night. Maybe M. Night Shyamalan wanted to use the day-to-night transition to symbolize the two halves of Cooper’s lives meeting in the middle. But it would have been equally cool (and made more sense) to have the concert occur at night, with the tense events at Cooper’s home bleeding into the next day.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="4cbc0592beaa2ba6711e45128e650cbf" data-recommend-id="image://4cbc0592beaa2ba6711e45128e650cbf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Josh Hartnett snacks at his seat at the concert." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Josh Hartnett snacks at his seat at the concert." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warner Bros.</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4cbc0592beaa2ba6711e45128e650cbf" data-recommend-id="image://4cbc0592beaa2ba6711e45128e650cbf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Josh Hartnett snacks at his seat at the concert." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It’s not unusual for a concert to have an intermission. Even the Eras Tour, which is three hours and goes through Taylor Swift’s entire discography, has brief pauses marked by on-screen interludes. But the intermissions in Lady Raven’s concert are so long that fans can meander through the concourse multiple times. This makes me wonder just how robust Lady Raven’s catalog is. How early did she have to start this concert if she’s taking so many breaks? When is the next concert supposed to start?<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f2f068a5e81214c824b9c8784e30c42a" data-recommend-id="image://f2f068a5e81214c824b9c8784e30c42a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Josh Hartnett looks up as concertgoers hold their phones with flashlights lit." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Josh Hartnett looks up as concertgoers hold their phones with flashlights lit." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warner Bros.</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f2f068a5e81214c824b9c8784e30c42a" data-recommend-id="image://f2f068a5e81214c824b9c8784e30c42a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Josh Hartnett looks up as concertgoers hold their phones with flashlights lit." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>So often the concert feels like a backdrop for the fans to do other things. We see them wandering the arena, buying snacks, and purchasing merchandise. Of course, this isn’t out of the ordinary, but the fact that so many concertgoers are doing this in the middle of the headliner’s set is weird. Even Riley, who is obsessed with Lady Raven, sometimes seems more focused on getting snacks than on watching the show. (No hate on snacks, but personally, when I see my favorite musician, my eyes are glued to them.)<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="77a0bf71fab48e36d609a8a83edcabbc" data-recommend-id="image://77a0bf71fab48e36d609a8a83edcabbc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Josh Hartnett and Ariel Donahue look off-camera.

At concerts, a musician’s inner circle is usually behind some sort of barrier, making it difficult to strike up a conversation, let alone convince them that you should be the one to go on stage.

Typically, famous musicians have bodyguards or entourage members with them for public events, but especially for impromptu private meetings with fans at their homes.<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Dead Island 2 has been on the market since April 2023, and Dambuster Studios is still hard at work introducing new content to the zombie-slaying platform. Last year, the game was released to a solid reception after being in development for more than a decade, and it quickly became one of my all-time favourite open-world zombie-themed games.</p>



<p>On October 22, Dead Island 2 will get the ‘Patch 6’ update, which will introduce New Game Plus and a brand-new horde mode called Neighbourhood Watch.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-long-time-coming">Long Time Coming</h2>



<p>Last year, we <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dead-island-2-neighborhood-watch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported exclusively on Neighborhood Watch</a>, the all-new experience that’s finally arriving in October of this year. Per our report, this new mode will see players clear out a neighbourhood and defend a safe house against waves of enemies. It’ll take place over a five-day loop, during which a ‘setup phase’ will unravel before the hordes move in.</p>



<p>As you play further through Neighborhood Watch, you’ll unlock new abilities that give you a fresh experience every time. It’ll also usher in a host of new weapons, outfits, locations, and in-game mechanics.</p>



<p>Patch 6 will also introduce New Game Plus. This will enable players to start their Dead Island 2 story from the beginning <strong>but </strong>with their existing character, which means they’ll pull through all their collected weapons and skills. </p>



<p>It’s even more rewarding, as Dambuster will add on an increased level cap and new weapons <strong>plus </strong>a tougher difficulty mode and new zombie archetypes.</p>



<p>Dead Island 2 is a phenomenal and brutal game with plenty to offer – if you’ve never experienced it, now is the perfect time. Since it was released, two major expansions have been added to the game, which presents you with hours of content.</p>

Galante's given plenty of interviews in the past about his surprise hit game that birthed a sea of "survivor" games, but his chat with Game Informer tells us a little more about the tools and techniques that brought the game to life.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Speaking with Pao Yumol, Galante </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/vampire-survivors-developer-interview/">retold some</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nme.com/features/vampire-survivors-creator-luca-galante-talks-quitting-his-job-to-fulfil-his-promise-3153107">familiar tales</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> from development—that his gambling app programming background didn't really influence the whole game's design, just the treasure chest openings, and that he he was first inspired by LEME's mobile game </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Magic Survival</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">—but there are a few new tidbits that tell us how making the game was possible.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For instance, the proliferation of open source tools and free assets are what set Galante on the journey to making his own games. Galante specifically used the HTML5 open-source game engine </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://phaser.io/">Phaser</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and built the basics of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Vampire Survivors</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> with default engine assets.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The game's janky visuals that spiral out of control when hundreds of sprites pour onto the screen were there from the start, when he grabbed a Castlevania-themed pack of sprites. He told Game Informer that the sprites "were not getting rendered at the right size," and he fell in love with those imperfections.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"They were all very chaotic [and] messy. There was a lot of green on screen, with a giant mantis and grass on the floor."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="With open-source game engines, you can do a lot with a little">With open-source game engines, you can do a lot with a little</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Galante's fire-and-forget development process apparently took off when he began designing playable characters and weapons, which is still his "favorite part" of the development process. He explained his approach to design was "mercenary," grabbing individual assets from the sprite pack and coding attack patterns on the spot, with little thought for character, feel, or consistency.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This...uh, "methodology" manifested in a strange way in 2023, when he opened the game and discovered a character Game Informer says he "didn't recognize." Sometime in development he "blacked out" (his words) and forgot he'd made the character before going to sleep.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Stories of blackout in game development may conjure nervous memories of crunch and overwork for many developers, but it seems Galante perceives it as being more about his familiarity with his own toolkit. "Sometimes that comes from knowing your tools very well—your programming language, the game framework, and all of that."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The story closes with the tale of Peppino, a Christmas Tree character whose ability is just standing still and letting enemies pour over him. Galante made him in tribute to a Christmas tree that he was taking down on January 7, 2022, when a friend messaged him to let him know the game's sales were exploding after YouTuber SplatterCat published a review of the game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to Galante, he forgot to take down the tree and then decided to let it stay up forever.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But there's more. Peppino's "standing still" gimmick came from Galante learning about players who took on self-imposed "no movement" challenges. Galante told Game Informer that he had an unused sprite for a pine tree still on hand and the still-standing Christmas tree in his apartment.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The name Peppino in Italian means a pine tree, basically," he told the outlet. "And so my incredibly stupid brain just put all those bits together."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We would </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/korean-devs-report-a-burst-of-interest-in-single-player-console-and-pc-games">normally</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> point you to Game Informer's website to read the rest of Yumol's interview with Galante, but the interview was never published online following GameStop's decision to close the outlet and wipe out its online archives.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We encourage you to seek out a physical issue of Game Informer's final issue to read it, and other great stories, for yourself.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.

<!-- cache hit 73:single/related:2cfb9e607e0ad454376cae8e9fc24eca --><!-- empty -->
<p>In <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/05/the-asus-rog-ally-runs-windows-eats-battery-and-needs-time-to-cook/">our review of the Asus ROG Ally</a> last year, many of our complaints centered on having to fiddle with an "awkwardly scaled" version of Windows. That's especially true when you compare the ROG Ally experience to Valve's Steam Deck and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/11/steam-deck-system-update-greatly-improves-older-lcd-displays-too/">its finely handheld-tuned SteamOS 3</a>.
</p><p>Those ROG Ally complaints may be moot in the future, though, as Valve has confirmed that it is working to officially support SteamOS 3 installations on Asus' handheld.</p>
<p>The first hint of the move came when support for "extra ROG Ally keys" popped up out of nowhere in <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1675200/announcements/detail/4361258795952118018">the latest SteamOS release notes</a> last week. Now, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/13/24219469/valve-steamos-asus-rog-ally-steady-progress-dual-boot">speaking to The Verge</a>, Valve's Lawrence Yang confirms that the note is indeed "related to third-party device support for SteamOS. The team is continuing to work on adding support for additional handhelds on SteamOS."</p>
<p>On the other side of the portable OS equation, Yang also said Valve is continuing to work on the drivers necessary for official "dual boot" support for Windows on the Steam Deck hardware. "There’s no update on the timing for dual boot support—it’s still a priority, but we haven’t been able to get to it just yet," Yang said.</p>
<h2>Valve time</h2>
<p>This is far from the first time Valve has spoken about officially distributing the latest version of SteamOS beyond the Steam Deck. Yang <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23499215/valve-steam-deck-interview-late-2022">said in 2022</a> that "not only are we excited to see other manufacturers making their own handheld PC gaming devices, we’re excited to see people make their own SteamOS machines, which could include small PCs that they put next to their TV."</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>Still, Valve's confirmation of specific work on ROG Ally support is the strongest sign yet that the company is making concrete progress in this effort. Don't get too excited about an imminent release, though—Yang told The Verge that the team is "making steady progress," but the software "isn’t ready to run out of the box yet." The same goes for a generic SteamOS installer that users could download and install on any generic device.</p>

<p>In the meantime, hackers and hardware manufacturers are finding their own ways to get access to SteamOS without a Steam Deck. Ars' Kevin Purdy <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/06/the-linux-coders-turning-the-rog-ally-and-other-handhelds-into-steam-deck-clones/">ran through a cumbersome process with some very non-drop-in ISOs</a> to get SteamOS on his ROG Ally over a year ago. And earlier this year, Ayaneo <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/01/why-more-pc-gaming-handhelds-should-ditch-windows-for-steamos/">announced that its Next Lite handheld</a> would use an adapted version of the Linux-based <a href="https://github.com/holoiso-eol/holoiso">Holo ISO</a> to "provide a close-to-official SteamOS experience" (as Holo ISO's makers put it).</p>
<p>We remain eager for the day when that "close-to-official" SteamOS experience on non-Valve hardware becomes an "official" one that could let more hardware makers <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/01/why-more-pc-gaming-handhelds-should-ditch-windows-for-steamos/">ditch an expensive Windows license</a>. But given the company's <a href="https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Valve_Time">schedule-warping history with "Valve Time,"</a>&nbsp;we realize that day could still be quite far in the future.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Overwatch 2 - Official Season 12: New Frontiers Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">As for Clash, it's being described as a fast-paced mode with players capturing multiple control points. It'll also feature dynamic spawns and streamlined map routes, making it easier for players to jump back into combat after dying.</p><p dir="ltr">Season 12 will also officially introduce Juno.<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-adorable-new-hero-playable-this-weekend/1100-6525073/"> She was initially announced earlier last month</a> and comes with various weapons. These include the Mediblaster, her primary action that heals players and damages enemies. She also has a homing projectile, Pulsar Torpedos, that can heal allies over time and also damage enemies like her primary. Juno's ultimate ability lets her call down a beam from space that can heal players and increase their damage.</p><p dir="ltr">It's also worth mentioning that Season 12 will reset everyone's rank in competitive play. This is to help give players a fresh start and allow them to work their way up from the ground again.</p><p dir="ltr">Even though Blizzard is getting ready to launch Season 12,<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-is-bringing-back-6v6-sort-of/1100-6525278/"> the studio has also revealed it's working on bringing back 6v6</a>, which was how the game initially was before Overwatch 2 launched in 2022.</p>

The Bullfroggy connected universe that is Two Point County continues to expand with the announcement of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/two-point-museum">Two Point Museum</a>, another irreverent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-management-games">management</a> sim from developers Two Point Studios. This one’s about museums, would you believe, with exhibition themes including the world of prehistory. Find a trailer propped below this paragraph like a freshly brushed-down Tugowaurus skeleton.

The basics appear to be as in the previous two games: you build an attractive, labyrinthine space in order to fulfil the needs and demands of people passing through, so as to earn cash. The theming is played for laughs, but there’s a relentless metrics-sating machine rattling away beneath. Individual relics you might display include dinosaurs that must be assembled fossil by fossil, primeval stone computers, and giant ice cubes containing not-entirely-dead cavemen. Each exhibit generates Buzz, depending on how well you’ve arranged the pieces, which translates to more donations from visitors, who range from meddling school children to furtive artefact thieves.
</p>
<p>
In terms of how it differs from previous Two Point management sims, here are some nuggets of precious amber excavated from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/two-point-museum-turns-a-fresh-slice-of-mundane-life-into-a-wacky-british-adventure">Eurogamer’s preview</a>. Firstly, building is no longer constricted by rooms: instead, you’ll use partition walls, archways, floor materials, lighting types and decorations to structure and define each part of your museum. Hmm, I wonder if I can build another Toilet Maze? That was my finest achievement in the previous Two Point Campus, which Ed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/two-point-campus-review-a-relaxed-management-sim-bursting-with-silliness-and-seminars">enjoyed</a>. Such a shame that Two Point's in-game sense of humour doesn't extend to having NPC bladders explode.</p>
<p>You'll obtain new musuem artefacts by sending out fossil hunters and tomb raiders to explore a gradually revealed world map. You’ll also need these experts to keep the exhibits kempt and well-maintained once installed. Exhibits can also be “levelled up” through research to increase their earning potential.
</p>
<p>
At the risk of yet again sounding like a killjoy: it’s a mildly temperamental time to reveal a museum sim, in the UK at least. There’s <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/british-museum-contested-artefacts-benin-bronzes-b2394754.html">an on-going muddy reckoning in our cultural sector</a> with the fact that many prized UK museum exhibits are pillaged goods that should perhaps be returned to the descendants of the people we stole them from. With its comedy popsicle Bigfoots and literal lavalamps, Two Point Museum (which you can find on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2185060/Two_Point_Museum/">Steam</a>) isn’t really trying or equipped to join that conversation. I’m not sure how the developers could go about it - the difficulty is with the concept of museums and archives in general. If you’d like to dig into such things, I recommend Ariella Aïsha Azoulay’s recent polemical tome <a href="https://www.versobooks.com/en-gb/products/857-potential-history">Potential History: Unlearning Imperialism</a>.

<p>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth director Naoki Hamaguchi said they could consider moving to Unreal Engine 5 for the final instalment in the series. However, the decision will be based on multiple factors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During an interview with <a href="https://cgworld.jp/article/202408-ff7reb-01.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CG World</a> (via <a href="https://x.com/Genki_JPN/status/1823392560729194" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Genki</a>), Hamaguchi was asked if they were considering upgrading to Unreal Engine 5 for the next instalment in the Final Fantasy 7 Remake series. The director responded that the team will “assess the pros and cons of the engine,” but he believes it is “possible.” He further explained that the decision is “similar to considering whether to switch from SVN to Perforce.”</p>

</div></figure>



<p>Hamaguchi elaborated by saying that Final Fantasy 7 fans currently want the team “to deliver the final game in the series in good form as soon as possible.” He mentioned that the team will “objectively” consider whether changing the environment will speed up the process or whether it’s best to develop everything in one go as it is.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5aKJFzIPitY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">previous interview</a>, Hamaguchi mentioned that they were also considering moving from Unreal Engine 4 to Unreal Engine 5 for the previous Final Fantasy 7 Remake games. However, they scrapped that decision as many tools had not yet been developed for UE 5. &nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/witchfire-the-final-preview<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>You ever watch a black metal music video and think, “This is cool and all, but what if those guys screaming around a candlelit pentagram had mid-20th century guns?” Me neither, but I can’t help but think the team at The Astronauts did to get inspired for Witchfire, their single-player roguelike extraction shooter that feels like a gaslamp fantasy movie with Mercyful Fate as the soundtrack. Its mix of hot-handed running and gunning and more slow-paced exploration and investigation meld into something that is more of a dream to play than a nightmare. Though some balancing of what can feel like downright unfair difficulty is certainly in order, and some of the more obscure features could be made to feel less esoteric, I am firmly caught in the spell of this black magic banger.</p><p>Though it’s drenched in dark gothic drip, Witchfire is actually about the fight against the evil influence of powerful witches taking an alternative version of our world into its doomed clutches bit by bit. This world’s Vatican calls on you, an immortal warrior for the Pope called a preyer, to hunt and kill one of these witches – a task much easier said than done. The story sort of fizzles out after that. Everything you walk past or interact with is teeming with place and sometimes even lore, but it’s all piecemeal world building stuff that isn’t always intelligible. But it does a great job at setting the overall Roman Catholic x Van Helsing vibe.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Witchfire Horror Posters</h3></div></output><p>I really fell in love with Witchfire’s combat once I found the right guns for me out of the dozen available. It hits just the right stride between DOOM and Destiny, with fast-paced shooting that rewards chain kills and evasiveness and spells that are both powerful odds-eveners and clever utility pieces that helped me get out some gnarly binds all the time. Clearing monster camps manifests arcana, which is a random boon that helps flavor your particular run in the same way the many popular roguelikes do these days. I found that some of these boons were clearly more impactful than others, like ones that lowered my reload times or gave me bonus damage to enemies being afflicted by status elements. They are divided into specializations, and you can have a small effect on which specializations you can choose arcana from in a particular order, but it’s limited – not nearly on the level of the kind of God-boon manipulation in Hades, for example.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It hits just the right stride between DOOM and Destiny.</p></div><p>Besides having some truly satisfying sound design and clever artistic nods to real-world weapons, all of the guns feel pretty standard until you start unlocking special abilities by completing weapon-specific tasks like getting a certain amount of kills with it. Hunger, my go-to mid- to close-range heavy revolver, gained the ability to get empowered shots when I reloaded based on how many critical hits (i.e. weak point hits) I landed with the previous cylinder of rounds. Of the six or so I tried, each felt distinct and viable in their own right, but once I found this revolver and a shotgun that reloads when I hit a charged melee attack, I haven’t looked back.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Much of the meat of Witchfire is jumping into varied locations and finishing each map's main objective, like solving the mystery of the Wailing Tower or killing a gnarly boss in the Scarlet Coast. The map highlights other goodies like enemy camps that denote the difficulty of the monsters inside with increasingly more metal-looking skulls, or treasure chests and what they could hold should you want to trek towards them. These are usually your first guide for plotting any given trip out of the sanctum and into the fire, but these locales have plenty of things to find that won't be on the map – like walls that can be magically dissolved to reveal secret loot or passageways, or this nefarious spector that always seems to lead me into the waiting arms of something horrible. </p><p>I found that the time between dealing with sub-objectives is filled with navigating around and shooting up dozens of demonic denizens. As far as the regular footsoldiers of the witch go, you’ll be spending a lot of time clapping similar-looking baddies like various humanoid archers and cultists in rags, gunmen with long range and sharp aim, and knights who can turn into fireballs and leap long distances. This never really feels repetitive though, because these enemies get shuffled in with one another in dynamic groups that often require you to deal with lots of different types of threats at once. And these locations are filled with obstacles and verticality and very few corners that feel safe hunkering down in that you always have to be on the move or risk getting caught.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>More difficult monster camps will increase the quantity and variety of enemies, and is where you’ll see the scariest stuff. I stumbled across a camp of the highest, most horned-skull difficulty a few times during my travels and saw not only upgraded elite versions of monsters that I knew, but some brand-new horrors that I didn’t, like fully armored grenadiers and some floating menagere that resembled a balloon that’s also a picnic basket. These were a true test of my gear, stats, and skills that I still have a hard time passing. Being able to actively choose to engage with these high-risk challenges makes Witchfire feel more fair than frightening, but there’s also a few features that feel like insult to injury, like a roving band of monsters spawned by the exit portal that will follow you around the map and hunt you, getting stronger as time passes. Yes, they do make sure you stay on track and active during any given expedition, but they barge onto the scene largely unannounced, often being a nuisance when I was trying to engage an enemy camp or one of the weird puzzles on the map. Though killing these special hellions guarantees an ammo drop, a resource that becomes more precious the longer you stay in a map, they never stop coming, and never produce arcana - meaning you could kill them forever and never get any stronger even though they are -  and always feel like just one too many levers of discomfort.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>All of the treasure hunting and monster shooting I did on any given map was being watched by the Witch. With every mistake I made, the calamity meter rose.</p></div><p>The Gnosis level, my preyer’s general knowledge and insight as it comes to all things demonic, is the most obvious form of progression in Witchfire. It requires more relatively difficult tasks to be completed, like holding a large amount of currency at once, but when completed, higher Gnosis levels allowed me to unlock new access to rooms in my hideout, and also some previously locked or veiled doors in the available expeditions. The downside is that it raises the bar for all of the dangers you’ll find on expeditions. Suddenly, those floating demons I only saw in the most difficult of locations now show up more often in other locations as well. Traps change, more of the chests and items you find are cursed, the roving band of hunters includes more types of monsters, etc. It’s something I wish Witchfire made more obvious, because I certainly wish I knew this before I invested in my actual stats and gear.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>All of the treasure hunting and monster shooting I did on any given map was being watched by the Witch. With every mistake I made, the calamity meter rose in the top left corner, and when it’s filled completely, some terrible fate befell me. This was usually in the form of several assassins coming to slay me as my sanity slowly drained, but my understanding is that that is one of a few fates. The reverse GTA star meter that punishes you for being bad adds some pressure to already dangerous circumstances, but in a way that can feel like the game is snowballing against you regressively. And what “mistakes” are feels hit and miss. Sometimes it's pretty clear: being caught in a trap, failing a puzzle, or being seen by specific enemies. Other times it's simply getting hit, assumptively also by specific sorts of enemies but when things get really hectic, it's unclear who I need to dodge in order to not make a bad situation worse </p><p>Whether I successfully extracted from the map via one of the many possible portals on it, or was brutally murdered while trying, I ended back at my cliffside HQ to restock and regroup. Here I can spend my volatile witchfire - this game’s “souls” - to improve my stats or buy items from the strange merchant who I guess is my roommate? I can spend the gold that I found in chests or by turning in random (probably cursed) baubles I found at a demonic mirror that I can direct to research weapons, spells, or other gear that it will produce at random while I’m out witch hunting. It’s still early in development and all of these things are expanding gradually, but the grind outside of fighting all of the available bosses and maxing your Gnosis, is pretty limited at this point.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>But Witchfire has all the right ingredients in its cauldron for a genre-blending brew that is both unique and fun. Gunplay is an enchanting mix of kinetic cowboy guns and eldritch wizardry that really sings against the dangerous and plentiful soldiers of the ever-present Witch. Some of what it asks you to do is opaque and obtuse, both in a “fun to figure out” and a “frustrating lack of info that would have made a few hours of my game easier” kind of way. There’s hours of possessed chests to cleanse, secret passages to find, and bosses to conquer, and though the endgame grind looks rather unappealing off on the horizon, I have plenty still left on my list to see and do, and would be first in line for the next update Witchfire summons as the game continues on it Early Access journey.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>
