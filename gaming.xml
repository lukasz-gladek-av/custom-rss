			<p>Two different PlayStation 6 SoCs are said to be in the works, suggesting that the next-generation Sony system will be released in two different SKUs.</p>
<p>Speaking on the <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/kepler-theres-two-socs-in-development-for-next-gen-playstation-not-sure-if-its-a-series-x-s-situation-or-home-console-handheld.1675176/">NeoGAF forums</a>, well-known AMD leaker Kepler revealed there are two SoCs in development for the next-gen system, but the insider cannot confirm if it's an Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S situation or a home console and a handheld. One of the two, the insider added, should be affordable at least, suggesting there's a clear power difference between the two.</p>
<p>Very little is known about the PlayStation 6. <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-powered-amd/">Earlier this week</a>, a new report from Reuters confirmed the system will once again be powered by AMD, although Intel was among the two final contenders to design the system. Apparently, negotiations fell through when a dispute over profits prevented the company from settling on a price. Backward compatibility concerns also arose during negotiations, and reportedly Sony and Intel talked at length about the matter.</p>
<p>With the <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-price-test-consequences/">PlayStation 5 Pro</a> right around the corner and the current generation likely lasting a few more years, it may be a long time before we learn more about the PlayStation 6 and the potential two SKUs suggested by the two SoCs in development. We will keep you updated on the system as soon as possible, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

            <p>A few months ago, Minecraft's original console developer 4J Studios showed off a new in-house engine they had created, called the Elements Engine. Now they've announced what game they're making with it. It's called Reforj, and it's an "open-world multiplayer survival sandbox." But it's not aiming to be Minecraft 2, they say.
</p>

<p>The screenshot above is from a pre-alpha version of Reforj, which has no release date at this point. The trailer below shows more of the engine in action.

<p>"The fact this is coming from 4J means that the comparisons to Minecraft are unavoidable," Joseph Garrett <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-minecraft-studio-and-minecraft-youtuber-looking-to-transform-sandbox-gaming">told GamesIndustry.biz in a recent interview about the game</a>. Garrett is better known as Stampy, a Minecraft YouTuber, and he's working with 4J on Reforj. "We've already had articles about 4J making Minecraft 2. But that's not what we're trying to do. Despite all of us being huge fans of Minecraft, we don't need to make another one. It already exists."
</p>
<p>Reforj will instead offer "a very different gameplay experience," 4J co-founder Chris van der Kuyl says. The Elements engine has been designed to serve an open world survival game, however, one where players can change the world much like they can in Minecraft.
</p>
<p>4J Studios say they're hoping to release Reforj early and build it in partnership with its community, and that they recognise they're a small team and so their expectations of likely player numbers are low.
</p>
<p>We're long past the point in the industry where there's a new Minecraftbut launching every two months, but it's too early to tell if Reforj will offer something more than Ylands or Trove or any of a thousand of other block-building games which came and went. I will say this: I do not think swapping cubes for smaller, angled pieces is the good idea so many of these games think it is.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Concord game director Ryan Ellis has reportedly stepped down after the beleaguered 5v5 shooter was yanked offline amid apparently disastrous sales, with staff at developer Firewalk Studios said to be in limbo while they await Sony's decision on the future of the game.
</p>
<p>
Concord was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-pulled-from-sale-as-sony-admits-our-initial-launch-didnt-land">removed from sale</a> earlier this month, just two weeks after its launch on PS5 and PC, with Sony offering full refunds to players. In a statement released at the time, Ellis wrote, "While many qualities of the experience resonated with players, we also recognise that other aspects of the game and our initial launch didn't land the way we'd intended."
</p>
<p>
Ellis added that Firewalk would "explore options" and "determine the best path ahead"  once the game was offline, but no further statements have been issued since then. According to <a href="https://kotaku.com/concord-firewalk-studios-relaunch-ps5-sony-playstation-1851652811">Kotaku</a>, however, staff at Firewalk have remained "in limbo" in the two weeks following Concord's shutdown as they wait for a decision on both the game and the studio's future.

<p>
Three sources told Kotaku employees are "pessimistic" Concord will return, with some having already been asked to explore pitches the studio might work on next. Some are said to believe mass layoffs are on the cards for the Sony-owned Firewalk - which employs around 150-170 people - given the studio is reportedly one of the most expensive under PlayStation's watch on a per-head basis.
</p>
<p>
Kotaku says there's also speculation among staff that Sony may decide to set Firewalk to work co-developing one of its many other first-party projects - although "a few" employees have reportedly already preemptively exited the studio, while others are waiting to see what a potential severance package may look like before making a decision.
</p>
<p>
As for Ellis - who previously served as creative director on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> - he reportedly told staff last week he would be stepping down from his current role as game director and moving into a support role. "Ryan deeply believed in that project and bringing players together through the joy in it," one former developer told Kotaku. "Regardless of there being things that could have been done differently throughout development...he's a good human, and full of heart."
</p>
<p>
Firewalk was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-acquires-firewalk-studios-as-it-continues-work-on-triple-a-multiplayer-exclusive">acquired by Sony</a> last year, as part of a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plans-to-launch-more-than-10-live-service-games-before-march-2026">massive live-service push</a> under former PlayStation boss Jim Ryan. The response to Concord, Firewalk's debut game, was lukewarm at best, with industry analysts estimating it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-has-sold-just-25000-copies-estimate-industry-analysts">sold less that 25,000 copies</a> across PS5 and PC.

		<p>To mark the 30th anniversary of the PlayStation console family, Sony is breaking out their stocks of grey plastic once again, decking out a full range of PS5 consoles and their accessories. There’s even the first limited edition of the PS5 Pro.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/10/ps5-pro-everything-we-now-know-about-the-souped-up-playstation-5/">PS5 Pro</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/11/06/dualsense-review-feeling-the-future-of-gaming/">DualSense</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/01/23/dualsense-edge-review-is-sonys-first-ps5-pro-controller-essential-for-gamers/">DualSense Edge</a> and even the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/11/13/playstation-portal-review/">PlayStation Portal</a> are all getting a 30th Anniversary makeover. They’ve even made the included USB cables look like the classic PlayStation controller connector!</p>
<p><iframe title="Introducing the PlayStation 30th Anniversary Collection" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/amdZnHooTkk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The PS5 Pro is possibly going to be the most desirable of the bunch, with Sony making and numbering 12,300 of these consoles. These limited edition bundles will basically be the full set. You’ll naturally get the PS5 Pro itself with the grey faceplates, but there will also be an additional console cover included for the optional (and separately sold) disc drive. You’ll also get a vertical stand included (such luxury!), both a DualSense and a DualSense Edge controller, and special collector’s items including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Original PlayStation controller-style cable connector housing</li>
<li>Four PlayStation Shapes cable ties</li>
<li>PlayStation sticker</li>
<li>Limited Edition PlayStation Poster (1 of 30 possible designs)</li>
<li>PlayStation Paperclip</li>
</ul>


<p>The PS5 Slim bundle is the same, but only comes with one DualSense controller.</p>
<p>The DualSense, DualSense Edge and PlayStation Portal will also be sold separately.</p>

<p>The full collection will be released on 21st November, but pre-orders begin on 26th September exclusively at direct.playstation.com for the PS5 Pro, PS Portal, and DualSense Edge. In regions without a PlayStation Direct store, they’ll come from participating retailers instead.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, all regions will let retailers offer the PS5 bundle from 10th October, and the standard DualSense from 26th September.</p>
<p>No prices were confirmed, but given all of the items included with the consoles, expect them to cost a pretty penny…</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/atari-launches-kickstarter-campaign-for-centipede-blast-card-game<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Atari has launched a new Kickstarter campaign today. It isn't a revival of an <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/atari-7800-retro-console-announced" rel="noopener" target="_blank">older console</a>, but a a dip into tabletop gaming. Their first project is the <em>Centipede Blast Card Game</em>, an adaptation of a retro arcade classic.</p>

<p>According to the campaign page, the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/centipedeblast/atari-centipede-blast-card-game/description"><em>Centipede Blast Card Game</em></a> is based on the 1981 arcade game, <em>Centipede</em>. Much like the source material, the game requires a combination of quick reactions and strategy.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/centipede-blast-card-game-card-artwork.jpg?itok=Iy282DDY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/centipede-blast-card-game-card-artwork.jpg?itok=yuZe1Rh5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The <em>Centipede Blast Card Game</em> is a competitive experience&nbsp; Players take turns placing cards in a center pile. If two consecutive cards match in numbers Blast happens. When a blast occurs, all players must slam their hand on the top card. The last one to react takes the draw pile.</p>
<p>The first one to get rid of all their cards wins.</p>
<p>Several cards add creative wrinkles to this process. Blast! cards automatically trigger a Blast. Scorpion cards add 1 to every card's number until the end of the round. Mushroom cards reverse the direction of play.</p>
<p>All 60 cards in the <em>Centipede Blast Card Game</em> will feature a retro art style. This style is reminscent of the expressive arcade decals used to attract players back in the 1980s.</p>
<p>There are several pledge tiers for the <em>Centipede Blast Card Game</em>. They are as follows:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Standard Edition for $15:</strong> A copy of the game</li>
<li><strong>Double Up for $25:</strong> Two copies of the game</li>
<li><strong>Limited Edition for $35:</strong> A copy of the game, A limited edition game box, and an embroidered <em>Centipede Blast</em> patch</li>
<li><strong>VIP Bundle for $100:</strong> Everything in the Limited Edition tier, a Centipede Blast Sticker Pack, and a Centipede Blast-themed Gaming Mat.</li>
</ul><p>The <em>Centipede Blast Card Game</em> is relatively small compared to other tabletop adaptations of board games. According to an official press release,this is because the focus is on community engagement.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The Kickstarter goal for Centipede Blast is quite modest. We are using the platform primarily for its community engagement tools, which pair well with the collaborative manner in which we designed the game,” said Tyler Drewitz, Director of Atari X. “Fans have the option to get a basic or special edition version of the game, and follow along as we move quickly from production to shipping.”</p>
</blockquote>

The 1990 title from LucasArts is an exemplary entry in the point-and-click adventure genre, as well as one of the funniest games around. For many, that success is thanks to the team behind it: series creators <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/return-monkey-island-ron-gilbert-art-style-angry-fans-1849128586&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/return-monkey-island-ron-gilbert-art-style-angry-fans-1849128586">Ron Gilbert</a></span>, Dave Grossman, and Tim Schafer (of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/microsoft-buys-psychonauts-2-developer-double-fine-prod-1835359067&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-buys-psychonauts-2-developer-double-fine-prod-1835359067">Double Fine</a></span> fame). 2024’s Return to <em>Monkey Island</em> positioned itself as a return to form for the series, and it had big names involved in its production that long-time fans were excited about. Grossman, who worked on the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tales-of-monkey-island-chapter-1-preview-guybrush-sail-5303149&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tales-of-monkey-island-chapter-1-preview-guybrush-sail-5303149">fifth entry</a></span> in 2009, returned alongside Gilbert, who hasn’t been involved in the series since <em>Monkey Island 2</em> in 1991. </p><p>Together, the team pulled off a truly amazing series retrospective by updating the classic gameplay loop, keeping the old humor, and subverting everything fans would have expected in its story. The point-and-click adventure mechanics of <em>Return to Monkey Island </em>have largely remained the same, but they’ve been gussied up for the modern age. Instead of the original’s frustrating <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/scummvm-is-bringing-cd-rom-games-back-1847517151&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/scummvm-is-bringing-cd-rom-games-back-1847517151">SCUMM</a></span> engine, whose convoluted text box interactions often made puzzles that much harder, now everything flows much smoother. </p><p>As the saying goes, you can never go home again, and despite the title of the game, <em>Return to Monkey Island</em> understands that. It might set up a grand pirate adventure reminiscent of the first game and you might revisit a number of iconic locales, but they’re the same as how they appear in the original <em>Monkey Island</em>. And that’s the point: thing’s change. Protagonist Guybrush Threepwood might still be the wise-cracking pirate you fell in love with so many years ago, but he’s much older. And furthermore, he’s old-fashioned— much like the player, Guybrush is thrown off by the way the places he once knew have changed with the times. </p><p>One of the best illustrations of this is <em>Return</em>’s pirate leaders. Guybrush expects to see the pirates he knows from the first game to still be running things, but when you finally come face-to-face with the i leaders it’s a trio of younger upstarts who have no respect for or knowledge of who he is. The old pirate leaders are there, but they’re just milling around on the street now, stripped of their old titles, men of no importance. This goes for almost everybody you meet—people have moved on from Guybrush and either don’t know him or don’t agree with his old-school mindset. </p><p><em>Monkey Island</em> has always reflected its creators and their journeys through life, and <em>Return</em> is no different: Grossman and Gilbert return to the game that made them after 34 long years, and try to recapture the glory of the old days in a field now populated by annoying youngsters who very well might have no idea who the hell they are. Can they recapture what they had in 1990? No. Because they aren’t the same people. Neither is Guybrush or the player. <em>Return</em> is a <em>Monkey Island </em>game that looks back on the past and appreciates it for what it was, while also coming to terms with the notion that things must change to move forward. Two years after its release, <em>Return to Monkey Island</em> has aged like a fine wine, and it’ll only get better.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>BLAST has unveiled a step towards mobile esports in partnership with Supercell, a leading developer of mobile games. The top-tier esports organiser revealed a triple-threat tournament structure made up exclusively of Supercell games. In October, competitors will try and win big on Clash of Clans, Clash Royal, and Brawl Stars.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-three-times-the-magic">Three Times The Magic</h2>



<p>BLAST has long been associated with top-shelf esports games like Counter-Strike and Rainbow Six, but now the organisation is making a major step into mobile esports. For years, mobile esports has been a growing vertical, and with more games emerging in the space all the time, it’s quickly becoming one of the most diverse sectors in the wider esports market.</p>



<p>Once upon a time, a mobile game held the record for the highest concurrent viewership for an esports tournament, before being dethroned by last year’s League of Legends World Championship.</p>



<p>In October, BLAST Bash will take place, featuring three games: Clash Royale, Clash of Clans, and Brawl Stars. Here’s the schedule for BLAST Bash:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>BLAST Clash</strong>: 12 – 13 October</li>



<li><strong>BLAST Royale: </strong>12 – 13 October</li>



<li><strong>BLAST Brawl: </strong>10 – 11 October</li>
</ul>



<p>The prize pools up for grabs aren’t massive, but this is BLAST’s first step in the direction of mobile esports, so it’s expected that it’ll be a relatively humble one. What’s great is that the BLAST Bash tournaments will incorporate teams from Europe, the EMEA, and North America, which means it’s an international event off the bat.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to BLAST’s mobile esports tournaments? Let us know on the Insider Gaming forum.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ps6-2-socs/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-playstation-6-has-2-socs-in-development-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.986247/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ps6-2-socs/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>A reputable leaker has claimed that the PlayStation 6 currently has 2 SoCs (System-on-a-Chip) in development.</p>



<p>That’s according to KeplerL2, who made the comment on the <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/kepler-theres-two-socs-in-development-for-next-gen-playstation-not-sure-if-its-a-series-x-s-situation-or-home-console-handheld.1675176/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">NEOgaf forums</a> following discussions about the PlayStation 6’s price. Kepler, who has a fairly strong track record when it comes to reporting on hardware chips, says the PS6 currently has two SoCs in development, but it’s unclear what exactly this means for the console.</p>



<p>Kepler said, “There’s two SoCs in development for next-gen, idk if it’s a Series X/S situation or home console + handheld, but probably one of them will be affordable at least.”</p>



<p>Rumours suggest that the next-generation Xbox will have a main console and a handheld version, so it’s possible that PlayStation is also considering a similar approach with its hardware. In the last couple of years, the handheld gaming market has seen a boom, with PlayStation themselves also happen with the PlayStation Portal’s sales despite it being an accessory to the PlayStation 5. So it’s entirely plausible that the console giant could be eyeing up a dedicated handheld.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/youtube-pause-ads-confirmed/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>For almost two years, the concept of YouTube ‘rolling ads’ when you pause a video has been batted around the creator space. It was a few months ago that such a practice started cropping up, but now, YouTube has confirmed that on a global scale, paused videos are fair territory for ads to appear.</p>



<p>In a recent report, YouTube’s commercial team confirmed that ‘<strong>all advertisers</strong>‘ can now insert their promos into paused videos worldwide.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-money-talks">Money Talks</h2>



<p>Earlier this year, it was confirmed by Google that inserting ads into paused videos was ‘lucrative’. It comes as no surprise that months later, the firm has opted to roll out this mechanic to advertisers everywhere.</p>



<p>Per a report <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/18/24248391/youtube-pause-ads-widely-rolling-out" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">published by The Verge</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>As we’ve seen both strong advertiser and strong viewer response, we’ve since widely rolled out Pause ads to all advertisers.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In theory, it shouldn’t bother viewers one bit, as these ads will only appear when they’re not actively watching something. In The Verge’s article, it was rightfully pointed out that this should offer a ‘less interruptive’ experience, but it was also noted that standard ads might not necessarily appear less just because you’ve got a chance of seeing them while your video is paused.</p>



<p>It’s an unsurprising move – ad revenue is <strong>big bucks </strong>for streaming and content platforms. It’s what pays the bills, in most cases. In truth, platforms like Twitch and YouTube are desperate to make back the money they spend on infrastructure, so every ad impression counts massively.</p>



<p>Of course they’re going to shoehorn them in whoever possible.</p>



<p>Do you think this’ll impact your viewing experience on YouTube? Let us know on the Insider Gaming forum.</p>

Others can be entirely different fighters, such as bosses or even guest characters. I’ll be going over how to play as every one of these hidden fighters in this guide, in addition to providing a small breakdown of what makes each one unique.</p><h2 id="h154"><a id=""></a><strong>Where to find character unlock instructions in-game</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="ad42a17bfe0a72534606aafd64ba6488" data-recommend-id="image://ad42a17bfe0a72534606aafd64ba6488" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The screen explaining how to unlock characters." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The screen explaining how to unlock characters." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ad42a17bfe0a72534606aafd64ba6488" data-recommend-id="image://ad42a17bfe0a72534606aafd64ba6488" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The screen explaining how to unlock characters." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This may come as a surprise, but the necessary steps to play as nearly every secret character are available in the game. They’re just a little bit buried within some menus.<br></p><p>Head to the main menu, and then select Fighter Awards. You’ll then need to press the button labeled Toggle Player Progress Page in the bottom right corner. This will take you to the specific awards for each game, which are simply to complete a run with each character. Scroll through and you’ll notice some awards with “???” on them—these are the secret fighters. Press the How to Use button to find specific directions for unlocking them.</p><p><strong>As helpful as it is to have these hints readily available, you can only access them from the main menu.</strong> Feel free to return to this guide if you need a quick refresher while you’re choosing your characters!</p><h2 id="h155"><a id=""></a><strong>What does Easy Select mean?</strong></h2><p>Whether you’ve looked at the instructions on the Player Progress Page, or went straight to the Game Settings to tinker around, you likely noticed that most six games have a setting called Secret Characters. They’re all set to Easy Select by default, which is what this guide will be assuming you’ve left enabled. However, you might be a little confused about what that or the other options mean.</p><p><strong>Easy Select means that you can choose secret characters without needing to use any complicated inputs.</strong> There might still be some extra-simple inputs, but you’ll usually just need to move off the character select portraits.</p><p>Original Select means that it functions similarly to later releases, or a different setting back on the arcade version. Only some secret characters might be selectable, and even then it will likely require a complicated input.</p><p>Disabled is the last of the common options, and it means there are no additional fighters available to choose from. You’ll be limited simply to what’s available on the character select.</p><h2 id="h156"><a id=""></a><strong><em>X-Men: Children of the Atom</em> Secret Characters</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="84a36d8359ddbcbdc9dfa2a42cef8f4f" data-recommend-id="image://84a36d8359ddbcbdc9dfa2a42cef8f4f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Akuma and Magneto on the X-Men: Children of the Atom VS screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Akuma and Magneto on the X-Men: Children of the Atom VS screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="84a36d8359ddbcbdc9dfa2a42cef8f4f" data-recommend-id="image://84a36d8359ddbcbdc9dfa2a42cef8f4f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Akuma and Magneto on the X-Men: Children of the Atom VS screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The first and earliest game in this compilation is <em>X-Men: Children of the Atom</em>. Its three secret characters include two bosses and a guest from the <em>Street Fighter</em> series.<br></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Juggernaut</strong> – Highlight Cyclops and press up for the Juggernaut. He’s incredibly slow, but makes up for it with specials and supers that take out huge chunks of an opponent’s life bar.</li><li><strong>Magneto</strong> – Highlight Omega Red and press up for Magneto. As the final boss, he’s the cheapest character by far. Strong moves, a shield super that nullifies most attacks, and a regenerating super meter are just some of his highlights.</li><li><strong>Akuma</strong> – Highlight Wolverine and press up for Akuma. He doesn’t have a sprite image of his face, so you’ll know you’re good once there’s no face image on your side. This version of the character is pretty close to how he is in <em>Super Street Fighter II Turbo</em>, only with a unique counter super and the debut of his Tenmakuujinkyaku dive kick. One glaring caveat is that his health is very low, so be sure to keep note of that.</li></ul><h2 id="h157"><a id=""></a><strong><em>Marvel Super Heroes</em> Secret Characters</strong></h2><p>Next on the list is <em>Marvel Super Heroes</em>. Just like the previous title, this game’s hidden characters include two bosses and one character from a Capcom series.</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Doctor Doom</strong> – Highlight Wolverine and press up for Doctor Doom. As the sub-boss of this game, he’s naturally very powerful. His specials and supers deal incredible damage, and he can fly too.</li><li><strong>Thanos</strong> – Highlight Magneto and press up for Thanos. He’s the final boss of the game and you’ll feel like one when playing him. Thanos has six different supers, one for each Infinity Gem he wields. You’ll be able to use them pretty often too because he builds up his super meter very quickly.</li><li><strong>Anita</strong> – Highlight Spider-Man and press up for Anita. Based on a side character from the <em>Darkstalkers</em> series, Anita is a test character that was initially only available in the Japanese version. She’s unfinished and pretty broke, with plenty of rough animations and a super that can take out nearly all of your opponent’s health.</li></ul><h2 id="h158"><a id=""></a><strong><em>X-Men vs Street Fighter</em> Secret Characters</strong></h2><p>There’s only one hidden character in <em>X-Men vs Street Fighter</em> and it’s someone from a previous game in this compilation. There’s no Easy Select option for this title, but that’s fine because it’s easy to play this elusive fighter.</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Akuma</strong> – All you need to do is press up while looking at anyone on the top row of the character select screen. He’s based on his appearance in <em>Street Fighter Alpha 2</em>, so you have all the typical fun Akuma tools and the legendary Raging Demon super. His trademark low health is also here, so I suggest playing offensively but carefully.</li></ul><h2 id="h159"><a id=""></a><strong><em>Marvel Super Heroes Vs Street Fighter</em> Secret Characters</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="9f24556dcf33a9ced0bd6652e23bddfb" data-recommend-id="image://9f24556dcf33a9ced0bd6652e23bddfb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Cyber-Akuma, U.S. Agent, and Shadow on the Marvel Super Heroes VS screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Cyber-Akuma, U.S. Agent, and Shadow on the Marvel Super Heroes VS screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9f24556dcf33a9ced0bd6652e23bddfb" data-recommend-id="image://9f24556dcf33a9ced0bd6652e23bddfb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Cyber-Akuma, U.S. Agent, and Shadow on the Marvel Super Heroes VS screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Marvel Super Heroes vs Street Fighter</em> has the highest number of secret fighters, although most are palette swaps. A couple of them don’t change anything gameplay-wise, but the rest offer unique properties.<br></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>U.S. Agent</strong> – Highlight M. Bison and confirm the character while holding the start button. He’s a palette swap for Captain America who plays the same.</li><li><strong>Armored Spider-Man</strong> – Highlight Spider-Man and confirm the character while holding the start button. He has one hit of armor and doesn’t jump quite as high, but otherwise plays the same as the web crawler you know.</li><li><strong>Mephisto</strong> – Highlight Omega Red and confirm the character while holding the start button. He’s a palette swap for Blackheart and the primary difference is that his attacks set opponents on fire. That being said, this is purely a visual change and the fire doesn’t do any extra damage.</li><li><strong>Dark Sakura</strong> – Highlight Hulk and confirm the character while holding the start button. This is much more than a simple palette swap for everyone’s favorite spunky shoto. She ends up borrowing some moves from Akuma, including air fireballs, and even gets her own Raging Demon variant.</li><li><strong>Mech-Zangief</strong> – Highlight Blackheart and confirm the character while holding the start button. <strong>If you hate playing defensively, this is the character for you.</strong> Mech-Zangief gains permanent hyper armor at the cost of blocking and an acceptable jump height.</li><li><strong>Shadow</strong> – Highlight Dhalsim and confirm the character while holding the start button. Following what happened in his ending in <em>X-Men Vs. Street Fighter</em>, this is a souped-up version of Charlie. He’s faster and his supers hit a lot harder.</li><li><strong>Cyber-Akuma</strong> – Highlight Akuma and confirm the character while holding the start button. The final boss of the game is pretty much a busted version of Akuma, so you can have a lot of fun playing Cyber-Akuma. All of his moves come out quicker and in most cases a lot stronger too. He can even perform a Raging Demon in the air for some ungodly reason.</li></ul><h2 id="h160"><a id=""></a><strong>Marvel vs Capcom: Clash of Super Heroes Secret Characters</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="df5e67c7751c0883d1453a06444fd04f" data-recommend-id="image://df5e67c7751c0883d1453a06444fd04f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Marvel vs Capcom character select screen with Shadow Lady, Roll, War Machine, and Venom shown." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Marvel vs Capcom character select screen with Shadow Lady, Roll, War Machine, and Venom shown." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="df5e67c7751c0883d1453a06444fd04f" data-recommend-id="image://df5e67c7751c0883d1453a06444fd04f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Marvel vs Capcom character select screen with Shadow Lady, Roll, War Machine, and Venom shown." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Every secret character in <em>Marvel vs Capcom: Clash of Super Heroes</em> except for one is a palette swap. Even then, that one outlier still shares moves with someone else on the roster.<br></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Hulk (MSH Version)</strong> – Highlight Ryu and press up to use Hulk (MSH version). Commonly called Orange Hulk by fans, this version is meant to play similarly to the big green guy in <em>Marvel Super Heroes</em>. It’s not the same though, as there are some obvious changes to move properties. Other notable differences include no super armor and faster movement.</li><li><strong>Hyper Armor War Machine</strong> – Highlight Zangief and press up to use Hyper Armor War Machine. Just like Mech-Zangief from the previous title, this palette swap of War Machine has hyper armor but can’t block or jump that well.</li><li><strong>High-Speed Venom</strong> – Highlight Chun-Li and press up to use High-Speed Venom. Commonly called Red Venom by fans, even though he’s obviously orange, this palette swap is the most precarious to play. His movement and attacks are incredibly fast, which is balanced out by him taking nearly double the damage from attacks.</li><li><strong>Roll</strong> – Highlight Mega Man and press right to use Roll. She’s the only one who isn’t a palette swap and has her own sprites, but her moveset is technically the same as Mega Man. To be more precise, she’s worse than Megaman due to low damage and lengthy delays for her attacks. Roll is a gag character in this game like Dan Hibiki, only less viable and a lot cuter.</li><li><strong>Shadow Lady</strong> – Highlight Gambit and press down to use Shadow Lady. Arguably the most distinct hidden fighter, Shadow Lady is a visual palette swap of Chun-Li with unique robotic moves. This includes a triple jump, an air dash, missile attacks, and turning her hands into a giant drill.</li><li><strong>Morrigan (Lilith)</strong> – Highlight War Machine and press down to use Morrigan (Lilith). The only reason to use her will be if you want a team with two succubi. Aside from a more accessible air dash, this palette swap suffers from a worse fireball and worse supers.</li></ul><p><strong>Read More:</strong>&nbsp;<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/capcom-fighting-collection-arcade-classics-impressions-1851643432&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/capcom-fighting-collection-arcade-classics-impressions-1851643432">Capcom’s Latest Collection Of Arcade Classics Gives <em>The Punisher</em> Its Due</a></span></p><h2 id="h161"><a id=""></a><strong>Marvel vs Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes Secret Characters</strong></h2><p>The original arcade release of <em>Marvel vs Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes</em> required characters to be unlocked through an experience system.

Microsoft said it's ending the program in part because Xbox players are "finding more value" in other, similar places, including the Xbox Insider program, Fanfest, and the Xbox Rewards program.</p><p>"Thanks to the work of this group, the chance for players to experience the joy of gaming is more global and inclusive than ever--and we believe that now is the right moment to bring the learnings and values of the Ambassador community into all of our player engagement programs," Microsoft said.</p><p>Seasonal Ambassador quests are being phased out, with resources instead going to the Rewards with Xbox and Xbox Research programs--more details will be announced soon, Microsoft said.</p><p>"You will also have a new, more global way to share feedback directly with us through Xbox Research, providing the chance to receive more early access to new games and features, and help us improve the Xbox experience for everyone," Microsoft said.</p><p>Additionally, the Xbox Ambassador Champions system is "evolving" into what's called Xbox Community Champions.</p><p>"We recognize that this evolution of the program may feel like a loss for some of you, but our work in maintaining an inclusive community of thoughtful players continues in new and expanded ways," Microsoft said. "We are incredibly proud of your impact and through your continued engagement, we will together continue to make Xbox the most fun place for everyone to play."</p><p>The Xbox Ambassadors program will officially go offline on October 15, which is also the last day existing Xbox Ambassadors can claim outstanding rewards. Microsoft is also giving members who have been active during the latest season a "special thank you," though it's not clear what this will be.</p><p>Now until October 15, Microsoft will host weekly sweepstakes to give Ambassadors a final chance to use their ticket balance. Finally, the Xbox Ambassadors badge given to members will be updated in the future with a "legacy" design.</p><p>Microsoft has made a number of cuts and changes to the Xbox business in recent times, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-cuts-650-more-gaming-jobs-but-no-studios-closed-or-games-canceled/1100-6526439/" data-ref-id="1100-6526439">more than 2,500 layoffs since the start of 2024 at the Xbox team.</a></p>

            <p>
Developer Mojang has revealed the next instalment of its formerly annual Minecraft Live digital showcase will air on 28th September, marking the first edition to be broadcast following the studio's recently revealed format changes.
</p>
<p>
More specifically, a "new take" on Minecraft Live will broadcast at 6pm BST/1pm EDT on Saturday, 28th September. It can be watched via the <a href="http://minecraft.net/live">Minecraft website</a>, YouTube, or <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a>, and promises "news about our games, content creators, and more."
</p>
<p>
Notably, however, it won't see the return of Mojang's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/295k-minecraft-fans-criticise-lack-of-new-content-in-stop-the-mob-vote-petition">increasingly controversial</a> mob vote, which the studio confirmed it was retiring earlier this month. That news came alongside the announcmement Minecraft Live is ditching its traditional annual format, and will now air twice a year. This revamped version will be the place to learn about "the latest features we're working on, what's coming into testing, and the newest news from across the Minecraft franchise". Perhaps we'll also see more of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecraft-movie-trailer-gives-first-look-at-block-stars-jason-momoa-and-jack-black-in-action">decidedly iffy looking</a> live-action Minecraft movie.

<p>
Mojang's Minecraft Live makeover isn't the only change in the works for the mega-popular survival game. The studio also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecraft-ditching-single-summer-update-for-more-regular-releases-ps5-version-incoming">recently confirmed sweeping changes to its content release schedule</a> that'll see the blockbusting sandbox adventure trade its traditional single summer update for multiple content drops throughout the year. This, it said, would help satisfying players' desires for "new Minecraft content more often".
</p>
<p>
Mojang's first update for Minecraft following that announcement released earlier this week, bringing bug fixes, gameplay tweaks, and a new experimental Bundles feature - letting players stack different blocks or items together in the same inventory slot to save space. That update was accompanied by the news Minecraft will be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecraft-is-ditching-psvr-support-next-year">ditching PSVR support</a> next year.
