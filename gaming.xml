            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>According to a new report, Ubisoft canceled an in-development&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed&nbsp;</em>game that was set to take place in the Reconstruction-era USA last year, citing political concerns.</p>

<p>That's per Stephen Totilo of <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/scoop-ubisoft-cancelled-a-post-civil" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Game File</a>, who cites "interviews with five current and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-layoffs-leamington-closure" rel="nofollow">former Ubisoft employees</a>". Said employees told Totilo that they were "enthusiastic" about this potential&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed&nbsp;</em>game, but were "frustrated by its cancellation", which they saw as "Ubisoft bowing to controversy".</p>

<p>If Totilo is to be believed, players would have taken the role of a Black former slave who had moved from the South in order to begin a new life. The Assassins would have recruited said protagonist, and he would have fought the Ku Klux Klan, among other hostile forces.</p>

<p>If you need reminding, said backlash revolved around whether or not the historical Yasuke (who was a real person) would actually have held the rank of samurai. Its proponents claimed historical inaccuracy, but those opposed to the backlash accused its adherents of covert racism.</p>

<p>The second reason the&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed&nbsp;</em>project in question was canceled was, according to Totilo's report, the political climate in the US, which a source said was "too unstable" to justify the continuation of the game's development.</p>

<p>The sources to whom Totilo spoke said that cancelling a project in the gaming industry was not unusual (to which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/starbreeze-project-baxter-canceled-layoffs" rel="nofollow">recent events</a> will certainly <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/contraband-canceled-report-avalanche-studios" rel="nofollow">attest</a>), but that doing so for the above reasons was.</p>

<p>The French studio also announced back in September that future games in the&nbsp;<em>Far Cry&nbsp;</em>series, another franchise that serves as one of Ubisoft's flagships, would <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/far-cry-multiplayer-ubisoft" rel="nofollow">focus much more on their multiplayer elements</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>This is </em><a href="https://www.lowpass.cc/">Lowpass<em> by Janko Roettgers</em></a><em>, a newsletter on the ever-evolving intersection of tech and entertainment, syndicated just for </em>The Verge<em> subscribers once a week.</em></p><p>The glasses stole the show: When Meta held its annual Connect developer conference last month, the company’s new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/779566/meta-ray-ban-display-hands-on-smart-glasses-price-battery-specs">Ray-Ban Display glasses</a> got a lot of attention. Without new hardware to announce, VR took a bit of a backseat. Sure, <a href="https://www.lowpass.cc/p/james-cameron-mixed-reality-headsets-generative-ai">there was James Cameron</a>, who is helping the company bring 3D movies, shows, and sports events to Quest headsets. But what about that whole metaverse thing? How’s that going? To get an update on Meta’s efforts to make VR social, I talked to the company’s metaverse VP, Vishal Shah.</p><p>Meta’s struggles with Horizon Worlds, the company’s social metaverse platform, have been well-documented. Shah himself complained in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/6/23391895/meta-facebook-horizon-worlds-vr-social-network-too-buggy-leaked-memo?utm_source=www.lowpass.cc&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=exclusive-inside-meta-s-horizon-worlds-reboot">a series of leaked 2022 memos</a> that not even Meta’s employees were using the platform, leading him to pose the question: “If we don’t love it, how can we expect our users to love it?”</p><p>The company has since launched a series of polished games within <em>Horizon</em> and spent heavily to attract VR developers to the platform. At this year’s Connect conference, Meta doubled down on those efforts by announcing not just AI developer tools, but also a whole new game engine for Horizon Worlds.</p><p>All of this is part of the company’s efforts to turn Horizon Worlds into a link between social 3D spaces everywhere, from headsets to phones to your Facebook and Instagram feeds — and one day, as Mark Zuckerberg suggested during his Meta Connect keynote, perhaps even glasses.</p><div><p id="worlds-apart-making-vr-games-work-on-phones-isnt-easy"><h2>Worlds apart: making VR games work on phones isn’t easy</h2></p></div><p>When Meta launched the first version of Horizon Worlds in late 2021, it very much embraced a kind of DIY ethos. Developers could easily build games and worlds in headset, but the resulting experiences all lacked texture and complexity. Remember <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/19/23313469/mark-zuckerberg-horizon-worlds-screenshot-memes-response-upgrades">Zuckerberg’s selfie in front of the Eiffel Tower?</a> That was essentially how Horizon Worlds games looked at the time. “The ceiling of what you could make was low,” Shah says. “It was just not compelling enough.”</p><p>The company began shifting away from this approach in 2023 by building and <a href="https://www.roadtovr.com/meta-horizon-worlds-50-million-creator-fund/">investing in</a> higher-quality games like <em>Super Rumble</em>, a PvP shooter built by Meta’s in-house studio Ouro Interactive. It eventually fully transitioned from in-headset creator tools to a desktop solution for building worlds <a href="https://www.uploadvr.com/horizon-worlds-desktop-editor-now-publicly-available-in-early-access/">earlier this year</a>. That software, Meta Horizon Studio, lets developers create more complex games with TypeScript, including <a href="https://horizon.meta.com/world/10221079610486872/?locale=en_US">haunted houses</a>, <a href="https://horizon.meta.com/world/393502540519645/?locale=en_US">sports competitions</a>, and <a href="https://horizon.meta.com/world/462305146410908/?locale=en_US">party games</a>.</p><p>“That required a skill that not everyone has,” admits Shah. “So can we lower the floor of what you need to get started, but still keep the ceiling really high?” Meta’s answer to that question is AI: At Connect, the company unveiled <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/780256/meta-horizon-worlds-engine-studio">new tools for developers</a> to create 3D environments, NPCs, and even game mechanics with simple prompts.</p><p>Embracing desktop creator tools has also allowed Meta to take Horizon Worlds beyond the headset. The company <a href="https://www.lowpass.cc/p/horizon-worlds-super-rumble-reboot-mobile-app">began making select games, including <em>Super Rumble</em></a>, available on mobile in 2023. “We have this chicken-and-egg problem,” Shah tells me. “We know the most immersive experiences are in VR. But that’s not where all the people are today. People are on mobile.” And once people discover <em>Horizon</em> games on mobile, they’re more likely to try them in VR, or so the logic goes.</p><p>However, getting people to try <em>Horizon</em> games on mobile hasn’t been easy, with Shah acknowledging that the company’s initial push to bring VR games like <em>Super Rumble</em> to phones didn’t work. “The control specs weren’t right,” he says. “It just didn’t feel right.”</p><p>Now, Meta also allows developers to build mobile-only Horizon Worlds games. Engagement on mobile has supposedly increased by 4x since, but Shah admits that overall mobile use is still nascent. “It’s smaller than VR, but it’s not nearly as small as it was,” he tells me.</p><p>And while Meta keeps investing in mobile <em>Horizon</em> games, its ultimate goal remains unchanged. “This is not about [building] a mobile-only thing,” Shah says. “This is about cross-platform play. This is about making sure people can find these [worlds] from whatever device they’re on, and whatever experience they’re in.”</p><div><p id="why-meta-built-a-new-game-engine"><h2>Why Meta built a new game engine</h2></p></div><p>To that end, the company is also looking to bring <em>Horizon</em> to some of its other platforms. “If you go to the games tab on Facebook, you can find <em>Horizon</em> games,” Shah says, adding that the company was also testing the integration of <em>Horizon</em> games into Instagram.</p><p>Part of this push to bring Horizon Worlds everywhere is the transition to a new game engine to replace the Unity engine the platform was originally built on. “That was the right place to start for us,” Shah says about the popular game engine. However, Unity is primarily known as an engine for developers looking to build single games, while titles like <em>Roblox</em> and <em>Minecraft</em> tend to run on proprietary engines. “So we made the decision that we’d have to build something much more bespoke for our needs.”</p><p>The new <a href="https://developers.meta.com/horizon/blog/meta-horizon-engine-at-a-glance/">Meta Horizon Engine</a> makes it possible to have many more players in the same world at the same time while also reducing load times. The latter is key to making <em>Horizon</em> feel more like a series of interconnected worlds, and, for instance, allows a group of friends to easily jump from one experience to another without having to spend a lot of time waiting for worlds to load.</p><p>“We’ve done research on this,” he says. “You feel like something takes a long time to load if it’s anywhere over 15 to 20 seconds. It feels much faster if it’s under 15, but the real magic number is under seven [seconds], where it almost feels instantaneous.”</p><p>The new engine will be rolling out in stages. One of the first worlds running on the new engine is Horizon Central, the town square that many people start their journey into Horizon Worlds on. Higher concurrencies also make the new engine the best solution for Horizon Arena, Meta’s concert and events space in VR.</p><p>However, most Quest owners will get their first glimpse of something powered by the new engine as soon as they put on their headset when the company rolls out a redesigned home base soon. “That home environment is just a world,” Shah says.</p><div><p id="everything-is-just-a-world"><h2>Everything is just a world</h2></p></div><p>It’s just a world: That could ultimately become the unofficial tag line for Horizon Worlds. The VR comedy club, meditation space, or 3D shooter? They’re all just worlds. The games your friends are playing on Facebook or Instagram? Also just worlds. The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/780044/meta-quest-metaverse-hyperscape-capture-vr">virtual replica of your living room</a>, powered by Gaussian splats? Just another world. Future avatar-powered co-presence experiences that will likely be added to wearables like Meta’s Ray-Ban Display glasses? At some point, probably yet another world.</p><p>Turning Horizon Worlds into the connective tissue that ties together social VR hangouts, mobile gaming, and even future XR co-presence experiences is ambitious, to say the least. It will also require the company to make some tough decisions, which could alienate early VR users.</p><p>Meta has taken such steps across its VR efforts in recent years. It stopped updating the original Oculus Quest headset in early 2024, pulled the plug on its fitness tracking service Move <a href="https://www.meta.com/nl-nl/blog/oculus-move-updates-track-your-vr-fitness-stats-and-goals-outside-your-headset/">earlier this year</a>, and has removed some early Horizon Worlds games from the platform. More painful choices may be needed, admits Shah.</p><p>“That’s kind of the phase that we’re in,” he says. “We have to clean up a lot of the core experiences. I’m [spending] a lot of my time just moving throughout the entire OS, saying, ‘Okay, what can we deprecate here? How do we consolidate here?’ We have this amazing ecosystem that’s complex. And if we really want to expand the audience, we’ve got to simplify.”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTM1Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Janko Roettgers</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/column/797624/meta-metaverse-horizon-worlds-mobile-vr-social]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a>'s launch day patch was promised to be a big one, and EA weren't lying. The full notes have just arrived ahead of the shooter's launch tomorrow, October 10th. They're over 2700 words long. That's about double the length of my last feature, but solely dedicated to stuff like recoil and times to murderdeath.</p>
<p>If you played the beta, is there anything left you'll actually recognise when you fire up the full version? I've no idea, to be honest, they could have hidden a line about swapping every character model for Mr Bean in here and I'd likely have struggled to clock it.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The update's dubbed Patch 1.0.1.0 and EA say it's all about "addressing bugs, refining balance, and enhancing clarity throughout the entire experience". I shudder to think how beefy its file size might be.</p>
<p>Headlining as "major updates" are a lot of the things the studio <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6s-hefty-launch-day-patch-will-bring-over-200-changes-and-ea-know-folks-pine-for-the-sea">announced earlier this week</a>, when they also said they'd heard folks crying out for the ocean. Namely, the following: </p>
<ul>
<li>Movement is refined with reduced slide-to-jump momentum, lowered jump height, and increased inaccuracy when firing while airborne or sliding.</li>
<li>Weapon handling has been rebalanced through general recoil tuning and adjustments to ensure more consistent gunplay.</li>
<li>Rush and Breakthrough layouts revised to deliver a better balance between Attackers and Defenders.</li>
<li>Maps improved with better traversal, lighting adjustments, and overall performance upgrades.</li>
<li>UI and HUD have received a range of polish improvements for clearer prompts, smoother navigation, and more accurate displays.</li>
<li>Settings and controls expanded with improvements across multiple areas.</li>
<li>Audio overhauled game-wide with clearer pings, refined weapon and vehicle sounds, and fixes for missing or delayed effects.</li>
<li>Netcode optimized to reduce desync, fast time-to-death, and instances of invisible damage.</li>
</ul>
<p>Read all of those? Good, you've only got a further 2667 words by my count to go. If you've not equipped the tactical version of your traditional Sunday Papers reading monocle and comfy slippers, I suggest you do it now, Lieutenant videogames.</p>

<p>Right, your eyes are almost certainly clinging on for dear life now, so here's a quick reminder that you can find the exact times for Battlefield 6's full launch on October 10th <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-release-time">here</a>. It's well worth checking out <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-review">Edwin's review</a> too, the first paragraph alone had me saluting and pressing F to pay respects to his writing skills. Yes, I know that last bit's a Call of Duty gag, but let me have it.</p>

              <p>Devs behind the sci-fi MMO Phil Spencer liked but canceled anyway form a new studio. More turnover at Halo Studios ahead of its big reveal for the future of the franchise.

 <p>“As of today and after seventeen long years, I am officially no longer contributing to the Halo universe,” Israel <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7379767940897959936/">wrote on LinkedIn</a> last week. “There is little more I can say for the moment, though I intend to share this particular story in its entirety when it is absolutely safe to do so next year. In the meantime, I have a message for anyone and everyone who needs to hear it.”</p>

 <p>He continued, “I know that the state of our industry seems dire, but never forget that you are *free to choose*. No illusion of security nor promise of wealth or fame or power is worth trading away your health, your dignity, your ethics or values – and no one can force you to. Stay strong, take evidence when necessary, and find where you belong.”</p>

 <h2>Laid-off devs behind Microsoft’s cancelled sci-fi MMO launch a new studio</h2> <p>The studio’s made of developers who had been working at ZeniMax Online Studios on Project Blackbird and it’s called, fittingly enough, <a href="https://www.sackbirdstudios.com/news/studio-takes-flight">Sackbird Studios</a>. It’s employee-owned and self-funded. “With internal funding and full creative control, the studio is focused on crafting bold, character-driven experiences free from corporate compromises,” a post on the company website reads.</p>

 <p>“We’re grateful for our time at ZeniMax Online Studios; it shaped us as developers and as people,” said Lee Ridout, Sackbird Studios’ CEO. “When I learned that Blackbird was being cancelled and a lot of people were losing their jobs, it lit a fire. We realized the best way to protect our craft—and our team—was to create a studio where creative independence isn’t negotiable.”</p>

 <h2><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> gets a new secret ending in a free update</h2>  <p>It drops October 10 and unlocks after players finish the just-added new game plus mode.</p> <h2><em>MTG</em> head designer pushes back against Universes Beyond “slop” accusations</h2> <p>A pro player’s rant went viral last week as he railed against what he saw as the dilution of<em> Magic: The Gathering</em>‘s identity. “There’s always a line in the sand where people say ‘this is <em>Magic</em>‘ or ‘this is not<em> Magic</em>,’ but everybody’s line is different,” head designer Mark Rosewater said earlier this month, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-minds-behind-magic-the-gathering-say-theyre-making-it-for-anyone-not-everyone/1100-6535324/">proactively responding to criticisms at MagicCon 2025 in Atlanta</a>. “I know your line seems like the line, because it’s so clear of a line to you, but your line is just not everybody’s line. And as the guy who has to make the game, I have to respect everybody’s line.”</p> <p>Rosewater also dunked on <em>MT</em>G’s most popular format to prove his point. “I’m not a Commander fan,” he said. “To me, <em>Magic</em> is a strategic game. I love it because I win when I’m outthinking my opponent. Commander is not a strategic game. It is a political game; you’re playing the people.”</p>

No Switch 1 or Xbox versions.</p> <h2>A new report warns against pricing <em>GTA 6</em> at $100</h2> <p>Despite speculation that Rockstar Games’ upcoming sequel could be the first game to break the $100 barrier, a MIDiA Research study claims that less than half of players interested in <em>GTA 6</em> would buy it at that price point.</p> <p>“Our research shows that 59 percent of consumers have some interest in purchasing<em> GTA 6</em>, highlighting the immense appeal and commercial potential of the game,” analyst Brandon Sutton <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-much-will-gta-6-cost-new-research-claims-100-price-point-would-actually-leave-money-on-the-table">told <em>IGN</em></a>. “This notoriety also makes <em>GTA 6</em> the perfect test case to understand consumer expectations around video games pricing. Our findings should serve as a caution to game developers looking to raise game prices in the future.”</p> <p>One response to these findings might be: why not try every price for the game?

<p>Battlefield 6 reviews are out, the embargo is up, and new BF 6 details are spilling out by the second. One cool detail for PlayStation owners has been revealed, and it’s that the PS5 edition of Battlefield 6 can earn you more XP than other platforms.</p>



<p>The weeks of leaks and back-and-forth rivalry between Battlefield 6 and Black Ops 7 have culminated in this moment: The long-awaited Battlefield 6 launch. We’ve been assured the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-servers-should-be-ready-for-launch-day/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BF 6 servers should be ready</a> for the incoming day one rush, and there are even <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-battlefield-6-launch-patch-notes-movement-nerfs-weapon-handling-rebalanced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launch patch notes</a> already.</p>



<p>But now multiplayer bonuses revelations are next on the cards.</p>



<h2 id="h-you-can-earn-more-battlefield-6-multiplayer-xp-on-ps5-than-on-xbox-or-pc">You Can Earn More Battlefield 6 Multiplayer XP on PS5 Than on Xbox or PC</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Xbox players running to PlayStation. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p>As it’s been revealed on social media, if you’re playing Battlefield 6 on PlayStation, you can earn up to 15% additional XP, compared to Xbox and PC users, who are eligible for a maximum of 10%.</p>



<p>This may seem marginal, but it will add up in the long term. With so many player ranks and dozens of Battlefield 6 guns to level up, an extra 5% could be huge.</p>



<p>As it stands, you can earn 5% more XP for owning the game, a further 5% if you join a party, and a final 5% if you “Join a Party With 2+PlayStation Plus Subscribers.”</p>



<p>You can see the evidence for yourself, thanks to <a href="https://x.com/BFBulletin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Battlefield Bulletin</a>.</p>

<p>Do you think this minor benefit could encourage people to buy Battlefield 6 on PlayStation over Xbox and PC? With Call of Duty leaning heavily into Xbox over the years—thanks to the Microsoft and Activision merger—could this be the start of an exclusive partnership between PlayStation and Battlefield? Let us know in the comments and through the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

New Game Plus unlocks after completing the main story and will let players keep their unlocked Adventure Books.

                <p>Longtime Xbox devotees have recently seen several former exclusive games go to PlayStation 5, while Microsoft has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-price-hike-announced-now-costs-30-month-for-ultimate/1100-6535138/" data-ref-id="1100-6535138">raised prices on Game Pass</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-is-raising-xbox-prices-in-the-us-again/1100-6534892/" data-ref-id="1100-6534892">Xbox consoles in the US</a>. Now, one of Xbox's original team members, Laura Fryer, is calling out her former employer and describing the price increases as a "betrayal" of the trust that gamers placed in them.</p><p>"With this latest increase to Game Pass, Xbox threw away one of their last advantages," said Fryer in her <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGh1-W-nYQA" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">latest YouTube video</a>. "They were the best deal in gaming... With these price hikes, it feels like a betrayal, like greed over gaming... I recognize that this Xbox console generation isn't over yet, it's almost certainly going to be remembered first and foremost for Microsoft's greed."</p><p>Fryer went on to recap the two hardware price increases this generation, three separate Game Pass price increases, more expensive games, massive layoffs, and multiple studio layoffs.</p><p>"I believe all of these changes and drama will harm Microsoft's brand," said Fryer. "It appears that Xbox is moving towards cloud gaming and away from hardware, but it also could be that they're just incompetent, that they just don't understand what they're doing... They need to rebuild trust with gamers and fans. I know people on the Xbox team that are still there that were there in the early days... They can fix this and I'm rooting for them and wishing them the best."</p><p>Fryer previously shared her belief that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-has-no-desire-to-make-hardware-anymore-founding-team-member-says/1100-6532825/" data-ref-id="1100-6532825">Xbox is abandoning hardware</a> by outsourcing the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-rog-ally-windows-handheld-revealed-releases-holiday-2025/1100-6532245/" data-ref-id="1100-6532245">ROG Xbox Ally handheld devices</a> to Asus.

            <p>Sony and AMD just announced three key technologies that look likely to come to the PlayStation 6 and future AMD graphics cards, with PS5 system architect Mark Cerny and AMD senior vice president Jack Huynh teaming up to deliver the news. The talk is fairly technical, but the three core features - Neural Arrays, Radiance Cores and Universal Compression - look set to make a big impact on future AMD-based hardware. The main goal is speeding up computionally-expensive ray tracing and path tracing in some novel ways, as well as reducing the cost of the upscaling and denoising techniques they rely on. </p>
<p>Let's start with Neural Arrays. In short, this is a new arrangement of the dozens of Compute Units (CUs) that make up a graphics processor like that in the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a>. Normally each of these CUs work alone on a bite-sized piece of the puzzle, which makes sense for most tasks, but can be inefficient for upscaling techniques like FSR or PSSR. Neural Arrays therefore link multiple CUs together in a "smart, efficient way", like a "single, focused AI engine". </p>
<p>The benefit is that this ought to allow for bigger (and therefore higher quality) machine learning models, with less overhead and better scalability. To say it another way, it means that an upscaling algorithm like PSSR ought to run faster at a given quality level, or accomplish more in a given time frame. The same speed-up also applies to denoising algorithms, which are important for ray-traced or path-traced graphics. </p>

<figcaption>Here's the full announcement. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCMzw-_dMw" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>


<p>Huynh also promises that Neural Arrays will allow for new features, including "dedicated innovations that bring cinematic rendering to an entirely new level." </p>
<p>Radiance Cores are the second new technology, and they're firmly a hardware change. Essentially, this is a new dedicated hardware block in next-generation AMD graphics processors that's "designed for unified light transport", ie ray tracing and path tracing. In the PC space, Nvidia has long held a ray tracing performance advantage thanks to its RT cores, and it looks like finally AMD is adopting a similar strategy. </p><p>Just as other dedicated hardware we've seen appear in graphics cards over the years, such as those that deal with media encoding or AI processing, Radiance Cores accomplish their given task faster than doing the same thing on more generic hardware. This speeds up the intensive work of ray traversal - "digging through complex data structures to locate where the millions of rays being cast hit the millions of triangles in the scene geometry". </p>
<p>As well as the speed-up from having dedicated hardware, this change also unburdens the CPU and the rest of the GPU - so that they can perform the things they're best suited for, such as simulation and geometry on the CPU and shading and lighting on the GPU. </p>
<figure data-count="2" role="group"><figure>

</figure><figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Sony</cite></span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The final bit of tech Sony and AMD announced is called Universal Compression, and thankfully it's a bit easier to explain. In short, it's a system that compresses everything that goes out to GPU memory, rather than just a few data types like textures, as is currently the case on the PS5 and PS5 Pro. Again, this is along similar lines to an existing Nvidia technology, in this case Neural Texture Compression. </p><p>By adding this compression step, effective GPU memory bandwidth is much higher. That means frame-rates might increase if you're bandwidth-limited, but more importantly it allows for higher-quality assets and reduces power consumption too. This technique has broad positive implications, but it also specifically helps make both Neural Arrays and Radiance Cores more effective. </p>
<p>These technologies currently exist only in simulation, according to Cerny, but clearly both parties are confident enough to detail them at this early stage. Huynh also mentions that AMD is aiming to bring the technologies to developers "across every gaming platform", which would follow in the company's general approach of open-sourcing its graphics innovations. </p>
<figure>

<figcaption>Universal Compression is a more extreme version of the Delta Color Compression used on the PS5 and PS5 Pro, which compresses all data sent to graphics memory.  | <span>Image credit: <cite>Sony</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It will be fascinating to see how these technologies work when they start to be realised in real hardware, and given the Project Amethyst partnership thus far, it seems reasonable to assume that the two companies will make further announcements over the next few years as the tech gets closer to completion - and when the expected PlayStation 6 is officially announced. </p><p>Beyond the rumoured PlayStation 6, we could also see these approaches being used in a PlayStation or Windows-based gaming handheld. Power consumption and memory bandwidth limitations are key challenges for any mobile form factor, so no doubt the likes of Valve, Asus and Lenovo would be mighty interested in any significant advancements. Valve has famously said that they're waiting for a "<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/steam-deck-wont-have-yearly-refreshes-because-its-not-really-fair-to-your-customers-says-valve">generational leap</a>" to justify a Steam Deck 2, and this might just qualify. </p>
<p>Similarly, this is huge news for fans of AMD desktop graphics cards, which have traditionally offered great price to performance in rasterised games and plenty of VRAM, but have fallen behind Nvidia alternatives in terms of RT performance and other features. AMD could massively close the gap here, and that's an exciting prospect. </p>
<p>Either way, I'm happy to see Sony and AMD share the fruits of their partnership so openly, and it's certainly food for thought when it comes to seeing how Sony, AMD and other tech giants are looking to circumvent <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-how-playstation-5-pro-lays-the-groundwork-for-ps6-and-beyond">the rise in silicon costs</a> that has prevented faster, cheaper models from arriving this console generation. </p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/news/797640/sony-ps6-handheld-gpu-ray-path-tracing-amd-radiance-cores</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-teases-new-gpu-tech-for-the-ps6.1320976/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Sony’s next console (presumably the PS6) is coming in “a few years time,” according to someone who I’d believe to make that claim. Mark Cerny, lead architect on the PS5 and PS5 Pro, joined Jack Huynh, SVP and GM of AMD’s computing and graphics group, in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCMzw-_dMw">YouTube video</a> wherein the pair spend nine minutes going through some very specific, co-developed advancements in graphics technology that will come to the next console. But the pair cautioned that the technologies are still in “very early days” and “only exist in simulation right now.”</p><p>Much of it boils down to how the companies are working to make it easier for future GPUs to handle graphics upscaling, ray tracing, and the super-intensive path tracing techniques used to make game worlds look more realistic. Cerny says “the current approach has reached its limit,” so Sony is working with AMD to integrate components of its next-gen RDNA architecture in future consoles. AMD’s Huynh introduced Radiance Cores (similar in theory to Nvidia’s RT Cores) that are dedicated to handling ray tracing and path tracing. In addition to Sony’s new consoles having the new cores, they will almost certainly be built into AMD’s future desktop GPUs, too, and likely within whatever it’s assisting with in its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/688407/microsoft-next-gen-xbox-cloud-amd">Xbox partnership</a>.</p><p>The Radiance Cores supposedly deliver a speed boost to performance, freeing up other components to quickly process shaders and textures instead of having to spin so many plates, so to speak. This new GPU tech will also benefit from advancements in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/pc-gaming/671961/amd-fsr-redstone-rdna-4">AMD’s FSR Redstone</a>, its latest AI-assisted upscaling technology, such as Neural Radiance Caching, as well as likely whatever upscaling tech comes after.</p><p>Another key area of improvement is compression, which will free up more bandwidth for GPUs to run future games at peak performance and fidelity. Sony’s improving on the Delta Color Compression technique (used on the PS5 and PS5 Pro) that compress textures and render targets. Its next hardware will utilize the new, more efficient technique called Universal Compression that compresses <em>everything </em>in the pipeline. Huynh says this will let the GPU deliver “more detail, higher frame rates, and greater efficiency.” More compression could raise the performance ceiling of a GPU, so it should also let it run more efficiently in a low-power mode, should the need arise.</p><p>Speaking of, it’s easy to see how these improvements could benefit the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/25/24305337/sony-handheld-gaming-console-playstation-nintendo-microsoft">rumored PlayStation handheld</a> that’s allegedly in development. Sony and AMD’s work to reduce the stress on GPUs could theoretically be applied to any form factor, such as a handheld. Sony has already made strides in efficiency on the PS5, with a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/712212/sony-ps5-power-saver-handheld-rumors">new Power Saver mode</a> that can scale back game performance in favor of lower power consumption. In a nutshell, those are the key ingredients necessary to run games on a handheld.</p><p>It’s encouraging to see Sony being proactive about showing how it’s working to make the GPUs in its upcoming devices (be it the PS6 or a handheld) as capable as possible. For now, we’ll pretend that this news doesn’t cast a shadow over the aging PS5 and the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/24289319/ps5-pro-review">not-as-powerful-as-we’d-hoped PS5 Pro</a>.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTU2Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Cameron Faulkner</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/797640/sony-ps6-handheld-gpu-ray-path-tracing-amd-radiance-cores]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-is-a-pivotal-moment-for-the-series-%E2%80%94-and-ea.1320973/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Battlefield 6</em> is one of EA’s most important launches in years. As the company becomes laser-focused on big, bankable franchises and looks to compete with the beast that is Activision’s <em>Call of Duty</em>, EA needs <em>Battlefield 6</em> to be a hit when it debuts on October 10th — especially after the previous game in the series had a rough release — and it’s putting an incredible amount of effort into making it successful. The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/787112/electronic-arts-55-billion-privacte-acquisition-pif-silver-lake-affinity-partners">recently announced $55 billion deal to take EA private</a> has only upped the stakes.</p><p>“EA’s fate is tightly tied to <em>Battlefield</em>,” New York University games professor Joost van Dreunen tells <em>The Verge</em>. “If <em>Battlefield 6</em> underperforms, it will call into question the strength of EA’s non-sports portfolio. At that point, the company faces pressure to rethink its strategy, perhaps even to divest and lean more heavily on the dependable sports business. It makes <em>Battlefield</em> a bellwether that will tell us if EA can still compete in blockbuster shooters.”</p><p>The pressure for <em>Battlefield 6</em> started building almost immediately after <em>Battlefield 2042</em>’s disastrous 2021 debut. The multiplayer-only <em>2042</em> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22524753/battlefield-2042-release-date-trailer-ps4-ps5-xbox-pc">added huge, 128-player battles</a> to a franchise already known for epic multiplayer skirmishes. But the game had a rough, <a href="https://www.vg247.com/battlefield-2042-bugs-fixes-known-issues">bug-filled launch</a> that necessitated multiple patches <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-2042/news/battlefield-2042-update-notes-1">shortly</a> <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-2042/news/battlefield-2042-update-notes-2">after</a> <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-2042/news/battlefield-2042-update-notes-3?isLocalized=true">release</a>. EA <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/2/22814517/ea-battlefield-vince-zampella-apex-legends-respawn-boss-ceo-shakeup">moved quickly</a> to put Vince Zampella, cofounder of <em>Apex Legends</em>-maker Respawn Entertainment and former head of <em>Call of Duty</em> studio Infinity Ward, in charge of the <em>Battlefield</em> series to help right the ship. But the damage was already done. A few months after <em>2042</em> came out, EA CEO Andrew Wilson <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/1/22913193/ea-battlefield-2042-launch-expectations">put things bluntly</a> on an earnings call: “The launch of <em>Battlefield 2042</em> did not meet expectations.”</p><p>The <em>Battlefield</em> series kicked off with <em>Battlefield 1942</em> in 2002, and even that first game had a reputation for its big multiplayer battles. I have a memory of a hectic, shenanigans-filled match in an older <em>Battlefield</em> at a LAN cafe when I was a teenager. But the franchise has been steadily overtaken by Activision’s <em>Call of Duty</em> as <em>the</em> multiplayer shooter — especially because <em>COD</em> now has an enormous amount of resources behind it for annual releases and major <em>Warzone</em> updates.</p><p>Despite the rocky launch, EA has kept <em>2042</em> going, even releasing <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-2042/news/battlefield-2042-update-notes-9-2-0">a surprise update in August</a> that added new weapons, vehicles, and a map. But it’s been clear for a long time that EA has been focusing much more on the <em>future</em> of the <em>Battlefield</em> franchise. Activision has several dedicated studios focused on <em>Call of Duty</em> that lets it launch a new blockbuster game nearly every year. <em>Battlefield</em> has historically been developed by Dice, but EA roped in three additional studios — Criterion, Motive, and Ripple Effect — to create a new Battlefield Studios structure so that it can make a better push to compete. (EA reportedly wants to get <em>Battlefield</em> on a similar type of <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/analyst-says-ea-plans-to-milk-battlefield-for-everything-its-worth-their-goal-is-three-studios-making-battlefield-on-a-3-year-basis-so-they-can-get-to-battlefield-annually/">annual release cadence as <em>Call of Duty</em></a>.)</p><p>Even though EA is also known for titles like <em>Mass Effect</em> and <em>Plants vs. Zombies</em>, most of its money comes from a small number of franchises, along with add-ons like microtransactions and battle passes. Live service revenue is already big money for EA; according to its most recent <a href="https://s204.q4cdn.com/701424631/files/doc_financials/2026/q1/Q1-FY26-Earnings-Release-FINAL1.pdf">quarterly earnings report</a>, 83 percent of its net revenue came from “live services and other.” If <em>Battlefield 6</em> is successful over the long term, that potentially makes the game a big cash cow for EA.</p><div><p>Perhaps more than anything, if <em>Battlefield 6</em> is a success, it gives the company another annual game that’s almost a sure hit. EA found a way to keep its soccer franchise going even after it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/10/23065405/ea-sports-fc-fifa-branding">dropped the <em>FIFA</em> branding</a>. It brought back an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/16/24158294/ea-sports-brings-college-football-back-to-game-consoles-on-july-19th">annual college football game last year</a>, meaning it now has two American football titles it can release annually. The next-generation release in <em>The Sims</em> series, codenamed “Project Rene,” will be free and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/12/23870172/project-rene-next-gen-sims-free">won’t replace</a> the hugely successful <em>The Sims 4</em>, which just got <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-4s-adventure-awaits-expansion-is-exactly-the-kind-of-getaway-ive-been-looking-for">its 20th expansion</a>. EA even just launched a new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/761186/ea-skate-free-to-play-early-access-release-date">live service version of <em>Skate</em></a>, and even though that’s still in early access, <a href="https://x.com/skate/status/1975229570807890000">more than 15 million players have already tried it</a>.</p></div><p>Beyond overcoming the stigma of <em>2042’s</em> poor launch, <em>Battlefield 6</em> also has the uphill battle of competing with the many other enduring multiplayer shooters on the market like <em>Fortnite</em>, <em>Counter-Strike 2</em>, and <em>Valorant</em> (a lesson <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/4/24235163/concord-cancellation-live-service-games">Sony learned the hard way</a>). Those also all have the advantage of being free-to-play games, while EA has to convince people to shell out a minimum of $69.99 for <em>Battlefield 6</em>, something that’s especially challenging when a third of video game players buy a new game less often than once per year, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m27zezw2ek2v">according to Circana data</a>. It’s not an impossible hurdle — the annual <em>Call of Duty</em> releases <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/circana-confirms-black-ops-6-is-2024s-biggest-hit-but-overall-game-spend-in-the-us-falls-9-yoy">still do numbers</a> — but EA has its work cut out.</p><div><p>And this was all the case <em>before</em> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/787723/ea-private-deal-buyout-future-games-layoffs">EA announced a $55 billion deal to take the company private</a> — a deal that includes $20 billion of debt financing. Should the deal go through, that debt adds a lot of money that the new version of EA will have to pay down, and the company could lean on <em>Battlefield 6</em> — and the in-development <a href="https://www.ea.com/en/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/community-update-battle-royale-testing"><em>Battlefield</em> battle royale</a> as well as future <em>Battlefield</em> titles — to help. The deal could <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/787723/ea-private-deal-buyout-future-games-layoffs">also eventually mean</a> cost-cutting measures like layoffs, like what Microsoft did <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/25/24049050/microsoft-activision-blizzard-layoffs">following its Activision Blizzard acquisition</a>.</p></div><p>From what I’ve played of <em>Battlefield 6</em>, I feel like EA’s efforts may have paid off. I’ve spent the most time with the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lw4WBofOkLE">single-player campaign</a>, a gripping thriller where an unstable NATO has to fight back against a shadowy private military group called Pax Armata. So far, it’s filled with chaotic firefights where I almost always feel like I survive by the skin of my teeth. One memorable mission involved night vision goggles, rising tensions between the city’s citizens and Pax Armata, and, eventually, taking down a helicopter. Though, in a chilling moment that made me lose some appetite to keep playing, the in-game helicopter once flew by at the same time <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/06/us/oregon-national-guard-trump-ruling-portland-hnk">a real military helicopter flew over</a> my home in Portland.</p><p>I’ve only dabbled a bit in multiplayer, but the matches I’ve played have been frantic and exciting, and I really like playing with a lot of other soldiers around me. (Even if, because of the relatively small playerbase during the review period, I was usually playing mostly against bots.) I’m a poor shot, so when I would get frustrated dying over and over again, I’d focus on reviving my teammates. And while the <a href="https://www.ea.com/en/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/pc-portal-experience">sandbox Portal mode</a> wasn’t available during the review period, I’m guessing players will create some wild, imaginative new experiences that could be worth coming back for.</p><p>Early signs look good for <em>Battlefield 6</em>, and it has all of the pieces in place for a successful launch. But <em>Battlefield 6</em> needs to be more than that — it needs to be a hit long after it first comes out. The future of EA depends on it.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/795232/ea-battlefield-6-hit-launch-deal]]></content:encoded>

              <p>Prime Big Deal Days may be over, but some of the best discounts are still alive on Amazon from brands like Samsung, SanDisk, Dyson, and, yes, even Amazon itself. Pretty much every Amazon-branded product is seeing a discount during the event and that includes the smart home hub, the Echo Dot. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4514/">This 2022 smart speaker is still priced at just $35, the same as it was during Prime Day.&nbsp;</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4514/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Vibrant Sound</h2>
<p>The Echo Dot is the standard Echo’s little brother. Even though its smaller, the smart speaker is still capable of producing powerful sound with a rich and deep bass with its 1.73-inch front-firing speaker You can listen to your favorite music, audiobooks, or podcasts with clear vocals and dialogue, even when you are rooms away.</p>
<p>Since the Echo Dot is a smart home hub, you can take control of all the other smart products in your home using just your voice. If you have smart RGB bulbs installed in you lamps, you can ask Alexa to dim them, or adjust to a spooky orange and purple glow for a Halloween party. With as smart thermostat, you can ask it to turn down the temperature when it’s starting to feel a bit warm. And you can do it from the comfort of your couch with your phone still in your pocket.</p>



<p>Echo Dots can answer questions, keep your schedule, or set timers when cooking or running laundry. I frequently find myself asking what the weather is like in the morning when getting ready as I will constantly forget where I set my phone down as I dart between the kitchen, bedroom, and bathroom. If you have more than one Echo device ( or just the Alexa app installed on your phones) you can connect with friends or family from different rooms of the house. Start a call from the Echo Dot in your kitchen to the Echo Dot in your basement to let the kids know dinner’s ready and it’s time to pause the game. It’s the new age version of connecting two cups together with a long string.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4514/">The Echo Dot from Amazon is available in three different colors. Each happen to be on sale for $15 off.</a> Choose between either charcoal, glacier white, or deep sea blue, all of which are just $35 during the post-Prime Big Deals Day at Amazon.</p>

<h3 id="h-movement-nerfs">Movement Nerfs</h3>



<p>Movement has been adjusted significantly from the Battlefield 6 beta, with reduced slide-to-jump momentum, lower jump height, and increased inaccuracy when firing while airborne or sliding.</p>



<p>These changes should make the game significantly different from Black Ops 7, where run-and-gun mechanics are a huge part of the game and have been enhanced further with wall jumping.</p>



<h3 id="h-weapon-handling-rebalanced">Weapon Handling Rebalanced</h3>



<p>Weapon handling in Battlefield 6 has been rebalanced from the beta, with recoil tuning and adjustments that “ensure more consistent gunplay.”</p>



<h3 id="h-rush-amp-breakthrough-layouts-revised">Rush &amp; Breakthrough Layouts Revised</h3>



<p>As indicated in the early patch notes, Rush and Breakthrough maps have been revised to “deliver a better balance between Attackers and Defenders,” which should result in more enjoyable gameplay in these modes.</p>



<h3 id="h-map-improvements">Map Improvements</h3>



<p>Maps in Battlefield 6 have been give a face lift, resulting in better traversal, lighting adjustments, and overall performance upgrades. We’ll have to wait until we’re in the game to get the full experience.</p>

            <p>MachineGames is celebrating its 15th anniversary by updating last year's <a href="https://eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, following its DLC last month.</p>
<p>The biggest addition is New Game+, which allows players to carry over Adventure Books and unspent Adventure Points, currency, and Medicine Bottles from a previous playthrough. What's more, completing the game again in this mode will unlock a brand new ending after the credits.</p>
<p>Secondly, the Cairo outfit has been added, inspired by Indy's jacket-free look in Raiders of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lost-ark">Lost Ark</a> (see header image).</p>

<p>Thirdly, new language options will allow players to mix and match voice languages and subtitles.</p>
<p>The update will be available across Xbox Series X/S, PC, and PS5 from 10th October.</p>
<p>It also brings a number of other fixes and tweaks you can see listed below.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>General Fixes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where enemies might linger in their “stumble” animation if you punched them while they’re breaking out of your grab.</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>UI</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The price of guides and books now show correctly when inspecting them from one of the vendors.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>PC Specific Fixes</strong></p>
<ul>

<li>Fixed an issue where setting Reflections to the lowest quality made certain objects look completely black.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Localization</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In Arabic, fixed the alignment of the quick-inventory warning text about restricted zones.</li>
</ul></blockquote>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Every couple of years I decide I’m going to learn to play chess, because it feels like the kind of thing a well-rounded adult knows how to do. Usually, I can mostly remember how all the pieces move, but I’ve never been great at thinking enough moves ahead to really <em>play</em> the game. So I’m not that good at <em>Below the Crown</em>, but, like regular chess, I keep throwing myself at it anyway.</p><p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1883920/Below_the_Crown/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Below the Crown</em></a> is an upcoming early access game by Misfits Attic, the folks behind 2016’s <em>Duskers</em>. It’s a combination of a roguelike dungeon crawler and chess: Your characters are chess pieces, who follow the rules of the traditional game, but the board is a dungeon, full of walls and hazards. You have to get your king to a door to the next room of the dungeon, using them and other pieces you play via cards to capture the enemy pieces or put the enemy king in check.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Below the Crown - Official Reveal Trailer | The MIX Fall Game Showcase 2025" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/40HNDcQ01uY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>It’s not just chess on a weird board: as you progress, you get spell cards or can upgrade your pieces to have new abilities. I’ve used a spell to freeze troublesome opponents, transformed one of my pieces into a bishop to knock out a diagonal enemy, and upgraded a piece to be able to wrap around the board and have more movement options. The game also has a lot of tools to help you out–you can undo a limited number of moves, get a hint for the best move to make, and show unsafe spaces to help you plan. </p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Below the Crown - Official Gameplay Overview Trailer | Indie Fan Fest Fall 2025" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/muhNLNbTBpE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>The chess of it all comes from the thinking ahead, remembering how pieces move and imagining all the possible outcomes. At the same time, pieces’ upgrades and abilities mean you also have to think like a fantasy dungeon crawler or turn-based video game. These two genres work together to create a game that moves slowly and thoughtfully, but also has moments of action and clever strategy. The combination of traditional dungeon design and a sort of cyberpunk overlay and art style heighten the feeling that you’re playing something super <em>weird</em>, but also really cool. It hasn't made me any better at chess, which at this point in my life I don't think anything will, but it lets me <em>feel</em> like I'm playing chess while also playing kinds of games I'm a bit less hopeless at.</p><p><em>Below the Crown</em> has a Steam demo out now, and comes to early access November 10.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/baby-steps-manbreaker-did-not-break-me-challange"><h3>Baby Steps’ Manbreaker Did Not Break Me</h3></a><p>Baby Steps' Manbreaker is an optional, brutal challenge that is as much a test of your humility as it is your skill.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/epic-games-suing-two-fortnite-island-makers-over-inflated-bot-engagement"><h3>Epic Games Suing Two Fortnite Island Makers Over Inflated ‘Bot’ Engagement</h3></a><p>Epic Games says Idris Nahdi and Ayob Nasser made tens of thousands of dollars worth of ‘unwarranted payouts’</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/100-meters-gkids-anime-movie-kenji-iwaisawa-director-interview"><h3>100 Meters Director On Capturing The Art And Agony Of Track And Field Through Rotoscope Animation</h3></a><p>Kenji Iwaisawa hopes his film adaptation will be “the first of its kind” to bring the quiet intensity of track to the big screen</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/hades-2-ending"><h3>Hades 2’s Story Doesn’t Change The Status Quo</h3></a><p>Melinoë's journey is more about acceptance than change</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/chess-dungeon-crawler-yeah]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[Battlefield 6 Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/09/battlefield-6-review/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-review.1320928/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Battlefield 6 has been a long time coming, arguably all the way back to when we assumed this was what Battlefield 2042 would be called. This is actually a return to what Battlefield has done best over the decades, with 64-player battles, a modern warfare setting, defined classes, and a steady sense of player progression that feels like the good old days. It’s as close to a modernised Battlefield 3 or 4 as you could hope for, and the franchise’s best shot to meaningfully challenge Call of Duty in almost a decade.</p>
<p><iframe title="Battlefield 6 Review –&nbsp;Finally, a Battlefield 4 sequel" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/it1ZxHggEl4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>With a week of pre-release multiplayer sessions under my belt, it definitely strikes a lot of the right notes for me. At the heart of Battlefield 6 are series staple large scale game modes, with Conquest and Breakthrough leading the way – the first an open map with check points, the other pitting attackers against defenders to fight from one side of the map to the other. Rush, in this iteration, is more like a 12v12 shrunk down version of Breakthrough. Joining them is Escalation, which takes Conquest and ramps the stakes up over time. Starting with seven control points, you need to hold more than the other team to build up a meter to try and score a point, at which point the map shrinks by one objective and you go again, with more and heavier vehicles unlocking over time. The first to three points wins, but this can really swing back and forth, and it can be really rather fun.</p>



<p>The map rotation we experienced put a lot more emphasis on the city maps than those with more open spaces. Six of the nine maps are in towns or cities, and I’ll be honest, I was fine with that – I did partake in the occasional Operation Locker grindfest back in the day. These offer up mazes of buildings and rooms, letting infantry be the focus and showcasing this game’s take on destruction. There’s quite a good balance to this effect, giving the effect of destruction, both cosmetic and impactful, without letting you fully level a map in the style of Bad Company 2. While I enjoyed this, there is an imbalance here and the game does need more open maps. As popular as Operation Firestorm is, it’s going to do a lot of heavy lifting here alongside the mountainside battling on Liberation Peak, and the one other open level, Mirak Valley. There’s also an oddity with one map – Saints Quarter – which isn’t usable for any large modes.</p>

<p>The big modes are then joined by small scale modes TDM, Squad DM, Domination, King of the Hill, and it’s here that I really got to grips with weapon handling and the pace of battle. The time to kill can be very quick, and there’s a lot more sliding round corners these days, but this forced me to consider my approach a bit more, instead of just rushing headlong into the fray. That and the pre-launch lobbies needing a bit of help from bots to fill the player count did wonders for my K:D ratio.</p>

<p>There’s a traditional set of four character classes, which harks back to Battlefield: Bad Company 2 by combining medic, ammo supply and LMG into the Support class, which allows Assault to be a two-gun frontline soldier, Engineer to really focus on anti-vehicle gear, and Recon for sniping, spotting and sneaky spawn points. It is, I think, close to being a perfect blend of roles and duties, and while open gun choice does muddy the waters a little bit, I think the class bonuses for sticking to their particular signature weapon is enough, and there’s enough weapons within each bucket to let you lean in a different direction as well. The second LMG has a rapid 30-bullet clip that makes it more like an AR, for example, especially with foregrips enhancing your aim. I feel there’s been some positive changes since the beta here as well, so the Assault doesn’t have totally free reign with their second weapon choice, and they might consider a breaching charge instead double weapons to lean into the level destruction.</p>
<p>Progression is generally quite straightforward. Weapons and gear are unlocked as you rank up, and then attachments come via weapon mastery –&nbsp;using it lots, in other words. Feeding this is a slew of basic daily challenges to score with a particular class and weapon, such that open weapons are really useful, and then weekly challenges that can get more specific, as well as overarching challenges that grant specific XP boosts or cosmetic unlocks.</p>

<p>You’re rewarded mid-battle as well through Field Specs. Yes, you have your key gear and equipment, but you also gain class and role-specific buffs and boosts as you earn points in a round. Assault can passively get better movement speeds while aiming, Support the ability to share life and ammo with nearby allies, and so on. There’s only a couple Field Specs per class, so this feels like an area for DICE to expand on through future seasons.</p>
<p>This is, of course, a live service game, and after fluffing their lines for the last couple games, Season 1 for Battlefield 6 promises two new maps and a seasonal makeover through the end of this year, as well as half a dozen new weapons, a new vehicle, new mode and more. That’s a significant improvement, and it’s also before talking about the Battle Royale game mode that’s coming down the pipe. We don’t know precisely what the long term monetisation will look like at the moment, outside of there being a battle pass and expected cosmetics. The developers have repeatedly stated the intent to stick to grounded military looks, and that’s true of the base game, but with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/28/electronic-arts-saudi-investment-fund-trump/">EA’s impending ownership change</a>, you might wonder if <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/26/cristiano-ronaldo-joins-the-fatal-fury-city-of-the-wolves-roster/">a&nbsp;Cristiano Ronaldo skin will be unceremoniously shoved in eventually</a>.</p>

<p>That will live alongside Portal, which puts sweeping editing tools in the hands of players to create custom levels and game modes. Playing on PS5, we don’t get to fiddle with these tools and they weren’t available pre-launch regardless, but there’s already officially created infantry-only versions of Breakthrough and Conquest, and a Hardcore mode from the off. They’re splintered off from the default game mode selections – just as the Closed Weapon playlist is hidden away – and they’ll have to do a lot to ensure that the best experiences are made discoverable, but it’s good that they’re there.</p>
<p>While multiplayer is obviously the main part of Battlefield 6, this game sees the return of a single player campaign, a side to the franchise that has swung between highs and lows since the first effort in Bad Company. In this case, it’s just too by the numbers, and lacking in polish.</p>

<p>NATO is under attack by a mysterious PMC known as Pax Armata, whose rise rapidly escalates from a territorial rivalry into all-out conflict through Gibraltar, New York, and beyond. There’s some fun highlights and grand spectacle, squeezing in some Battlefield staples, like repairing a tank through urban combat and open area missions later on, but it’s wrapped up in a largely uninteresting mystery and the presentation isn’t up to snuff.</p>
<p>There’s missing canned animations, there’s mission scripting that doesn’t trigger properly if you outpace your AI team or do things in atypical ways, and the enemy AI is just painfully dumb. Then there’s the story beats that don’t land because interpersonal relationships and conflict aren’t in the final game, there’s cutscenes that take take control away from you for highlight moments that you should 100% be playing, and which have so much shaky cam that even Jason Bourne would need a sit down.</p>
<p>This is the part of the game that really needed more time, and it’s a shame that Motive and Criterion, who led the campaign’s development, didn’t get it.</p>

			<div><header>Game Info</header><div><div>
						<h5>Battlefield 6</h5><p><span>October 10, 2025</span>
					</p></div><div>
							<h5>Platform</h5><p><span>PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S</span>
						</p></div><div>
							<h5>Developer</h5><p><span>Battlefield Studios (DICE, Ripple Effect, Criterion, Motive)</span>
						</p></div></div></div>			
			<p>Battlefield 6 has a lot on its shoulders. EA put the effort of four studios together under the Battlefield Studios banner (Motive, Criterion, Ripple Effect, and DICE) to try and get a win for the series after the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-acknowledges-disappointing-battlefield-2042-reception/">overall loss that was Battlefield 2042</a>. As of last week, it has to try to get people to forget that, in a year's time, EA will <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-confirms-agreement-to-be-acquired-by-pif-silver-lake-and-affinity-partners-for-55-billion/">likely be a very different company under its new ownership</a>, despite what chief executive officer Andrew Wilson might claim. It also has to try to compete with an annual franchise <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-games-almost-half-of-all-best-selling-playstation-games-in-us/">that makes up for nearly half the best-selling games on what is arguably the biggest console platform</a>.</p>



<p>Battlefield 6 has to be good enough to account for all of that and <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-targeting-100-million-players/">hit the insane expectations that EA has for the game</a>. So is it good enough to do all of that? Well, not really. If you were already rethinking your purchasing habits towards EA games based on who its new owners will be next year, if/when its privatization deal goes through, Battlefield 6 probably isn't going to stop you, nor is it a hill to die on. Can it compete head-to-head with Call of Duty on the sales charts? Again, probably not, though at the time of this writing, it seems to have more public favour than Call of Duty, so we'll see where we stand by the end of the year.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Haz Carter in Battlefield 6.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>But can it make up for Battlefield 2042, and be definitive proof that this long-running series is back in fighting shape? Absolutely. Battlefield 6 is undoubtedly one of the best Battlefield games ever. What we all played and felt in the beta this summer was real; this is a return to form for the series, with large, well-designed maps and destruction mechanics that drive the idea of being in the middle of a major battle home.</p>



<p>A wide array of weapons that sound great and feel punchy to use, stunning visuals on every front, and as a small cherry on top, an actual campaign mode. It's unfortunate that the campaign isn't actually very memorable or overall that good, but it's better than nothing, and even a bit better than that.</p>



<p>Let me start there. The campaign takes place over the course of nine missions, and over the course of the six or so hours it took to play them, there are some truly stunning moments of spectacle. Battlefield is already capable of creating cinematic moments in its multiplayer, so it wasn't surprising to see it accomplish the same in an environment where it could carefully plan out and direct those moments for players.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>(From left to right) Gecko, Lopez, and Hemlock in Battlefield 6.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Which is what makes it even more mind-boggling that those moments aren't everywhere in this campaign. I wouldn't say any of the missions are necessarily bad or that they're not fun to play through. They all reach a pretty fair quality bar, and they are all fun. Only a few of them, however, actually step up to the kind of quality that I'd expect from a campaign in a triple-A first-person shooter. I'm not saying it needed to have <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/baldurs-gate-3-review/">Baldur's Gate 3</a>-level writing and characters, or that there should be environmental storytelling that rivals <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-make-way-for-the-elden-lord/">Elden Ring</a>. I think we all know the score with shooter campaigns. </p>



<p>The most memorable ones play out like a really well-put-together action movie, with characters that are engaging enough so you care about them when they're in jeopardy, a score that properly backs up high-stakes moments, and spectacular, stunning, jaw-dropping action. And of course, the gameplay has to be solid throughout.</p>



<p>Battlefield 6 sees you step into the boots of different members of the Dagger 1-3 squad, beginning with a cutscene where the Dagger squad has infiltrated the house of someone who you learn is their CIA handler, Melissa Mills. The year is 2028, and in Battlefield 6's fictional version of Earth, a private military coalition formed by multiple countries called Pax Armata has essentially waged war on the rest of the world and specifically anyone still part of NATO, caused enough political rifts to have even more countries on its side looking for protection, and is armed to the teeth with a seemingly endless supply of new weapons and recruits. They're generally faceless, save for an antagonist called Kincaid, not representative of any particular country, and the sort of 'enemy faction' that can be vague enough to try and remove any of the political realities of making a military shooter centred around American soldiers as the 'heroes.'</p>

<p>There are five members in Dagger 1-3, with the initial four each representing one of the classes you play as in multiplayer. Haz Carter is the squad leader and Assault character, Dylan Murphy is the squad's Engineer, Simone 'Gecko' Espina is the Recon member, and Cliff Lopez is the Support member of the squad. Hemlock is the fifth member of the squad, described as a CIA operative who we don't know much about. Almost like his poisonous name is meant to represent something deeper.</p>



<p>As Murphy interrogates Mills about the truth and the true objectives behind each of their missions, starting in 2027, you play through each of them, cutting back to the house for another cutscene to set up the next mission in between most of them. I don't want to spoil what happens, but I will say that it's terribly underwhelming the whole way through when it comes to the story. It falls particularly at the end, since it clearly sets up some sort of continuation that I have no doubt will be sold in a future DLC package or poorly continued through an element of Battlefield's live service trappings. That might sound cynical, but I don't have any reason not to be when it comes to EA repackaging elements of games that used to just be in the game you bought and reselling them to you in a drip feed and charging $25-a-pop for each.</p>



<p>Gameplay-wise, thankfully, it's a much better experience throughout. The first mission, 'Always Faithful', is a bombastic opening that starts things on the right foot. 'Night Raid' does a good job at filling the spot of obligatory night-vision-focused mission, and 'Moving Mountains' has a fun and intense chase sequence where you get the President out of a burning New York. The final two missions, 'Operation Ember Strike' and 'Always Forward', are perhaps the two most spectacle-filled missions across the whole campaign, and unsurprisingly, the best missions in the campaign.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Battlefield 6 campaign</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>What I did appreciate was how elements of the multiplayer made their way into the campaign. Since each level is mostly set within a map you'll play again and again in multiplayer matches, it was nice to see those maps still open to you in a way that lets you choose your own approach in each firefight. It wasn't so linear that you were completely on a track the whole time; you had the space to try a different route or strategy, including destroying the entire building that a Pax soldier was taking cover in. You could also be revived (though this option is removed on the hardest difficulty) and revive your squadmates, and they would respond to different call-outs you make, adding a small flavouring of tactical shooter gameplay to the campaign.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, that element isn't executed very well and is easily ignored. There were also more than a few bugs I encountered while playing. Some were small and more comical, like watching a floating pair of goggles be handed to me, and others were genuine interruptions, like how every time you made it to a point in the level where you watched a short in-game cutscene, it awkwardly set you in position, cutting whatever momentum you began to feel. </p>



<p>There was also plenty of visual pop-in, and when I consider the bugs, with the lacking story, and the fact that some levels didn't have the kind of action-spectacle I'd expect, and how very silly it felt every time a member of the squad would yell out, "<em>Engineer down!</em>" or a different bark that represented a Pax soldeir by his assumed class, it all left me feeling like Battlefield 6's campaign lacks a few layers of polish.</p>

<p>But even that still makes it a 'not bad' compared to other games at this scale doing a campaign, because most other shooters trying to be as big as Battlefield 6 don't even bother with a campaign nowadays. They go all-in on multiplayer.</p>



<p>Which is also true here, in many ways. In fact, when you finish the campaign, EA adds the "<em>Uninstall campaign</em>" button to the home screen to ensure you have enough space for the multiplayer and the constant updates it is sure to receive. So with that in mind, let's move on to the multiplayer, which is really what we're all here for.</p>



<p>A couple of bits of housekeeping to get out of the way first. Due to the fact that (<a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-ps5-retail-full-game-on-disk-no-download/">despite some copies getting into the wild</a>), there just simply weren't as many people playing in multiplayer matches over the course of the review period as there will be when the game is out and available to everyone, every match I played was filled with bots, one way or another.</p>



<p>I also didn't get to spend any time with Portal, though that's because it wasn't made available during the review period "<em>due to some unexpected infrastructure and global logistics issues</em>." EA clarified that the mode will be available at launch despite the issues preventing it from being available for reviews.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Battlefield 6 multiplayer</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>So the multiplayer experience I had for this review is not the one that you will have when you load up your first match on launch. But I can still talk about how the weapons feel, the maps, and the breadth of what's available to you in Battlefield 6's multiplayer.</p>



<p>Starting with the last point on that list: it's a lot. That's not to say it doesn't need more content, just that it has a good foundation at launch. There are seven game modes (not counting variations like CQB, Closed Weapons, or separating Squad and regular Team Deathmatch) for regular multiplayer play, each of them satisfying a different element of Battlefield gameplay. Conquest, Breakthrough, and Rush still deliver on the kind of spectacle I expect from a Battlefield game, and I'm very glad to see how well destruction has been implemented to add what was a missing piece from Battlefield 2042's gameplay.</p>



<p>Adding in the many variations on each mode, and the launch of Portal, and you'll always have an option for the kind of gameplay experience you want to have. It's also a strong suite of maps, though I already have favourites among the nine available at launch. Liberation Peak, Mirak Valley, and New Sobek City stand out as my top three maps for larger-scale battles, while Saints Quarter absolutely takes the cake for the close-quarters-focused maps. If anything, I would like to see smaller maps of the same calibre added to the roster sooner rather than later, since whenever I'm playing any other map, I just find myself wishing it were Saints Quarter instead.</p>



<p>That said, I don't want to see the large-scale maps get any bigger. I'd appreciate more verticality, but the size of these maps all feels just right for large-scale battles without feeling like you have to run for miles to get back into the action.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Battlefield 6 multiplayer</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>As I mentioned earlier regarding the weapons, they feel and sound great to use (the same goes for the vehicles), and I'm already enjoying working my way through to unlock each one, but I'm not entirely sold on how you unlock the full arsenal. It's not just about reaching an overall level or mastery; you have to complete specific challenges, which, on the one hand, is beneficial because you can focus on just completing that challenge instead of grinding to level 25 or whatever to unlock it. But I don't love how that switches your focus in a match from playing with your squad and completing the objective to completing your own personal goal, which might not be what your team needs in that moment.</p>



<p>I've no problem grinding for levels, I know that's the deal here, and I'm ready for that. It's a way to shake things up and opens an avenue through which you can dictate how you unlock and experience the weapons available. I'm just not sure I gel with it.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Battlefield 6 class loadouts UI</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>On the performance and technical side of things, besides the bugs I mentioned in the campaign, and some connection issues that were more likely due to something on my end or the fact that EA and Battlefield Studios were doing maintenance at times when the multiplayer servers were live for us to use, it was a smooth experience on my PlayStation 5 console. </p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>Of course, the reality when reviewing any multiplayer-focused game is that it will change. In six months' time, with new maps, weapons, vehicles, and game modes, Battlefield 6 could look entirely different. The <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-season-1-starts-october-28-roadmap-unveiled/">first new map, game mode, vehicle, and weapons</a> arrive before the end of the month on October 28. </p>



<p>And I'm really looking forward to it. The single-player experience might be lacking in polish, but the multiplayer experience couldn't be any shinier for launch. It's true; Battlefield is back, and I hope this is only the beginning, with the quality bar trending upwards from here.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/battlefield-6-review-war-on-unprecedented-scale</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-review-war-on-an-unprecedented-scale.1320916/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I used to have the time of my life with old&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/series/battlefield" rel="nofollow">Battlefield</a>&nbsp;</em>titles. You ever just take a grenade launcher to a house and completely demolish it in multiplayer, exposing enemy players to your gunfire? I thought the destruction in those games --&nbsp;<em>Bad Company 2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 3,&nbsp;</em>specifically -- was revolutionary, but we're in 2025, and&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6&nbsp;</em>is here to show you that destruction can get even bigger and better than ever.</p>

<p>Seriously, I can't get over how cool it is to fire tank missiles, grenades, and the like at buildings and blockades and see them crumble apart.&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6</em>&nbsp;goes all in on the cinematic, bombastic action and destruction it's known for, and delivers a powerful multiplayer experience, and, for better or for worse, a single-player campaign.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/battlefield-6-campaign.jpg?itok=rX4o2EQF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/battlefield-6-campaign.jpg?itok=YEwEy7fN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It does look beautiful, I'll give it that.</figcaption></figure><h2>Does the <em>Battlefield 6</em>&nbsp;Campaign Exceed Expectations?</h2>

<p>You heard that right,&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6&nbsp;</em>returns with a single-player story. I'm a sucker for campaigns, to the point that I found myself gravitating toward boomer shooters since most other <a href="https://techraptor.net/genre/first-person-shooter" rel="nofollow">FPS</a>' ditched singleplayer in favor of multiplayer-only content.</p>

<p>Needless to say, I was excited to see what&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6</em>&nbsp;had to offer. The year is 2028, and you play as multiple members of a special forces unit within the Marines, MARSOC. NATO's alliance is crumbling as it faces an unprecedented threat -- PAX Aramata.&nbsp;</p>

<p>PAX Armata is a fair compromise as a villain when you consider the current affairs of the world. Painting any particular country as a villain opens up a can of worms that is probably left closed. Any other enemy other than a fictitious one could hit too close to home. In this case, PAX Armata is like a conglomerate of mercenaries of no particular nation, yet they've managed to amass an army with the latest hardware.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/battlefield-6-campaign-explosions.jpg?itok=jGtqVC53 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/battlefield-6-campaign-explosions.jpg?itok=8j64jOQ7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Big ol' explosions! Whoom, boom!</figcaption></figure><p>Okay, that concept alone is already a little unrealistic, so I absolutely had to suspend my disbelief with&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6</em>. Perhaps I'm misremembering&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 3</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 4</em>'s campaigns, but I recall them being somewhat grounded in realism.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The campaign feels like something closer to&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty</em>&nbsp;than the&nbsp;<em>Battlefield&nbsp;</em>series I know. Or rather, it tries to imitate that over-the-top, action movie formula and fumbles. The plot is incoherently written to the point where most dialogue is military jargon that will fly over most players' heads, mine included.</p>

<p>It's a globe-trotting tale featuring your squad of Gary and Mary Sues. You'll fight PAX Armata in the backstreets of Cairo and in the rugged terrain of Tajikistan, and while I appreciate the variety of locales, something smaller and more focused would have been better than this hodgepodge of ideas thrown into a pot.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/battlefield-6-campaign-1.jpg?itok=mqTaSTd2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/battlefield-6-campaign-1.jpg?itok=wXJGRhjt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Gotta have a night vision level.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>The story ends so abruptly that I could scarcely believe it was over, not that I really cared for the story at that point. Thankfully, it's a pretty short narrative overall, so it's not there to waste your time. A lot of the campaign is actually to acquaint players with&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6</em>'s mechanics, like the squad dynamic and how vehicles operate.</p>

<p>Its gameplay, I suppose, is serviceable. There are some enjoyable, if mindless, sequences that can look amazingly cinematic. As an example, one mission has you command a tank platoon on the outskirts of Cairo. With a tank, you see&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6</em>'s destruction on full display, and it's chaotic, but bloody exciting as overpasses and buildings crumble before you.</p>

<p>There's one other mission that takes place within a large, open area. The type of landscape that the <em>Battlefield&nbsp;</em>is known for is these rural, sparsely populated war zones. You're supposed to take out several pieces of military hardware, and you can tackle those in whatever order.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/battlefield-6-sam.jpg?itok=Eg-SlXU5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/battlefield-6-sam.jpg?itok=907Ib-Kb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Down with SAM.</figcaption></figure><p>This non-linear mission shows a hint of promise and perhaps a vision for something greater, but that potential is never realized.&nbsp;You're even given a drone for this particular mission, which is horrifically effective and a bit scary when you think about how it's being used in real-life war.</p>

<p>And so, if you're able to turn your brain off, you'll actually find that the campaign can be enjoyable. Outside of the disappointing narrative, I didn't dislike its gameplay by any means because the gunplay in&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6</em>&nbsp;is so tight and refined, but mileage with it will vary. One playthrough is more than enough for me.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/battlefield-6-m277.jpg?itok=Ht6ERWIX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/battlefield-6-m277.jpg?itok=kqay0L3d 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>They could never make me hate you, M277.</figcaption></figure><h2>A Gun Nut's Delight</h2>

<p>Allow me to nerd out for a minute. Just a few years back, during the pandemic, the U.S. Army went out to bid for the Next Generation Squad Weapon. This was an effort to replace the now-dated M4, the de facto rifle of the time. In comes Sig Sauer's M7, the new rifle chosen to define the future of warfare.</p>

<p>The thing is, it's a pretty controversial firearm. Even though it conformed to the specs the U.S. Army put forth, it was a <em>hefty&nbsp;</em>boy.&nbsp;Not only that, it had a 20-round magazine (10 rounds less than its predecessor) in order to accommodate the larger cartridge it used.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is all to say, I'm a big stickler for gunplay in FPS games. It might not matter to some, but for me, how a weapon feels is pivotal to how I perceive the overall quality of the title.&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6</em>&nbsp;has, by far, some of the best gunplay in a AAA title, and this game's version of the M7 -- called M277 in this case -- made me realize that.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/battlefield-6-variable-zoom.jpg?itok=Pycjq_HZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/battlefield-6-variable-zoom.jpg?itok=EichiAQL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>J.A.R.V.I.S., enhance.</figcaption></figure><p>Another cool tidbit about the M7, it features a super fancy optic that features, among other things, a variable zoom. This means the scope can adjust according to how far out the target is.&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6</em>'s M277 also features this, and I fell in love with this damn thing. I felt like a real pro, zooming in or out in accordance with the target.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Battlefield Studios even gave that darn thing a 20-round mag, and man, you run out of ammo so fast, so I can see why it was a common complaint.&nbsp;You feel the power of the larger cartridge, though, and it was a blast to pick off enemies with this thing, even if I found myself reloading far more than I wanted to.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is just one of&nbsp;<em>many</em>&nbsp;weapons you can use in&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6</em>. As you play more multiplayer and rank up, you'll unlock new weapons. Focusing on a specific firearm will also allow you to choose from a myriad of attachments. Gun customization is as good as it gets in&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6.</em></p>

Each gun has a distinct feel, so nothing felt like a repeat of the other. Later on, I discovered the PW7A2, a submachine gun best used by the Engineer class. It has this attachment that allows you to sprint while shooting, changing up the way I approach gunfights with it.</p>

<p>I'm certain there will be a meta, as there always is in games such as this. I'm a casual enjoyer of&nbsp;<em>Battlefield</em>, so if you're a gun nut and love to customize and use various weapons, you can't go wrong here.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But yes, the multiplayer is the premier&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6</em>&nbsp;experience. For complete transparency, I was able to play multiplayer during select times throughout my review period. That said, many of my games were composed of several players on either side, with the remaining slots being filled by bots.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bots inflated my ego a bit because they're not particularly smart. It was like shooting fish in a barrel. Either way, I expect&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6</em>'s multiplayer to have a healthy player count without the need for bots in most, if not all, games. I say that, not because it's a popular series, but because the multiplayer is that addicting.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bf6-multiplayer_0.jpg?itok=FOCymdfx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bf6-multiplayer_0.jpg?itok=_mtjcb3N 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Yeah, I dabble in a bit of camping, so what?</figcaption></figure><p>EA would shut off the servers for the day, and I'd feel sad I couldn't play more. The progression is addictive, acquiring and upgrading guns. There are tons and tons of challenges to complete, weapon camos to unlock, and more.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There is a nice variety of multiplayer game modes in&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6</em>. Whether you prefer short fights or long conflicts, there's something for you. Team deathmatch is a traditional FPS game mode comprising a lower number of players and closer quarters. This was a&nbsp;blast&nbsp;to play when we had a group of nearly all players.</p>

<p>Still, the smaller maps don't hit the same as the larger ones. The true&nbsp;<em>Battlefield&nbsp;</em>experience, in my mind, is these gigantic maps with tons of vehicles, mayhem, and destruction. You'll find that in spades here. During peak hours, we were able to get a larger group of reviewers together, and that's the most fun I've had in&nbsp;<em>Battlefield</em>&nbsp;in a long time.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/battlefield-6-multiplayer-map_0.jpg?itok=vaEXOJm9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/battlefield-6-multiplayer-map_0.jpg?itok=g4DauhZy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Keeping watch on the rooftops!</figcaption></figure><p>Everyone was either pushing objectives, riding in vehicles, or just causing utter mayhem. There I was with a Stinger launcher trying to shoot down every jet and helicopter just so I could be <em>that&nbsp;</em>guy, and it was cathartic. That vision of "all-out warfare" is the vision&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6</em>&nbsp;is trying to sell. It achieves just that.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This opinion stands only on those larger, open maps. While I did enjoy fighting in some of the more urban environments, I wasn't a particular fan of the layouts, especially those taking place within New York City. They felt too cramped despite being actually quite large in size, and too repetitive with all the buildings, many of which you couldn't enter.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/battlefield-6-loadout.jpg?itok=zuNcHUhe 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/battlefield-6-loadout.jpg?itok=h9Hppqz3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Gotta go with the grenade launcher, it's crucial!</figcaption></figure><h2>Fulfilling Your Role in&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6</em></h2>

<p>On the note of classes, the signature Assault/Engineer/Support/Recon makes a return in&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6</em>. Now, there's some contention about any class being able to use any weapon. At first glance, it seems to blur the lines of what makes a class what it is, and also that it might mean players just end up using whatever weapon is the most "meta."</p>

<p>Those are valid concerns, but Battlefield Studios makes an admirable effort to mitigate them. One way&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6</em>&nbsp;does this is by including "Signature Weapons." For the Support class, that's light machine guns. They get a benefit no other class gets from using LMGs, which is that they aren't slowed down by the rifle while sprinting. They can also aim down their sights faster, giving you a bit of an edge over, say, an Engineer using an LMG.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bf6-grenade-launcher.jpg?itok=BtQ-FOh3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bf6-grenade-launcher.jpg?itok=KqCJvsN8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Lobbing 'nades is fun.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>I found myself sticking to my class' designated weapons, but it's a toss-up if other players will feel inclined to do so as well. Personally, it's a smart inclusion and, at least in casual play, should make classes feel more distinct. Other than that, classes have different abilities and gadgets to further distinguish their role.</p>

<p>For example, Engineers have a range of launchers to choose from. They can, like other&nbsp;<em>Battlefield&nbsp;</em>titles, repair vehicles. We also have active abilities, so a Recon can live up to its name and toggle a UAV to disclose enemy locations. I actually sometimes forget about having these abilities, so it's good to get into the habit of using them right from the start.</p>

<p>I have some strong thoughts about the campaign. At this point, I think I've made my point that the story is incredibly lackluster. It's like a Michael Bay movie: All style, no substance. It's fun to look at, but that's about as much as you'll get out of the campaign.</p>

<p>Despite this drawback, the main attraction here is the multiplayer, and I had a helluva time with it. The tight, fierce gunplay kept me addicted to the progression so I could unlock more guns and customize them. The destruction and mayhem on the battlefield are cinematic and jaw-dropping, as well as incredibly immersive.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Yeah,&nbsp;<em>Battlefield</em>'s had a few fumbles here and there, but with&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6</em>, it feels like it's returning back to what it was meant to be. Pure, adrenaline-fueled multiplayer with rich destruction physics and plenty of guns and vehicles to commandeer.&nbsp;</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ex-zenimax-devs-band-together-to-create-sackbird-studios.1320913/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A group of ex-ZeniMax Online Studios developers have banded together in order to form a new company by the name of Sackbird Studios, and it's pledging to create "bold, character-driven experiences".</p>

<p>Several of the developers involved in the formation of Sackbird were previously working on looter shooter&nbsp;<em>Project Blackbird&nbsp;</em>for Xbox, but that project was reportedly canceled during Microsoft's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/latest-microsoft-layoff-wave-king-zenimax" rel="nofollow">recent layoff frenzy</a>&nbsp;(which also saw studios like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/everwild-canceled-rare-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">Rare</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shut-down" rel="nofollow">The Initiative</a> impacted).</p>

<p>Now, however, as reported by <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/laid-off-zenimax-online-studios-developers-form-sackbird-studios" rel="nofollow">Game Developer</a>, a number of the staffers who were involved with that project, as well as with developing&nbsp;<em>The Elder Scrolls Online</em>, have formed Sackbird together, including luminaries like technical director Robert Ballantyne and tools engineer David Worley.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-elder-scrolls-online-zenimax-sackbird-studios.jpg?itok=B6EWujUM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-elder-scrolls-online-zenimax-sackbird-studios.jpg?itok=vcpjy5zr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Sackbird Studios has risen from the ashes of layoffs at&nbsp;<em>The Elder Scrolls Online&nbsp;</em>developer ZeniMax Online Studios.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Sackbird <a href="https://www.sackbirdstudios.com/news/studio-takes-flight" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">itself</a>, the studio is employee-owned and self-funded, and it will feature "no outside investors", thus giving its developers "full creative control". I really hope Sackbird can stick to those values in what is becoming an increasingly frantic and chaotic industry.</p>

<p>Worley says he and his team "wanted the freedom to take smart risks without waiting for a greenlight or chasing quarterly targets", and that the studio will "only answer to people who are passionate about games".</p>

<p>Other team members apparently describe Sackbird as a "developer-first environment with a long runway and a tight, senior team", which currently consists of fewer than ten people. I'm assuming that's being announced in order to demonstrate that there isn't a "too many cooks"-style issue at the top.</p>

<p>Sackbird is apparently already hard at work on its first project, which it describes as "an original project for PC and consoles", with more information becoming available "when the game is ready".</p>

<p>In any case, we'll have to wait and see just what exactly Sackbird Studios has in store for us. Stay tuned for more on this and all other things industry-related.</p>

First <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/rubiks-wowcube-announced/">announced earlier this year</a>, the Rubik’s WOWCube is a simpler 2x2 version of the puzzle that trades colored squares for 24 tiny color LCD displays. It still rotates like a traditional Rubik’s Cube, but instead of aligning colored squares those mechanics are used to play mobile games such as guiding a race car to the finish line by lining up track pieces scattered across its various screens.</p><p>Cubios debuted an earlier version of the WOWCube a few years ago, but in 2024 the <a href="https://wowcube.com/news/wowcube-teams-up-with-spin-master-owners-of-the-world-famous-rubik-s-cube-">company announced a collaboration with Spin Master</a>, which had acquired the Rubik’s brand in early 2021, for an officially licensed version of the device. It’s now <a href="https://wowcube.com/">finally available for preorder for a steep $299</a>, with shipping expected ahead of the holidays this year. Battery life is claimed to be up to five hours, and the WOWCube comes with a proprietary charger.</p><p>In addition to being able to rotate the 24 screens, the WOWCube features sensors allowing games to be played by tilting the entire cube, shaking, or tapping it. Through a mobile app you have access to the <a href="https://wowcube.com/store">WOWCube’s app store</a> which includes a mix of free and paid titles that are sent to the device wirelessly over Bluetooth. Cubios also offers an SDK for developers wanting to make their own apps or games.</p><p>The selection isn’t anywhere near as expansive as what you’ll find on Apple or Google’s app stores, but it includes versions of popular games like <em>Space Invaders, 2048,</em> and <em>Cut the Rope</em> that have been customized with unique gameplay for the WOWCube. There are also productivity apps like timers, screensavers that create tiny aquariums, and widgets that can display the weather, upcoming appointments, and even stock prices.</p><p>And yes, the WOWCube can even function like a traditional Rubik’s Cube. Should you fail to solve it on your own, instead of having to peel and reposition stickers to realign the colored squares, you can just reset it.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/797601/spin-master-rubiks-cube-wowcube-puzzle-app-store-mobile-games]]></content:encoded>

Developers Heart Machine have announced that its development is ending, with an unspecified number of layoffs at the studio having been announced at the same time.</p>
<p>It's a depressingly rapid downward trajectory for the follow-up to a game which generally received strong and positive reception, tempered by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hyper-light-drifter-impressions-2">some criticism</a> of elements such as how it handled communicating the best way to keep making forward progress.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Heart Machine confirmed the winding down of Hyper Light Breaker's development and the forthcoming layoffs to <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/heart-machine-making-layoffs-and-ending-development-on-hyper-light-breaker">Game Developer</a>, but didn't specify how many workers will be affected by the latter. "This was not our ideal path, but rather the only one available given the circumstances," the studio wrote in a statement.</p>
<p>"While this path will include a conclusion on the project, it reflects broader forces beyond our control, including shifts in funding, corporate consolidation and the uncertain environment many small studios like us are navigating today," they continued. Heart Machine went on to suggest that, while the game's full original vision will be left unrealised, there are plans to polish it as much as possible over the coming months.</p><p>"We still have something coming in January," a spokesperson told <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/heart-machine-making-layoffs-and-ending-development-on-hyper-light-breaker">Game Developer</a>. "We plan to deliver something meaningful and as polished and complete as we can given our current circumstances. We’re doing our best to refine what we can, complete key systems, and have the game culminate in a satisfying punctuation point."</p>
<p>They added that there'll be no updates or dev Q and A sessions for the rest of 2025, citing the need to be able to work on the final release while facing "limited resources with team members rolling off the project".</p>
<p>The early access version of Hyper Light Breaker which only came out in January this year, with news of its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hyper-light-breakers-first-major-update-is-taking-an-axe-to-its-structure-and-it-sounds-better-for-it">first major update</a> following in April. Despite the work that's gone in, a mixed initial reception has lingered. James summed up his thoughts after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hyper-light-breaker-early-access-review">jumping in right out of the gate</a> thusly:</p>
<blockquote><p>The real meat of a roguelike is, to be fair, not the climactic challenge but the preparation for it: the massing of gear and experience, and the primeval pleasure of Numbers Going Up. As much as Hyper Light Breaker is unfinished and more than slightly broken, its biggest issue is how that meaty part just isn’t all that enjoyable. The combat is awkward, the progression is doddering, and the world isn’t interesting enough to motivate indefinitely repeating visits to it. That makes for an awfully long to-do list, early access or no.</p></blockquote>
<p>Our best to all affected by the layoffs at Heart Machine.</p>

        <p><span>It doesn’t take long until everything starts blowing up in </span><i><span>Battlefield 6</span></i><span>.</span></p> <p><span>After a lean introduction that outlines the collapse of international order in the late 2020s, you assume the role of Gunnery Sergeant Dylan Murphy, an American marine on a NATO base in Georgia. Murphy and his squadmates are about to evacuate this base ahead of its transfer of control to a giant private military company called, bleakly, Pax Armata. Within minutes, the base comes under a surprise attack from the impatiently aggressive PMC. Soldiers scream and die, gouts of flame blossom on the tarmac like nasty orange flowers. Gunfire rattles. Here are the explosions, ahead of schedule.</span></p> <p><i><span>Battlefield 6</span></i><span>’s opening plays out as a statement of intent. You are here, it knows, to shoot enemy soldiers and watch the vehicles, buildings, and natural world all around your character fall apart or combust in spectacular fashion. The point of the game, whether in its single-player campaign or multiplayer mode, is to make you feel like you’re an agent of small change within the overwhelming chaos of a warzone.</span></p>

 <p><span>To that end, the game’s first mission is a kind of Disneyland ride for the </span><i><span>Guns and Ammo</span></i><span> set. As Murphy, you grab the turret of a Humvee and rattle off hundreds of bullets at Pax forces as a landscape of greenly forested hills and concrete military installations flies by, speeding past exploding buildings and burning vehicles until there’s a chance to catch your breath on the lip of a cliffside overlooking an office building in mid-construction. From there, Murphy and his squad rush into a gunfight. You’re introduced to the on-foot rhythm of popping in and out of cover to shoot enemies, order a teammate to throw a grenade, and set charges to blow up the office, destroying data servers before Pax can capture them. The evacuation goes wrong and the level ends with Murphy and his team shot down in a helicopter, fighting off overwhelming forces in a heroic last stand.</span></p>

 <p><span>There’s a saccharine series of death scenes. Murphy reminds his friends that their motto is “unconquerable spirit” as their life drains, messy and red, onto an American flag conspicuously dropped onto the mangled floor of the helicopter. He alone is rescued in the nick of time. Murphy drapes the flag on a corpse, presses his hand to it, and watches blood spread out through the fabric and onto his gloves.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000633397" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000633397"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000633397">©EA</figcaption></figure> <p><span>This is hardly subtle stuff, but it is invigorating in a retrograde sense. It’s also, to </span><i><span>Battlefield 6</span></i><span>’s credit, something of a false indication of what’s to come. Over the eight missions to follow, the game tries–and sometimes succeeds–in subverting its players’ expectations of what a modern military shooter should look like, both in the direction the plot takes and in the ways that many fights play out.</span></p>

 <p><span>The campaign takes place over the course of nine missions, bookended by cinematics that show Murphy confronting a CIA agent sometime after the past-tense levels have taken place. Though the scope of the game is global, it’s told almost entirely through the perspective of Murphy and his fellow Americans in a special Marine squad dubbed Dagger 13. This means that the NATO allies encountered throughout the game serve only as backdrop for an international conflict that ends up largely centered on the United States.</span></p>

 <p><span>The exception is the primary villain of the game: a British Pax leader called Kincaid. </span><i><span>Battlefield 6</span></i><span> places its world-changing action within the context of personal relationships and so Kincaid is an embittered soldier formerly betrayed by an American comrade, a foil for Murphy’s doubting patriotism with a massive chip on his shoulder and a gruesome acid burn scar on his face to match.</span></p>

 <p><span>Much of the first half of the game sees Dagger 13 hunting down Kincaid for more information on his involvement with Pax Armata’s mysterious access to advanced technology. It’s a simple enough way to propel a plotline forward, and it works—though the campaign also moves between set pieces at such a breakneck pace that it could hold a hamster’s attention. The player is tossed between a variety of scenarios that break up the gunfighting formula, like one in which you lead a tank column between the wrecked cars and cracked roads of a bombed-out Egyptian highway, or another that sees you hopping across the wrenched-apart steel and concrete of a collapsing bridge.&nbsp;</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000633400" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000633400"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000633400">©EA</figcaption></figure> <p><span>There are also mission introductions that involve parachuting through the clouds and down past glowing tracer fire toward the cramped, sun-soaked streets of a war-torn Gibraltar. And, later in the same mission, a beach landing on a heavily defended shore where you rock along on an amphibious tank, battleships sinking into the waves behind you and artillery raining down on vehicles ahead. There’s a sense of choking dread in both cases, and especially in the latter, when crashing through the roiling sea and onto a beach defended by mounted guns, an inferno of oily black clouds of smoke and raging fires obscuring the view.</span></p> <p><span>Unfortunately, the finer points of each enemy encounter aren’t nearly as engaging as their presentation. The shooting is finely tuned, with the basic act of pattering bullets into a Pax soldier or punching a hole through the side of a wall with a rocket launcher gratifying. The enemies just aren’t very interesting to fight. Despite solid level layouts that facilitate basic, on-the-fly tactics like flanking or dodging into cover, enemy infantry typically arrives in waves of dopey soldiers running directly onto the battlefield from some hidden corner in lumped-together masses. Your AI squadmates, who can be ordered to shoot, toss smoke or frag grenades, and mark enemies, are pretty braindead, too. Though the trappings of just about every battle are vibrant and creative, they’re let down by a sense of artificiality at their center.</span></p>

 <p><span>The sound design in </span><i><span>Battlefield 6</span></i><span>, as in past entries to the series, goes a long way toward keeping the illusion of real danger present. Regardless of how pedestrian it might be (in video game terms) to shoot through encounters with one group of enemies after another, the crack of an overhead sniper shot or boom of a nearby explosion, bits of gravel dropping down like hailstones, provides a sense of deadly chaos. </span></p> <p><span>I</span><span>t’s also one of the highlights of </span><i><span>Battlefield 6</span></i><span>’s multiplayer. Freed from the confines of its story, the narrative reduced to a backdrop for eternal battles between NATO and Pax forces, the game comes alive as a lavish digital toybox. Over the review period, the multiplayer was mostly made available in two- or four-hour sessions, the servers filled with other reviewers and too many bots. While this makes it hard to gauge exactly how matches will feel once the game is properly live, a limited tour of the various modes and features represents, along with the beta test period from this summer, a worthwhile indication of what to expect.</span></p> <div>           <ul>                           <li>                 <p>Back-of-the-box quote:</p>                 <p>“It’s like World War III, but fun.”</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Developer:</p>                 <p>Battlefield Studios</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Type of game:</p>                 <p>Single-player and multiplayer military-themed first-person shooter.  </p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Liked:</p>                 <p>Appropriately nihilistic campaign, great sound and visual spectacle in campaign and multiplayer.</p>               </li>                               </ul><ul>                                         <li>                 <p>Disliked:</p>                 <p>Dull enemy AI and underdeveloped cast of characters; smaller maps and stripped-back modes are underwhelming.</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Platforms:</p>                 <p>PC (played), PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Release Date: </p>                 <p> October 10, 2025</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Played:</p>                 <p>Just over six hours to complete the campaign; roughly 10 hours of multiplayer.</p>               </li>                                     </ul>         </div>  <p><span>The maps are largely very good, especially in the case of a valley in Tajikistan, its ruined houses dwarfed by snowy mountain ranges, or the stretch of muddy ground surrounding a construction site outside of Cairo. In each of these, </span><i><span>Battlefield 6</span></i><span> shines by providing lots of room for grand engagements between infantry and tanks, helicopters and jets either attacking ground forces or fighting their own battles in the sky. </span></p>

 <p><span>The classic </span><i><span>Battlefield</span></i><span> frustration of spawning in and either immediately getting shot or blown up, or sprinting toward the center of the action only to get sniped from an unseen shooter, remains. But so, too, does the controlled chaos of large-scale combat between squads, all working toward the same objective in different ways. Fighting on-foot in a dilapidated house while tanks roar by outside the windows remains one of the most distinctive, exhilarating experiences in a multiplayer shooter. The smaller maps are less successful. While serviceable as a stripped-down infantry-on-infantry shooter, </span><i><span>Battlefield 6</span></i><span>’s combat works best when it’s augmented by other factors, like needing to mine routes that tanks might take toward an objective or shooting rockets at enemy helicopters. In comparison, close-quarters fighting just isn’t as strong of a draw.</span></p>  <p><span>There’s a lot to do in multiplayer as well, and a good amount of flexibility in how to do it. After every match, across a wide variety of game modes, a confetti blast of new weapon attachments and vehicle customization options fills the screen, providing incentive to continue customizing your approach to combat until, in coming months, the real obsessives kill the joy of experimentation by locking down a mathematically superior loadout for every class. At its core, though, the focus on objective-based modes and the enjoyment that comes from taking any part in such large-scale matches means that even the lousiest player can get something out of the multiplayer.</span></p> <p><i><span>Battlefield 6</span></i><span>’s general look and feel is easier to appreciate when playing online, but its campaign is still worthwhile as tone-setting and a piece of modern military fiction in its own right. The characters are too flat, and the plot fails to dig deep enough into its richest elements, but there’s a bitterly nihilistic edge to the story that speaks to something truer than its paranoiac World War III premise might suggest. As the plot progresses, the instances of patriotic heroism its characters try to engage in ring hollower and hollower. The flag-centric last stand from the opening mission seems like a cruel joke to the Americans of Dagger 13, who begin to see, in the nakedly monetary goals of Pax Armata, an unintended reflection of their own nation and the crumbling goals of Western hegemony.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000633395" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000633395"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000633395">©EA</figcaption></figure> <p><span>There’s an honesty to this tone and narrative. Like the climate apocalypse backdrop of </span><i><span>Battlefield 2042</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Battlefield 6</span></i><span> is a game that acknowledges the doomed trajectory of the current Western political landscape and, rather than offer a hopeful alternative, figures we all might as well enjoy the dramatic thrills of its take on a world order falling violently apart. It points very directly to America’s stewardship of this process but assigns real blame to a Hobbesian understanding of human nature—one in which survival, in the form of moneymaking, is an eternal guiding principle that will send us all to ruin.</span></p> <p><span>At one point, the villainous Kincaid poses a question to one of the Dagger 13 heroes: “Don’t you want to die for something real?” And the answer, by then, is clear. There’s nothing worth dying for when these characters can no longer believe in their country or its allies.</span></p> <p><i><span>Battlefield 6</span></i><span>’s campaign is too unevenly executed to make its vision as compelling as it ought to be, but it still works well enough to inflect the entire game with a healthy cynicism unusual for the genre. Though every multiplayer military shooter feels at least slightly callous when viewed from a distance, unending war modeled with a twinned desire for both realism and the rendering down of martial violence into sport, </span><i><span>Battlefield 6</span></i><span> manages to make a natural home for its design ethos in that discordance. It finds the road to global ruin pretty exciting, and believes that you will, too. For the most part, it’s right.</span></p>      </div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-review-steam-ps5-campaign-multiplayer-2000633379]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Heart Machine, developer of 2016’s hit action-RPG <i>Hyper Light Drifter</i>, has fallen on hard times after that game’s follow-up, the roguelike prequel <i>Hyper Light Breaker</i>, failed to resonate with players. Still officially in Early Access, the game will get some more attention from Heart Machine, but the studio has announced that it is winding down development, and that members of the team have been laid off.</p> <p>“We’ve had to make the difficult decision to part ways with a number of talented team members,” Heart Machine said in a statement (h/t <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/roguelike/still-in-early-access-hyper-light-breakers-ending-development-and-laying-off-staff-this-was-not-our-ideal-path-but-rather-the-only-one-available-given-the-circumstances/">Joshua Wolens at <i>PC Gamer</i></a>). Attributing the challenges its facing to “broader forces beyond our control, including shifts in funding, corporate consolidation and the uncertain environment many small studios like us are navigating today,” Heart Machine has hit bumpy patches in the past as well, with <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/hyper-light-breaker-developer-heart-machine-confirms-layoffs">a previous round of layoffs</a> implemented toward the end of 2024, Though it seems like <i>Hyper Light Breaker</i> might never be completed in the ways its creators once envisioned and hoped for, the studio is promising to issue an update in January and bring <i>Breaker</i> to some kind of finish line.</p>

 <h2>‘As an avid <i>Hyper Light Drifter Fan</i>, I have tried to enjoy this game multiple times. I just can’t’</h2> <p>Fans of the very cool and visually captivating 2016 indie hit <i>Hyper Light Drifter</i> have, by and large, failed to latch on to what <i>Breaker</i> is offering. “I just can’t,” <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198372477945/recommended/1534840/">reads one Steam review</a> of the game in its present Early Access state. “The only thing that actually ties this game to <i>Drifter</i> is the title of the game and the art style. […] Characters currently are limited to select weapons to artificially promote character diversity. Extraction as a concept is pointless aside from being a source of infinite health.”</p>

 <p>“The core combat feels decent enough at times,” <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/BloodClayston/recommended/1534840/">reads another negative review</a>. “But pretty much everything this game has to offer is either very rough around the edges or just questionably designed, on top of a large amount of smaller issues that quickly add up.”</p>

 <p>It’s not all doom and gloom in the reviews section. Some folks seem to be more patient with the game in its Early Access state, while others are finding genuine fun. Still, these are the lesser voices speaking out behind the game’s “Mixed” user review status on Steam.</p> <p>Though the game is still going to receive some attention, it’s unfortunate that its creators will never be able to implement their full vision for it, and particularly unfortunate that people have lost their livelihoods. Heart Machine continues on with its other projects, including the side-scroller <i>Possessor(s) </i>due out next month. “We are deeply grateful to everyone who contributed to all of our projects, and to our community for their continued support as we look forward to the future of Heart Machine,“ the statement says.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Battlefield 6 Campaign Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-campaign-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-campaign-review.1320889/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s been seven years since the last Battlefield campaign. A decade since the last one set in the modern day — the intriguing, but ultimately flawed Hardline. In that time, Doom and its sequels took the speed of a single-player first-person shooter to the next level, Titanfall 2 pushed level design forward in inventive ways, and even Call of Duty reinvented itself on several different occasions to varying degrees of success. But Battlefield 6 has little interest in innovation, instead firmly looking back at what made the series so successful two console generations ago. Aside from being an impressive technical showcase at times, its small set of routine missions has little new to offer. There is <em>some </em>variety and a few moments of impressive scale to be found, but it’s all over so quickly you barely have time to savour them. Though it never quite feels like a full-on afterthought, it’s a campaign that comes across as the sidearm of Battlefield 6’s arsenal when placed alongside its more grand multiplayer suite.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Across its nine missions, Battlefield 6 zips around at a furious pace, but I couldn’t help but feel that I’d done it all before, albeit at much lower fidelity. It’s flashy, but lacking when it comes to genuinely interesting level design, with its great feeling gunplay not supported by what you’re asked to achieve with it. On one hand, it makes sense for Battlefield Studios to take this approach and treat the campaign as a training ground for its trademark large-scale online warfare — the pure size and number of enemies that flood the screen in its missions are certainly in conversation with this. But in the other palm, it crushes all hope of crafting a thrilling story that has the chance of stepping out of the shadow cast by those multiplayer modes.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Battlefield 6: Single-Player Campaign Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s not to say there aren’t splashes of inspiration. A particular highlight was a sequence that takes place on a crumbling New York bridge. It’s at least visually interesting, even if it offers no great variance in what it’s asking you to do gameplay-wise. There’s just no one mission that screams out as an all-timer here, even if there are attempts to ape Modern Warfare’s Clean House — which fails to capture any of the desired tension — or its own version of a Normandy landing as you storm a Gibraltar beach. It’s, oddly, very much a ‘Call of Duty’ campaign in its map and objective design, and struggles to stamp much of the signature Battlefield large-scale action that made me fall in love with the series. I find it frustrating not to see risks being taken creatively, especially when such a vast budget is available to fuel such ambition.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One later chapter set amongst the mountains of Tajikistan does take place in a wide open area and echoes the multiplayer roots of the series, as you’re encouraged to take your own approach when completing the task at hand. In theory, this could be exciting, with all manner of airborne and ground vehicles ready to be controlled at your fingertips and a vast library of weaponry and gadgets to gear up with. In practice, it presents as more of a thin veneer of choice rather than drastically different ways to tackle objectives, with the range of tools at your disposal kept frustratingly limited. You’re given a drone to play with and a choice of ATVs and armored trucks to drive, but little beyond that. I’m just not a fan of this larger map approach when it comes to first-person shooter campaigns, much preferring an authored hand to level design, rather than being handed a box of crayons to make my own fun with. These stretches are worryingly close to Modern Warfare 3’s “open combat missions” at times — a memory I never wanted to relive, yet again so soon after, but at least they do feel philosophically more at home as Battlefield arenas.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I wanted to be the star of the show, but I just ended up feeling like a passenger.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Thankfully, these don’t make up the majority of the campaign, but what’s found in its smaller scope staging isn’t any more exciting. You’ll often find yourself hunkering down in tight city streets or behind hulking tanks, waiting for the right opportunity to pop your head out. A run-and-gun mentality simply isn’t welcomed here, with a patient, cover-based approach encouraged — the gunplay is snappy at least, with a satisfying weight to it whenever you do choose to open fire. Assault rifles and LMGs pack a powerful punch and serve as efficient tools when faced with another wave of enemies, and sniper rifles are satisfingly devastating — even if the enemy AI displays little brain to blow out. It gets especially exciting when the impressive destruction tech takes a chunk out of the building you’ve been finding solace in, and you’re forced to scramble to another safe haven. These claustrophobic moments of true jeopardy really are all too rare, though, as for the most part, the campaign is reduced to rinse and repeat objectives that were getting old in FPS campaigns a decade ago. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Having one mission include a sequence where you need to destroy anti-aircraft guns or SAM sites can be forgiven, but doing this on more than <em>three </em>occasions is just downright boring and grinds any gathered momentum to a halt. There are only so many times planting C4 can be considered a fun time, and all too often, you are tasked with standing still amongst the action and pressing a single button in order to continue. On multiple occasions, I was asked to watch some explosions that I didn’t even get to set off take place, or sit in the back of a speeding vehicle and control a mounted turret that only gives you a mild feeling of being responsible for the carnage on screen. It's on-rails all too often, taking its most exciting moments out of your hands and displaying them in cutscenes, resulting in much of the campaign feeling like the most straight-faced Disney ride ever built. I wanted to be the star of the show, but I just ended up feeling like a passenger.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">An early mission that takes you through an abandoned WW2 tunnel network-turned-museum to the decades-old war serves as an unfortunate symbol for the campaign as a whole — a relic of first-person-shooter design dressed up in a new guise. Being funneled through corridors towards the next static shooting gallery to gun down fish in a barrel is hardly exciting in 2025, and it barely was 20 years ago. Outside of a series of tank battles as dry as the desert roads they take place on, it attempts to sprinkle very little of that Battlefield magic into the mix, largely negating environment destruction as part of your toolkit and never once putting you in control of an airborne vehicle. Is it really Battlefield if I’m never zooming along in a fighter jet or unleashing hell from a helicopter gunship?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s a slight glimmer of tactical ops magic to be seen, as you can call on your squadmates to activate their personalised skills to help you in a fight. They each come packed with their own multiplayer-class-flavoured abilities, such as Gecko, the recon specialist, being able to tag targets, which, admittedly, does make certain situations ridiculously easy, as every enemy in the area is revealed to you instantly. Ultimately, though, each member ends up playing practically the same and feels like another missed opportunity to add a dash of variety into the mix.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">They each fall under the banner of an expert Marine Raider squad called Dagger 1-3 — an unfittingly sharp name for such a dull bunch. On the whole, they’re a fairly cookie-cutter military unit who love nothing more than getting their boots on the ground and shouting “hooah”, with memorable character moments near non-existent. The performances and the shells of humans they inhabit are wholly forgettable, barely coming across as fully formed, and it’s hard to detect any sort of emotion, even when one of their own falls in the line of fire. Nuance is hardly the name of the game when it comes to Battlefield 6’s campaign, though, and its story, centered on taking down a rogue private military force called Pax Armata (ironically, Latin for Armed Peace), proves to be anything but a peaceful one.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Battlefield Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a fairly straightforward affair that doesn’t leave too much room for interpretation. For a military shooter about the collapse of NATO, it’s all oddly apolitical in its presentation, and as such, it feels like it has nothing of real substance to say. It’s safe, and as a result, largely uninteresting. At least Call of Duty has attempted to take on subjects such as chemical warfare and terrorism, even if they’ve ultimately been misguided efforts that come across as antithetical to its larger message. It’s not easy to present such important themes delicately, so I can understand why Battlefield Studios may have felt like trying to fire and catch a bullet laced with hot-button issues may have been a risk not worth taking when it could simply choose not to pull the trigger at all. It just means it doesn’t have anything to say on a global or personal level, and all feels a little hollow as a result. It’s a far cry from when the series did tell some engaging tales through the eyes of fun characters in its Bad Company days.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I did also fall victim a few annoying little glitches on the way, such as my character zipping across the screen involuntarily, fuzzy textures popping in, and occasional bullets aimed right at enemy heads leaving zero impact. But on the whole, there’s no denying that it looks and sounds very impressive, with spectacular explosions peppering skylines and gunfire whizzing and cutting through smoke and debris as mayhem ensues around you with regularity. I just wish there was a little more substance hiding behind it all.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Simon Cardy is a Senior Editor at IGN who can mainly be found skulking around open world games, indulging in Korean cinema, or despairing at the state of Tottenham Hotspur and the New York Jets.

It’s a staggering spectacle to behold at times, and a treat for the ears at others, but when it comes to mission design and an engaging plot, it fails to deliver at all. A quick afternoon of fun, it's a safe reimagining of what Battlefield once was, but far from a bold reinvention of what it could, and maybe should, be now.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-campaign-review]]></content:encoded>
