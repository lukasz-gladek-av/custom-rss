            <p>Gather your ghost hunting crew, but this time rather than grabbing your torches and crucifixes, reach out for some popcorn instead - a film adaptation of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/phasmophobia">Phasmophobia</a> is on its way.</p>
<p>The upcoming film based on the psychological horror co-op game will be a collaboration between developer Kinetic Games, as well as Blumhouse and Atomic Monster, which will be producing.</p>
<p>Blumhouse is known for its horror films, with the likes of M3gan and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/five-nights-at-freddys">Five Nights at Freddy's</a> to its name. Atomic Monster, meanwhile, is the production company behind Annabelle, The Nun and The Conjuring universe (which is the "most successful horror franchise" of all time).</p>

<p>"We're thrilled to officially announce that a Phasmophobia film adaption is in development - it's a big moment for the whole Kinetic team, and the start of something really exciting," said Kinetic Games director Daniel Knight.</p>
<p>"We never could've imagined the incredible heights this game would reach when it launched five years ago, and we're so thankful to our amazing community for the lasting impact Phasmophobia has had in the gaming space and beyond. Working with Blumhouse and Atomic Monster marks an incredible new chapter for the game, and we can't wait to share more as the project develops."</p>
<p>Phasmophobia joins the swathes of games receiving film versions in recent years. Until Dawn was adapted for the big screen in April, but featured <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/until-dawn-film-wont-feature-the-same-characters-or-even-the-same-story-as-the-game-its-based-on">both a new cast of characters and a new story</a>.</p>
<p>As for Phasmophobia, it has surpassed 23m in global sales since its early access debut. Its next content drop - known as Chronicle - will be released on 24th June. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phasmophobia-junes-update-reworks-the-journal-media-and-brings-a-total-overhaul-of-evidence-collection">This will be Phasmophobia's "biggest update yet"</a>, the team said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile in 2023, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blumhouse-games-hires-horror-game-specialist-louise-blain">journalist and radio host Louise Blain joined Blumhouse Games as its creative lead</a>, as the company brings its horror expertise to gaming.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-day-one-update-starts-rolling-out-enabling-network-functions-and-more.1206558/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-day-one-update/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 day one update has started rolling out, enabling network features, playing original Switch games on the system, and more.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/nintendo-switch-2-day-one-20-1-1-update-out-now-patch-notes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Everything</a>, the new update enables all network features that were previously not available for those lucky enough to get a unit before the official release, such as using original Switch games, Nintendo Switch Online, GameChat, Virtual Game Cards, uploading screenshots and videos, linking with the Nintendo Switch App to view them, and more. With the network features going live, the Nintendo Switch 2 eShop has also gone live.</p>
<p>The wait has been long, but the next-generation Nintendo system is almost here, and soon enough, players from all over the world will be able to experience its launch titles, which include Mario Kart World and plenty of third-party ports. Among these ports, the most impressive will likely be the Cyberpunk 2077 port, which is also among the first Nintendo Switch 2 games to use<a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-nvidia-dlss/"> NVIDIA DLSS</a> to improve image quality and performance. According to CDPR VP of Technology, the upscaler, alongside the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-ram-storage-dlss-push-past-playstation-4/">RAM and the system's storage</a>, are the features that allow the console to surpass the PlayStation 4 system, which was made evident by the fact that the developer was able to release the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-shiny-firmware-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Phantom Liberty expansion</a>, which ended up skipping last-generation consoles due to technical limitations.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 officially launches tomorrow, June 5th, worldwide, with some exceptions, like China and Central America.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-movie-blumhouse<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Horror film studio Blumhouse and&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>developer Kinetic Games have announced that the spooky multiplayer horror game is getting its very own movie adaptation.</p>

<p>Per a press release, the movie will be a co-production between Blumhouse and James Wan's production company Atomic Monster, whose works include&nbsp;<em>The Conjuring</em>&nbsp;and its associated spinoffs, as well as&nbsp;<em>M3GAN&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Malignant</em>. Of course, Kinetic Games is also involved in the production.</p>

<p><em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>lead developer Daniel Knight says the movie is "a big moment for the whole Kinetic team, and the start of something really exciting", promising to share more "as the project develops" (although stopping short of a timeline for said info).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/phasmophobia-movie-blumhouse-room.jpg?itok=QfOmcXQC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/phasmophobia-movie-blumhouse-room.jpg?itok=tjz7g5CK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Blumhouse is producing a&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>movie.</figcaption></figure><p>We don't yet have a release window for the movie, nor do we know who any of the creative personnel involved with it will be. We'll likely have to wait quite a while before we learn things like the director, the writers, and the stars of the&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>movie, unfortunately.</p>

<p>What we do know, however, is that this is just one of several video game movies that have been greenlit recently, and it's not even the only one in the horror space, either.</p>

<p>Back in April, it was revealed that a movie based on <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mortuary-assistant-movie-announced" rel="nofollow">horror work sim&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mortuary-assistant-movie-announced" rel="nofollow">The Mortuary Assistant</a>&nbsp;</em>is in development, and, of course, Sony recently released a movie based on its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/until-dawn-movie-first-look" rel="nofollow">interactive narrative adventure&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn</em></a>.</p>

<p>Outside of the horror world, movies based on the likes of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-movie-sydney-sweeney" rel="nofollow">EA's co-op platformer&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction</em></a>, Ubisoft's extreme sports sim&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/riders-republic-movie-report" rel="nofollow"><em>Riders Republic</em></a>, and FromSoftware's mega-hit&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>have all also been confirmed to be on the way.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<em>Sonic the Hedgehog&nbsp;</em>movies <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sonic-the-hedgehog-movies-1b-box-office" rel="nofollow">cumulatively crossed the $1 billion mark</a> in January, and the&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>movie, despite critical skepticism (<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/first-minecraft-movie-trailer" rel="nofollow">not least from me</a>), made almost $1 billion by itself, second only to the&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Bros.&nbsp;</em>movie in terms of video game adaptation box office figures.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/fortnite/679077/epic-games-fortnite-creators-ai-npcs-darth-vader<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>AI Darth Vader was a huge hit in <em>Fortnite</em>, and now Epic plans to let creators make AI-powered NPCs for their own in-game experiences. But a senior Epic exec says that creators should expect a “learning curve” when using them — something Epic had to figure out on its own.</p><p>The AI Vader that Epic made lets users talk to the character using their voice and hear an AI-generated version of James Earl Jones’s Vader voice talk back. It was the “culmination of a very intense effort for a character everybody understands,” Saxs Persson, Epic’s EVP of the <em>Fortnite</em> ecosystem, tells <em>The Verge</em>. </p><p>But Epic couldn’t just set an AI chatbot loose — “a lot” went into defining how Vader reacted and dialing in the voice. The work was worth it, though; in-game, Vader’s voice sounds just like the movies, and when he’s on your team, he’s a menacing, aggressive force. Persson says that Vader was ultimately “integrated into gameplay in a way that every player could understand” and he hopes creators are able to make similar things.</p><p>Vader’s rollout wasn’t perfect; a popular streamer, Loserfruit, was able to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/668349/fortnite-star-wars-james-earl-jones-vader-ai-voice">get Vader to swear</a>, which Epic fixed shortly after it happened. Persson says that it was a “learning experience” and that the team has built multiple layers of how it does its safety checks.</p><p>Epic also tries to build systems to prevent those kinds of things and be able to react fast. “We do our best job on day one,” Persson says. “But more importantly, we’re ready to surround the problem and actually have fixes in place as fast as we can.” Creators making AI NPCs for <em>Fortnite</em> will have access to the same safety tools that Epic did for Vader.</p><p>At Unreal Fest on June 3rd, the company showed a live demo of an AI NPC called Mr. Buttons, whose only purpose was, using its voice, to try and convince the player to push a giant red button. It was a simple, effective, and funny demo that showed what’s possible. The goal was to create a scenario where “the responses are literally endless” so that “everybody has a different experience,” Persson says.</p><p>Persson wouldn’t say if or when Epic plans to bring more AI NPCs to <em>Fortnite</em>. He says that Epic didn’t give its designer some kind of “AI objective” when making Vader. “Our objective is fun,” CEO Tim Sweeney says. “AI is just another tool they have now,” Persson adds. It sounds like AI characters could show up in Epic and Disney’s “persistent universe” that’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/4/24261555/epic-disney-fortnite-unreal-fest">in the works</a>, too: “I would imagine that AI plays a role,” Persson says, noting that it would help with immersion.</p><p>Persson wouldn’t share a timeline for when the universe, which was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/7/24065281/disney-epic-games-investment-fortnite-metaverse">announced last year</a>, might be available. But Epic is going to let creators make their <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/678399/epic-games-fortnite-ai-darth-vaders-tech-creators">own <em>Star Wars-</em>themed experiences</a>, so perhaps somebody will create another take on an AI Darth Vader.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-rise-sunbreak-sales-10m</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-hunter-rise-sunbreak-sales-top-10m.1206540/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-rise-sunbreak-sales-10m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Capcom has revealed that&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Rise&nbsp;</em>expansion&nbsp;<em>Sunbreak&nbsp;</em>has topped a major sales milestone, and no, you're not reading that wrong; I do mean <i>Monster Hunter Rise&nbsp;</i>and not&nbsp;<em>Wilds</em>.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/monsterhunter/status/1930202980927623265" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> on the official&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>X account,&nbsp;<em>Sunbreak&nbsp;</em>director Yoshitake Suzuki says the expansion has "finally surpassed" the 10 million sales mark, which means that it's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-rise-13-million-sales" rel="nofollow">picked up another four million sales or so</a> for itself in the last two years.</p>

<p>As a reminder, at <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/business/million.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">last count</a>, the base&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Rise&nbsp;</em>game itself stood at around 17.1 million sales. It's pipped to the post by&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter World</em>, which, at 21.5 million units sold, is still the best-selling game in the series (and Capcom's best-selling title overall).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-hunter-rise-sunbreak-sales-10m-celebration.jpg?itok=xVd1ZQAz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-hunter-rise-sunbreak-sales-10m-celebration.jpg?itok=UoNxLWMf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak&nbsp;</em>is still picking up sales for itself.</figcaption></figure><p>Neither of these games is the latest in the series, however; that honor goes to&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, which launched across PC and current-gen consoles <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-release-date" rel="nofollow">back in late February</a>.</p>

<p>On release, the game quickly broke Capcom records, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-8m" rel="nofollow">amassing eight million sales</a> within a three-day period. In late March,&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-10m" rel="nofollow">broke ten million sales</a>, and that's where it still stood at last count, although I wouldn't be surprised if it's picked up a lot more sales for itself since then.</p>

<p>Continuing sales for&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak&nbsp;</em>suggest that it's not just&nbsp;<em>Wilds&nbsp;</em>that's doing very well for Capcom, but the series as a whole. It is, after all, one of Capcom's biggest moneyspinners, alongside <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/resident-evil-4-sales-10m-village-11m" rel="nofollow">the <em>Resident Evil&nbsp;</em>series</a>.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak</em>, it's the sole major expansion for&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Rise</em>, introducing new areas, new monsters, and more to the game.</p>




<p>The expansion was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-rise-sunbreak-release-date-announced" rel="nofollow">released back in mid-2022</a>, a few months after the PC release of the base game and a few months before it would land on consoles other than the Nintendo Switch.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> won't include a 200cc mode for faster racing, but producer Kosuke Yabuki hasn't ruled it out for a post-launch addition. </p>
<p>Mario Kart World is the next entry in Nintendo's long standing series, however unlike the games that have gone before, this time the team is mixing things up with the introduction of a roamable interconnected, well, world.</p>
<p>But, while the upcoming release will feature some newness on its debut, that 200cc is one feature from previous series entry <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-8">Mario Kart 8</a> that will not arrive on launch.</p>

<p>This mode is often seen as a higher difficulty level for players as it can result in more frantic races due to the increased speed and power of karts. It's a lot of fun, especially after the comparatively tame 50, 100 and 150cc modes.</p>
<p>But, even though 200cc won't be available on launch, fret not. The 200cc mode was introduced to World's predecessor as part of an update following the game's initial launch, and the same may well happen again here.</p>
<p>"Some players are really happy with the addition of high difficulty modes like this," Mario Kart World's producer told <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/mario-kart-world-switch-2-nintendo-kosuke-yabuki-1235350685/">Rolling Stone</a>, before coyly adding:</p>
<p>"However, does that mean we're going to consider adding engine sizes that are larger than 150cc to Mario Kart World? I'm afraid I can't say just yet."</p>
<p>Is this something you hope to see added to Mario Kart World further down the road?</p>

			<p>Only a short time after the third installment's tenth anniversary, yesterday was a great day for The Witcher fans as CD Projekt RED <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-new-trailer-ps5-60-fps-ray-tracing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">took the stage</a> during the State of Unreal presentation in Orlando, Florida. The footage included a live demo of sorts, but a CD Projekt RED spokesperson <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/witcher-4-tech-demo-shows-the-game-running-at-60-fps-with-ray-tracing-on-base-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">clarified</a> to VideoGamesChronicle that it should not be confused with The Witcher 4 gameplay.</p>
<p><em>This is a tech demo, and a first look at the cutting-edge technology powering The Witcher 4 – but not The Witcher 4 itself. It showcases the powerful foundation we’re building in close collaboration with Epic Games to push open-world design further than ever before and the core systems and features we’re developing using Unreal Engine 5. We’re really proud of this early milestone and excited to give you a sneak peek at some of the cool tech, like UAF, Nanite Foliage, Smart Objects, ML Deformer, and FastGeo Streaming, that are helping shape the future of The Witcher.</em></p>
<p>This is perhaps unsurprising, given that the studio previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-wont-launch-until-2027-says-cd-projekt-red/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> that The Witcher 4 won't be released before 2027. As such, it's a little too early to see actual gameplay.</p>
<p>The Polish developer had <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-next-game-announced-unreal-engine-5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> its decision to switch from their proprietary RED Engine to Unreal Engine 5 back in 2022. Since the beginning, the claim was that CDPR would help improve the open world game development experience even for other developers. Indeed, what we saw yesterday was impressive, especially considering that the footage was captured on a base PlayStation 5 console that ran the demo at 60 frames per second with ray tracing enabled.</p>
<p>On another note, some fans thought that Ciri looked a bit different in the new video compared to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-gets-first-trailer-showing-off-cirilla/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previous trailer that aired during The Game Awards 2024</a>. Again, a CDPR spokesperson addressed this feedback in a quote <a href="https://kotaku.com/witcher-4-ciri-trailer-gameplay-ue5-tech-demo-1851783467" target="_blank" rel="noopener">provided to Kotaku</a>:</p>
<p><em>It’s the same character model used in the 2024 trailer. Ciri’s face is a direct copy of The Witcher 3 model, adapted to work with the latest MetaHuman technology. Two subtle changes were made to improve animation quality: slightly raised eyebrows, and a more relaxed eye area—the latter was present in the trailer but has since been removed.</em></p>
<p>During the State of Unreal presentation, Epic Games also <a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-6-now-available-open-worlds-60-fps-ray-tracing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> the public availability of Unreal Engine 5.6, which brings several enhancements for developers.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/a-boys-club-above-the-law-former-ubisoft-execs-in-court-for-alleged-sexual-harassment-and-abuse.1206504/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-boys-club-above-the-law-former-ubisoft-execs-in-court-for-alleged-sexual-harassment-and-abuse<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Back in 2023, several <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-ubisoft-executives-taken-into-custody-over-sexual-abuse-claims-according-to-reports">former Ubisoft executives were taken into custody</a> by French police, following <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-vow-to-investigate-allegations-of-sexual-harrassment-and-abuse">allegations of sexual harassment, workplace abuse, sexism and violence</a> in 2020. Now, some of those executives have appeared in court in Bobigny, Seine-Saint-Denis to defend their alleged role in cultivating a workplace where women were frequently assaulted or humiliated by senior members of staff.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The former Ubisoft executives in question are Serge Hascoët, former chief creative officer, who resigned after the 2020 allegations, and is accused of sexual harassment and bullying. According to his lawyer, he "denies any knowledge of reprehensible acts committed by collaborators at Ubisoft and did not receive any reports of this." Former vice-president of editorial and creative services Tommy François is also accused of sexual harassment, bullying and attempted sexual assault. He denies all charges. Former game director Guillaume Patrux, finally, is accused of sexual harassment and bullying. He, too, denies all charges.</p>
<p>As reported by the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/02/ubisoft-trial-france-accused-sexual-harassment-video-games-me-too">Guardian</a>, the court proceedings include more details about the allegations against the three executives, and what one Ubisoft staffer characterised as a "boys' club above the law". All the events in question were said to have taken place between 2012 and 2020.</p>
<p>Amongst other accusations, one woman was reportedly informed that wearing a coat with a red lining was "an invitation to rape", while another was told that her outfit had given somebody an erection. The most serious allegations include tying a female employee to a chair with a roll of tape and pushing her into an elevator. The same woman allegedly had her face drawn on with a marker pen and was forced to attend a meeting without washing it off. Some men are said to have been targeted, with one office game involving touching their genitals through their trousers.</p>
<p>There are also claims of religious hatred. A Muslim developer reports being ostracised after the 2015 jihadist Bataclan concert hall attacks in Paris. She also allegedly found bacon sandwiches placed on her desk or thrown at her during Ramadan. </p>
<p>During the court proceedings, a few of the individual alleged abuses were attributed to the three former Ubisoft executives on trial. Hascoët is said to have told staff that he should have sex with a colleague in a meeting room in front of everyone "to show how to calm her". François is accused of trying to kiss a woman on the mouth while his colleagues restrained her by the arms and back at an office Christmas party in 2015. François reportedly told the court this week that "I never tried to harm anyone" and that there had been a "culture of joking around."</p>
<p>As for Patrux, the allegations against him include miming physical attacks on staff, throwing equipment across an open plan office space, drawing swastikas on a woman's notebook during a meeting, and cracking a whip near colleagues' faces.</p>
<p>Back in 2020, Ubisoft apologised to "everyone affected" by the reported harassment and abuse, and announced plans to audit "our existing policies, processes, and systems to understand where these have broken down, and to ensure we can better prevent, detect, and punish inappropriate behaviour." In November 2021, current and former Ubisoft staff <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-employee-group-launch-petition-seeking-public-support-for-demands">launched a public petition</a> condemning the company for a lack of meaningful or transparent progress on this front.</p>
<p>In 2022, CEO Yves Guillemot <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/ubisoft-ceo-defends-company-against-criticism-of-reforms-but-campaigners-demand-deeper-change/">responded</a> to criticism of Ubisoft's efforts to make amends by saying "we have done a lot and I think we are a company that can be proud of itself", pointing to the swift dismissal of certain reported offenders, including Patrux. Ubisoft have yet to respond to this week's revelations.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The Bulwark class is also great, with its huge shield and overpowered, game-saving abilities. But up to this point the Bulwark was unable to wield a Thunder Hammer. It made sense that it couldn’t, given you need two hands to bring a Thunder Hammer to bear on a heretic’s noggin, and you can’t do that while holding a Storm Shield.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, a Bulkwark can equip a Thunder Hammer, but there is an understandable catch: if the Bulwark uses a Thunder Hammer, it can’t also use a Storm Shield. This significantly changes what the Bulwark is all about, which is being a Space Marine who hunkers down for proper last stand stuff. The class has various abilities tied to using the Storm Shield, such as Shield Bash, which when using a Thunder Hammer are no longer available.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What I love is the patch notes explanation from Saber Interactive justifying this change. It basically amounts to an admission that it doesn’t make a great deal of sense lore wise, but they’re doing it anyway for FUN.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We are adding this option only because we think it will be very cool and it's a shame that only one class can use the Thunder Hammer,” Saber explained. “We are not done with Bulwark, more interesting gameplay things are to come.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As a result, the Bulwark’s perks have been updated, which you can find detailed in the patch notes below.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 Siege Mode Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Elsewhere, there is a hugely exciting tease for expanded customization options coming to Space Marine 2, one that’s already got fans hyped for what’s to come in future patches. </p><blockquote>We are preparing a very big update for customisation, players will be able to reuse chapter champion armour parts on other classes (with lore accuracy, clipping and technical restrictions). While it's not going to be in this patch, we wanted to mention this in this patch notes to assure you that we are going to continue expanding our customization system.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">The patch notes do not reveal any new weapons or Operations mode maps, so it seems the focus here is squarely on Siege, which arrives in fully fleshed out form as part of Patch 8 on June 26. But Saber has confirmed new content is set to hit the game, including a new class. Season 4 also includes a new game mode for PvP and a new Chaos enemy.

            <p>Nintendo is currently in full swing gearing up for the launch of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a>, and part of that has seen the company update a number of its original Switch games for the newer model. While many of these updates are along the lines of 'added support', Nintendo has gone a bit further with Legend of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom">Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a> - there's finally a more streamlined way to find favourite Echoes no matter which console you play on.</p>
<p>Echoes, for those unfamiliar with the game already, are essential items (or creatures) Zelda can copy and paste into the world, and use to her advantage. For example, once Zelda learns a bed Echo, she can use imitations of this object to create a bridge. An <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/best-echoes-to-get-early-zelda-of-wisdom">Echo of the classic Legend of Zelda enemy the Peahat</a>, meanwhile, can be deployed during any confrontation and steadily use its spikes to jab your foes into oblivion. However, they could sometimes take a while to find during gameplay, given in total there are <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/all-echoes-locations-abilities-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-listed">127 Echoes to eventually choose from</a> all in one long list to scroll through. </p>
<p>Thankfully, Nintendo has heard our outcries (I am sure I am not the only one who has cried out...) about this. Now, those playing Echoes of Wisdom will find a new feature which displays "only favourited echoes in the list of echoes after 30 or more echoes have been learned". Huzzah! My word, I would have really loved this when I played the game on its release last year.</p>

<p>The biggest feature introduced to the game by the Gone Fission update is fishing, which can be done in any water where swimming is possible. 30 new fish can now be caught, and it is also possible to cook new recipes using them. Before you can start enjoying this new pastime in the world of Fallout 76, however, you will first have to complete the Casting Off new questline, where you will receive a working Fishing Rod, which can also be upgraded by completing the new fishing challenges and daily fishing quests.</p>
<p>The Fallout 76: Gone Fission update also introduces 12 Axolotls to find, one available to catch every month throughout the year. The update also introduces Local Legends, new C.A.M.P. items related to the newly introduced fishing challenges, some combat changes, perk tweaks and rebalancing, and more.

            <p>Get yer flip-flops out and dust last year's sand off the boogie board. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a>'s world map will be bigger than previous games in the soaking survival series. At least that's what the developers say in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbvNYN76ArQ">a recent Q &amp; A video</a>. They've also said they're returning to the storytelling style of the first game, with a silent protagonist and "player discovery" being the big driver of the story. </p>

<p>"The playable map size will be bigger than what we originally launched in early access on the original <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/subnautica">Subnautica</a>, and even Below Zero's early access release," says creative producer Scott MacDonald in the video. "But just how big and how deep you'll be able to go over the course of early access, we're not exactly sure yet."</p>
<p>"The entire world is being handcrafted by a talented team of world designers and environment artists," he said, "and they're pouring everything into the world right now. We're aiming for this to be the biggest and most exciting Subnautica game ever once we hit 1.0 in a few years time."</p>
<p>It's not totally surprising for Unknown Worlds to go bigger for the sequel. But outright saying so may be reassuring to those players who complained that Below Zero's map felt smaller and shallower than the original survival splashabout. One player, for example, made comparison images to show <a href="https://imgur.com/xewdhVK">the difference in map size between games</a>.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Krafton</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I wasn't that bothered, to be honest. Much of the first game's map is open expanse and empty ocean - good for evoking a sense of vastness but not necessarily required in Below Zero's frosty ice fields.  The cold spinoff was still <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-below-zero-review">beautiful and inviting</a>, even if all the bitter snowstorms raged in a tighter space. But hey, I get why people are endlessly hungry for more watery depths to explore. The original Subnautica remains one of our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">best survival games</a>. </p>
<p>The devs cover some other common queries. They say a lot of players want to go back to the environmental storytelling basics of the first game. So the game is "returning to having a silent protagonist", rather than a tailored protagonist as in Below Zero. "But that doesn't mean that we won't have the opportunity to showcase some amazing voice acting in PDA entries and in other areas," says MacDonald. </p>
<p>But not everything is returning to tradition. The vehicles you'll get here won't include the nippy Seamoth submersible or hulking Cyclops submarine from the first game, we're told, because the team want to make "new vehicles that are designed in the same spirit, just more suited to the brand new environment". Meanwhile full character customisation won't be available from the first moments of early access, they say, but it will get added later.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The director of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> has claimed he was able to beat the game solo and without relics, that it's very possible to do so, and wants players to have the confidence to try it themselves.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/elden-ring-nightreign-director-interview-if-he-can-solo-every-boss-so-can-you/">In an interview with CNET</a>, director Junya Ishizaki was asked about how many bosses he had beaten himself, to which he responded: "I can hopefully give you reassurance to know that I have beaten all of the game's bosses. I've seen everything it has to offer, both in multiplayer and as a solo player. So I want you and players to know that this is very possible, and I want you to have the confidence to give it a try yourself. "</p>
<p>In a quick follow up, Ishizaki was asked if he'd solo'd every boss in the game too, to which he confirmed: "Yes. And without relics."</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-is-now-easier-for-solo-players">Elden Ring Nightreign was made easier for solo players last week</a>, acting as a salve for those who felt the solo experience was too daunting compared to the difficulty level experienced in groups of three. FromSoftware also announced a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-two-player-mode-confirmed-as-fromsoftware-celebrates-35m-players">duo-mode is in development in response to player feedback</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, while many are struggling still and Ishizaki has politely laid out a "Git Gud" to folks, one player has already jazzed up a regular Nightreign run by beating Gaping Jaw with a saxophone controller. This player - Dr. Doot - previously <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wg3RS_vYxpM">beat Elden Ring with a saxophone without being hit</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/this-years-agdq-included-someone-speedrunning-elden-ring-bosses-with-a-saxophone">and finished the game on the sax in less than 30 minutes at ADGQ this year</a>.</p> <div>

<p>So what I'm wondering is, when is Ishizaki busting his sax out? If he can't crack it, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/twitch-streamer-missmikkaa-completes-elden-ring-dlc-shadow-of-the-erdtree-on-a-dance-mat">a DDR mat would also suffice</a>.</p>
<p>Elden Ring Nightreign has proven to be a solid success despite its drastic departure from FromSoftware norms,<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-two-player-mode-confirmed-as-fromsoftware-celebrates-35m-players"> surpassing 3.5 million players yesterday</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The long-rumored Final Fantasy Tactics remaster could be announced during today's PlayStation State of Play, judging from some recent happenings.</p>
<p>Shortly after the announcement of the new presentation that will air later today, as reported on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/jason-schreier-might-be-teasing-an-upcoming-final-fantasy-tactics-remaster-announcement-plus-yasumi-matsuno-retweeted-the-state-of-play-tweet.1206009/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ResetERA forums</a>, Yasumi Matsuno, director and writer of the game, retweeted the announcement, suggesting that something he has worked on would be shown during the presentation, later deleting the retweet. In addition, well-known reporter Jason Schreier talked about the game shortly after the announcement of the State of Play on Bluesky, later correcting a user talking about a remake, saying that it is a remaster.</p>
<blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:2mkgbhbhqvappkkorf2bzyrp/app.bsky.feed.post/3lqptcfid4c2r" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreicz34dptjn7tp7r33oawxpzgbatmfnsp2gs4kikci4fu3zlx66wrq" data-bluesky-embed-color-mode="system">
<p lang="en">Remaster</p>
<p>— Jason Schreier (<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:2mkgbhbhqvappkkorf2bzyrp?ref_src=embed">@jasonschreier.bsky.social</a>) <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:2mkgbhbhqvappkkorf2bzyrp/post/3lqptcfid4c2r?ref_src=embed">June 3, 2025 at 7:36 PM</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The Final Fantasy Tactics remaster has been rumored for a long time, and there's very little doubt that it is real and coming at some point. The game was originally revealed alongside a slew of other Square Enix projects via a massive <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-leak-lists-final-fantasy-vii-ix-remake-half-life-2-remastered-mgs2-hd-and-lots-more/">GeForce NOW leak</a>, and every leaked title from the publisher eventually turned out to be real, except for the Final Fantasy IX remake, which has yet to be announced, much like the Final Fantasy Tactics Remaster.</p>
<p>Despite rumors of its development making the rounds for years, we have no idea if the Final Fantasy Tactics remaster will be a simple remaster, or something in the vein of Tactics Ogre Reborn, which introduced a lot of gameplay changes that ultimately make the remaster a more enjoyable experience than the PSP release, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tactics-ogre-reborn-review/">review</a>. Hopefully, it won't take too long to learn more about this, and if one infamous character will end up making every other unit obsolete when he joins Ramza in his quest as he does in the original PlayStation release.</p>

			<p>A few hours ago, NVIDIA released a new GeForce Hotfix Display Driver (version 576.66). This hotfix resolves crashing issues in popular games that are already out, such as the football game EA Sports FC 25 and the turn-based JRPG <a href="https://wccftech.com/33-days-after-launch-clair-obscur-expedition-33-reaches-3-3-million-copies-sold/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, as well as the upcoming survival MMO-like game <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-surprisingly-adds-private-servers-at-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dune Awakening</a>, which will officially launch on June 10 but will be playable starting tomorrow for those who purchased the Deluxe or Ultimate edition.</p>
<p>There are a couple more things in this GeForce Hotfix Display Driver release, as you can read from the official changelog:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dune: Awakening may crash during gameplay [5273568]</li>
<li>EA Sports FC 25 may crash during gameplay [5251937]</li>
<li>[RTX 50 series] Dragons Dogma 2 displays shadow flicker [5252205]</li>
<li>[RTX 50 series] Video playback in a web browser may show brief red/green flash corruption [5241341]</li>
<li>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 may crash [5283401]</li>
</ul>
<p>Unlike regular GeForce Game Ready drivers, a GeForce Hotfix Display Driver cannot be downloaded via GeForce Experience or the recently released NVIDIA app. You'll have to get it manually <a href="https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/5667" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from this support page on NVIDIA's website</a>. Of course, if you're not encountering those issues and/or are not playing those games, you can skip the download. It will be rolled into the next major GeForce Game Ready driver release anyway, which is probably not far off.</p>

			<p>A new PlayStation 5 system software update is now available, bringing a small number of improvements to the system.</p>
<p>As a minor update, system software 25.04-11.40.00 doesn't introduce any major new features, focusing on improving message and usability on some screens, according to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/hardware/ps5/system-software-info/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official update notes</a> shared on the PlayStation official website. No other change or improvement is mentioned, so we will have to wait for the next update for the usual<a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-system-software-update-25-01-10-60-00/"> system stability improvements</a> often implemented in system software updates.</p>
<p>The latest major PlayStation 5 system software update went live back in April, bringing back the beloved PlayStation 30th anniversary UI some months after it went live and was later taken down when the 30th anniversary celebrations ended. The 25.03-11.20.00 also introduced the Audio Focus feature, a feature only available when using headphones that supports broader accessibility and allows players to hear quiet sounds and voice chat more clearly in games. Rounding up the changes and improvements introduced in the latest major update were the usual system software performance and stability improvements.</p>
<p>The new PlayStation 5 system software update 25.04-11.40.00 will be downloaded by the system automatically.&nbsp;<span>You can download the latest system software update&nbsp;<a href="https://pc.ps5.update.playstation.net/update/ps5/official/tJMRE80IbXnE9YuG0jzTXgKEjIMoabr6/image/2025_0529/sys_c81ab2031ccdaec9c83dcb1918d5051e3c6e988a5c6dba135cf238aa944072ed/PS5UPDATE.PUP" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here </a>if you want to update it manually</span>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion">Oblivion</a> is really a game about the Imperial Watch. Forget all the Mehrunes Dagon stuff and that Hero of Kvatch - the real stars of the show are the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rps-asks-please-tell-me-your-stupidest-oblivion-remastered-anecdotes-so-far">stupid</a> guards who pop out of the ether to tell you it’s time to pay the fine for your long list of misdeeds or head off to jail.</p>
<p>One <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">Oblivion Remastered</a> modder clearly feels the same way, as they’ve just fleshed out the Imperial Watch and Forestry divisions into joinable factions, via the addition of some new radiant quests and systems. These kinds of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/oblivion-remastered-best-mods">mods</a> have become a bit of a hobby for the modder in question, ColdTyrant, and I <a href="https://www.vg247.com/oblivion-remastered-coldtyrant-modder-interview-evil-faction-quests">spoke to them about it</a> pretty recently.</p>
<!--more-->
<p><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/4225?tab=description">The latest project</a> in their ‘Infinitum’ series of faction mods focuses on the Imperial Legion, and it looks like it offers a roleplaying experience I’ve been craving for years. You’re offered the choice by an NPC called Field Officer Leveilleur of becoming one of the potato-faced Imperial guards that patrol Cyrodiil or one of the rangers that help keep the wilderness in check.</p>
<p>The former is the option I’m most interested in, as it means you can earn gold and promotions by completing radiant arrest warrant quests. These task you with hunting down wanted criminals, stopping them in their criminal scummy ways, and demanding they make the infamous decision that’s usually facing your character - come quietly or resist arrest. Hilariously, the wording of what you say to them is exactly the same, so you can properly embrace the memeiness of your new vocation.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, folks who choose forestry are tasked with hunting down bandits at randomly selected camps. The mod doesn’t leave it there, also giving you the chance to go a bit bad and abuse your guardly powers. Both branches render you able to impose fines on the regular citizens of Cyrodiil, and if you want, you can extort them for money like a certain Ulrich of Cheydinhal.</p>
<p>ColdTyrant’s created a system to track this, which I’ll let them explain: “If you choose to do this, your Corruption Level will increase by 10 for each illegally-demanded fine, and the game will inform you of your current Corruption level whenever it increases or decreases.</p>
<p>“If you really go out of control, and manage to reach a Corruption Level of 100, you will be permanently expelled from The Imperial Legion. This will remove any pending warrants or bounties, strip you of your ranks, and remove all Imperial Legion Infinitum content from the game, as well as slam you with an extremely heavy bounty.” So yup, another stat to try and max out if you’re a morally ambiguous completionist.</p>
<p>Don’t worry, though, the modder adds that you can gradually get back on the good path by going back to lawfully arresting and bounty hunting. If you want to give the mod a go, you’ll need to grab <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/32">UE4SS</a> and the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/1272">TesSyncMapInjector</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p><a href="https://x.com/_Tom_Henderson_/status/1929890398236774904" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According</a> to insider Tom Henderson, Sony might announce a new God of War game later today during the <a href="https://wccftech.com/40-minute-playstation-state-of-play-announced-for-tomorrow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">State of Play live stream</a>. However, this won't be the next installment in the main series; on the other hand, the report says it will be a 2.5D Metroidvania-inspired game set in ancient Greece. Henderson even added that it sounds smaller scale than he previously thought, so don't expect a sizable experience.</p>
<p>Still, it could be an interesting one, not unlike Ubisoft's Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown. That game was successful among critics (it <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-who-needs-sands-time/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earned</a> a 9/10 score here on Wccftech) and fans, but it <a href="https://wccftech.com/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-sequel-isnt-happening-due-to-low-sales-ubisoft-disbanded-the-team/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">did not sell enough to warrant a sequel.</a> In the case of God of War, it might be a stopgap release while Sony Santa Monica is busy with something else.</p>
<p>As far as we know, they have two main teams, and their next release from Cory Barlog's team is <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-developer-might-be-making-a-new-ip/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumored</a> to be a new IP, possibly set in a sci-fi universe. Of course, there will eventually be a new mainline God of War game, but it wouldn't be too surprising if it only arrived on PlayStation 6, given the increasingly long development times of a triple-A game.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, there were also <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-greek-saga-remasters-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumors</a> that Sony Santa Monica would be remastering the Greek trilogy. It is unclear whether that was indeed true and the announcement has been delayed, or perhaps insiders got slightly misleading information and their sources were referring to this 2.5D Metroidvania spin-off instead. Regardless, we should learn more about it in around twelve hours or so.</p>
<p>As a reminder, the developer is also <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-tv-series-officially-coming-from-amazon-prime-video/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">working</a> with Amazon Prime Video on a live action TV series adaptation of the Norse trilogy. However, production was delayed due to a major change: showrunner Rafe Judkins was <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-tv-series-starts-from-scratch-with-battlestar-galactica-for-all-mankind-producer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">replaced</a> by Ronald D. Moore, who is credited for Star Trek: Next Generation, Battlestar Galactica, For All Mankind, and Outlander.</p>

            <p>I currently do not have time to play <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyber-knights-flashpoint">Cyber Knights: Flashpoint</a>, the game Katherine (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-spiritual-successor-to-invisible-inc-is-finally-here">called </a> a "spiritual successor" to (unbelievably good stealth tactics game) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/invisible-inc">Invisible Inc</a>. So, I'm writing about its release from early access as a sort of vicarious joy substitute. Because, boy, does it tick several big honking megaboxes for me. The idea is that you'll be pulling off cyberpunky heists with a squad of mercs, planning and executing while keeping the future fuzz off your backs. There's also lots of dense <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> multiclassing stuff I'll talk about in a second. Here's a launch trailer.</p>

<p>"A modern tactical RPG with some of our favorite elements: gridless movement, environmental cover, specialized overwatch, initiative manipulation and more," begins the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1021210/Cyber_Knights_Flashpoint/">Steam description</a>. More of this, please. Don't tell me how immersed I'll be in your visceral yet cerebral yet emotional journey that represents a bold evolution of (genre). Tell me about the specific (genre) design you're personally into and are very excited about having shoved into your game. There's more. Customisable weapons. Faction reputation. 40 multiclass combinations. A variety of admirable hairdos. There's even some <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deus-ex">Deus Ex</a> Human Revolution style hacking minigames.</p>
<p>I am chuffed this exists, evidently, although I am just trailer-gawking. For a more sober and detailed take, do read <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rally-point-cyber-knights-flashpoint-is-both-worth-playing-and-worth-waiting-for-a-little-longer">Sin's Rally Point on the game</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The design goal is, I think, to represent stealth as vital, but not the entirety of your tactics. If you're feeling spicy you can hit a job loud, counting on speed and firepower over waiting for the sentry to chase the shiny penny. Almost all gunfights should feature rolling, repositioning, moving towards a target or shooting your way out before reinforcements catch up. Rather than a stealth/combat binary there's room for degrees of both, sometimes simultaneously.</p></blockquote>
<p>Bah! I am already <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/battle-prose">managing one party of mercs regularly</a>, but it now seems like I'll need to make room in my life for another.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/4010">Glory Holes Of Oblivion</a> is an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a> mod that lets you shoot arrows and cast spells through holes in gates, and also allows your enemies to do the same. Cheers <a href="https://www.exresearch.co/">Ex Research</a> for the spot. NexusMods lists Glory Holes Of Oblivion as containing 'adult content'. This is surely because they're not scholars of glassblowing or drawers. More on this in a second. First, here's a good skeleton demonstrating the use of the mod.</p>

<p>Right: etymology time, buckaroos. Whoop whoop. This is a good one, too. The <a href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/glory%20hole">original meaning </a>of the term 'glory hole' seems to be "a drawer or box where things are heaped together in a disorderly manner". This pleases me because I've spent my entire life just calling them 'stuff drawers". I have one to my right as I'm typing this. It contains: Post-it notes, batteries, guitar picks, a single micro USB cord, Hall's Soothers, some screws, and a small remote for a lamp I'll never use because I only like one of its changeable hues. According to the (single, repeated around the internet a lot, might be therefore be bollocks) source, the use of 'glory' here likely comes from the Scottish 'glaur' - "to make muddy, dirty, defile".</p>
<p>Yes, skeleton. I'll be with you in a second.</p>
<p>For our next glorious fact, you need to pop yourself over to the 1849 book <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/books/edition/Curiosities_of_Glass_Making/OI80AQAAMAAJ">Curiosities of Glass Making (With Details of the Processes and Productions of Ancient and Modern Ornamental Glass Manufacture)</a>. On page 65, you'll find an illustration of today's subject, described as "the mouth of a pot heated by beech-wood, and called the Glory Hole". This was used to reheat large objects following the processing of 'annealing', or slowly cooling to remove internal stresses. According to our first source, this likely comes from a different  'glory' - which had come to suggest a "circle or ring of light" by the 1690s.</p>
<p>As for modernity, its earliest recorded usage is in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glory_hole#History">a 1707 court case</a>, with the rise of the glory hole coinciding with the need to be discreet in a society that simply refused to be normal about queer people. Luckily, things are fine now, providing you eat this delicious meal of black mould J.K Rowling has prepared for you like it's the introduction to Resident Evil 7, and ask absolutely no follow up questions.</p>
<p>None of this information is, I imagine, factored into this mod. But this means little to the skeleton, who is still doomed. Lmao.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>I need help identifying an Ossic Ring. Whatever an Ossic Ring is, it's related to a serpent goddess and is great at keeping away vermin. Legend holds that you can hear it hissing. I'm not sure if the Ossic Ring is an actual ring, and if so, whether it's a ring for your finger or a ring necklace or a ring design found on something unhelpfully nonringular.</p>
<p>With time running short (I am playing the demo for Bad Viking's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/strange-antiquities">Strange Antiquities</a> on the train), I grab weird knick knacks from my shelves at random and thrust them imperiously at the customer. Perhaps this berringed corpse's hand? No? How about this iron band enclosing a blue crystal tear? I get it wrong three times in a row and my character's brain saturates with Dread. To dispel the Dread, I must play a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farkle">farkle</a>-style dice game, matching faces to sigils before my soul collapses. Ah, this is just like recommending guest beers at the gastropub I worked in before getting my first job in the shitpost business. Do Strange Ales next, Bad Viking.</p><!--more-->

<p>As you may guess from the title, Strange Antiquities is essentially 2022's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/strange-horticulture">Strange Horticulture</a> but you are running a magic antiquarian store rather than a magic garden centre. I haven't played much of Strange Horticulture, but the broad strokes of Strange Antiquities seem identical to those of the verdant puzzler Alice B (RPS in peace) described as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/strange-horticulture-review">"quiet, meticulous, delightful, dark, and beguiling"</a>. Ding the bell and customers materialise from the green streets of Undermere to ask for a particular item - a bony emblem to aid with the hunt, for example, or a Moon Heart to provide solace for a lonely grandmother. You then work out which of your initially unlabelled commodities fits the bill.</p>
<p>First, you look up the name in an illustrated antiquarian's guide. Then you try to find an artefact that has the right shape, texture, material composition, temperature, smell, sound and psychic resonance. Perhaps you also refer to your book of symbols, which is otherwise used when writing labels. According to Alice B, there was a reward in Strange Horticulture for labelling things very precisely, and I imagine the same is true here.</p>
<p>The appeal of Strange Antiquities, for me, is that it cuts against the disposability of so-called magical artefacts in many other games. Today's RPG-flavoured free-to-play or live service offerings especially are larded with eldritch geegaws, frou-frous and doodads that exist to be fed continually into progression systems. They are glittering sequins on the face of a slot machine.</p>
<p>Strange Antiquities wants you to run curious hands over every dusty Ascendant Shard or poundshop Holy Grail and diagnose its aura. There's a patent loveliness to this. Between sales, you'll also investigate the interior of the shop, which is full of locked compartments and peculiar mechanisms. As in Horticulture, there's a wider world to glean from customer requests, troubled dreams, and expeditions to recover artefacts that take place on a paper map.</p>
<p>My chief criticism, I guess, is that the occult elements don't feel very occluded. Yes, you have to figure out the lore, but there's no doubt that everything in stock is a potential Lament Configuration. I think the game would be more engrossing if the objects at your disposal appeared mostly or entirely devoid of supernatural import, and you had to impose and cultivate those associations by striving to fulfil orders. But that would be a very different game. This one will probably be quite enchanting enough if you adored Horticulture. The demo launches on 5th June.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/as-if-sweary-darth-vader-wasnt-enough-fortnite-developer-epic-will-soon-be-letting-players-create-their-own-ai-powered-npcs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Oh boy. Remember the AI-voiced Darth Vader NPC Epic recently added to Fortnite? The one that very quickly had to patched because it wouldn't stop <a href="https://www.vg247.com/fortnite-darth-vader-ai-chatbot-why-does-this-exist">saying bad words</a>, and has since become the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-voice-actor-union-takes-fortnites-darth-vader-chatbot-to-court">subject of action</a> from the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sag-aftra">SAG-AFTRA</a> union? Well, it'll be getting some AI NPC siblings later this year, with Epic planning to give creators the tools to create their own.</p>
<p>AI Vader, which was created in collaboration with the family of actor James Earl Jones, got its own streamer reaction montage at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjikvaR0i34">State of Unreal showcase</a> during which these upcoming AI NPC tools were announced - one that naturally didn't feature any of the clips of it swearing or saying slurs.</p> <div>

</p></div>
<p>"As game developers, our job is to entertain players and AI is ultimately a tool to make games more fun and immersive," said Epic's Fortnite ecosystem EVP Saxs Persson, "It enables infinite possibilities for two-way dialogue just like we saw with Darth Vader, and as the next step we want to take what we've learned and share the underlying technology with you."</p>
<p>In practice, players will mess around with a new "Persona Device" to create AI NPCs, picking the type of voice and delivery they want for the character, as well as its "characteristics". This was demoed on stage via an AI NPC taking on the role of "a mysterious cosmic entity named Mr Buttons", tasked with persuading the player to press a big red button with "comedic finesse". It'd have earned surreal points with me was I not a bit preoccupied with the ethics of using AI to voice NPCs.</p>
<p>After all, this is just the latest chapter in the ongoing debate over the ethics of using generative AI for voice acting. The aforementioned SAG-AFTRA and a host of voice actors have opposed it, arguing that it poses a potential threat to human VAs' livelihoods, with the union having called a strike that's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/following-the-nightmare-footage-of-ai-loy-horizon-actor-ashly-burch-shares-her-stance-on-the-whole-debacle">still ongoing</a> as of writing. SAG-AFTRA, meanwhile, has <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/actors-union-sag-aftra-strike-deal-to-allow-ai-voice-replicas-and-video-game-stars-are-understandably-pissed">drawn some criticism</a> of its own for striking deals with a companies which employ generative AI.</p>
<p>I'd say being sworn at by Darth Vader isn't that immersive. Then again, I struggle to get too hung up on immersion in games that can see you be 360 no-scoped by Mace Windu, who then promptly hits the griddy and gets obliterated by the OP combat skills of Sabrina Carpenter or a sentinent banana. If you want a more nuanced, in-depth view on the genAI in games debate, it's worth checking out Michael Cook's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/electric-nightmares">Electric Nightmares essay series</a> on the issue.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>British developer Jagex announced a round of layoffs. Community Manager JagexHooli <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/1l1fut4/comment/mvkxroe/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> it earlier this week with the following Reddit comment:</p>
<p><em>Yes, there have unfortunately been job reductions at Jagex. These have been made as part of changes in a company restructure as Jagex puts more emphasis on RuneScape games and community growth. The majority of roles are from non-game dev and non-player facing areas. There are some exceptions within the RS team as part the company's focus on a streamlined development approach.</em></p>
<p><em>I’m sure many of you are concerned about what this means for RuneScape 3. This is not a change in direction from what Mod North has said before – we are still committed to growing this game and investing in it. Our Roadmap won’t change because of these job reductions, and we’ll continue the great path we’ve been on with our content. We will talk to you about this when the time is right.</em></p>
<p><em>What matters most right now are the people affected by this change. The studio’s focus is to support those affected, as is mine. Now is the time we put them first and do everything we can to help them out.</em></p>
<p>At the same time, work on 'Project Zanaris', whose objective was to allow private servers for Old School RuneScape, has been paused. On this note, Jagex <a href="https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/pausing-project-zanaris--whats-next?oldschool=1#_ga=2.197087977.499468828.1749024097-1248850839.1749024095" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a>:</p>
<p><em>After careful consideration, we've decided to pause work on Zanaris indefinitely. We're committed to delivering the best possible Old School RuneScape experience. With a renewed focus and continued support from our incredible team, we're excited to keep making OSRS even better for everyone.</em></p>
<p><em>We understand that feelings around the project were mixed, and many of the concerns raised were fair. The truth is, there are other areas of the core Old School experience that deserve more attention right now. While Zanaris was ambitious and innovative, it wouldn't have met expectations until much later in development. Rather than stretch our focus, we want to prioritise the things that matter most to you today.</em></p>
<p>Jagex recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/runescape-dragonwilds-has-suddenly-launched-on-steam-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> RuneScape: Dragonwilds, a survival cooperative multiplayer game, on Steam Early Access. According to Steam data, it was purchased by 550K, 789K, or 842K users, depending on the analytics website (VG Insights, Gamalytic, PlayTracker).</p>
