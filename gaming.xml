After the announcement, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_(streaming_service)#cite_note-62&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_(streaming_service)#cite_note-62" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WB’s stock dropped by six percent</a></span> and people mostly laughed at the new name and kept using the old one. Then, in February, WB rebranded Max’s logo from blue to black, seemingly signaling a return to the HBO branding. And now here we are. HBO Max is back after millions of wasted dollars. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://press.wbd.com/us/media-release/max/warner-bros-discovery-announces-max-become-hbo-max-summer&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://press.wbd.com/us/media-release/max/warner-bros-discovery-announces-max-become-hbo-max-summer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On May 14, WB Discovery announced</a></span> that it was bringing back the HBO Max name this summer because “consumers” now demand “better” content, not just “more” content. Fun fact: <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/12/23673475/warner-bros-discovery-max-new-name-hbo&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/12/23673475/warner-bros-discovery-max-new-name-hbo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Back in 2023</a></span>, after dropping HBO from the brand, the reason given was because they wanted people to not assume it was just premium adult content. Anyway, here’s some corpo blabble that will make you roll your eyes so hard they might fall out of your head. </p><p>“Returning the HBO brand into HBO Max will further drive the service forward and amplify the uniqueness that subscribers can expect from the offering. It is also a testament to WBD’s willingness to keep boldly iterating its strategy and approach—leaning heavily on consumer data and insights—to best position itself for success.”</p><p>Ahh, yes, what a bold strategy! Taking a name that was popular, recognized, liked, and successful, and tossing it into the bin because you completed a big merger and suddenly had new execs wanting to shake things up and be a part of the process. Then, after that new name flopped and everyone mostly igorned it anyway, you sneak back out to the garbage, clean up the old name, and bring it back with a big press release that touts how HBO is a brand connected to quality and prestige. Makes you wonder why you ditched it to begin with? </p><p>Now, let’s all think about how much money was spent on this stupid process and how the richest people in the world running these companies aren’t good at their jobs. Welcome back, HBO Max. You shouldn’t have been killed in the first place. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

I am told, by just about every single person in my life, that I should be using a mechanical keyboard, with removable switches, clickity-clackity sounds, and probably enough neon lighting to open a nightclub. I do not. I use a Microsoft MultiMedia Keyboard 1.0A, with a blob of Blu-Tac over the Num Lock LED, and I have done so for as long as I can remember. And as of today, I’m down to my last one. When this one goes, that’s it. I’m done.</p><figure id="" data-id="e919d42bb401a06493cea7a3fded7e08" data-recommend-id="image://e919d42bb401a06493cea7a3fded7e08" data-format="jpg" data-width="967" data-height="544" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A dead keyboard, lying on its belly on a towel." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A dead keyboard, lying on its belly on a towel." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->John Walker / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e919d42bb401a06493cea7a3fded7e08" data-recommend-id="image://e919d42bb401a06493cea7a3fded7e08" data-format="jpg" data-width="967" data-height="544" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A dead keyboard, lying on its belly on a towel." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I’m not ashamed, and you’re not going to make me ashamed. The Microsoft MultiMedia Keyboard 1.0A is the best keyboard ever made. First created in 1997, its keys press with a whisper-quiet “shddd” and that is perfection. Yes, it has the most ludicrous array of “media” buttons across the top in a fancy arch, and no, I’ve never pressed one of them once in the twenty-ish years I’ve been using this keyboard. And no, this isn’t the “Natural” ergonomic version, it’s the regular-shaped one. I’m not a sicko.</p><p>I have had friends and co-workers react with genuine horror upon hearing of my use of this device. To not be part of the mechanical cult is, apparently, shun-worthy, and I accept that you too, reader, are now thinking even less of me. But worry not, for of the pile of six of these keyboards I bought when I heard they were no longer going to be manufactured, the one I’ve attached via its PS/2 cord to my PC today is my last. And after this one dies, I feel like retirement is my only option.</p><p>You know those authors who say that they write their books out long-hand, using the fountain pen they inherited from their great-great grandmother, and then some poor lackey has to type them up for the publisher? Or the writers who insist on using a 1930s Royal P typewriter, because they’re incapable of composing their prose on anything else? That’s me. Pretentious, dumbass me. The magic’s not in my heart, it’s in the Microsoft MultiMedia 1.0A.</p><p>(Look, I know, there’s controversy here that I’m not addressing. The official Microsoft data sheet for the keyboard calls it a “1.0a,” but the device itself says “1.0A,” and I won’t be budged from that capitalization. Sorry, you’ll just have to be offended.)</p><p>This is the keyboard on which I’ve composed my greatest works.

It’s the keyboard on which I finished <em>Dishonored 2</em>, and the means by which I conquered <em>Titanfall 2</em>. I’m far better at <em>Fortnite</em> on these keys than I am on my Xbox. This is how I spent those billions of hours in <em>Skyrim</em>. This keyboard is vital to my gaming life!</p><p>Over the years, I’ve been through so many makes of PCs, mice, monitors and speakers, but the keyboard has always remained the same. For years, I had to use a USB adaptor to plug the PS/2 cable in, although right now (because fate knows best) my current PC actually has a classic purple port right on the motherboard. I have literally no idea why. Surely there’s no one else this stupid?</p><figure id="" data-id="f5a2623becea03076327bdf1913928c4" data-recommend-id="image://f5a2623becea03076327bdf1913928c4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1042" data-height="587" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A new keyboard in its cardboard box." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A new keyboard in its cardboard box." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->John Walker / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f5a2623becea03076327bdf1913928c4" data-recommend-id="image://f5a2623becea03076327bdf1913928c4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1042" data-height="587" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A new keyboard in its cardboard box." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>But it feels right! Maybe you have a favorite make of running shoes that you insist on buying, because everything else makes your feet feel funny. (You should try barefoot shoes though, trust me.) Perhaps there’s a cushion you put on the driver’s seat of every car? A favorite pillow without which going to sleep is significantly harder? That’s my 1.0A. It feels exactly the right shape under my fingers, the keys are perfectly spaced apart for my hands, and the wrist rest clips on the front in a way that makes all other keyboards feel like a form of gentle torture.</p><p>Time is certainly not on my side. Despite the mysterious PS/2 port, Windows doesn’t like this keyboard very much any more. The first thing I do each time I crack open a new one (usually because either the one I’m using has become as clickity-clackity as your ghastly mechanical setup, or because—as with today—I’ve murdered the last one with liquid) is fix the crummy delay when holding down a single key. Except, in the ten minutes I spent looking before I started writing this, I have been unable to find the key delay settings in Windows! They’re gone! I just misspelt “They’re” and when I held down Backspace to fix it, it took a near interminable half a second to begin clearing the mistake. I’m searching on Google for a solution, and most of the results are, “Are you OK? Do you need anything?”</p><figure id="" data-id="e5a829273329b1a945225e2f2c0f82b8" data-recommend-id="image://e5a829273329b1a945225e2f2c0f82b8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1128" data-height="634" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The new keyboard in all its glory, complete with Blu-Tac over the light." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The new keyboard in all its glory, complete with Blu-Tac over the light." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->John Walker / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e5a829273329b1a945225e2f2c0f82b8" data-recommend-id="image://e5a829273329b1a945225e2f2c0f82b8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1128" data-height="634" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The new keyboard in all its glory, complete with Blu-Tac over the light." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>“So just buy a new one,” you might say, before realizing that it’ll only encourage me to keep working. Oh, poor sweet fool, if only it were that simple. When these things were new, they cost like $20. They were so gloriously cheap. When I bought that batch of six in 2013, it cost me $40 (plus $25 shipping!). That’s the greatest bargain of my life. Less than $11 a keyboard, and they’ve kept me going for 12 beautiful years. But right now, when I look on eBay, I’m finding <em>used</em> ones for $90! <em>USED! </em>(And to make matters worse, it’s listed as “Vintage.” It’s not fucking vintage! It’s as old as <em>Fight Club</em>. That is not a vintage film.)</p><p>In the last couple of years, when looking to find more back-ups, I’ve never seen a new one on sale for less than $100, which is ludicrous. Today, however, the best price for a new, unused version I’ve found <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/235994418826&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/235994418826" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">is £32</a></span> ($43) and maybe I have to pay that? What’s that—a quarter of the cheapest mechanical keyboard you’d consider buying? <em>Outrageous</em>. Is my career worth this much?</p><p>OK, fine, I just bought it, alongside a second one I found for $20 that claims to be unused, but I’m suspicious. And with that, I’ve bought <em>all</em> the “new” 1.0As available on UK eBay. (PayPal was so suspicious of this activity that on buying the second one it sent alerts to my phone to make sure my account hadn’t been hacked by a deranged, 150-year-old criminal.) I refuse to believe there aren’t Microsoft warehouses filled with forgotten pallets of these things, lurking in a dark corner behind the crates holding Arks of the Covenant. Honestly, at this point I should be part of some ambassador program, appointed by Microsoft to herald the greatest moment in the company’s history, before it got distracted all over again by being evil.</p><p>And I still don’t care what you think. It’s so lovely to be on a brand new one of these lovely keyboards, the keys especially thuddy, the gaps between them not containing concerning amounts of fluff, and the insides entirely free of coffee and soda. I just need to figure out how to let it let me delete my mistakes more quickly, and I’m a happy boy. Until they’re all gone, that is, although I somewhat suspect that’ll be more than the universe can take, and everything else will go with it.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Officially titled Stalker: Legends of the Zone Trilogy Enhanced Edition, developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/gsc-game-world">GSC Game World</a>'s newly announced current-gen update promises a range of additions and optimisations to all three bundled titles - 2007's Shadow of Chornobyl, 2008's Clear Sky, and 2009's Call of Prypiat - alongside a number of platform-specific features.
</p>
<p>
All platforms get visual upgrades, for instance, including enhanced lighting (GSC specifically mentions godrays, screen space reflections, and global illumination), advanced shaders for water and wetness effects, upgraded skyboxes, upscaled textures, and improved 3D models for NPCs, weapons, and environments. That's in addition to improved weapon field-of-vision, and 4K pre-rendered cinematics for a bit of extra storytelling pizzazz.

<p>Playing the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/19/wreckfest-2-early-access-preview/">Wreckfest 2 Early Access</a> at its initial release, with its very limited content, I said, “At this point in time, fans of the original are probably best served by actually continuing to play the original, but if you know that Wreckfest 2 will be a part of your racing game future and want to get in at the earliest possible point to see it develop, then the Steam Early Access release might just be for you. It is distinctly limited right now, little more than a demo or technical test, but there’s plenty for fans to look forward to in the months ahead.”</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-final-system-specifications-cpu-gpu-dlss/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-final-system-specifications-confirm-cpu-gpu-max-clock-speeds-available-ram-for-games-multiple-nvidia-dlss-options.1189119/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-final-system-specifications-cpu-gpu-dlss/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The full Nintendo Switch 2 system specifications have been detailed today, providing a better idea of what the system may be capable of and revealing some of the limitations developers will have to work around for their games.</p>
<p>Today, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-final-tech-specs-and-system-reservations-confirmed">Digital Foundry</a> provided a full run-down of the system specifications for the next-generation Nintendo console, starting with the CPU. The ARM Cortex A7BC runs the ARMv8 64-bit instruction set with cryptography extensions enabled, with no support for 32-bit in the SDK, and features 64K of L1 instruction cache and another 64K for L1 data cache. Each of the eight cores has 256K of L2 cache, sharing 4MB of L3 cache. Like the original Nintendo Switch CPU, not all cores will be available for games, as two will be reserved for running the operating system. In terms of CPU maximum clock speed, the CPU can reach as high as 1.7 GHz, a lot higher than the figures of 1100 MHz for handheld mode and 998 MHz for docked mode. According to Digital Foundry, the max clock speed is a theoretical maximum that could be reached in specific circumstances.</p>
<p>Regarding the Nintendo Switch 2 GPU, Digital Foundry confirmed the specs leaked before the system was revealed. The console's GPU is built on the Ampere architecture, which powers the RTX 30 series GPU, has 1536 CUDA cores, and runs at 561 MHz in handheld mode and 1007 MHz in docked mode. The GPU can run as high as 1.4 GHz, but it's not clear if developers can push the GPU higher than the values indicated for handheld and docked modes. Additionally, developers won't be able to use all the GPU resources, as some are reserved for the system. The 3.072 TFLOPs figure was also confirmed by Digital Foundry, but it has become somewhat irrelevant to gauge the system's performance. Regarding the console's ray tracing capabilities, the Nintendo Switch 2 is rated for around 10 gigarays per second, 20 in docked mode.</p>
<p>Much like the CPU and the GPU, not all of the Nintendo Switch 2's 12GB of LPDDR5X RAM will be available for games. Besides confirming that the RAM comes with two 6 GB modules and its 102GB/s and 68GB/s bandwidth for docked and handheld modes respectively, Digital Foundry confirmed that 3 GB of RAM will be reserved for the operating system, which is a much bigger chunk of RAM reserved for non-gaming functions compared to what was reserved for the original Switch.</p>
<p>Via the system's SDK, Digital Foundry was also able to confirm how the Nintendo Switch 2's custom-made FDE, File Decompression Engine, should allow for faster and more power-efficient decompression, and how VRR is only available for the system's screen, and is not currently supported over HDMI. It was also confirmed how Game Chat may have a certain performance impact on the system, so much so that a tool to test the function without an active session is being provided to developers.</p>
<p>Lastly, Digital Foundry was also able to confirm that the Nintendo Switch 2 will support multiple NVIDIA DLSS options—DLAA, 1x, 2x, and 3x options. While details on these options are not available, it is speculated that they could be equivalent to the Quality, Balanced, and Performance modes available on PC.</p>
<p><iframe title="Nintendo Switch 2 Confirmed Specs: CPU, GPU, Memory, System Reservation + More" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/huxDoYXS8Ng?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 launches on June 5th worldwide, except for select regions like <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-has-indefinitely-delayed-the-launch-of-the-nintendo-switch-2-in-china/">China</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-wont-launch-in-central-america-or-the-caribbean-this-year/">Central America</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-teams-up-with-bad-boys-for-life-directors-to-make-a-riders-republic-film-adaptation/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Another video game-to-film adaptation is in the works, and this time it's Ubisoft's open-world extreme-sports multiplayer game Riders Republic being made into a movie, <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/05/riders-republic-adil-bilall-gaumont-ubisoft-1236397176/">Deadline</a> reports.</p>
<p>The studio has teamed up with Bad Boys for Life and Bad Boys: Ride or Die directors Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah to direct the project, with Noé Debré signed on to write the script. Ubisoft and Gaumont will develop and produce the film.</p>
<p>Released in 2021, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/riders-republic-beautiful-rocky-road/">Riders Republic</a> was a flawed but solid game for anyone who just wanted to jump on a bike and ride down the side of a mountain, hop on a snowboard, or just as quickly jump into several other sports of the extreme variety. It launched with a <a href="https://wccftech.com/riders-republic-fixes-achievements-matchmaking-mass-races/">bunch of issues</a>, like most modern multiplayer games, but what it definitely wasn't known for was its rich characters and story.</p>
<p>Which means that, for now, it's anyone's guess as to what this movie will be about. The only note about what this movie will actually be about in Deadline's report says that the movie will capture the action of the extreme sports "<em>with humor and spectacular stunts on the snow-covered slopes of the Alps</em>."</p>
<p>We've been enjoying a renaissance of video game to film/TV adaptations with some standout successes, like HBO's The Last of Us, Amazon's Fallout, the Sonic movies, and the Super Mario Bros. movie. But there have still been some big misses, like <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-tv-show-is-canceled-but-is-being-shopped-around-while-fallout-ramps-up-season-2-and-earns-emmy-nominations/">Paramount's Halo TV show</a> and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-movie-handed-to-tim-miller-for-reshoots/">Borderlands</a> movie, which both showed that you can't just adapt any video game into a film and walk away with $1 billion.</p>
<p>If Ubisoft hadn't already tried to make a big blockbuster hit out of <a href="http://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-review/">Assassin's Creed</a> years ago, it would definitely have tried that in this current landscape before trying to make a Riders Republic movie. Perhaps casting and the 10 million player base that Deadline's report says Riders Republic has will help make the movie successful. But right now, that feels difficult to imagine.</p>

        <p>Finally, a relatable main character</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Hideo Kojima is his own Peter Molydeux, in that he's forever out there pitching Kojima-like ideas for games he might make. Hideo Jokima? On a recent episode of his Japanese radio show, KOJI10, the designer of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-gear-solid">Metal Gear Solid</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding">Death Stranding</a> pitched a few ideas he had for games based around time. The best of the bunch: a game in which your character gradually forgets information if players take too long a break from playing.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hideo-kojima-has-an-amazing-idea-for-a-forgetting-game-where-the-main-character-gradually-forgets-important-information-and-abilities-if-you-take-too-long-a-break-from-playing">Ian Games Network reports</a>, the "forgetting game" is one that players would have to "play through quickly".
</p>
<blockquote>In this concept, the main character gradually forgets important information and abilities if you take too long a break from the game. For example, if you don’t play every day, the main character will gradually forget things such as “how to fire their gun or what their job is.” This forgetfulness builds up until finally the player is unable to move. “Players would have to take a week off work or school to play it,” Kojima laughs.</blockquote>
<p>What's that, you say? You already have to play through games quickly lest you forget what the heck is going on when you return to them? Yes, everyone everywhere has already had that response. I, too, can't remember the buttons anymore when I take a break from a game. I do like the idea of a Memento-style game where you have to leave notes for your in-game character before you save and quit, though. Make a wee polaroid of Peter Molyneux and write "don't believe his lies" on it.
</p>
<p>Kojima's other two concepts were: a game in which you start as a baby and gradually age over the course of playing into an old man, with an arc that includes worsening eyesight and so on (yes, yes, me too); and a game in which you're creating something that takes time to mature, such as wine or cheese, which sounds a lot like an idle game you can probably already play on Steam.
</p>
<p>Apparently <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a> almost had a time mechanic of its own. The protagonist was going to grow a beard that players would have to shave lest they become unkempt (YES, ME TOO), until Kojima decided that Norman Reedus was too big a star and he "didn't want to make him look uncool." You'll be able to play Reedus's statically stubbled face when On The Beach releases next month.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Many of them are using AI-generated artwork to advertise, and we strongly recommend against purchasing from these sources."</p><p>However, don't let the bad news get you down too much, as the thread continued with the reveal that the team is looking into making our dreams come true with licensed plushies.</p><p>"We are looking into making official Esquie plushies, and we want to bring them to you as soon as we can," a follow-up reply states. "In the meantime, please be patient — and don’t get scammed!"</p><p>Though the team didn't elaborate on timing for any potential plushies, it's great to see Sandfall Interactive working on continuing to bring fans what they want. Tomorrow comes!</p><p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has earned widespread acclaim from critics and players alike, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sales-numbers-keep-climbing-as-more-players-jump-into-the-rpg/1100-6531328/" data-ref-id="1100-6531328">sales topping 2 million just 12 days after release</a>.

Speaking on his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRQeB2a-RSs&amp;t=2191s" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">podcast</a> (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hideo-kojima-has-an-amazing-idea-for-a-forgetting-game-where-the-main-character-gradually-forgets-important-information-and-abilities-if-you-take-too-long-a-break-from-playing" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via IGN</a>), Kojima said he's intrigued by the idea of a "forgetting game" where the player would have to get through a game quickly to make the most of it.</p><p>The character would forget important information and lose certain abilities if people stopped playing for a long enough time. For example, if you didn't play this game every day, the character would forget things like "how to fire their gun or what their job is," and with enough time away, the player would forget how to even move.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Death Stranding 2 - On The Beach Trailer Full Breakdown</p>
      </div>
<p>Whether or not Kojima has explored this concept in any real way beyond discussing it is unknown, however. For now, it seems to be just that--a concept that he may or may not ever explore.</p><p>Another concept that Kojima floated in the podcast was a game where a game begins with a character being born, then becoming a child, and then an adult, ultimately running through when the character is 70 or 80. "When you are a teenager you'll be able to run faster but by the time you reach 60 you'll slow down a bit," Kojima said, adding that no one would buy this game.</p><p>Also during the podcast, Kojima said one of his original plans for Death Stranding 2 was for main character Sam's beard to "gradually grow out over time." Players would have to remember to shave, if they wanted. "If they didn't, Sam would end up looking unkempt," Kojima said.</p><p>But Kojima abandoned plans for this feature because the actor who plays Sam, Norman Reedus, is a famous person. "I didn't want him to look uncool," Kojima said.</p><p>For what it's worth, <a href="https://manforhimself.com/mens-hairstyles/norman-reedus-long-wavy-layered-hairstyle/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reedus has an amazing head of hair</a>, but it's true he's not known for donning a massive beard.</p><p>Death Stranding 2 launches on June 26 for PS5. For lots more, be sure to read <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/i-played-30-hours-of-death-stranding-2-and-i-cant-wait-to-do-it-all-again/1100-6531384/" data-ref-id="1100-6531384">GameSpot's hands-on preview of Death Stranding 2</a> that chronicles our 30 hours of time with the game.</p><p>In addition to Reedus, the cast for Death Stranding 2 includes Elle Fanning, Troy Baker, Lea Seydoux, George Miller, and Debra Wilson.</p><p>Beyond Death Stranding 2, Kojima is making at least two other games. These include OD and Physint. We don't know much about them, but OD is being made in partnership with Xbox and Phsyint with Sony.</p>

Now Remedy is using the setting of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Control</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> as a launching pad for a live service co-op shooter called </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2272540/FBC_Firebreak/">FBC Firebreak,</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> their first crack at an online co-op game about contending with The Oldest House following a new lockdown.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Producing an online live service game these days is </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/70-percent-of-devs-wary-of-live-service-games-being-sustainable">an increasingly risky business</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> that many developers </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/sony-cancels-two-live-service-projects-including-god-of-war-title">have struggled with</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. A key factor is that playing a live service game and keeping up with the content and other players is time-consuming—and only so many games can operate within that space at a given time. With that, the developers at Remedy Entertainment have built their take on an online live service game that not only allows players to tune the activities to match their pace, but also offer a way for players to take in as much as they want when they want.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In a chat with Game Developer, game director Mike Kayatta explained that Remedy is expanding the 'Remedy Connected Universe' further, while also building an online co-op game that's all about getting players right into the action and progressing at their own pace—all to build a sustainable live service that can attract players without plenty of time on their hands, and how they're ensuring players who don't have a lot of free time won't feel left behind.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/in-skin-deep-cartoon-logic-helps-players-understand-complicated-gameplay" target="_self" data-discover="true">In Skin Deep, 'cartoon logic' helps players understand complicated gameplay</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="An online game built around the player's schedule">An online game built around the player's schedule</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>FBC Firebreak</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, squads of 3 players are tasked with completing various missions within The Oldest House—the extradimensional office building from the original </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Control—</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">using jerry-rigged equipment and weapons to contain rogue Objects of Power or halt the invasion of the otherworldly monsters known as the Hiss. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>FBC Firebreak</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> stands out in the live service space by providing more surreal objectives, like a mission called "Paper Chase," where players hunt supernatural sticky notes.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to Kayatta, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>FBC Firebreak</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and its first-person, co-op-driven gameplay have been long brewing at Remedy. The concept itself stretches back to the original's conceit of contending with a setting that's actively working against players.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"One of my favorite pieces of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Control </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">concept art is of an FBC employee trying to play a game of pool, but the floor has shifted one end of the table just enough to ruin his game. This is pretty much how we think about the Oldest House in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>FBC: Firebreak</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">," said the game director. "It's a powerful and mysterious building, yes, but there's also a certain level of canonical 'grounded absurdity,' it produces that's perfect for our type of experience."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/is-blue-prince-s-success-due-to-social-play-" target="_self" data-discover="true">Is Blue Prince's success due to 'social play?'</a></p><p>Image via Remedy Entertainment.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"But even aside from those tonal opportunities, the House's shifting and unknowable nature, and the fact that it can connect to other dimensions, gives us all the room we'll ever need to do what's best for Firebreak without violating what makes </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Control</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Control</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">On the surface, the concept of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>FBC Firebreak</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> recalls similar efforts from other developers attempting a stand-alone multiplayer game based on a single-player experience, another example being the upcoming </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Elden Ring: Nightreign</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. What makes </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>FBC Firebreak</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> particularly interesting is that it's not only leveraging the weirdness of the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Control </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">setting, but it's also an online game that seeks to remedy (pun intended) a growing problem with live-service games. Simply put, there's never enough time to play all the games out there while meeting the investments they expect from players.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Kayatta stated that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>FBC Firebreak</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was all about removing the familiar pain points and sense of FOMO found in online games. To them, the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Control </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">spin-off aimed to be a game that players could play "on their terms, and not on the games."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/huge-donation-will-help-the-strong-preserve-the-history-of-defunct-saints-row-developer-volition" target="_self" data-discover="true">Huge donation will help The Strong preserve the history of defunct Saints Row developer Volition</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Amusingly, Kayatta said the team at Remedy took inspiration from their own busy schedules as game developers, studying the pace of how they kept up with modern online games.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="FBC Firebreak"><span>FBC Firebreak</span> lets players set their own progression pace</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The developers of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>FBC Firebreak</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> seek to solve the live-service dilemma with two solutions. First, all players can unlock key weapons and upgrades for their Crisis Kits (the game's take on class types), all from playing the game's set of missions and collecting resources. As players rank up their Requisitions—the game's take on the unlock system—they can spend points to unlock whatever they like, which includes new weapons, kit upgrades, and other add-ons to modify their loadouts.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The second solution, and most interesting to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>FBC Firebreak</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s structure, is the customizable objectives and encounter difficulties. Before each job, the team leader can tune the enemy variety and spawn rate to different intensity levels while also setting the number of objectives needed to clear the mission.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This means players can can have a mission with limited objectives but high enemy frequency, presenting a one-stage encounter with an onslaught of enemies. Conversely, they can customize the same mission to have a larger set of objectives, but with a lower frequency of enemies, making it more of an atmospheric, task-focused mission that culminates in a boss encounter.</span></p><p>Image via Remedy Entertainment.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"With a multiplayer game, it's important to consider how your game slots into people's lives," he said. "In co-op, especially, friend groups are stepping in with an unpredictable set of needs: How experienced is each group member? How much time do they have? Are they treating the game session like a phone call, where they just want something to do in the background while talking about something personal?"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"And you can't solve this for a player forever because the same person who wants to zone out one night for thirty minutes sometimes turns around and wants to hyper-coordinate for two hours the next night. This goes back to putting the game on the players' terms instead of ours; we wanted to give you those controls so that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Firebreak </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">can meet you where you are on any given day."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>FBC Firebreak</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s approach to challenge and tuning of the experience is flexible by design, which feels like an oddity among other games that push players towards timed battle passes or monthly events.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to Kayatta, building the game's structure and more flexible approach to progression was all about removing potential barriers that so many other live service games have, to provide an online game that players of whatever time investment can get something out of. Remedy axed other popular live service features like dense statistics (think damage, buff, and debuff percentages) because it made players care about "min-maxing and tracking metas."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"That in turn, can create barriers to people who don't want to be pressured into thinking about anything that's not directly in front of them," he said.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's an unconventional strategy to drive retention by asking players for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>less</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> engagement, but Kayatta said targeting those busy everyday players will be key to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>FBC Firebreak</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s success.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We just wanted to make a game that players without a lot of time could enjoy, which feels like it describes a lot of gamers these days," he concluded. "Some people lose their time to work or to their kids. Others are among the hundreds of incredible games destroying their backlogs. Some poor suckers, like me, lose time to both."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Too many games ask too much of their players, especially in the multiplayer space."</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Contributor</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Alessandro Fillari is a writer/editor who has covered the games, tech, and entertainment industries for more than 12 years.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/2025/05/14/sony-is-considering-price-hikes-to-cover-trumps-tariffs-but-it-might-not-affect-ps5<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Sony released its latest financial earnings report today, and it included a wealth of information about first-party game sales expectations for PlayStation, PS5 console sales, and information about how the company might deal with U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariffs. Overall, Sony expects its operating profit to rise .3% to $8.7 billion in the financial year ending in March 2025, an estimate that includes a roughly $684 million hit expected from Trump’s ongoing trade war with various countries, as reported by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/sony-annual-operating-profit-rose-16-beating-analysts-estimates-2025-05-14/"><em>Reuters</em></a>.</p><p>It’s important to note, though, that the numbers of this financial report were locked in before the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/china-us-switzerland-tariffs-negotiations-b3f5174d086e39b2522ab848ddad9372">U.S.' recent trade deal with China that happened this week</a>, which could change expectations depending on the effects of this deal. According to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/666584/sony-earnings-tariffs-ps5-price-us-manufacturing"><em>The Verge</em></a>, Sony chief financial officer Lin Tao told investors the company is considering “passing on” the cost of tariffs to consumers. Though the PS5 recently received <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/04/14/sony-raises-playstation-5-price-in-europe-australia-new-zealand-and-more">price hikes in Europe, Australia, and elsewhere</a>, Tao didn’t specifically mention the PS5 or anything about its cost when it comes to passing on the cost of tariffs.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PVBLJYjSAhg"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PVBLJYjSAhg" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>As for why the PS5 didn’t receive a price hike in the U.S. similar to that of other countries, Sony explained the company has stockpiled consoles in the U.S., adding that the console can be produced in the U.S., too, which would mitigate tariff costs associated with manufacturing the console outside of the country.</p><p>On the subject of PS5, Sony sold 2.8 million units from January through March, which marks a roughly 37% drop compared to this quarter in 2024. According to <em>The Verge</em>, it shipped 18.5 million PS5s from March 2024 to March this year, bringing lifetime total shipments to roughly 77 million. Total operating profit at PlayStation fell 12.5% during this quarter, but thanks to higher sales expectations due to upcoming first-party releases, Sony expects PlayStation profits to increase by 16% this fiscal year.</p><p>Those higher sales expectations are likely due to upcoming first-party releases like <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/04/12/bungie-shares-first-marathon-gameplay#:~:text=Marathon%20targets%20a%20launch%20on,be%20in%20on%20early%20playtests.">Bungie’s Marathon on September 23</a> and <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/04/23/ghost-of-yotei-release-date-set-for-october-collectors-edition-revealed">Sucker Punch Productions’ Ghost of Yōtei on October 2</a>.

		<p>STALKER: Legends of the Zone is getting a new Enhanced Edition, taking the 2024 console port and further enhancing it to take advantage of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a> and modern PC hardware. STALKER: Legends of the Zone – Enhanced Edition is launching next week on 20th May.</p>
<p><iframe title="S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Legends of the Zone — Enhanced Edition Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AVWkOx4Cj6g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>STALKER: Legends of the Zone – Enhanced Edition gives the original trilogy of STALKER games – Shadow of Chornobyl (2007), Clear Sky(2008), and Call of Prypiat (2009) – a visual spruce with upgraded visuals, optimisations specific to newer consoles and mod support. The 2024 Legends of the Zone port previously ran in backward compatibility on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S consoles, so this is GSC Game Worlds spreading their wings with more specific support.&nbsp;Additionally, where Legends of the Zone wasn’t released on PC last year, it is now getting a PC version with these same enhancements.</p>
<p>These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enhanced lighting with godrays, screen space reflections, and global illumination for a more immersive atmosphere.</li>
<li>Upscaled textures and detailed 3D models for NPCs, weapons, and environments.</li>
<li>Advanced shaders for water and wetness effects, paired with upgraded skyboxes for a more dynamic world.</li>
<li>4K pre-rendered cinematics for dramatic storytelling and improved weapon FOV for better combat visibility.</li>
</ul>
<p>On consoles, you now have the following graphics modes.</p>

<p>Xbox Series X, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 5 Pro:</p>
<ul>
<li>Quality (native 4K/30 FPS)</li>
<li>Balanced (upscaled 4K/40 FPS)</li>
<li>Performance (upscaled 4K/60 FPS)</li>
<li>Ultra Performance (upscaled 2K/120 FPS)</li>
</ul>
<p>Xbox Series S:</p>
<ul>
<li>Quality (native 2K/30 FPS)</li>
<li>Balanced (upscaled 2K/40 FPS)</li>
<li>Performance (1080p/60 FPS)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>(“2K” seemingly refers to 1440p)</em></p>
<p>There’s also keyboard and mouse support, and Mod.io integration to allow for mod sharing across both PC and consoles.</p>
<p>On PC, the trilogy is now Steam Deck optimised, there’s Steam Workshop integration, cloud saves and gamepad support.</p>
<p>For all existing owners, you’ll get a free upgrade. From the PS4 and Xbox One Legends of the Zone release last year, the Enhanced Edition on the respective current gen consoles will be free. Additionally, owners of the original STALKER games on PC get the Enhance Editions for free, and the same works in reverse as well – handy in case there’s any mod incompatibility that is introduced here.</p>
<p>STALKER: Legends of the Zone was a great way for console gamers to experience the original late noughties trilogy for the first time, ahead of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/21/stalker-2-review-heart-of-chornobyl/">STALKER 2’s</a> release at the end of 2024. This Enhanced Edition looks to go further as a remaster, but <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/09/stalker-legends-of-the-zone-trilogy-review-ps5-xbox-ps4/">we originally said of the console release</a>, “On the sliding scale of remasters, the Legends of the Zone Trilogy is more of a port rather than an attempt to give these games a total makeover. […] As someone who struggled to get them running on my own PC back around the time they launched, being able to finally venture into the Zone on console has been immensely satisfying, even if these ageing first person shooters don’t cater for modern gamer sensibilities.”</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/it-looks-like-a-riders-republic-movie-is-happening-for-some-reason.1189071/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/riders-republic-movie-report<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>According to a new report, a movie based on Ubisoft's extreme sports racer&nbsp;<em>Riders Republic&nbsp;</em>is in the works, and I'd love to meet literally anyone who asked for such a project.</p>

<p>Per a Deadline <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/05/riders-republic-adil-bilall-gaumont-ubisoft-1236397176/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">article</a>, the&nbsp;<em>Riders Republic&nbsp;</em>movie will be a co-production between French movie house Gaumont and Ubisoft, and it'll be directed by&nbsp;<em>Bad Boys: Ride or Die&nbsp;</em>helmsmen Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah, colloquially known as Adil &amp; Bilall.</p>

<p>Writing duties on the project will be handled by&nbsp;<em>The World Is Yours&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Stillwater&nbsp;</em>scribe&nbsp;Noé Debré, although it's not clear whether there will be any other writers on the movie or whether Debré will be the sole writer.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/riders-republic-movie-racing.jpg?itok=bcAQTRwJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/riders-republic-movie-racing.jpg?itok=nBQyJQs3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Was a&nbsp;<em>Riders Republic&nbsp;</em>movie in the cards for 2025 as far as you're concerned?</figcaption></figure><p>This won't be Ubisoft's first foray into multimedia; the company is currently gearing up for the release of Netflix animated series&nbsp;<em>Splinter Cell: Deathwatch</em>, which is set to launch sometime later this year. Lest we forget, there's also 2023's Netflix series&nbsp;<em>Captain Laserhawk: A Blood Dragon Remix</em>.</p>

<p>Indeed,&nbsp;<em>Riders Republic&nbsp;</em>is just one of a number of video game movies in the works right now. Others include <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-movie-sydney-sweeney" rel="nofollow">a movie</a> based on EA's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-sales-4m-battlefield-skate" rel="nofollow">hit multiplayer game</a>&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction</em>, as well as a movie based on <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mortuary-assistant-movie-announced" rel="nofollow">horror work sim&nbsp;<em>The Mortuary Assistant</em></a>&nbsp;and an adaptation of Sega's racer&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/outrun-movie-report" rel="nofollow"><em>OutRun</em></a>.</p>

<p>Video games are also proving ripe territory for series adaptations. Amazon's wildly successful&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>series, for instance, is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fallout-season-3-confirmed-season-2-december" rel="nofollow">set to air its second season later this year</a>, and a third season has already been greenlit. HBO's&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us</em>, meanwhile, is partway through its second season at time of writing.</p>

<p>These shows join animated fare like Netflix's&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netflix-devil-may-cry-renewed-second-season" rel="nofollow">Devil May Cry</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Castlevania&nbsp;</em>shows, as well as Prime Video's&nbsp;<em>Secret Level</em>, an anthology series with shorts based on properties like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/warhammer-40000-secret-level-trailer-brings-glory-to-imperium" rel="nofollow"><em>Warhammer 40k</em></a>,&nbsp;<em>Armored Core</em>, and, er,&nbsp;<em>Concord</em>.</p>




<p>Naturally, the&nbsp;<em>Riders Republic&nbsp;</em>movie doesn't have a release date yet, and we don't know who's attached to star in it either. It's likely we'll learn more about the project in the coming months, but don't expect it to arrive in cinemas for a while.</p>

These include two of the most critically acclaimed titles of the year so far, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/boundary-pushing-co-op-adventure-split-fiction-nears-4-million-sales"><u>Split Fiction</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-hits-2-million-copies-sold-after-12-days-on-sale"><u>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</u></a>, which have sold over 4 million and 2 million copies respectively so far this year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a pattern that both Mafia: The Old Country – <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mafia-the-old-country-tells-a-story-that-doesnt-require-a-massive-time-commitment-publisher-sets-price-at-50-and-announces-release-date"><u>recently revealed to cost $50 when it launches on August 8</u></a> – and FBC: Firebreak will be hoping to continue.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">FBC: Firebreak - Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Launching on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fbc-firebreak-remedys-co-op-fps-set-in-the-world-of-control-has-a-release-date"><u>June 17, 2025 and costing $39.99/£32.99</u></a> (as well as on both Game Pass and PS Plus), Firebreak is looking towards this newly emerging mid-tier space between wildly budgeted AAA games and indies to find its success. It’s a notion that Kayatta explained to IGN:</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>“</strong>I read somebody describe this recently in a very eloquent way as game developers building cathedrals competing to build these more and more complex, beautiful, expensive things," Kayatta said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And it's gotten to the point where you've got a lot of games that cost half a billion dollars to make. And then, of course, when you get into marketing and promotion, I mean, the amount of money involved is staggering. And that can produce some incredible, incredible experiences that I am very thankful exist, but only some of those can exist, and everyone can't compete in that space."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kayatta continued: “And then on the other side, you've got all of these incredible indie developers. Everything from Inscryption to Stardew Valley to Blue Prince feel like they come out of nowhere and light the world on fire. But then I do think we're seeing that emergence of that middle ground now of, it's messy to call it AA, right? But it is something kind of new. It’s not quite God of War Ragnarok or GTA 6, but it's also something more than a Slay the Spire. And that's not a comment on either end of those spectrums. Those are fantastic games, but it does feel like there is something kind of emerging in the middle, at least to me.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"If it's the future, I'm not sure. I wouldn't say in the sense that it implies that that's where all games need to go, but this idea of a responsible team size, a responsible budget, a responsible amount of time to develop a game, just get it out there, make something that respects player time and don't try to overcharge and don't try to be greedy with time. I do think there's a space for it, and we're trying to touch on it with this game.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That respect for players’ time and money goes hand-in-hand with Remedy’s all-in-one approach to Firebreak. This is a game you pay once for and get everything for that $40. The idea of a free-to-play model was something never even entertained by the team.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“A lot of that has to do with reducing FOMO (the fear of missing out), which I think has kind of infected a lot of modern games," stated Kayatta.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And by the way, that's not a blanket statement. I think a lot of games are able to use FOMO to be exciting. So I'm just saying that for this game in particular, it didn't work for us, but it's not just about monetization, I think it's about the value that the game has. So one example would be, I don't know if you've ever played Path of Exile, for example, and you open up that skill tree and you see 10,000 things that you're going to be able to do.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And for a type of person, they're really excited, like look at that depth and look how many hours I've got, all these other things. And then for another type of person, they're looking at that saying, 'I will never extract the value from this game even if I want to.' And even if those devs, and this is no longer a comment about Path of Exile, which I love by the way, even if you say, 'Well, but you don't have to interact with those systems, you can still have fun.' That may be true, but the minute you see those systems exist, you're instantly put into that frame of reference where you say, 'There is something that I'm not getting from this, and that just feels bad.'</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"So for us, we wanted to make sure that the game, both from the way we monetize it, we don't do daily check-ins, timed battle passes, all that other stuff that dictates your time. There's that side.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“But the other side, too, is that we don't want to present a game that feels so complex, like, oh, if you don't come back and do six more sessions, you're not going to be able to do this, and progression's important. You feel like you're accomplishing something over time. So we definitely have that, and we definitely wanted to have a strong meta game, but we also just wanted to keep things feeling like, you know what? I get as much out of this as I want at any given time, and at any given moment, I have the complete experience.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Firebreak will be hoping to capture both fans of Remedy’s uniquely weird work and fans of co-op shooters alike when it launches on June 17.

Today, those aspirations went up in digital smoke, as Square Enix has announced that Missing Link will no longer be released.</p><p dir="ltr">Official Kingdom Hearts Missing Link social media accounts announced the cancellation of the game, which was first announced in 2022 as a "GPS-based action RPG for iOS and Android." The official statement also offered "heartfelt apologies to everyone who has been looking forward to the release."</p><p dir="ltr">"Although we worked hard on developing and adjusting the game in the hope that it would be enjoyed by lots of players," the statement reads, "we determined that it would be difficult for us to offer a service that players would find satisfactory over a long period of time, leading us to the decision to cancel development."</p><p dir="ltr">The announcement also confirmed that "the Kingdom Hearts series will continue," while also mentioning that "the team is hard at work on Kingdom Hearts 4." No additional details were provided for either the cancellation or KH4.</p><p dir="ltr">Kingdom Hearts 4 was first announced in 2022, at the same anniversary event where Missing Link was unveiled.

			<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is one of the most successful games to launch this year. Despite being available on Game Pass from day one, the JRPG developed by Sandfall Interactive has already <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-director-bored-ubisoft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">managed to sell more than two million units</a>. Considering that its budget was certainly not as large as a regular triple-A game, its success is already guaranteed.</p>
<p>It may even get bigger by adding a new platform like the upcoming Nintendo Switch 2 console. In a video interview <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M14dRaYeAHM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with French YouTuber mistermtv</a>, as translated by MP1st, Sandfall Interactive CEO and Game Director Guillaume Broche said that the great sales have changed the perspective, and that the idea was 'interesting'.</p>
<p><em>Well, at this point, considering the success of the game, it kind of changes everything. So clearly, it’s too early to say, but we’re kind of in a situation where… let’s say there are a lot of opportunities showing up — way too many at once — and we’re figuring out what we’ll go for and what we won’t. But yeah, it’s definitely something that could be interesting.</em></p>
<p>A turn-based JRPG like Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 could indeed resonate very well with the Nintendo audience, which would get access to a fantastic game, as outlined <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in Wccftech's review</a>.</p>
<p><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 may not be the most innovative role-playing game, but its core elements come together beautifully, delivering an emotional journey that is as moving as it is engaging and fun. It may be Sandfall Interactive’s first expedition, but the French developer has shown it has the passion and the chops to craft a memorable experience worthy of a Game of the Year nomination, if not the award itself.</em></p>
<p>The game is powered by Unreal Engine 5, but it's not one of the heaviest titles made with Epic's technology. The Nintendo Switch 2 hardware could likely run it. Whether that means Sandfall Interactive and publisher Kepler Interactive actually make the port remains to be seen.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/stalker-legends-of-the-zone-trilogy-enhanced-edition-comes-to-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-and-pc-next-week/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>GSC Game World has announced STALKER: Legends of the Zone Trilogy - Enhanced Edition, an updated version of the first three STALKER games it previously released on <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-legends-of-the-zone-trilogy-leaked-will-bring-the-series-to-consoles-in-june/">PS4 and Xbox One,</a> now coming to PS5, Xbox Series X/S and PC next week on <strong>May 20, 2025.</strong></p>
<p>The new current-gen version of the remasters includes better lighting with godrays, screen space reflections, upscaled textures and environments, advanced shaders, and cutscenes that have been pre-rendered in 4K to add to the storytelling. For console players, though, the catch to all that is you'll see as much of these upgrades as the graphics mode you pick will allow.</p>
<p>Playing on PS5, PS5 Pro, or Xbox Series X consoles, players can select between four graphics modes. Quality, Balanced, Performance and Ultra Performance. The first three are all set at a 4K resolution, with the frame rate caps being the only variable. Quality runs at 4K/30fps, Balanced runs at 4K/40fps, and Performance mode runs at 4K/60fps. Ultra Performance sets the resolution down to 2K to reach 120fps.</p>
<p><iframe title="S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Legends of the Zone — Enhanced Edition Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AVWkOx4Cj6g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Xbox Series S players have Quality, Balanced, and Performance modes to choose from, though none of those modes have any of the three STALKER games running at 4K. Quality mode on Series S runs at 2K/30fps, Balanced runs at 2K/40fps, and Performance mode runs at 1080p/60fps.</p>
<p>Obviously, PC players don't have to deal with all of that and can more manually adjust graphical settings based on the hardware they have available to them, but there are still a few improvements PC players can look forward to. Such as the games now being optimized for Steam Deck, and support for cloud saves.</p>
<p>Current-gen console players will also be able to plug in a keyboard and mouse, if they want, with KBM support coming in this new version. GSC Game World has also confirmed that the PS5 and Xbox Series versions will have Mod.io support, so they can enjoy some of the modding fun that is usually only accessible on PC.</p>
<p>The best part about this new Enhanced Edition is that anyone who has already purchased any of the remasters in the STALKER: Legends of the Zone Trilogy will get the corresponding enhanced edition for <strong>free</strong>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-legends-of-zone-enhanced-edition-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>GSC Game World has revealed the&nbsp;<em>Stalker: Legends of the Zone - Enhanced Edition&nbsp;</em>release date, with the updated versions of all three classic shooters coming to PC and current-gen consoles next week.</p>

<p>Back in December, it was revealed that the long-awaited next-gen update for&nbsp;<em>Stalker: Legends of the Zone&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-roadmap-legends-of-zone-next-gen-2025" rel="nofollow">would arrive in 2025</a>, and now we have a concrete release date: May 20th.</p>

<p>All three games will receive significant enhancements across PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S, including visual and performance improvements, gameplay tweaks to bring the games "more in line with current game practices", and more.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/stalker-legends-of-the-zone-enhanced-edition-release-date-gameplay.jpg?itok=iJEWmIrK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/stalker-legends-of-the-zone-enhanced-edition-release-date-gameplay.jpg?itok=dESfbHaG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Stalker: Legends of the Zone - Enhanced Edition&nbsp;</em>comes to PC and current-gen consoles next week.</figcaption></figure><p>In addition, GSC Game World has also <a href="https://www.stalker-game.com/en/faq" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">revealed the PC specs</a> you're going to need if you want to run the&nbsp;<em>Legends of the Zone - Enhanced Edition&nbsp;</em>trilogy, and they're significantly beefed up compared to the original games, as you'd expect.</p>

<p>Running the games at 1440p and 60fps will require a GTX 1070 Ti and a Core i5-6600K or equivalent, while 4K at 60fps will need an RTX 2080 Ti and Core i7-6700K or AMD's version of the same.</p>

<p>On the plus side, if you already happen to own the original three&nbsp;<em>Stalker&nbsp;</em>games on PC, you will receive the&nbsp;<em>Legends of the Zone&nbsp;</em>enhancements as a free upgrade. It's not just visual updates, either; you're also getting extras like controller support and Steam achievements.</p>

<p>However, it's worth bearing in mind that the new versions of the game won't support mods created for the old versions. Still, these enhanced versions won't be replacing the originals in storefronts, and there's every chance modders will create new mods for the enhanced editions.</p>




<p><em>Stalker: Legends of the Zone - Enhanced Edition&nbsp;</em>launches across PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S on May 20th. You can buy all three games separately or together as a bundle, and console players also won't have to pay for the upgrade.</p>

            <p>Surreal first-person medical sim <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pathologic-3">Pathologic 3</a> will be different from its plague-ridden predecessor in a lot of ways. In <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pathologic-2">Pathologic 2</a> you played a roaming surgeon rooting around in bins for sustenance, and this time you play as the Bachelor, a well-fed doctor who diagnoses patients by inspecting their bodies and investigating their homes for signs of disease. But one of the biggest changes regards the open world. You won't freely explore the remote steppe town this time, but instead dander through isolated pockets, with lots of loading screens, map plotting, and fast travel. That's made a few fans grumpy, but developers Ice-Pick Lodge are sticking to their plans, as they've stated in a development update.</p>

<p>You'll know how town traversal works if you've played the demo for this sequel, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3389330/Pathologic_3_Quarantine/?curator_clanid=7802587">Pathologic 3: Quarantine</a> (or if you've read <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pathologic-3-quarantine-drops-the-hunger-meters-so-you-can-play-doctor">our hands-on impressions</a> of the demo). Basically, you walk through particular archways and get confronted with a map screen. From here, you select a route and watch as your little dot makes its way through the city. In certain dangerous neighbourhoods, you're kicked out of this map screen and forced to make your way through the streets in the usual first-person mode once more, a handy revolver at your side to keep desperate muggers at bay. Once you get clear of that zone and find the exit arch, it's back to the map screen. </p>
<p>This is obviously very different from the freestyle wandering of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pathologic">Pathologic</a> and its recent spiritual successor Pathologic 2. Enough players of the demo left negative or skeptical feedback about it to prompt Ice-Pick Lodge to respond with a post that explains their reasoning.  </p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rock Paper Shotgun / HypeTrain Digital</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>"The main question after Quarantine: what’s up with the city?" said the devs in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3389330/view/521964845255362377">the post on Steam</a>. "Why couldn’t you move through it without loading screens? And how will that change in the full game? Why change a game where everything 'worked'?</p>
<p>"We know some players would’ve liked that just fine. But for us that wouldn’t be enough. Not creatively (there’s already a game about digging through Gorkhon’s trash cans), and not commercially: sequels to indie games statistically sell much worse than the originals, and we’re making a sequel to a sequel. Just repeating ourselves? That’s a dead end.</p>
<p>"But trying new things is in the studio’s DNA. And that led us to the idea of a new kind of game — about a person lost in time, with narrative structure and space-time torn to shreds. That presentation will stay. It’s a core part of the concept — it can’t be changed. (And technically, it can’t be reversed at this point.)"</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rock Paper Shotgun / HypeTrain Digital</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Essentially, they didn't want to simply make the same game again, and it'd be too much work to change direction now from a technical perspective. The studio also asked players of the prologue to remember it was just a demo, and that this railroaded tutorialised journey was only a "parade alley". The street-stalking segments will have more to them, they promise. For example, the player will see the effects of decrees and laws they make during the quarantine at street level. Ordering everyone to wash regularly will mean you really see some NPCs washing their hands as you pass by.  </p>
<p>Although the studio isn't budging on the splintering of that open world, they are looking into other changes. They admit that the survival meter of the hero's mental state is not well-balanced or well-explained (it's a meter that runs from apathy to mania and must be balanced by slurping drugs). And when it comes to some choppy performance issues, they're "planning for things to get much better". </p>
<p>The demo will be taken down at some point shortly before release, they say, with the team now moving all their attention to the full game. It's due to come out some time this year. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The game spent over a year in closed beta testing periods, but the team determined it would be difficult to keep it “satisfactory” for players over a long period of time.</p><p>Alongside this announcement, Square Enix assures series fans it is “hard at work on Kingdom Hearts IV.” As the title “Missing-Link” implies, this mobile spin-off was meant to provide story content to connect the events of Kingdom Hearts III to the upcoming title. It’s unclear at this point if the cancellation of Missing-Link will affect the development of <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/product/kingdom-hearts-iv">Kingdom Hearts IV</a>.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gxOGWd6LoyY"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gxOGWd6LoyY" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Here's Square Enix's statement about the game, in full:&nbsp;</p><p>“We have made the decision to cancel the development of Kingdom Hearts Missing-Link.</p><p>We wish to convey our heartfelt apologies to everyone who has been looking forward to the start of service. Although we worked hard on developing and adjusting the game in the hope that it would be enjoyed by lots of players, we determined that it would be difficult for us to offer a service that players would find satisfactory over a long period of time, leading us to the decision to cancel development.</p><p>We would like to take this opportunity to express our thanks to everyone who gave us their support and assistance with the multiple closed beta tests. We are truly sorry to have to make this announcement. The Kingdom Hearts series will continue. We are hard at work on Kingdom Hearts IV, and hope you’ll continue to support the series as you keep an eye out for further updates."</p><p>Missing-Link was <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/04/10/new-kingdom-hearts-mobile-game-missing-link-announced-closed-beta-test-this-year">announced in 2022</a> and originally <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2023/10/30/kingdom-hearts-missing-link-teaser-trailer-confirms-2024-mobile-release">set to launch on mobile devices in 2024</a>.</p><p>In the meantime, read <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/exclusive-interview/2022/06/14/nomura-reveals-more-on-kingdom-hearts-iv-and-the-series-future-with"><em>Game Informer’s </em>exclusive interview with Tetsuya Nomura</a> about Kingdom Hearts IV, and then check out <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/04/10/hikaru-utada-has-released-a-new-recording-of-kingdom-hearts-best-song">Hikaru Utada’s new recording of the best song in the Kingdom Hearts series</a>.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em>Did you get to play Kingdom Hearts Missing-Link?
