			<p>Microsoft's <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Investor/earnings/FY-2025-Q4/press-release-webcast" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Q4 fiscal year 2025 results</a> show that Xbox content and services revenue grew 13% this quarter (12% when considering constant currency). Hardware revenue continues to decline (-22%), but overall gaming revenue is still up 10%. According to Microsoft CFO Amy Hood, the result was driven by 'better-than-expected performance from first-party content and Xbox Game Pass.'</p>



<p>During the subsequent investor call, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella shared some new milestones, such as the fact that the Game Pass subscription service has nearly reached $5 billion of yearly revenue for the first time since its launch in 2017. Nadella also referenced the fact that Microsoft was the top publisher not only on Xbox but <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-dominates-playstation-q2-top-10-chart-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">also on PlayStation</a> this quarter. Lastly, the chief executive officer noted that Xbox has nearly 40 games in development.</p>



<p><em>When it comes to gaming, we have 500 million monthly active users across platforms and devices. And we are now the top publisher on both Xbox and PlayStation this quarter, with the successful launches of Forza Horizon 5 and Oblivion Remastered. The Call of Duty franchise has never been stronger: 50 million people have played Black Ops 6. Total hours surpassed 2 billion.</em></p>



<p><em>Minecraft saw record monthly active usage and revenue this quarter, thanks in large part to the success of the Minecraft movie. And we have nearly 40 games in development, so much, much more to come. We surpassed over 500 million hours of game play streamed via the cloud this year. And Game Pass annual revenue was nearly $5 billion for the first time.</em></p>



<p>Microsoft CFO Amy Hood noted, however, that Xbox revenue will likely decline in the first quarter of the next fiscal year due to a tough comparison with the previous year: </p>



<p><em>In Gaming, we expect revenue to decline in the mid to high single digits. Against a strong prior year comparable, we expect Xbox content and services revenue to decline in the mid single digits.</em></p>



<p>Xbox Game Studios is about to launch <a href="https://wccftech.com/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-enhanced-launches-on-playstation-5-xbox-series-xs-pc-on-august-12/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Senua's Saga: Hellblade II Enhanced</a> on PlayStation 5, no doubt hoping to repeat the excellent results of ports like Forza Horizon 5 and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. The remaining release schedule for the publisher's calendar year includes Gears of War: Reloaded on August 26, Double Fine's new game Keeper on October 17, Team Ninja's Ninja Gaiden 4 on October 21, and Obsidian's The Outer Worlds 2 on October 29. There's also Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, although that one is technically published by Activision, which is nevertheless owned by Xbox.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/dead-take-review-true-horror-was-institutionalized-power-we-met-along-way</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dead-take-review-the-true-horror-was-the-institutionalized-power-we-met-along-the-way.1257786/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I was drawn to <em>Dead Take</em> on its teased reveal with my love for psychological horror, love of movies, and a cast of some of my favorite actors from various live action, video game, and actual play content. Getting to sit down and play <em>Dead Take,</em> I was taken on a rollercoaster of emotions, tense relationships, and a veritable 'who's who' of warped power dynamics and relationships.</p>

<p>In <em>Dead Take,</em> the player takes on the role of Vinny Monroe, an actor in Hollywood trying to score his dream role but coming up short due to a number of reasons. After not hearing from your friend, Chase Lowry, who attended a party in the home of renowned producer Duke Cain, you go to investigate.</p>

<p>Arriving at the mansion in the Hollywood Hills, you find the lights on, but no one is home. Letting yourself in, you begin a strange exploration of the house where you'll get to solve puzzles, witness audition footage and screen tests for Cain's latest film, The Last Voyage, and learn what it takes to make it in this warped version of the industry.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dead-take-review-ben-starr.jpg?itok=ei65ggXl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dead-take-review-ben-starr.jpg?itok=NysIIalg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Be prepared to see a LOT of Ben Starr</figcaption></figure><p>If you're interested in knowing a bit more about the kind of horror experience you're in store for, expect eerie rooms of the house and a few jump scares crossing thresholds or when completing puzzles.</p>

<h2>Exploring The Mansion</h2>

<p>This mansion covers three floors of locked rooms and progressive exploration. From the get-go, though, you can explore most of the rooms, interact with some strange objects and letters, and even pick up a few progressive puzzle pieces.</p>

<p>You'll walk and run, but the game doesn't let you do more than that as you're forced to sit with your own thoughts amid tense audio and the sound of your own echoing footsteps. The game will do a lot more to set you on an unsettling edge, teasing you that something might be about to happen, far more than it ever actually scares as you're moving through this space.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dead-take-review-piano-puzzle.jpg?itok=chDJrTtV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dead-take-review-piano-puzzle.jpg?itok=I0tO0PvU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>It's in progressing through the puzzles of the game that you'll uncover more puzzle pieces, leading to more parts of the mansion, and to fill in the grander story. It felt a lot like playing a classic Resident Evil title, but more of the mansion exploration and less active antagonists.</p>

<h2>Some Puzzles Were Highlights, Others Were Too Simple</h2>

<p>Puzzles were one of the two core aspects of <em>Dead Take</em> to engage in. From the moment you start the game, it's about figuring out how to get in. You can do this by programming a Fob with a certain frequency based on a sticky note in a drawer and the numbers on the front plate of the house.</p>

<p>There were some really entertaining puzzles, like getting to walk by a grand piano with all kinds of cultish and demonic symbols on it or needing to develop film correctly by bathing it in different chemical solutions.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dead-take-review-set-puzzle.jpg?itok=VNla-T1O 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dead-take-review-set-puzzle.jpg?itok=znV_RgxK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>My favorite puzzle of the game involved stepping into a set with mannequins posed around a table. I had to read pages of the script, including notes from the director, in order to determine the 'correct' setting for the scene. Make sure all of the actors were in place, they had the correct props, and that the camera was angled correctly.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there were also a few puzzles that really let me down. I was excited to make it to the pool house and begin picking up different weapons with snake motifs: a Snake Sword, Dagger, Sickle, etc. As I was hypothesizing where they could go or what they could do, I happened across a plaque with four places to put them and a very clear description of what cardinal direction each should point in.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dead-take-review-weapons-puzzle.jpg?itok=l6xhZbId 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dead-take-review-weapons-puzzle.jpg?itok=n3eOhs2W 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The answer is as simple as you'd expect...</figcaption></figure><p>It was less of a puzzle and more like English comprehension.</p>

<p>The other major aspect in gameplay, and one that lends to the deeper part of the story, is in collecting footage to watch, and Splaicing that footage. Splaicing is an 'AI' driven editing tool that lets you combine two pieces of footage together automagically.</p>

<p>For the narrative, this meant you could see one scene where Alanah Pearce's Victoria Cross is running her sides of a pivotal scene in the movie, and a second scene of Ben Starr's Chase Lowry doing the same, and combine them to get the full scene's context.</p>

<p>You'll watch footage and combine it for new footage to advance the greater plot of the game.</p>

<p>You can also get a variety of behind-the-scenes footage that honestly doesn't make sense based on the clips you provide the machine, but is interesting nonetheless. It might be Travis Willingham's Harry Dufresne, who plays the captain and love rival in The Last Voyage, candidly telling Vinny that just because he feels a role should be his… doesn't mean it should, and he shouldn't be so quick to use his connections, as it might backfire.</p>

<h2>Surface Story Didn't Do Much, But The Deeper Narrative Was Fascinating</h2>

<p>The surface story didn't do too much for me, it was never entirely clear why Vinny was in that mansion, what had happened to the party members, or why there were terrifying mannequins that were lurking around. Honestly, by the end of it, I wasn't exactly sure what kind of adventure Vinny had been on.</p>

<p>The aspect of the game that fascinated me was the deeper story. About the kind of man Duke Cain was — Producer, Husband, and Father — and how each of the actors in the story used their own power and were abused by each other's power.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In talking with<a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="81fc54e7-5f6a-4933-8e34-9698b21581bd" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/inside-dead-take-abubakar-salim-explores-fear-fame-and-actors-experience" rel="nofollow"> Narrative Director Abubakar Salim </a>he told me that Video Games were the place to tell this story because it allowed him to present a situation and have others interpret</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Seeing these audition tapes, learning about the Cain family history through notes around the house, and learning about how everyone was pining to be part of The Last Voyage and were cutthroat to earn their place was an interesting reflection on aspects of the movie industry, but also many creative careers.</p>

<p>Playing as Vinny I could feel his pain for not making the cut and losing the role of the lead man to Chase, but we also got to see how Chase reacted when screening Vinny's phone call, tossing him to the side as an actor without a job.</p>

<p>It shows that even when the entire system is working against you, and is trying to churn you up and spit you out, that if it's something you love, and you feel you were born to do you'll continue to lay everything on the line and even cross some lines to get to where you feel you 'deserve' to be.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dead-take-review-uv-light.jpg?itok=i5KT1r0k 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dead-take-review-uv-light.jpg?itok=dYZAo-IC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The more I thought about what Vinny was putting himself through, the more I understood and related. Obviously not to the level of horror, but I can understand taking something you love doing and wanting to push to make a larger name for yourself in that field. For me, my ambition and drive have me sitting here and writing this review, but even in the game review and journalism space, I've heard all kinds of stories of abuse of power from those running the companies, to individual writers seeking to propel themselves to spite all others.</p>

<p>How this journey can relate to your own personal story of development, or in what you've seen of major industries, or closer to home,e can really enhance how deep this story is.</p>

<h2><em>Dead Take</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p><em>Dead Take </em>was a game that I went into expecting a few good puzzles and a cheap jumpscare or two. In that sense, the game perfectly delivered on my expectations. It did bring something extremely unique to the table in the live action sequences, delivering different sides of a story or a whole picture, letting the player mull over what they've seen and then rediscover it in an altered framework.</p>

<p>The surface story of Vinny in the mansion and his adventures throughout were entertaining gameplay wise, but didn't make as much sense from a narrative perspective. The grander story that it revealed of each of the main characters was one that was truly fascinating to me and will sit with me for a long while to come.</p>

<hr><p><strong><em>Dead Take </em></strong><em>was reviewed on PC via Steam with a copy provided by the Developer over the course of 5 hours of gameplay - all screenshots were taken during the process of review.</em></p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> has been out for a few weeks now, and unsurprisingly, players are still discovering all sorts of things about it.</p>

<p>Here's the post in full, along with a bit of extra detail about how exactly it works:</p>

<p>We've had a closer look at this ourselves and have taken multiple before-and-after shots in one of the layers with better lighting:</p><div><figure data-videoid="fMx2XNyAq4E" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5d98e4owisjx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMx2XNyAq4E" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

Combat in Wuchang: Fallen Feathers is different from a lot of other Soulslikes, as your main resource Skyborn Might revolves around getting “perfect dodges” called Shimmers (think Sekiro but with hitting B instead of LB). You can then spend Skyborn Might to empower your weapon skills, or instantly execute a charged heavy attack. This is particularly useful because you can use charged heavy attacks to stagger foes, opening them up to a powerful Obliterate attack.

One-Handed Swords have long animations and low damage but provide Spell Damage, enabling a dedicated caster archetype. The Dual Blades reward all out aggression as you clash through enemy attacks and heal yourself. Axes hit hard, staggering foes and stopping them in their tracks, but they also tend to be slower and have higher stamina costs. </p><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://maxroll.gg/wuchang-fallen-feathers/builds/dual-blades-blademaster-build-in-wuchang-fallen-feathers" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Dual Blades Blademaster</u></a></li><li><a href="https://maxroll.gg/wuchang-fallen-feathers/builds/one-handed-swords-spell-build-in-wuchang-fallen-feathers" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Spellcaster Build</u></a></li><li><a href="https://maxroll.gg/wuchang-fallen-feathers/builds/axe-rampage-build-in-wuchang-fallen-feathers" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Axe Rampage Build</u></a></li></ul><h2 data-cy="title2">Database</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/31/database-wffimg1-1024x767-1753926837961.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Use Maxroll’s <a href="https://maxroll.gg/wuchang-fallen-feathers/database" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers database</u></a> to learn more about all of the items in the game.

Players place character and item cards from their deck on the game mat and square off against Jafar's 50-card deck. Your objective is to make it through the palace and secure the Reforged Crown. It's not a straightforward journey, however, as Supreme Sorcerer Jafar has plenty of tricks up his sleeve to impede your progress.</p><p>Palace Heist is a compelling variant on Lorcana that is especially great for those who don't always have someone around to battle. It's also a good tool to introduce new players to the game, since it's fully playable as a single-player experience as well as cooperatively with one other player. You can also use the cards in the standard Lorcana TCG.</p><p>Illumineer’s Quest: Palace Heist includes the following:</p><ul><li>1 Jafar Scenario Deck (50 cards)</li><li>2 Player Decks (60 cards each)</li><li>1 Oversized Jafar Card</li><li>4 Battleground Cards</li><li>1 Reforged Crown Tile</li><li>1 Palace Heist Playmat</li><li>1 Jafar Draw Token</li><li>5 Lore Tracker Tokens</li><li>29 Damage Counters</li><li>1 Victory Card</li><li>Palace Heist Rules Sheet</li></ul><p>As mentioned, this is the second Illumineer's Quest game. The first, Deep Trouble, released as part of the Ursula's Return set in May 2024. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ravensburger-Disney-Lorcana-TCG-Illumineers/dp/B0CGXJ8244?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Illumineer's Quest: Deep Trouble</a> still regularly sells for full price, though you can save a few bucks at Amazon. It's worth clarifying that Palace Heist and Deep Trouble are different games with unique scenarios and entirely separate decks of cards, so both games are worth checking out.</p></div>                      </div><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-lorcana-tcg-reign-of-jafar-palace-heist-cooperative-game-is-steeply-discounted/1100-6531334/">Disney Lorcana TCG Palace Heist Solo And Co-Op Game Is Steeply Discounted</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-evo-2025-accessory-sale-ps5-dualsense-edge-controller-deals/1100-6531846/">PlayStation Evo 2025 Sale Features Rare Deals On DualSense Edge &amp; Pulse Headset</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-book-series-andrzej-sapkowski-box-set-deals-novel-reading-order/1100-6532972/">The Witcher 5-Novel Box Set On Sale For Just $33 At Amazon</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rds-game-traveler-deluxe-nintendo-switch-2-carrying-cases/1100-6532022/">Amazon Restocks The $40 Licensed Alternative To Switch 2 All-In-One Case</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-nintendo-switch-2-console-and-game-restocks/1100-6532451/">Nintendo Switch 2 At Amazon - Console Restocks, Every Accessory You Can Buy, And More</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/god-of-war-20th-anniversary-retrospective-box-set-gets-nice-discount/1100-6530148/">God Of War 20th Anniversary Retrospective Box Set Gets Nice Discount</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lord-of-the-rings-tolkien-illustrated-book-is-only-30-at-amazon-right-now/1100-6533080/">Lord Of The Rings Tolkien Illustrated Book Is Only $30 At Amazon Right Now</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/berserk-anime-blu-ray-best-amazon-deals/1100-6524954/">Berserk's Best Anime Adaptation Gets Limited-Time Price Cut At Amazon</a></li>   </ul> </div>

<p>According to its <a href="https://x.com/nintendo_cs/status/1950723771306054133">customer support account on social media</a>, the ability to upload records to the rankings is temporarily suspended. Rankings will also not be updated for the time being. This will once again be resolved in an update as soon as possible:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Nintendo Customer Support:</strong> "Regarding "Super Mario Party Jamboree" (including the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition), due to a glitch, the function to upload records to the ranking is currently suspended, so even if you update your records, the ranking will not be updated. We apologize for the inconvenience caused. We are currently preparing update data to fix this issue, and we will provide further information as soon as it is ready."</p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="XT_vmJEKdkw" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XT_vmJEKdkw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XT_vmJEKdkw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XT_vmJEKdkw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4a62a0lqirxv&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XT_vmJEKdkw" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

            <link>https://aftermath.site/video-games-user-experience-ux-research</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/%E2%80%98dopamine-simply-doesn%E2%80%99t-work-like-that%E2%80%99-an-interview-with-a-user-experience-researcher.1257714/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>After a short hiatus, we are <em>back </em>this week with a fresh entry<a href="https://aftermath.site/category/what-i-do" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> in our What I Do<em> </em>series, a collection of blogs</a> explaining just what, exactly, individuals working in the video game industry do every day.</p><p>There's nothing I love more for this feature than getting <em>deeply </em>specific, so it's with great pleasure today that I introduce Ben Taels, who has spent a big chunk of his career working as a User Experience Researcher at places like Epic Games. And if you think that involves focus-testing or experiments in dopamine release, Ben is here to share his experiences and dispel some myths.</p><p><strong>Luke Plunkett: Hey Ben, thanks for taking the time out to chat with us! Tell us all about yourself.</strong></p><p><strong>Ben Taels</strong>: I am from a small town in New Zealand and my first contact with video games was when my dad borrowed a Sinclair computer from a friend. It had this plane game on it (that you had to manually program in) where you had to clean, via dropping bombs, a landing field before your plane reached the bottom of the screen. When I say plane I mean single pixel moving from left to right and then right to left. It was really, really hard, but also amazing. I then had an Atari, an Amiga, and then a Mac. I didn't want the Mac, because I wanted to play <em>DOOM</em>! Luckily I found <em>Marathon</em> (by Bungie) and then all was well. In fact, l would go on to be the game reviewer for New Zealand's best (only) Mac publication, <em>MacGuide Magazine</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>When I wasn't playing video games or TTRPGs I was really interested in biology and animal behaviour. As such, I enrolled in an animal behaviour course at university and even worked for a year as a zoo keeper at a local zoo. The course was jointly taught by the biology and psychology departments and via the psych department I was also exposed to the idea of “human factors psychology”, which is a branch of psychology that studies technology and humans and as a principle believes that technology should be made for humans and the capabilities of humans. That is to say that people shouldn't have to suffer or struggle because of technology asking them to do things humans aren't physically or cognitively good at. Human factors also acknowledges that behaviour is systemic and arises from a web of interactions. Therefore the designers and owners (governments, businesses, etc) of those systems have the biggest responsibility for the outcomes of those systems.</p><figure><blockquote><p>A focus group/test is a specific methodology where you get a group of people together and get them to talk about a product, design, or idea. It is a flawed method, and not one I use or recommend.</p></blockquote></figure><p>Human factors psychology really spoke to me. There are so many systems out there that don't seem to care about the people interacting with them at all, and that should change. So I did a master’s in human factors, focused on road safety. Then after some time working for the NZ government as a road safety scientist I discovered that games UX research existed within the games industry! It was a pretty new field back then and the most prominent lab was at Microsoft. So I wrote them a message and they very kindly replied, put me through an interview loop, and then let me know, amongst other things, that really I needed a PhD (no longer the case, but the field was newer back then). I had always wanted one of those, so I headed off to the Netherlands, got a PhD, and more importantly also was lucky to find my partner while in Europe!&nbsp;</p><p>My PhD in human factors psych was also focused on traffic safety, but I always kept an eye on the games UX research world and taught some courses about UXR to game design students at a local university in the Netherlands. I also gave some talks at GDC EU. I was then lucky enough to get my first role as a Games UX Researcher and entered the games industry around 12 years ago.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>LP: So you've worked in the same space for over a decade, what was the last job title you had?</strong></p><p><strong>BT</strong>: My first role was as a Games UX Researcher at a consultancy in the UK called Player Research. We worked mainly with indies and mobile game companies, and in the two and a half years I was there I worked on around 75 games.</p><p>I then moved on to Epic Games in the USA, around nine years ago. I started as a Researcher, but then moved into management of the UX Research team. My move to leadership happened a little while before <em>Fortnite Battle Royale</em> came out, and most recently my title was Director, User Experience Research.&nbsp;</p><p>I left Epic a few months ago to move back to NZ for lifestyle and family reasons.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>LP: Across both your user experience roles, both as a researcher and managing a team, what did your job actually involve? Like, on both a daily basis and a more long-term basis?</strong></p><p><strong>BT</strong>: As Director, User Experience Research, I viewed my main role as making sure my team was happy, healthy, having fun (we work on games so fun should be part of the work environment!), and had what they needed to do their job. Effectively as the top level of the UXR team system my role was to design it as a positive place to be. This also included knowing what the priorities were, where the work is most needed, and advocating for games user experience research and my team.&nbsp;</p><p>To talk more broadly about what games user experience research can do, I see it as typically having four main functions:&nbsp;</p><p>UX research with external players: There are a range of methods that can be deployed here, but the most important and valuable is running observational UX tests with external players and users. The primary goal of this is to put real, representative, players/users into contact with the in-development games and products to observe and research what happens. These players are not familiar with the game and therefore better represent the behaviours of the player population. Another aspect of this can be checking to help make sure the game is accessible for a range of players e.g., looking at things like is the UI colour blind friendly? Are simulation sickness triggers minimized? etc.</p><p>Competitive and UX analysis: This is where UX researchers use their training and education to examine a game or product for what makes it work and what may be issues. This can be a full description of a single game or looking at a particular mechanic or system (for example crafting systems) across multiple games.</p><p>Internal playtesting: Setting up, running, and collecting and sharing data on the results of internal (employee) playtests. This can also include being involved in the technical side of making sure in-development builds are ready and working. The goals of internal playtests are to let developers play/use and provide feedback on games and products being developed at the company. This is important as it lets teams experience what they and others have been working on and fosters a feedback culture. At some companies this function is owned by QA, and at others by UXR.&nbsp;</p><p>Survey research: Creating, sending, and analyzing surveys. Surveys can be sent via email (to people who opted in) and/or built directly into games (for example has <em>Fortnite Battle Royale</em> ever asked you how powerful you thought bananas were?). The goals of this function is to find out how players were feeling and thinking via representative surveys. In the banana example, by having players rate the banana, alongside also collecting ratings for, say, the Kamehameha, it can give comparison points and context for the data.&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p>As someone who loves research it is also really fulfilling to be able to take the knowledge I have of why, cognitively speaking, a motorist may not see a cyclist at an intersection and be able to use that to investigate why a UI element or enemy in a game may also not stand out.</p></blockquote></figure><p>Across the functions above, ultimately, the goal of user experience research is to be a partner to other devs and help them make sure their design intent/vision is reaching the players/users. So for example, is a new game mechanic clear? Can players use it the way the designer intends? Is it too easy to use? Then once it is out, is it being received and interacted with as intended?</p><p>One example of a UX test finding from during my consulting days was a game where at a certain point you had to "press tab". I watched a player in a lab not press tab over and over and then went to talk to them. At that point they told me they had seen the instruction, but couldn't see a tab (as in a tab in a browser) anywhere in the UI to press. Which was an important lesson in how mental models can differ, particularly in a world where often the "tab" button on keyboards may not be labeled and its use is relatively rare.&nbsp;</p><p>Another way to look at it is that the goal of user experience research is to use the scientific method and what is known about how psychology and physiology to:</p><p>- Help make sure the intended game/product design is being experienced. Including that the friction/difficulty the designers want is being achieved.</p><p>- Help make sure any unintended friction that gets in the way of, or blocks, the intended design is found and addressed.</p><p>- Finally to help find any unexpected/emergent experiences that may not have been fully intended, but are awesome.&nbsp;</p><p>Then we use the above data to help inform design. I do want to flag the use of "inform" there as very intentional vs the idea of "data driven" design. I have found that data is a poor driver, as it is often short sighted, lacks context, and is overly reactive. Where data really shines is when it is used, in partnership with the expertise of other devs, to inform a design. It is here that data can contribute to long term views and mesh well with the art of games.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>LP: That's certainly a lot! Out of all that, what would you say was the thing you loved most about the job?</strong></p><p><strong>BT</strong>: The clear answer is the people I have had the privilege of working with in my career so far. They are all just the best people; smart, funny, and awesome to work with.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, to be able to raise players' issues and concerns and to highlight what they think is cool is another wonderful thing. To see a game come through UX tests, design iterations, reach players, and then see the behaviour we saw in the lab also being shown by millions of players and to know they are loving it! That is really a great feeling. To have the collaborative process of game design come together.</p><p>As someone who loves research it is also really fulfilling to be able to take the knowledge I have of why, cognitively speaking, a motorist may not see a cyclist at an intersection and be able to use that to investigate why a UI element or enemy in a game may also not stand out. Every survey, every UX test and every playtest, it is just exciting to me to see the data, whether it is surprising or completely expected.</p><p><strong>LP: On the flipside, what are the downsides? Are there any challenges you would face regularly, and are there fresh ones you see coming on the horizon?</strong></p><p><strong>BT</strong>: A regular challenge would be dealing with the misconception that UXR dumbs down games and makes them easy. Also, that we are all inherently evil and working to manipulate players into spending money. Neither of these is true about UXR.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Part of the reason I have worked in games UXR and not, say, microwave UX, is that games can be designed to be hard in a way that just isn't the goal for consumer UX. Games can be confusing and challenging. If that is the intent of the designer, then that is what we work to support in UXR. In my 12+ years working in games UX research I have far more often highlighted that some design element was too easy for players than I have said something was too hard.&nbsp;</p><p>In terms of the manipulation I do understand where that comes from. So much of the online world now has been made to intentionally work against the user. But absolutely that is not what I am interested in, nor is it what games user experience researchers should be supporting. Our goal is to represent the players. This means if something around purchasing is unclear it is our job to find that and point it out.&nbsp;</p><p>Two other things regularly bug me. One is calling what games user research does “focus testing” or “focus groups”. A focus group/test is a specific methodology where you get a group of people together and get them to talk about a product, design, or idea. It is a flawed method, and not one I use or recommend. If I were to pick one method that is most representative for UXR it would be observational research. Watching people play and writing down what happens to collect their actual behaviour i.e., not what they say they do, but what they actually do. So, please if you are going to generalize say: we do playtesting or UX testing, not focus tests.&nbsp;</p><p>The other is when people throw around scientific terms like "hit of dopamine" or "dopamine rush". Dopamine just simply doesn't work like that at all. Also we really shouldn't be using drug metaphors in general when talking about games.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>LP: Thanks so much again for your time. Is there anything else you'd like to add before we sign off? Shout outs to peers, advice for folks, ill tidings for the industry?</strong></p><p><strong>BT</strong>: If anything I have said above is interesting to you, you should check out <a href="https://www.gamesur.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Games User Research,</a> which is best place to go on the Internet for information on games UX research, including an active Discord server for connecting with and talking with others in the field.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, a big thanks to my previous teammates, colleagues, and teachers.

                <p dir="ltr">These days, Baldur's Gate 3 is probably the first thing that comes to mind when people think "Dungeons &amp; Dragons video games," but there's a long history of D&amp;D video games stretching back to before Baldur's Gate 3--or even its predecessors like Baldur's Gate 1 and 2, Planescape Torment, and Neverwinter Nights--ever existed. Throughout the '80s and early '90s, there was a long list of titles like Eye of the Beholder, Pool of Radiance, and Champions of Krynn that adapted older D&amp;D editions into video game form--and many are still considered important classics that are worth revisiting today. If you've ever been curious about these beloved PC games, you'll want to check out Humble's <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Get+30+Classic+D%26D+PC+Games+For+%2410&amp;fnauthor=brendanhesse&amp;fndate=2025-07-30+13%3A17%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-07-30+16%3A11%3A03&amp;fnarticle_id=6533569&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fhumblebundleinc.sjv.io%2Fc%2F1804712%2F2059850%2F25796%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fgames%2Fdungeons-dragons-classics-collection&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fget-30-classic-dd-pc-games-for-10%2F1100-6533569%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dungeons &amp; Dragons Classic Collection</a> game bundle, which includes up to <strong>30 old-school D&amp;D PC RPGs, strategy, and action games, for just $10.</strong> But you'll want to act fast, as the bundle will <strong>only be available until August 7</strong>.</p><p dir="ltr">Like other Humble bundles, a portion of all Dungeons &amp; Dragons Classic Collection revenue is donated directly to charity. For this deal, Humble is donating proceeds to Covenant House, which provides food, shelter, and ongoing services to homeless and trafficked young people. If you want to donate more, you can increase your pledge beyond $10 and change the revenue split between Humble, the game publishers, and Covenant House before checkout.</p><p dir="ltr">The Dungeons &amp; Dragons Classic Collection offers two payment tiers, and the more you pay, the more games you get. The bundle's base $5 includes six games, four of which are standalone releases, including the top-down action-adventure game Al-Qadim: The Genie's Curse, the classic dragon-flying combat sim DragonStrike, the kingdom-building strategy sim D&amp;D - Stronghold: Kingdom Simulator, and DeathKeep, which is a fast-paced action-RPG with gameplay inspired by 90s first-person shooters. The other item in the bundle is Forgotten Realms: The Archives Collection Three, which includes two classic D&amp;D dungeon-crawling CRPGs: the party-based "blobber" Menzoberranzan--which stars iconic D&amp;D character Drizzt Do'Urden--and the hardcore roguelike Dungeon Hack.</p><p dir="ltr">If you pay $10 or more, you'll unlock the full bundle, which includes everything from the previous tier. Most of the other items in this tier are multi-game collections with between two and eight titles each, totaling 30 games (a $109 value). There are several notable inclusions in this tier, but one of our favorites is the Forgotten Realms: The Archives Collection One, which bundles the Eye of the Beholder trilogy--often considered three of the best dungeon-crawling RPGs ever made--into a single title. If you've ever played the Legend of Grimrock games, you'll immediately recognize the gameplay style of Eye of the Beholder 1-3, which still holds up well today despite being over 30 years old.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4540967-dndgamespchumble.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4540967" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4540967-dndgamespchumble.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4540967"></a><figcaption>Humble's Dungeons &amp; Dragons Classic Collection PC game bundle</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4540967-dndgamespchumble.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The full list of games in Dungeons &amp; Dragons Classic Collection offers a varied list of genres and worlds--including popular campaign settings like The Forgotten Realms, Dragonlance, and Spelljammer, as well as more obscure worlds like Darksun and Ravenloft--making it a great source for classic D&amp;D lore and history.

For those who want a streamlined, easy-to-set-up version of the game, the upcoming Dungeons &amp; Dragons x Stranger Things: Welcome to The Hellfire Club looks to be a solid entry point for the TTRPG. Launching October 7, the game comes with everything you need to start playing immediately--including pre-made characters, maps, and four follow-along adventures based on the campaigns made by Stranger Things character Eddie Munson. Preorders for the game are available for $50 at Amazon. </p><p dir="ltr">If that still sounds too complicated, you may want to check out the new Horrified: Dungeons &amp; Dragons board game. This D&amp;D-themed version of the award-winning Horrified board game sees 1-5 players taking on quests where they encounter iconic D&amp;D monsters like The Mimic, The Beholder, The Displacer, and Red Dragon in the notorious Undermountain dungeon from D&amp;D's Forgotten Realms lore. The game is available now for $30. We had a chance to play the game ahead of launch, so be sure to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-dungeon-full-of-terror-and-fun-horrified-meets-dd-in-legendary-fashion/1100-6533180/" data-ref-id="1100-6533180">check our Horrified: Dungeons &amp; Dragons review</a> for our impressions.</p><p dir="ltr">For those who want to play the full version of the game, you can pick up the latest D&amp;D 2024 Edition--also known as 5.5E--of the rulebooks needed to start playing, plus a selection of gameplay elements, expansions, and adventure modules. The new Player's Handbook, Dungeon Master's Guide, and Monster Manual are the three primary books you need to put together your own campaigns and characters, and all three are available at Amazon. And if you want some pre-made campaign modules to follow along with, there's the recently released <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dungeons-Dragons-Dragon-Adventure-Anthology/dp/0786969989?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dragon Delves Adventure Anthology</a> that comes with 10 adventures designed for characters from levels 1-12. There are also additional expansions and gameplay materials available if you feel like supplementing your collection even more.

Finally, players can use the Sword of Dracula for Blade’s ultimate ability, allowing him to tear through entire enemy teams with style.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Almost a century ago, Eric Brooks was born of two worlds: the light of his mother's embrace and the dark of the vampire that attacked her,” a description from NetEase says. “After embracing his existence as a dhampir, he became the Daywalker, the ultimate vampire hunter, combining unmatched combat skills and unwavering supernatural abilities.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“When Dracula reigned over New York City, it was none other than Blade who confronted him first. By then, however, it was too late. Dracula had mastered the almighty power of Chronovium, defeating the Daywalker and imprisoning him within the castle dungeon.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“After Dracula's fall, Blade was sent to Wakanda to recover, but his story is far from over. Now recruited by Shuri to save all existence, Blade stands awake and at the ready against the dark forces of Hela and Knull.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With the launch of the Marvel Rivals Season 3.5 update next week comes changes to the team-up abilities. Guardian Revival and Atlas Bond are both being removed from the experience, and Loki is being removed from Ragnarök Rebirth. In place of these adjustments come two new team-ups: Duality Dance and Vibrant Vitality. The former includes Adam Warlock and Luna Snow, while the latter brings Mantis together with either Groot or Loki. Existing team-ups are also expanding, with Iron Fist joining Chilling Assault, Star-Lord joining Rocket Network, and Blade joining Lunar Force.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">NetEase Is Making a Splash With Marvel Rivals in August</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Also set to join NetEase’s popular hero shooter come August 8 are adjustments to how players can help maintain a positive environment in their matches. In what the studio calls “Operation: Shield the Community,” players will be able to utilize a custom text chat filter, allowing users to mute specific words. NetEase says it will monitor popular muted words, which may then be added to its official list, while also saying that it’s been able to monitor all in-game voice chat conversations since July 24.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"> Marvel Rivals Season 3.5 will also introduce increased penalties for players who leave in the middle of Competitive game modes. Examples include longer bans from Competitive play and larger point deductions, with remaining players gifted point compensation at the end of affected matches. Leaver penalties will be handled on a case-by-case basis, with NetEase promising to speed up the appeals process for those looking to appeal a ban.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, the new Resource Rumble game mode and its Throne of Knull map will arrive later in the month alongside an August 22 update. NetEase stops short of detailing exactly what makes these additions stand apart from other maps and modes but teases more with plans to premiere a gameplay deep dive soon. Expect to see Resource Rumble first launch in Quick Match before it joins Competitive at a later date.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Marvel Rivals is chugging forward as NetEase works to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-dev-says-its-feeling-social-media-pressure-to-keep-the-game-as-exciting-as-it-has-been-since-december-announced-big-season-3-shake-up"><u>maintain the two-month seasonal release schedule</u></a> it promised back in April.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><figure><figcaption><span>RoseRodionova / Shutterstock / Visa / Mastercard / PayPal / Aftermath</span></figcaption></figure></p></div><div><p>If you work at a Visa, Mastercard, Stripe, or PayPal call center, your past few days might have taken on a recurring theme. Since last week’s sudden <a href="https://aftermath.site/itch-io-nsfw-adult-content-remove-payment-processors-collective-shout" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">de-indexing of almost all NSFW content</a> sent shockwaves through indie game storefront Itch.io, concerned creators and fans have been organizing to call the aforementioned reportedly-responsible companies and voice their displeasure en masse. Coordinating across BlueSky, Twitter, Discord, and Reddit, their rationale is simple: If Collective Shout, the activist group that has claimed responsibility for adult game removals on Itch <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/software/platforms/steam-introduces-new-rule-prohibiting-certain-kinds-of-adult-content-that-might-make-visa-or-mastercard-unhappy-financial-deplatforming-in-action/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and Steam</a>, could move the needle with <a href="https://www.collectiveshout.org/steam_campaign_history" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1,067 emails to payment processors</a>, a much larger group can tug the needle right back.</p><p>Of course, this relies on some pretty big assumptions: 1) That Collective Shout, which claims to fight "against the objectification of women and the sexualization of girls" but which over the years has largely set its sights on <a href="https://www.collectiveshout.org/ban-prn-on-x?fbclid=IwY2xjawL2DW5leHRuA2FlbQIxMABicmlkETFJcFJvcm1BVnUwRXZheW1TAR501XhzQorP36fB8s4Keaz5DdvdnQd0yg7qBpXK9MBJyXd3QylZOo3WCYJR6g_aem_CE1Moq-4XPj6QYrWKVQhcA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">banning porn</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/29/mastercard-visa-backlash-adult-games-removed-online-stores-steam-itchio-ntwnfb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">underwear ads</a>, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/australian-anti-porn-group-claims-responsibility-for-steams-new-censorship-rules-in-victory-against-porn-sick-brain-rotted-pedo-gamer-fetishists-and-things-only-get-weirder-from-there/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">concert tours, and various video games</a>, can be taken at face value and is not exaggerating its involvement to boost its own profile (Collective Shout has mentioned Visa, Mastercard, and PayPal, and Itch has named Stripe, PayPal, and Collective Shout, but none of those financial companies have directly indicated that Collective Shout’s pressure swayed them). And 2) that Collective Shout’s success was born of numbers and persistence, rather than a system rigged in its favor – propped up by squeamish, puritanical companies that were ready to take action the moment a semi-notable third-party tugged on their sleeve.</p><p>Still, those providing phone numbers, pre-written scripts, and entire websites to the <a href="https://www.change.org/p/tell-mastercard-visa-activist-groups-stop-controlling-what-we-can-watch-read-or-play" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hundreds of thousands of people</a> opposed to censorship on Steam and Itch say they at least have to try.</p><p>“Outside of boosting posts and donating to causes via social media, I haven't been involved with something like this to this extent before,” Dieselbrain, a former artist who created <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/dieselbrain.bsky.social/post/3luxwaqn4gs2g" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a resource-rich anti-censorship cheat sheet</a>, told Aftermath. “I decided to do this because seeing how quickly payment processors were moving to pressure platforms like Steam and Itch just made me realize that we need to start organizing more concretely. In many ways I'd rather be doing literally anything else, but livelihoods and expression are under fire from many different points of attack, so something had to be done.”</p><p>“I think an outrage like this was inevitable,” Cereza, an artist and developer who created a <a href="https://stop-paypros.neocities.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">site called Stop-Paypros</a>, told Aftermath. “This was just the boiling point for a [lot of] people, me included. Itch.io is one of the most creator-friendly websites I've ever seen and a godsend for aspiring creatives like me. Watching itch.io being forced to delist all of these works felt like yet another opportunity closing in front of me. … If payment processors don't listen to the outrage right now, I think it'll only delay their troubles in the future.”</p><p>The pages community stewards like Dieselbrain and Cerza have put together advise trying to phone all four – and in some cases even more – targets each day and prepare those who’ve heeded the call for the long haul. "This is a marathon, not a race," reads Dieselbrain's cheat sheet. "Clogging their phone lines for an extended period, over a month at the absolute least, will almost guarantee that these companies will at least have to pay attention to the backlash."</p><p>Void, a Vtuber and artist who’s put together <a href="https://anti-censorship-campaign.carrd.co/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a website</a> and <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Ms9GVmFD7K" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Discord</a> to aid the cause, concurs.</p><p>"The most important thing is to keep talking about this,” he told Aftermath. “We have momentum and we need to keep it. This can't just be something we all forget about by next week. Meaningful change only happens if we work together and don't give up!”</p><p>Different guides offer different approaches, starting with basic by-the-book talking points but in some cases getting craftier. For example, Cereza’s page includes an oblivious option (“I'm calling because a few days ago I wanted to buy a game that was a bit uh... on the adult side of things, but now I can't buy it anymore. I asked around and got told to call here, cause apparently you guys told [STEAM/ITCH.IO] that they couldn't sell adult games anymore?”) as well as some sterner alternatives for those with the stomach to get under customer service reps’ skin (“If these changes aren't made then I, along with many others will be forced to seek other options for processing payments. If [PAYMENT PROCESSOR] continues to impede on legitimate businesses, free speech and users' freedom to purchase legal goods, I will press as many opportunistic law firms as possible and kick off a class action lawsuit against your company.”)</p><figure><blockquote><p>[PayPal] put me on a 16.5 hour silent hold yesterday.</p></blockquote></figure><p>It’s difficult to say just how many people have spent the past several days tying up the lines of card companies and payment processors, but the movement has made itself visible enough to gain support from larger industry bodies like <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/videogameworkers.bsky.social/post/3lv2foxkkac22" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Communications Workers of America</a> and <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/igda-seriously-alarmed-by-recent-crackdown-on-nsfw-games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the International Game Developers Association</a>. Additionally, its most vocal proponents have reported a shift in how representatives treat them. <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/brlka.com/post/3lut2e2mbl22g" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Late last week</a>, callers say reps were already telling them that they weren’t alone in expressing their specific concern, but otherwise maintained a chill, professional demeanor. Now, midway through this week, Visa and Mastercard reps have apparently taken to shunting incensed Steam and Itch users down scripts of their own and, in some cases, expressing impatience or frustration.&nbsp;</p><p>“Visa was hit and miss – either respectful or defensive; it went from respectful to defensive with each passing day,” Trepe, a member of Void’s anti-censorship Discord who said that they’ve made over 20 calls in total, told Aftermath. “When they were defensive, they didn't bother answering my question. They did ‘promise me’ a callback, but I have a feeling they just lied.”</p><p>Trepe went on to say that during one call they got yelled at, and in others, reps immediately ended the call.&nbsp;</p><p>Another repeat caller, Henrick, told Aftermath that generally escalating the issue to a supervisor – rather than a rank-and-file rep – has required a specific ask and that, even then, that hasn’t fully worked; at best, they’ve received a confirmation number for their case. At worst, well…</p><p>“[PayPal] put me on a 16.5 hour silent hold yesterday,” Henrick said to Aftermath.</p><p>It’s not difficult to find similar <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/dismalwether.bsky.social/post/3lv2vbve7ok2f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">anecdotes</a> on sites like BlueSky – <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/caraellison.bsky.social/post/3luzxqyotzk2k" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">some supportive</a> and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/sammynona.bsky.social/post/3lv4onz727227" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">others less so</a> – suggesting that at least some of those on the front (phone) lines are starting to buckle under the pressure.</p><p>Aftermath reached out to Visa, Mastercard, PayPal, and Stripe for more information. The former three did not reply as of this publishing, while a spokesperson for the latter – who seemed exceedingly familiar with the Steam/Itch situation – pointed to the adult section of <a href="https://stripe.com/legal/restricted-businesses" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stripe’s prohibited businesses list</a>.</p><p>"Stripe has a policy against commenting on users,” the representative told Aftermath. “Generally speaking, we take action when we conclude that users violate our terms of service. We do not support adult content."&nbsp;</p><p>Similarly, <a href="https://www.mastercard.us/content/dam/public/mastercardcom/na/global-site/documents/mastercard-rules.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mastercard’s “illegal or brand-damaging transactions” policy</a> forbids “the sale of a product or service, including an image, which is patently offensive and lacks serious artistic value (such as, by way of example and not limitation, images of nonconsensual sexual behavior, sexual exploitation of a minor, nonconsensual mutilation of a person or body part, and bestiality), or any other material that the Corporation deems unacceptable to sell in connection with a Mark.”&nbsp;</p><p>These policies often lean on terms like “illegal,” but experts in payment processors and censorship say the reality of the situation is far less black and white.</p><p>"I think the reason that activist organizations tend to target payment companies is that they're seen as the weakest link in providing online content payment services,” Rainey Reitman, special advisor to the Electronic Frontier Foundation and author of forthcoming book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0807019119?tag=bpress-20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Transaction Denied: Big Finance's Power to Punish Speech</em></a>, told Aftermath. “They don't really care about most individual accounts, because they're not making that much money, in the grand scheme of things, off of any one account. So any hassle that's going to cause them, like a headache or bad publicity or potential scrutiny from regulators, they just wash their hands of it. There's no consequences for them in shutting off accounts in the United States; they don't have an obligation to provide services to people or even to provide an explanation when they choose to end a financial relationship, except in a very limited number of circumstances."</p><p>While beleaguered call center workers are an unintended casualty of this potentially ceaseless dustup between companies and campaigners, the real goal is to deprive companies of time and money. In an ideal world, those spearheading the anti-censorship movement hope, companies will eventually reverse course. This might sound like a pipe dream, but it’s not unprecedented: In 2021, following backlash from users, OnlyFans <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/25/onlyfans-says-it-will-no-longer-ban-porn-after-backlash-from-users.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reversed a decision to ban porn</a> prompted by banks and payment companies. "Thank you to everyone for making your voices heard," OnlyFans <a href="https://x.com/OnlyFans/status/1430499277302816773" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said on Twitter at the time</a>. "We have secured assurances [from banking partners] necessary to support our diverse creator community and have suspended the planned October 1 policy change."&nbsp;</p><p>"I haven't seen backlash like this to this sort of censorship pressure since something similar happened with OnlyFans a few years back, and that backlash <em>was </em>able to turn that situation around," said Deiselbrain. "I think people are hitting a breaking point and they're sick of these kinds of draconian policies."</p><figure><blockquote><p>I haven't seen backlash like this to this sort of censorship pressure since something similar happened with OnlyFans a few years back.</p></blockquote></figure><p>According to Mike Stabile, director of policy at a trade association for the adult industry called the <a href="https://www.freespeechcoalition.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Free Speech Coalition</a>, the OnlyFans situation provides few surefire takeaways, but it does demonstrate a lack of legal and moral authority that companies like Visa and Mastercard disguise with official-sounding-but-vague terms of service.</p><p>"OnlyFans has been sort of tight-lipped about what actually happened [when it reversed its porn ban], but several days before OnlyFans made that decision, [Congresswoman Ann Wagner] had sent a letter to the Department of Justice saying that there was exploitation happening on OnlyFans,” Stabile told Aftermath. “The claims were really sort of without evidence, but it generated headlines and attention, which makes bankers nervous. ... They don't want to lose Visa and Mastercard, right? They don't want to be excluded from those networks. The threat of costly government investigations or bad PR can sometimes make them nervous enough where they were going to pull back from working with a specific platform."</p><p>"But the idea that it's just about what's legal is ridiculous,” he added. “It's not about what the law allows you to process. These are often very subjective rules around what falls outside the brand guidelines for Visa and Mastercard. And even if something doesn't fall outside the brand guidelines, it may just be something that is uncomfortable. ... [Questions of] 'Is this inside the bounds? Is this outside the bounds? Should we be processing that? Should we not be processing that?' are often incredibly subjective."</p><p>Stabile speculated that specific game removals on Steam and new rules on both Steam and Itch are meant to bring video games in line with what card companies and payment processors would be comfortable with in real-life porn. But that approach, he noted, doesn’t really stand up to prolonged scrutiny: "The difference is that you can't shoot anybody in real life, but there are plenty of games in which you can do that,” he said. “The stuff [companies] are talking about is entirely legal. It's legal to have in a book, it's legal to have in a game. They are making decisions based on their brand, based on public pressure from anti-porn groups, and that can be reversed."</p><p>Itch now finds itself waiting on the outcome of some of those subjective determinations to decide when, how, and which NSFW content will return to the store, according to site founder and owner Leaf Corcoran.</p><p>"The situation is evolving as we await final determinations from our current payment processors, Stripe and PayPal,” Corcoran wrote in <a href="https://itch.io/updates/update-on-nsfw-content#addendum-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an FAQ on Itch</a>. “There are still unknowns that prevent us from providing a fixed timeline."</p><p>Where Steam, a platform on which every product page is reviewed before going live, was able to target specific games and issue new policies relatively quickly, Itch, an open platform, has been forced to conduct “a broader review.”&nbsp;</p><p>“Every payments platform is built on many layers of different partners, from banks to card networks,” Corcoran told Aftermath. “When we got a policy notice from Visa, it went up that chain before arriving in our inbox. Each layer has a team that decides if they are willing to continue doing business with us. When we received the notice, we were told that those teams were likely actively clicking around on our site to determine if itch.io is a business they can support. It was incredibly critical that we addressed problematic pages as fast as possible. The changes we are making to our platform have to convince them that we've taken the violation seriously and that we're committed to a solution that will avoid any future issues.”&nbsp;</p><p>Throughout this process, Itch has also been hit with backlash from creators who feel abandoned in the face of an outside incursion. Some have pointed out, though, that Itch’s relatively small team is at least keeping the public abreast of its progress and methodology – that it’s less walled-off than, say, Steam. Corcoran can see where the critics are coming from.</p><p>"Honestly, I feel like our communication has been lacking,” he said. “I've personally been prioritizing critical platform updates over communicating externally. We've done our initial audit and implemented product changes, so I had a moment [earlier this week] to update our users on what's going on. We owe it to our developers to keep them updated while pages are deindexed."</p><figure><blockquote><p>Reps at these companies are very much aware of what's going on. I can only hope that this can lead to a positive change for creators. The work the community is doing is incredibly impressive and should be celebrated.</p></blockquote></figure><p>Corcoran cheers the movement to get card companies and payment processors to reverse their decision, though if it’s causing them to waver, they’ve yet to communicate it to him: "No one at any of the companies we're in touch with has mentioned [all the calls and messages] to us yet. I do see on social media, though, that reps at these companies are very much aware of what's going on. I can only hope that this can lead to a positive change for creators. The work the community is doing is incredibly impressive and should be celebrated. I think it's important that these discussions are happening."</p><p>In the long run, Corcoran plans to “start working with more financial partners that are equipped to handle the kind of content we have.”&nbsp;</p><p>“It's our own fault for not having additional relationships with payment processors in place to avoid interruptions like this,” he said.</p><p>That will hopefully mean NSFW games can continue to flourish on the platform – that The Great Deindexing will be remembered as merely an interruption before a return to regularly scheduled programming. In the meantime, however, games that do not include content card companies and payment processors might find objectionable appear to have run afoul of the rules on both <a href="https://myosuki.itch.io/girls-girls-girls/comments" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Itch</a> and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/dirtlord77.bsky.social/post/3lv2264j6sk2c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a> – a nightmare scenario that some see as the beginning of a slippery slope. <em>VILE: Exhumed</em>, a deeply personal horror game that was recently banned from Steam, has game makers feeling especially on edge.</p><p>"I am extremely disappointed to let you know that <em>VILE: Exhumed</em> has been fully removed and banned for sale on Steam," wrote the game’s creator, Cara Cadaver, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/dirtlord77.bsky.social/post/3lv2264j6sk2c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on BlueSky</a>. "I want to be clear: <em>VILE: Exhumed</em> was not banned for its use of gore in storytelling or the violent themes. It was banned for 'sexual content with depictions of real people,' which, if you have played it, you know is all implied, making this all feel even worse."</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="VILE: Exhumed | Release Date Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fSbDTr-g_sE?start=5&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Other developers of games that explore adult themes, like <em>Tryhard</em>, <em>Zugzwang</em>, and <em>Hurt Me Plenty</em> creator Robert Yang – whose games were also deindexed on Itch – have found hope in the movement to push back against bank companies and payment processors but believe that this might be a sign that it’s time to think bigger.</p><p>“In the long run, maybe the only way to prevent payment processor censorship is to distribute games without payment, non-commercially,” Yang told Aftermath. “But obviously people need money to survive. Maybe we have to imagine other ways of supporting artists.”</p><p>At the heart of all of this is a question: What <em>are </em>the companies that handle our transactions? Are they merely utilities, like gas or electricity, or should they play a greater role in shaping society? It’s one that’s being asked in court right now, as part of a case focused on <a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/judge-tentatively-dismisses-visa-from-pornhub-sex-trafficking-lawsuits/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Visa, Pornhub, and sex trafficking</a>.</p><p>“[The case] is trying to hold Visa accountable for sex trafficking by providing financial services to advertising on PornHub, which is a sweeping and mind-boggling accusation,” said Reitman. “Are you going to hold the water company accountable for sex trafficking, for providing water to PornHub? It just doesn't make any sense. With that said, it's still in the courts. We'll see how the courts sort that out, and it might be a long time before we get an answer about it, but it's possible that some of these financial companies are watching that case and wondering what might be in the future for them."</p><p>Naomi Clark, game designer and chair at the NYU Game Center, believes that the PornHub case is just one tendril of a much larger beast.</p><p>"These matters currently exist in a kind of legal and regulatory ambiguity where it's not entirely clear who could be held liable for some kind of vague ‘harm’ stemming from explicit content,” Clark told Aftermath. “Certainly the situation with [adult] content on Tumblr, on OnlyFans, and the lawsuit against PornHub's owner MindGeek show how varied these outcomes can be. In the case of MindGeek, you had one judge saying in 2022 that Visa could be named in that lawsuit as a defendant even though they were just processing payments, and another judge earlier this year saying the opposite in the same case, dismissing Visa as a defendant because in his view they're only a utility company."</p><figure><blockquote><p>Are you going to hold the water company accountable for sex trafficking, for providing water to PornHub? It just doesn't make any sense.</p></blockquote></figure><p>Then there’s FOSTA and SESTA, the <a href="https://www.eff.org/cases/woodhull-freedom-foundation-et-al-v-united-states#take-action" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">anti-sex work, pro-censorship laws</a> disguised as anti-trafficking bills that leave companies and online platforms vulnerable.</p><p>"Nobody really knows whether SESTA and FOSTA could be stretched to prohibit any kind of fictional content that could be perceived as ‘promoting sex trafficking’ or how broad that could get,” said Clark. “In many ways legal and government systems have abdicated setting guidelines, but we clearly have an incredibly litigious executive in the White House who favors abusing the law and lawsuits and regulatory power to prohibit speech he and cronies don't like, so that sets the tone."</p><p>The end result? Fear.</p><p>"We are in a time of fear, uncertainty, and doubt – even for top risk management, compliance, and legal executives in corporate settings,” said Clark. “There's been a lot of ‘We will just ignore this as long as we can look the other way,’ and Collective Shout pierced that bubble. But I don't think even the people at the top have a clear idea of what the safe or sensible thing to do is."</p><p>This is why Reitman believes that even if the movement to pressure bank companies and payment processors to stop meddling in Steam and Itch’s affairs does not succeed overnight – or ever – it’s still worthwhile.</p><p>“I think the more pressure the public can put on companies like Visa and Mastercard the better, because right now I fear that these financial companies only hear from people who are calling on them to engage in more censorship,” she said. “So these phone calls can be a powerful counter narrative.”</p><p>"There's this bigger societal question, which is, do we think that payment services and financial companies should ever be weighing in on online speech issues, or should just be neutral intermediaries that provide financial services?” she continued. “I would argue quite strongly for the latter. … There are any number of people who are closer to the content, who are better able to judge whether or not that content should exist. Financial companies are so far removed that they can't really weigh in on these issues."</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/video-games-user-experience-ux-research"><h3>‘Dopamine Simply Doesn’t Work Like That’: An Interview With A User Experience Researcher</h3></a><p>'Part of the reason I have worked in games UXR and not, say, microwave UX, is that games can be designed to be hard'</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/clues-by-sam-wordle-daily-puzzle-game"><h3>Clues By Sam Is My Favorite Daily Puzzle Game</h3></a><p>It’s a nice little thing to do as my last thing before falling asleep.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/new-york-times-video-games-ai-nyt"><h3>The New York Times Will Never Learn</h3></a><p>We kept getting fed the same bullshit, and it’s being laundered in the same kind of stories</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/anime-manga-disney-jail-netflix-fragrant-flower"><h3>The World Is Conspiring Against Me Legally Experiencing The Fragrant Flower Blooms With Dignity</h3></a><p>The enshittification of manga and anime have reached absurd new heights, courtesy of Netflix and Kodansha’s collective bullshit.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/andrew-liszewski">Andrew Liszewski</a> <span>is a senior reporter who’s been covering and reviewing the latest gadgets and tech since 2006, but has loved all things electronic since he was a kid.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Analogue’s 4K remake of the Nintendo 64 has been <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/631816/analogue-3d-delay-nintendo-64-modretro-teaser">delayed again</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/707586/analogue-3d-4k-n64-delay-august-2025">again</a> due to the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/699681/trump-south-korea-japan-tariff-25-percent">US tariff situation</a>. But at least you can get 8BitDo’s updated take on the N64 controller, which was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/16/24265587/analogue-3d-nintendo-64-price-preorder-date">announced alongside the Analogue 3D</a>, while you wait. You can <a rel="sponsored" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DKX7JZQD?th=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20">get one through Amazon</a> in white or black for $39.99 and while it’s one of 8BitDo’s more budget-friendly controllers, its functionality is limited.</p><p>The Nintendo 64, which launched in 1996, had an unusual three-prong controller design, with a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22643372/nintendo-64-controller-joystick-button-3d-gaming-control">single analog joystick</a> in the center of the gamepad above the middle grip. The 8BitDo 64 offers the same buttons as the N64’s controller in a more traditional layout, but while it’s easier to hold, the lack of a second joystick limits its compatibility with modern games, which generally expect two. The 8BitDo 64 is compatible with the Switch, Switch 2 (after updating the controller’s firmware), Windows, and Android devices and connects to consoles, PCs, and mobile devices using either a Bluetooth connection or a USB cable.</p><p>It also features more durable Hall effect joysticks and shoulder buttons which should help prevent it from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/643886/joystick-drift-tunneling-magnetoresistance-tmr-hall-effect-gaming-solution">developing stick drift</a> over time. But if you’re not planning to use it with the Analogue 3D (someday), the controller will potentially only be useful for playing classic N64 games through an emulator or the Nintendo Switch Online service but your <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/25/23570607/goldeneye-007-xbox-release-remaster-nintendo-switch"><em>GoldenEye 007</em></a> muscle memory may not perfectly transfer over to the updated button layout. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22728144/nintendo-64-sega-genesis-controllers-switch-online-expansion-pack-buy-order">Nintendo’s own wireless N64 controller</a> is a <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fen-ca%2Fstore%2Fproducts%2Fnintendo-64-controller%2F" rel="sponsored">more accurate reproduction</a>, but you still need to be a Nintendo Switch Online subscriber to buy one.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/716292/8bitdo-64-wireless-controller-nintendo-analogue-3d]]></content:encoded>

Players can now wall-run, grind off rails, and glance off mid-air objects to pick up extra speed boosts. </p><p>The most skilled players are thus effectively racing like they have a secret stash of Mushrooms. The new patch takes things even further, in particular increasing the speed boost after landing from ramp jumps and other mid-air tricks. “You get a ton of extra momentum,” YouTuber svcTyler said in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeT-NV0hkXk&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeT-NV0hkXk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a new video</a></span>. “So much momentum to the point that it’s completely trivialized every currently existing world record in the game.”</p><p>  The <em>Mario Kart World </em>records page shows exactly that.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-converted-kevin-feiges-son/">Marvel Rivals</a> developer NetEase has delved into the changes coming in the Season 3.5 update, showcasing the latest addition to the game's roster, Blade, changes to character team-ups, a new map, a new game mode, new features to help catch and penalize toxic players, and more.</p>



<p>Most of the new features, like Blade and NetEase's new monitoring of voice chat in matches and reviews of muted words, will arrive with the update on August 8, 2025. The new game mode, Resource Rumble, and the new map that it's introducing, Throne of Knull, won't arrive until a later update on August 22, 2025.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Regarding the team-up changes, two are being removed from play entirely: Guardian Revival and Atlas Bond. Loki is the only character who is being removed from a team-up, as Ragnarok Rebirth will now be a Hela/Thor team-up. Two new team-ups are being introduced, Duality Dance, which includes Adam Warlock and Luna Snow, and Vibrant Vitality, which includes Mantis and Groot/Loki.</p>



<p>Iron Fist will join the Chilling Assault team-up, and Star-Lord will join the Rocket Network team-up. Blade, as the new kid on the block, will join the Lunar Force team-up with Moon Knight and Cloak &amp; Dagger.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Beyond NetEase monitoring voice chat more closely and a custom filter for text chat to filter out muted words, the studio is also introducing harsher penalties for players who leave competitive matches. Players who quit competitive matches early will receive longer bans and larger point deductions, while the players who have to stick it out with a handicap thanks to their former teammate quitting will be offered point compensation when the match is over. </p>



<p>If you get booted from the match through no fault of your own, like losing a connection or your system crashing, NetEase promises to review mistaken bans and appeals faster, so players aren't wrongly sidelined. </p>



<p>Marvel Rivals was one of the biggest games at the top of the year, and while its active player base (on <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2767030/charts/#max">Steam</a>, at least) has declined from the heights it was hitting in January, it still has tens of thousands of players each day. As NetEase continues to update and add to the game, it'll be interesting to see if it is able to repeat, or even surpass its launch numbers, with future changes and updates.</p>



<p>After all, a strong launch for a free-to-play live service game is a great thing, but the sign of a healthy live-service game is being able to leapfrog those launch numbers with a new update, something Marvel Rivals has not yet done.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/how-standards-best-decks-can-survive-huge-rotation</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/how-standards-best-decks-can-survive-a-huge-rotation.1257558/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>With the release of Magic’s first ever space set in Edge of Eternities, another frontier was also crossed: that of the Standard rotation.</p>

<p>Standard is magic’s premiere tournament rotating format, and formerly its most played format. While the casual play of Commander has taken that crown, Standard is still played, especially online and it is the regional qualifier format come August. While the format was recently played at Pro Tour Final Fantasy, the decks from that event will need changing because of Wizards <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/banned-and-restricted-june-30-2025" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Banned and Restricted Announcement – June 30, 2025">banning 7 cards</a> after the event, and standard rotation happening with the release of&nbsp;<em>Edge of Eternities</em>.</p>

<h2>What is MTG Standard Rotation?</h2>

<p>When a format rotates, certain sets stop being legal for the format. Generally speaking, a number of sets rotate at once, in a predefined pattern. Previously, Standard had been on a 2 year cycle, meaning that it would rotate a year worth of sets at the start of the Magic year (traditionally September), leaving behind 3 or 4 sets along with the newly released set.</p>

<p>However, in 2023 Wizards of the Coast announced that Standard was moving to a <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/revitalizing-standard" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Revitalizing Standard">3 year rotation schedule</a>. Thus sets will be legal for at least 3 years (<em>Foundations </em>stays legal through at least 2029), before rotating. They further refined it in 2024 with the release of <em>Foundations</em>, <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/aligning-the-universes-making-all-our-sets-legal-in-all-our-formats" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Aligning the Universes: Making All Our Sets Legal in All Our Formats">announcing that following</a> the <em>Edge of Eternities </em>rotation, there will be no rotation until 2027 so that rotation is moved to happening at the start of the calendar year.</p>

<h2>What sets are rotating out of Standard with <em>Edge of Eternities</em>?</h2>

<p>The following sets will cease to be legal following the official release of <em>Edge of Eternities</em>:</p>

While Sheoldred is no longer the monster it was early in its run in Standard, it would see play either main or board for these decks and was especially strong against Izzet Vivi Cauldron. This loss, and the next, also impact other black midrange decks like Demons.</p>

<p><u>Black Removal Spells </u>– <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dmu/89/cut-down" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Cut Down ">Cut Down</a> / <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/one/108/sheoldreds-edict" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Sheoldred’s Edict">Sheoldred’s Edict</a> / <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/bro/102/go-for-the-throat" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Go For The Throat">Go For The Throat</a> / <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mat/12/blot-out" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Blot Out">Blot Out</a> / <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/one/81/anoint-with-affliction" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Anoint with Affliction">Anoint with Affliction</a></p>

<p>The removal package Dimir Midrange decks were running is getting gutted with rotation. The biggest loss here is Cut Down for all the black decks, as this was the little 1 mana answer that could, answering a huge variety of threats up to about 3 mana at instant speed. It was particularly useful against Izzet Cauldron as it could kill all their threats.</p>

<p><strong>Replacements</strong></p>

<p><u>For Faerie Mastermind</u></p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/lci/63/malcolm-alluring-scoundrel" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Malcolm, Alluring Scoundrel">Malcolm, Alluring Scoundrel</a>: Perhaps the most straightforward switch is adding another 2 mana flier that provides some card quality advantage with its looting.</p>

<p><u>For Sheoldred, the Apocalypse</u></p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/big/9/harvester-of-misery" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Harvester of Misery">Harvester of Misery</a>: One way the black decks may try to fill two holes with one card is Harvester of Misery, who is a sizable 5 drop, but also can be discarded earlier in the game for some cheap spot removal of -2/-2.</p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/eoe/97/elegy-acolyte" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Elegy Acolyte">Elegy Acolyte</a>: From <em>Edge of Eternities</em>, this acolyte is a 4/4 lifelink for 4 giving a passable body for this role, but importantly it can help you draw cards (also replacing <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/bro/95/gix-yawgmoth-praetor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Gix, Yawgmoth Praetor">Gix</a> for those lists that ran it), and make tokens if a non-land left the battlefield.</p>

The fact that it’s only -2/-2 with potential for more as well as a sorcery may doom it, as missing 3 toughness misses key creatures like <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dsk/136/fear-of-missing-out" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Fear of Missing Out">Fear of Missing Out</a>, and <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fin/248/vivi-ornitier" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Vivi Ornitier">Vivi</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Izzet Vivi Cauldron</h3>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/izzet-cauldron.jpg?itok=IUpZN7ye 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/izzet-cauldron.jpg?itok=k4ymErN1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><a href="https://mtgdecks.net/Standard/s-izzet-cauldron-decklist-by-thenerdysteve-2564171" rel="nofollow">Izzet Cauldron by TheNerdySteve</a></figcaption></figure><p>The other seeming top tier deck with Dimir Midrange is centered around everyone’s favorite little wizard. This is an aggro-combo deck aiming to win either by beating you down quickly with giant creatures, or do combo works with <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/woe/242/agathas-soul-cauldron" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Agatha’s Soul Cauldron">Agatha’s Soul Cauldron</a>.</p>

<p>Core to the deck are cards like <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mkm/67/profts-eidetic-memory" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Proft’s Eidetic Memory">Proft’s Eidetic Memory</a>, and <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dft/138/marauding-mako" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Marauding Mako">Marauding Mako</a> that take advantage of all the draw and discarding in the deck, which the core of cards are aimed at producing to let the deck punch face. If that plan gets stalled or stymied, it merely relies on it’s combo plan it is setting up of getting <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fin/248/vivi-ornitier" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Vivi Ornitier ">Vivi Ornitier </a>on <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/woe/242/agathas-soul-cauldron" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Agatha's Soul Cauldron">Agatha’s Soul Cauldron</a> and then using its creatures pumped with counters to generate mana. From there, drawing cards is generally easy for more, and the deck finishes with <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mom/171/voldaren-thrillseeker" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Voldaren Thrillseeker">Voldaran Thrillseeker</a> if huge creatures aren’t enough.</p>

<p><strong>Losing From Rotation</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mom/171/voldaren-thrillseeker" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Voldaren Thrillseeker">Voldaren Thrillseeker</a></p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/voldaren-thrillseeker.jpg?itok=IeeFQKWb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/voldaren-thrillseeker.jpg?itok=tydPVXaH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Having dodged the post-PT bans, Vivi Cauldron also dodges losing almost anything to rotation, although it does lose its combo finisher of choice. Thrillseeker was an easy way to launch the deck’s giant creatures at an opponent, and also served as an enabler by handing out counters.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Replacements</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dft/121/draconautics-engineer" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Draconautics Engineer">Draconautics Engineer</a></p>

It seems unlikely though that it will get the same 3of spot that Voldaren had before.</p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/otj/50/geralf-the-fleshwright" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Geralf, the Fleshwright">Geralf, the Fleshwright</a></p>

<p>In part because the Vivi decks may choose to diversify their finisher options some, or seeking cards that can provide additional value. Geralf doesn’t work with the Cauldron himself, but instead the way the deck’s engine works with wanting tons of spells played on its key turn to make tons of tokens.</p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/woe/246/gingerbrute" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Gingerbrute">Gingerbrute</a></p>

<p>Our last option here is a little sneaky, but Gingerbrute’s use here would be that it could essentially grant unblockability to the creatures for 1 mana. This would serve as a way for them to get past things like token hordes from Mono White.</p>

<h3>White Based Control (Mono White, Azorious, Jeskai)</h3>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/azorius-control.jpg?itok=39fOn_XR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/azorius-control.jpg?itok=qS782JIb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><a href="https://mtgdecks.net/Standard/azorius-control-decklist-by-ryuji-haga-2565267" rel="nofollow">Azorius Control by Ryuji Haga</a></figcaption></figure><p>Control decks containing white come in a lot of variety in Standard now, from the <a href="https://mtgdecks.net/Standard/mono-white-tokens-decklist-by-al-azif-2565284" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Mono White Control">mono-white token control decks </a>making use of <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/blb/6/caretakers-talent" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Caretaker’s Talent">Caretaker’s Talent</a>, <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdm/11/elspeth-storm-slayer" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Elspeth, Storm Slayer">Elspeth</a>, and a variety of similar token makers alongside removal, to decks that are based in blue and white (as pictured above), or going into <a href="https://mtgdecks.net/Standard/jeskai-control-decklist-by-mark-benedict-cabrera-2554462" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Jeskai Control">Jeskai</a> with white, blue, and red.</p>

<p>All of these are losing some of the same cards, with Mono White losing an additional card that might cause the deck to abandon its previous mono-white status. That may cause these decks to homogenize, especially as the metagame stabilizes, into just two decks.</p>

<p><strong>Losing From Rotation</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/bro/11/lay-down-arms" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Lay Down Arms"><u>Lay Down Arms</u></a><br>
A loss only for Mono White Token Control, Lay Down Arms was a major reason for the deck staying in mono-white as it gave it a 1 mana removal option. The ability to exile creatures based on your land count, and gain 3 life for it was a significant advantage in a format with a pair of notable decks that care about graveyards.</p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dmu/36/temporary-lockdown" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Temporary Lockdown"><u>Temporary Lockdown</u></a></p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/temporary-lockdown.jpg?itok=NSA9AhsT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/temporary-lockdown.jpg?itok=2iZ19SG2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>A loss also for the Orzhov/Esper Fairy Bounce decks, Temporary Lockdown has been a format staple. While not quite as prominent as it was a month ago when it was fighting <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdm/103/cori-steel-cutter" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Cori-Steel Cutter">Cori-Steel Cutter</a>, Temporary Lockdown is still seeing a lot of play in white decks that don’t make tokens and want to exert some control over the game. It is an early game stopper and its ability to remove anything that costs 2 or less was highly prized.</p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mom/40/sunfall" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Sunfall"><u>Sunfall</u></a></p>

<p>Previously the go-to top end mass wipe, Sunfall’s ability to exile creatures, and give a token back to the control player to hit back at the aggro player or block in the future. The key loss here is the exile portion for these decks.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Replacements</strong></p>

<p><u>For Lay Down Arms</u></p>

<p>There aren’t really any direct replacements for Lay Down Arms that would encourage the deck to stay mono-white. Instead you could see the deck merge some with Azorius or explore other options like black, but nothing matches the removal efficiency they got with Lay Down Arms.</p>

<p><u>For Temporary Lockdown</u></p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dsk/32/split-up" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Split Up">Split Up</a></p>

<p>Jeskai sometimes already prefers Split Up, but it seems like this may be the first replacement option for Temporary Lockdown. That said, Temporary Lockdown’s hitting of various permanent types would be missed by control decks.</p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/eoe/27/pinnacle-starcage" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Pinnacle Starcage">Pinnacle Starcage</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another major replacement option would be Pinnacle Starcage, which functions very similarly. It does miss enchantments however, and artifacts are more vulnerable to destruction generally, especially with <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fdn/188/abrade" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Abrade">Abrade</a> in the format.</p>

<p><u>For Sunfall</u></p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/eoe/7/beyond-the-quiet" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Beyond the Quiet">Beyond the Quiet</a></p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fdn/140/day-of-judgment" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Day of Judgment">Day of Judgment</a></p>

<p>A mana cheaper, Day of Judgment though doesn’t exile creatures which is a significant difference. It also doesn’t give you a potentially large creature to rebound with, but it's a solid no questions asked board wipe.</p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fin/38/ultima" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Ultima">Ultima</a></p>

<p>Ultima is already seeing some play, and it provides a way to avoid death triggers by ending the turn right there. However it also fails to exile creatures, though it does wipe out artifacts as well - so you don't want to run it alongside Pinnacle Starcage.</p>

<h3>Red Based Aggro</h3>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gruul-delirium.jpg?itok=mKRzphCO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gruul-delirium.jpg?itok=PQumSNvQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><a href="https://mtgdecks.net/Standard/delirium-decklist-by-yeggybombs-2553687" rel="nofollow">Gruul Delirium decklist by YeggyBombs</a></figcaption></figure><p>I’m cheating here and combining the various red-based aggro decks together. First of all: Boros Convoke is dead, as convoke cards are gone. Second, Boros as a deck is still alive, as are Gruul, Lizards, and Mice as all various takes on getting small little red dudes down and backing them up with burn.</p>

<p>The biggest hits to red happened with the recent bannings, as losing <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdm/103/cori-steel-cutter" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Cori-Steel Cutter ">Cori-Steel Cutter </a>took red decks out of the top tier, especially when combined with the further bannings of <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/woe/142/monstrous-rage" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Monstrous Rage">Monstrous Rage</a> and its best 1 drop <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/blb/138/heartfire-hero" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Heartfire Hero">Heartfire Hero</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Losing From Rotation</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/Seed%20of%20Hope" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="https://scryfall.com/card/mom/204/seed-of-hope"><u>Seed of Hope</u></a></p>

<p>Run by Gruul Delirium, Seed of Hope is a card used to quickly get some cards in the graveyard to help trigger their synergies and essentially cycles. Gruul Delirium needs to find a way to quickly stock its graveyard too.</p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/bro/144/monastery-swiftspear" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Monastery Swiftspear"><u>Monastery Swiftspear</u></a></p>

It’s not irreplaceable, but the decks will need to adapt to losing this good creature.</p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/one/134/gleeful-demolition" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Gleeful Demolition"><u>Gleeful Demolition</u></a></p>

<p>For more go-wide options, especially the dying convoke decks, Gleeful Demolition was a go-to option as it could quickly make several tokens. Nothing matches Gleeful Demolition pure token ratio of 3 tokens for 1 mana, which was an explosive burst these decks relied on to power their aggressive push, and figuring out how to survive its loss is their biggest challenge.</p>

<p><strong>Replacements</strong></p>

<p><u>For Seed of Hope</u></p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dft/171/molt-tender" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Molt Tender">Molt Tender</a></p>

<p>Run already by Insidious Roots, Molt Tender lacks the explosive graveyard loading of Seed of Hope, but provides a 1 drop who can help load the graveyard.</p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/lci/178/cenote-scout" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Cenote Scout">Cenote Scout</a></p>

<p>Another 1 drop, Cenote Scout’s exploration can functionally mill at least one card sometimes, or help get through land draws.</p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fin/185/esper-origins-summon:-esper-maduin" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Esper Origins">Esper Origins</a></p>

<p>While it costs 2 mana, the fact that Esper Origins can get 3 cards in the graveyard, and helps smooth draws makes it in some ways a closer fit for Seed of Hope. There is also the upside that in a longer running game, Esper Origins can be flashbacked to provide a body, and eventually an overrun option.</p>

<p><u>For Monastery Swiftspear</u></p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dft/132/greasewrench-goblin" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Greasewrench Goblin">Greasewrench Goblin</a></p>

<p>While lacking haste, this goblin provides 2 power for 1 mana and the ability to recharge by dumping excess lands for new cards and grow him up to 3 power later in the game.</p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/eoe/139/kavaron-harrier" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Kavaron Harrier">Kavaron Harrier</a></p>

<p>From <em>Edge of Eternities</em>, if your deck cares about artifacts at all, this 2 powered 1 drop is another good fill in, and it provides a mana outlet with an additional attacker come the midgame and keeping it relevant.</p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fdn/91/kellan-planar-trailblazer" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Kellan, Planar Trailblazer">Kellan, Planar Trailblazer</a></p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fdn/632/stromkirk-noble" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Stromkirk Noble">Stormkirk Noble</a></p>

<p>Remembering him from my days playing vampires, this guy was reprinted in Foundations, and more creatures are humans than you might think. With a single hit or two, he gets quite powerful and could be an option depending on how the metagame shakes out.</p>

<p><u>For Gleeful Demolition</u></p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdm/186/frontline-rush" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Frontline Rush">Frontline Rush</a></p>

<p>While it’s twice as much mana, Frontline Rush only makes 2 tokens, but it also can double as a finisher spell. Some decks have already adopted it, but expect any decks wanting to lean on token strategies to pick it up more.</p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdm/122/stadium-headliner" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Stadium Headliner">Stadium Headliner</a></p>

<p>Nothing replaces the explosiveness or mana to token ratio of Gleeful Demolition, but Stadium Headliner provides a quick 1 drop who can make an additional token each turn it attacks, and essentially an extra <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mkm/8/case-of-the-gateway-express" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Case of the Gateway Express">Case of the Getaway Express</a>.</p>
