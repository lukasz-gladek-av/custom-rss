			<p>At Gamescom 2024, I checked out the highly anticipated medieval RPG Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 and interviewed Martin Klima, Executive Producer at Warhorse Studios. The full interview will go live soon, but in the meantime, here's an excerpt related to the game's technology.</p>
<p><em><strong>I know that you've kept the CryENGINE. Did you consider any other engine early on?</strong></em></p>
<p><em>When we finished KCD, we looked at the technology we were using and considered our options. However, we decided that keeping CryENGINE made the most sense for us because we spent a lot of time customizing it for our needs. I think we are very happy. I'm quite proud of the performance we have now. We put a lot of effort into improving the performance since that can influence the perception of the game, and we wanted to have a smoother experience.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Did you get the latest version from Crytek or are you still using your own from the first installment?</strong></em></p>
<p><em>We are working closely with Crytek, so we have access to the latest version of the engine. Of course, we also wanted to keep our customization from KCD 1. In the end, although the engine that we have is not quite the same engine that Crytek uses for Hunt: Showdown, it is very close.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Do you support hardware ray tracing and/or multiple upscalers in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2?</strong></em></p>
<p><em>We support upscaling tech, both NVIDIA DLSS and AMD FSR. We are not using hardware ray tracing; CryENGINE has very good software ray tracing.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em><strong>I remember the first Kingdom Come Deliverance to be quite heavy on PCs.</strong></em></p>
<p><em>It was. There were a lot of things that we were doing just by brute force, and I think this additional time we had in the development for this sequel allowed us to optimize a lot, parallelize, and utilize CPUs better. Of course, hardware is faster now, and the consoles have more memory and better performance.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Will the game run at 60 FPS on consoles?</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is not finished yet, so we're still working on it, but 60FPS is not out of reach for us.</em></p>
<p>After Gamescom, I followed up with Warhorse PR Manager Tobias Stolz-Zwilling, who confirmed that the software ray tracing mentioned by Klima is actually an improved version of SVOGI, which stands for Sparse Voxel Octree Global Illumination. SVOGI was already <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-gets-svogi-onoff-comparison-performance-hit-is-minimal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">available</a> in the first Kingdom Come Deliverance game and in a few other CryENGINE-powered titles like War of Rights and SNOW. I also got confirmation that SVOGI will be available on consoles, too, for Kingdom Come Deliverance 2.</p>
<p>The game is slated to launch next year on February 11. Meanwhile, check out Chris's recent<a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> hands-on preview.</a></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/jackbox-naughty-pack-director-discusses-game-development-creating-an-opt-in-environment.979440/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/interviews/jackbox-naughty-pack-director-warren-arnold-discusses-game-development-and<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ff1e915c-de04-42ef-9c0c-9096efac6357" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/jackbox-naughty-pack-review-spicier-but-not-too-crass"><em>Jackbox Naughty Pack</em></a> is now available with three new M-rated titles; <em>Fakin' It All Night Long, Dirty Drawful, </em>and <em>Let Me Finish</em>. Ahead of the game's release we had a chance to talk with Warren Arnold, director of <em>Let Me Finish</em>, to learn about the game's pitch process, what the day to day of Jackbox development is like, and how they found the right balance of 'Naughty' without ruining anyone's night.</p>
<p>Arnold has been with Jackbox Games since <em>You Don't Know Jack</em> for Facebook, which he wrote for as a contract worker. "Once we started doing <em>Jackbox Party Pack</em> I came back full-time and wrote very heavily on <em>You Don't Know Jack</em> and <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="660ebb7e-b4c1-4b5c-a009-7d4663b03fab" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/review/quiplash-review-perfect-you-your-friends-or-strangers-internet"><em>Quiplash</em></a>, after that I was hired on full time and since then they can't get rid of me."</p>
<h2>How Where's The Butt became <em>Let Me Finish</em></h2>
<p>Arnold began our conversation by explaining the origins of <em>Let Me Finish</em>. "It was pitched by our lead editorial Rammel [Chan], and it had us all giggling from the start. The original title was 'Where's The Butt?' The first image he put up had a mailbox that had very rounded parts and it said, 'Where's The Butt?'"</p>

<p>"It was one of those things where the second he asked it in your mind you're just like, 'Well there's only one butt on this mailbox so how is this going to be a game?' but everybody circled something different and had very big opinions about why everyone else was wrong."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"When we have people being very wound up, we know we're onto something."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Arnold likened the success that they immediately felt internally to the same driving mechanic of a game like <em>Quiplash</em> where "[Jackbox Games] should be able to put something up there and your mind is already putting things together." The players should be getting excited to have the chance to talk about their answer.</p>
<p>A new feature to <em>Let Me Finish</em> that hasn't been part of previous Jackbox titles is the ability to Jump-In. This lets players who aren't part of the main head-to-head debate offer their own answer to the prompt.</p>
<p>Arnold explained that the evolution of this mechanic came from playing the game originally as a one-on-one and having other members of the team continuously adding their own thoughts on the prompt. Since then, it changed the team's mentality in terms of the game's design.</p>
<p>"If a player says they want to do something then we need to listen," Arnold said. "We tried different versions of making it a free-for-all, but that doesn't have quite enough structure. We gave it a lot of room to breath and found what's the best version of this."</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/let-me-finish-house-public-hair_0.jpg?itok=Lva082sZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/let-me-finish-house-public-hair_0.jpg?itok=jAiIMPBD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Part of what influenced the final form of this game was that the team wanted to create something that would appeal to the competitive players who would play to win, and to appeal to those who want to "draw cruel stuff and make your joke." Arnold also laughed as he admitted that the latter is more his play style anyway.</p>
<h2>The Development Cycle of a <em>Jackbox </em>Game</h2>
<p>Knowing that Jackbox Games have been creating a <em>Party Pack</em> a year, most with 4+ games available, I was interested to hear what the development cycle looked like.</p>
<p>"Most of the time when you're trying to crack the nut, it's a lot of, 'I don't know what I got done this week, but my brain is exhausted.'" Arnold explained further that it came down to a lot of planning and anticipating the desires of their audience. "As a player what do I want? How can I accentuate what's working about the game and elevate your experience."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"What's a very simple and elegant way to make sure you're engaged, you know what we're asking of you, and you can do this fun thing that you couldn't just do at your own house."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As for the writing of the prompts and the aim for the M-rating, I was interested to know how they found the balance between prompts that would add more kick than a regular Jackbox game but not enough spice to be uncomfortable.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/jackbox-naughty-pack-let-me-finish_0.jpg?itok=cLupbgoJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/jackbox-naughty-pack-let-me-finish_0.jpg?itok=HBIAwycN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>"Yeah, that's tricky," Arnold began. "Sometimes it is 'you know it when you know it.' One thing we've always tried to do at Jackbox is if you write a prompt, you don't want anyone to say, 'Oh man, that really ruined my night.' So we really try to have open ears internally and externally."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Everybody has their own experiences so we just want to be compassionate to that, at the same time we also know we need to make something fun and silly."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the <em>Jackbox Naughty Pack</em>, the project was an opt-in endeavor with an importance placed upon creating a safe space. Arnold even added that "you could also opt out. If this is going to places that you aren't comfortable with, A) we want to know why so we can take a different angle on it, or B) this is just your own personal choice and you've decided it's not for you. We just listened, that's the biggest thing we could do."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Trying to find this balance between the rating and something "fun and silly," the team was looking for prompts and experiences where anyone could say, "That is a silly thing, it's also a mature thing, but we can all agree that that is a fun topic to explore. It's trying to find that middle part where everyone can say this is a great place to live and have your party."</p>
<h2>Design Meetings With No Ego</h2>
<p>Talking about the design team as a whole, Arnold commended the design team, highlighting just how great everyone has been coming to the table with ideas for the past 6-7 years.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/jackbox-party-pack-games.jpg?itok=7xwQFaog 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/jackbox-party-pack-games.jpg?itok=vKo5hUZL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Talking through these design meetings, Arnold was especially complimentary of the team's ability to not be discouraged if an idea isn't immediately picked up. "Everyone knows you're going to have way more ideas, so when something comes up and it fits, we are already able to acknowledge it. No one gets their feeling hurt."</p>
<p>"The design meeting are a lot of fun because we're usually talking about something that's pretty ridiculous. I'd liken it to Apollo 13 where we're trying to solve a problem but the thing we're trying to solve is probably about something's butt," Arnold relayed jokingly.</p>
<p>To wrap up our time, I wanted to know, in Arnold's experience, what is the secret to Jackbox Games' success and he was able to offer two thoughts. The first of which is the 'phones as a controller' gameplay style that they wouldn't be able to do half of their games without, but the other key aspect is how players are able to create memorable experiences and in-group jokes with their friends that stick around long after the game is over.</p>
<p>"We want you to be talking about a game years down the road," Arnold said.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/12/24242937/unity-runtime-fee-cancelled-subscription-pricing<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>One year to the day since Unity announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/12/23870547/unit-price-change-game-development">its runtime fee pricing model</a>, the software developer <a href="https://unity.com/blog/unity-is-canceling-the-runtime-fee">is canceling that program effective immediately</a>. “After extensive consultation with our games community and customers, we’ve decided to cancel the Runtime Fee,” said Unity CEO Matt Bromberg in the blog post announcing the news. Instead of the runtime fee, Unity will return to a per-seat subscription model.</p><p>Last year, Unity caused a stir within the game development community with a controversial update to its pricing model. Instead of charging developers a set monthly rate based on the number of users utilizing the software, it would implement a pay-per-download scheme that charged developers every time their game was downloaded. That meant instead of paying a flat, predictable rate to Unity, payouts could fluctuate, resulting in potentially higher fees.</p><p>This news caused a massive uproar in the game development community with developers voicing their frustration on social media. Developers argued that the pricing model was implemented without adequate warning, forcing them to either pay the new fees that can’t be adequately budgeted for or make a costly and time-consuming switch to new software. They also claimed the per-download model could be exploited by malicious actors to run up fees on developers they don’t like.</p><p>As a result, some developers publicly committed <a href="https://x.com/galvanicgames/status/1702416458095972427">to moving away from Unity</a> to other game development programs like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/21/23971394/gamemaker-free-indie-creator-licensing-fee-unity">GameMaker</a> and <a href="https://x.com/MegaCrit/status/1713793866779042272">Godot</a>. Meanwhile, a group of mobile developers <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/15/23875396/unity-mobile-developers-ad-monetization-tos-changes">boycotted Unity</a> by turning off ad monetization, freezing ad revenue payouts to the company.</p><p>Unity took several steps to quell developers’ ire. The company <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/22/23882768/unity-new-pricing-model-update">restructured the pricing model</a>, raising the threshold at which the per-download fee would kick in to $1 million across all tiers of products. Unity also added a new option that allows developers to choose how to pay: either a flat 2.5 percent revenue share or the amount calculated by the per-download pricing scheme. The company also held <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/25/23889346/unity-pricing-model-fireside-chat-overview">a Q&amp;A with Unity Create president Marc Whitten</a> in which he apologized for the pricing model’s rollout. Just one month after the announcement, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/9/23910441/unity-ceo-president-john-riccitiello-out-retire">Unity CEO John Riccitiello retired</a> and earlier this year, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/25/24186003/cruises-new-ceo-comes-from-the-world-of-gaming-and-tvs">Whitten left the company</a>.</p><p>This new pricing model returns Unity to a per-seat subscription model, but there’s a catch; starting on January 1st, 2025, pricing will go up for Unity Pro and Unity Enterprise tiers. You can check out the specifics <a href="https://unity.com/products/pricing-updates">here</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

        <p>Returning to a subscription model</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Unity is scrapping their controversial "runtime fees", effective immediately. They're reverting to the "seat-based subscription model" that funded the game creation tool previously. 
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"After deep consultation with our community, customers, and partners, we’ve made the decision to cancel the Runtime Fee for our games customers, effective immediately. Non-gaming Industry customers are not impacted by this modification," <a href="https://unity.com/blog/unity-is-canceling-the-runtime-fee">says the announcement</a> from Unity CEO Matt Bromberg.
</p>
<p>"I’ve been able to connect with many of you over the last three months, and I’ve heard time and time again that you want a strong Unity, and understand that price increases are a necessary part of what enables us to invest in moving gaming forward. But those increases needn’t come in a novel and controversial new form. We want to deliver value at a fair price in the right way so that you will continue to feel comfortable building your business over the long term with Unity as your partner."
</p>
<p>While the runtime fees have been cancelled immediately, other changes will come with the launch of Unity 6 later this year. Unity Personal will remain free and the revenue cap, after which a fee must be paid, will double from $100,000 to $200,000, and in Unity 6 the "Made With Unity" splash screen will be optional. Unity Pro and Enterprise subscription pricing and revenue thresholds will change on January 1st, 2025.
</p>
<p>Unity's runtime fees charged developers money - typically around $0.20 - <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/unity-to-start-charging-some-developers-money-every-time-someone-new-installs-their-game">each time their game was installed, and applied retroactively to all games that used the engine</a>. That means that if you released a game using Unity five years ago, you would suddenly start incurring costs everytime a player installed the game. The tracking of installation figures would also be <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/unitys-per-install-fee-will-be-based-on-estimates-and-unity-may-not-spot-fraudulent-installs-in-advance">based on estimates, with limited ability to spot "fraudulent" installs</a>.
</p>
<p>The change was immediately controversial, with several developers such as Among Us creators Innersloth, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/game-devs-announce-plans-to-drop-unity-urge-players-to-protest-new-per-install-fees">planning on ditching the platform</a>. Nobody liked the fees, nobody liked their potential abuse, and nobody liked that Unity could change their terms retroactively - meaning there was no guarantee that, if you undertook the multi-year project of developing the game using the toolset, that you wouldn't end up paying far more than you expected because Unity had changed the rules in the interim.
</p>
<p>Unity <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/unity-are-changing-how-their-heavily-criticised-runtime-fee-works">immediately started walking back or clarifying the changes</a>, by excluding Unity Personal from the fees and allowing developers using older versions of Unity to remain on their existing terms. These changes did little to quell developers' concerns.
</p>
<p>Not long afterwards, Unity CEO (and former EA CEO) John Riccitiello <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/9/23910441/unity-ceo-president-john-riccitiello-out-retire">retired, effective immediately</a>. Matt Bromberg was appointed Unity's new CEO in May of this year.
</p>
<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/unity-ceo-matt-bromberg-says-runtime-fee-reversal-is-part-of-bid-to-become-a-fundamentally-different-company-">Game Developer</a>, Bromberg called the changes part of a plan to "become a fundamentally different company." Whether that's enough to win back developers' trust, I don't know. I wouldn't bet my business on it.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

I know you all feel the temperature cooling, and I’m already wearing my comfiest hoodies and sweaters indoors. Soon, the colors of the leaves will change, then they’ll fall from the trees, and before you know it, we’ll be layered up and taking picturesque park walks straight out of <em>When Harry Met Sally</em>. Never before, and never since, has a game made such wonderful use of the full autumnal palette as <em>Night in the Woods</em>. It is positively swimming in a rich swirl of brownish yellows and fiery oranges that’ll make you instinctively reach for a coat. As Mae, the game’s protagonist, walks up and down the streets of her hometown, she kicks up leaves everywhere she goes. The sky burns bright despite the obvious chill in the air, and the nights threaten to swallow people whole. In a word, it’s got an aura.</p><p><em>Night in the Woods </em>is also a source of immense comfort. I’ve always gravitated towards the fact that Mae’s unceremonious return to Possum Springs is brought on by a mental breakdown and her subsequently dropping out of college. When I played the game in 2017, Mae and I were both 20-year-olds feeling the growing pains of adulthood and our own steadily declining mental health. I wouldn’t drop out for another few years, but when I did, it was largely because of the same reasons: I needed peace of mind and some sense of normalcy in the midst of a personal crisis.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/night-in-the-woods-treats-depression-like-a-part-of-lif-1797400607&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/night-in-the-woods-treats-depression-like-a-part-of-lif-1797400607">Mae is just like us</a></span>. She’s been chipped away at over the years, and feels defunct and broken in ways that countless loved ones have professed to me over late-night talks. She doesn’t feel she deserves much in this life, and yet she desperately wants more out of it than the hand she’s been dealt. She comes back to town to play hookie with old friends, catch up, and feel <em>something</em>. She has agonizing conversations with her parents, reflects on embarrassing stories from her teenage years, and can’t handle her booze when she’s in the throes of depression. She’s also hilarious, and part of me feels that humor comes from a place of insecurity. You know those jokes about how depressed people use humor to deflect and mask their sentiments? Yeah, Mae embodies that fully. She’s the most true-to-life protagonist I’ve ever encountered, and that’s gone a long way to making her one of my favorite characters ever.</p><p>Despite how sullen the material of <em>Night in the Woods </em>may sound, it’s rarely ever so plainly dour. <em>Night in the Woods </em>is broken up into various days across Mae’s stay in Possum Springs, and every one of them is an excuse to walk around, jump on rooftops, and spiral. There are tons of tough and entertaining conversations to have with people along the game’s critical path, but there are so many more pockets of nostalgic joy and catharsis along the way too, particularly at the end of certain days where you must prioritize hanging out with one of Mae’s closest friends, like Gregg, Bea, Angus, or even that weirdo Germ who lives...somewhere. There’s Mr. Chazokov, one of Mae’s former teachers, who lets her stargaze on his rooftop and teaches Mae about the history and legends associated with the constellations. There are baby rats to be saved and pretzels to be stolen. There are <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/night-in-the-woods-rhythm-game-is-on-point-1792633078&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/night-in-the-woods-rhythm-game-is-on-point-1792633078">playable band practices</a></span> and a Halloween festival!</p><p>By the end of <em>Night in the Woods</em>, you will love the town of Possum Springs so much you’ll never want to leave. Maybe then you’ll also decorate your room with odds and ends lifted from the game, and consider etching it onto your own body, Iike I’m currently plotting to do. At the very least, it’ll live on your dashboard where you can consider returning to it whenever you need a dose of reality, a sprinkle of whimsy, a home away from home, or a reminder that it’s okay to not be okay. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-delivers-galaxys-underworld-far-better-than-solo-book-of-boba-fett<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Since we first visited a galaxy far, far away back in 1977, there have been a few glimpses at the universe’s dark underbelly – the “wretched hive of scum and villainy”. As early as A New Hope’s brief excursion to the Mos Eisley cantina for our first meeting with Han Solo, it was clear this was a galaxy filled with colourful characters who wouldn’t necessarily play by the rules. But while Star Wars projects like Solo and The Book of Boba Fett have spotlighted this infamous criminal underworld and its syndicates, it is only the franchise's latest video game that truly takes a deep, worthwhile dive into this murkier, darker corner of the universe. Star Wars Outlaws is filled with criminal enterprise, backstabbing, and syndicates vying for control, and does all this far more effectively than any other Star Wars movie or TV show to date. </p><p>Outlaws puts us in control of Kay Vess, a smuggler from Cantonica (the casino planet memorably explored in The Last Jedi.) From the game’s opening moments it is immediately obvious that this project is not overly tied into the wider plot of the Skywalker saga, telling a self-contained story with just the right amount of nods and cameos that service the story. It means Outlaws is free to dive deep into what makes Star Wars’ criminal underbelly tick.  </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Serving that goal is a reputation system that places importance on building relationships with the galaxy’s major syndicates on each of Outlaws’ five planets. On Kijimi, for example, Crimson Dawn is locked in a battle for control with the Ashiga Clan. Free to work for either of these syndicates, each job Kay chooses has a bearing on her standing with the group that hired her and, in turn, the people she turned down. Through this system we get a clear sense for which syndicate has the strongest presence on each planet and how Kay’s actions might help turn the tide. </p><p>The blend of existing planets like Kijimi, Catonica, and Tatooine, plus new planets like Toshara and Akiva, each have varying levels of urbanisation, Empire control, and syndicate activity, which all helps shows how the rise of the Rebel Alliance has left an opening for these criminal organisations to cash in on dwindling Imperial power. Even side activities like Sabbac, often played by shadowy sorts at secret underground tables, help flesh out the earthier side of the universe and show there is more to it than the lightsabers wielded by noble Jedi and dogfights performed by heroic pilots. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The rise of the Rebel Alliance has left an opening for these criminal organisations to cash in on dwindling Imperial power</p></div><p>Of course, such organisations aren’t new to Star Wars. Crime lord Jabba the Hutt was a major part of Return of the Jedi. The exploration of the Hutts' and their rival syndicates’ operations, though, had been much more superficial until Outlaws came along. George Lucas had once planned a TV series, Star Wars: Underworld, which would have explored the darker side of Coruscant, the galaxy’s capital, but the project failed to get off the ground. And so aside from the odd expanded universe novel, such as 1996’s Tales of the Bounty Hunters, it wasn’t until 2018’s Solo: A Star Wars Story that the franchise put criminals centre stage.</p><p>Unfortunately Solo scuppered a prime opportunity to explore a younger, rougher-around-the-edges Han Solo and his links to the underworld. Instead it was overly focused on box-ticking, showing us unnecessary formative moments like how Han met Chewbacca, Lando and got hold of the Millenium Falcon. The lightning-fast pace of Solo’s first half also meant there wasn’t a huge amount of time to dissect the state of the underworld during its timeline window between Episodes 3 and 4. While Han and Chewie do work with the Crimson Dawn syndicate as part of the story, we don’t find out much about the inner workings of its operation. A lot of the broader, potentially very interesting politics are instead relegated to simple asides, with Paul Bettany’s Dryden Vos – Crimson Dawn’s figurehead leader – only featuring in just a handful of scenes. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/12/solo-dryden-vos-1726135996615.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Solo: A Star Wars Story failed to properly explore Crimson Dawn and its leader, Dryden Vos.</figcaption></figure></output><p>A few years later The Book of Boba Fett, a seven-episode Disney+ TV series, presented a second opportunity for a live-action Star Wars project to really dive into the grit of the Star Wars universe. But, once again, while the show did explore the potentially interesting story of Boba Fett trying to inherit Jabba’s operations on Tatooine, it never quite came together in a way that delivered on its promise.  </p><p>Much of the opening half of the series was consumed by flashbacks, exploring what happened to Fett between his apparent death in Return of the Jedi and his return in The Mandalorian, rather than examining his place in the modern criminal underworld. What was set in the present came as a surprise to fans, who perhaps weren’t expecting so much of the show to focus on Fett’s relationship with the Tusken Raiders.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Boba Fett’s efforts to maintain power among the syndicates felt like a subplot in his own show.</p></div><p>When the show finally began to focus more on the politics of Tatooine’s power struggle, the attention oddly shifted to Din Djarin, filling in some of the gaps between seasons two and three of The Mandalorian. Losing almost two whole episodes to the lead from another show stifled the The Book of Boba Fett’s momentum and meant its focus was split. With cameos from Ahsoka Tano, Luke Skywalker and others, Boba Fett and Fennec Shand’s efforts to maintain power among the syndicates felt like a subplot in their own show. </p><p>Such a dismal result for Fett is only exacerbated by the fact that the fan-favourite bounty hunter was almost the star of his own crime movie, helmed by Logan director James Mangold. The project was “much more of a borderline R-rated, single planet spaghetti Western,” Mangold explained during an episode of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw22PXyXXd0&amp;ab_channel=JoshHorowitz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Happy Sad Confused podcast</a>. It’s a description that suggests a more interesting avenue than the one the show went down, one that may well have taken a deeper dive into Fett’s earlier years and time as a ruthless bounty hunter. Sadly the project was cancelled in the wake of Solo’s poor box office results. </p><p>With these multiple failed or disappointing TV shows and movies, it has been the job of Star Wars Outlaws to finally deliver on the galaxy’s darker, grimier underworld. Thankfully Outlaws takes concepts that have only been briefly explored in other live-action and animated projects and brings a fresh flavour to them, taking a far deeper dive into the universe’s more dubious characters and concepts. We get a proper feel for how the crime syndicates operate and the bearing each has for Kay and the central plot. It feels like a properly dangerous galaxy – a place where the wrong move could prove costly, and one without a single Jedi in sight to help. This feels like the Star Wars project we’ve been hoping for since Luke and Obi-Wan first set foot in the Mos Eisley cantina all those years ago. </p><p><em>Chris Connor is a coffee and whisky driven culture wordsmith, with work published at NME, Radio Times, Yahoo, and others. </em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/planet-coaster-2-channels-rollercoaster-tycoon-with-new-thrills<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>As someone who prefers high-adrenaline rollercoasters over the teacups, visiting amusement parks can be thrilling and Planet Coaster 2 understands this well. Building your own park in the original Planet Coaster remains entertaining eight years later, something Frontier Developments hopes to build upon with new water park rides, improved visuals, and better construction tools. I recently went hands-on with the PC version, and I'm confident the upcoming sequel will be worth the admission.</p><p>Anyone familiar with Planet Coaster or Planet Zoo will feel right at home, and your goal remains drawing in visitors to earn as much money as possible. This preview showcased two of the three upcoming modes - Sandbox Mode offers a pleasing level of freedom with unlimited cash for flat rides, rollercoasters, and more, while Career Mode feels designed as a gradual introduction to these gameplay mechanics. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Planet Coaster 2 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Starting with the Career Mode's third chapter, what follows is the type of strangely enjoyable challenge you'd only ever find in fiction. A rival theme park builder has bought land within your park and imposed unusual construction restrictions, which forces you to find creative workarounds. Career Mode uses a ranking system that swaps the original Planet Coaster's star rankings for up to four medals, and clearing the initial 'Bronze' challenges is unsurprisingly easy. </p><p>This mission highlights the new water attractions well, which offer more excitement than the original game's log flumes. You can now set down pools and water slides wherever you like, adding some welcome variety. Slides always require a landing pool underneath them, or you can create a separate large pool for guests to use at their leisure. Just make sure you have enough lifeguards on duty. Surrounding them with lovely scenery increases a ride's prestige rating, though it's a slightly shallow approach as you can dump anything around those rides without consistent theming.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>As someone who struggles with creating interesting custom creations, using pre-designed rides via the blueprints system over making your own is undoubtedly helpful. However, some noticeably fiddly gameplay mechanics hamper this. Connecting your theme park guests to each ride requires laying down paths, yet they don't always connect despite stopping right in front of a ride or theme park entrance. It's slightly frustrating as I can't tell what I'm doing wrong in these moments. Thankfully, new paving methods like drawing and stamping tools make the wider process more convenient.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Creating a park and letting things run isn't enough; you need staff and facilities, but wages and construction come at a cost. </p></div><p>Powering up rides needs a delicate balance as placing generators too close to an attraction can reduce the prestige, but placing them further away means the mechanic needs longer to reach them. Creating a park and letting things run isn't enough; you need staff and facilities, but wages and construction come at a cost. Still, rising to the challenge can feel rewarding, even if effectively spaced land development is not my specialty. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Watching these rides in action shows how closely the team paid attention to real-life rollercoaster designs, and that's particularly clear from the first-person camera. Instead of just watching from above like some omnipotent adrenaline-fuelled deity, you can swap perspectives and witness a ride unfold in either testing or while it's actively open. That's nothing new for the sequel, but seeing these rides in action has me itching to book Thorpe Park and Alton Towers tickets. How much care Frontier is giving Planet Coaster 2 is immediately clear. </p><p>I also enjoy how you can customize rollercoaster trains with additional designs, such as light bars on the side. Duplicating these across the entire set of trains at once is also helpful, keeping designs consistent while removing any potential tedium doing that for every individual cart would involve. An option to create custom trains and original mascots would be nice, though the existing choices on both aspects are still great.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Though Planet Coaster 2 doesn't completely flip the script, evolutionary gameplay changes and visual upgrades mean building your theme park feels better than ever. I hope Frontier will address my more minor frustrations, yet this hands-on session shows the potential of the upcoming amusement park sim. I'll be keen to check out more when Planet Coaster 2 launches on November 6 for PC, Xbox Series X/S, and PS5.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Each user will have their own save files and Steam achievements. However, in order to play the same game together, multiple users on the Steam Family will need a copy. Once two copies of the same game are accessible via the shared accounts, any two members of the Steam Family will be able to play.</p><p dir="ltr">Those looking to create a Steam Family will want to put some thought into it. While it is possible to leave a Steam family once you've joined, doing so comes with a one-year wait time before you are able to join another Steam Family, as well as a one-year wait before that slot in the Steam Family you left can be filled. The owner of the Steam Family can also kick out unwanted family members. If someone playing a game on your account gets banned, the owner of the game will be banned as well, so make sure everyone in your Steam Family is playing nice.</p><p dir="ltr">The new and improved Steam Families also comes with a plethora of Parental Control features, allowing parents to block off access to specific games, restrict certain content, set playtime limits, approve or deny requests from child accounts, and easily approve game purchases requested by child members.</p><p dir="ltr">To set up a Steam Family, find your Account Details on Steam, then click on the Family Management section. From there you can "Create a Family," invite members, and choose whether added members will be Adult or Child accounts. Invited users will then need to accept the Steam Family invitation to join.</p><p dir="ltr">Valve notes that not all games will support Family Sharing, as developers can opt out of the program. Some games, like those that require subscriptions, can't be shared between accounts.</p><p dir="ltr">"We want as many games as possible to be accessible via Family Sharing, but we realize some games might have special cases where this feature isn't feasible or doesn't give users a good experience," Valve writes in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110?emclan=103582791457287600&amp;emgid=4605582245626919823" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>. "Developers who have these concerns can reach out to us via the partner support page to get help with options and solutions."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/jackbox-naughty-pack-review-spicier-but-not-too-crass<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Another year and another <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="b0f7b9d1-a12c-4c8c-835f-34ef4ff66814" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/jackbox-party-pack-10-review-decade-of-brilliance"><em>Jackbox Party Pack</em></a>. This one, <em>The Jackbox Naughty Pack</em>, is a collection of three games specifically designed with an M-rating in mind. This means more crass jokes and more explicit sexual humor. How much does an M-rating really contribute to the tone of a game that is already filled with free-form comedy?</p>
<p><em>The Jackbox Naughty Pack</em> comes with three games, as opposed to the standard five games of a Party Pack. Two games are new editions of previously available titles, <em>Fakin' It All Night Long</em> and <em>Dirty Drawful</em>, and one game is a wholly new addition to the <em>Jackbox </em>stable of games, <em>Let Me Finish</em>.</p>
<p>Each game is intended for 3-8 players (though I don't think I'd ever recommend playing with three) and features using a browser-enabled device (Mobile phone, tablet, laptop, etc) as the controller letting you select prompts, draw silly images, and type in responses.</p>

So much of what makes these games enjoyable is the freedom of having your own screen.</p>
<h2><em>Fakin' It All Night Long</em></h2>
<p><em>Fakin' It All Night Long</em> is a social deduction game where you need to discover who among you is the Faker. Players are given tasks to complete, this might be to raise a number of fingers or point to a specific player, while the Faker is given a slightly different prompt or no prompt at all.</p>
<p>Players might be told to raise as many fingers as they need to unhook a bra, and if you look out across the room and see someone holding up a single finger it might seem suspicious. If the prompt is "Hold up as many fingers as the number of guaranteed booty calls in your phone" and a monogamous couple has a member hold up four fingers eyebrows may raise.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fakin-it-all-night-long-bush-is-back.jpg?itok=zAQzT9gh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fakin-it-all-night-long-bush-is-back.jpg?itok=y_X2vlg2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>How many fingers would you raise?</figcaption></figure><p>The aspect of <em>Fakin' It All Night Long, </em>as well as the original <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="2b4ae760-8c82-49a2-82d4-196d2e479e53" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/jackbox-party-pack-3-review-would-you-like-to-play-game"><em>Fakin' It,</em></a> that makes them my favorite series is that this is a <em>Jackbox </em>game where the game facilitates interactions with one another, and it's not just players all watching what's happening on the screen. The game facilitates prompts and conversations with the players but doesn't get in the way of itself.</p>
<p>A new gameplay mode has been added as one of the sub-categories of games. In this mode, you'll be given a prompt and you'll get to respond with a single emoji. A prompt like "What are you most afraid of" might elicit emoji of skulls to represent death, spiders, or other fears, but if someone posts a raccoon emoji then they might just be your Faker. This is a fun mode, created as internet games like recognizing TV shows and movies based on emoji flood social media.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fakin-it-all-night-emojis.jpg?itok=VlDYHelx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fakin-it-all-night-emojis.jpg?itok=EARpWZ75 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Playing a few rounds of this led to my group learning a lot about each other, for better or worse, and led to some rolling laughter when one person was so obviously the faker with how their responses didn't align with their personalities.</p>
<p>Compared to the original Fakin' It the major difference is just that the topics used end up being that much more personal. You'll definitely learn a lot about people with this game, make sure it's a closer group of friends that you decide to play this with.</p>
<h2><em>Dirty Drawful</em></h2>
<p><em>Dirty Drawful</em> is the least changed of the games in the <em>Jackbox Naughty Pack</em>. It's just like the <em>Drawful </em>you know but now there will be more mature prompts. Some of the prompts I saw across my early games were "Loose Pill Pinata", "Butter Knifed My Damn Dong Off", "European Peen Contemplates Life", or "Baby Working The Mines."</p>

<p>Players get prompted to draw one of these insane ideas, and then others will guess what they are. At the end, all of the fake prompts and the real prompt will get shuffled together and every player needs to guess which one they believe is correct.</p>
<p>The biggest effect that these wilder prompts had on the game was that when a player posted something truly unhinged as one of their guesses there was less reason to doubt it was incorrect. In a normal game of <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="2220d1a6-c9b6-454f-96bb-292cc7ace7d4" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/drawful-2-review-you-dont-know-pablo"><em>Drawful </em></a>you can rule out anything that references genitals or lewd puns but you just can't do that here.</p>
<p>This is an easier game to share with friends who might enjoy sharing off-color jokes, but that you don't want to learn much more about them directly.</p>
<h2><em>Let Me Finish</em></h2>
<p><em>Let Me Finish</em> is the new game in the pack, where players are presented with a stock image and are asked to indicate something on it. You could be shown a series of screwdrivers and asked which one likes to be called daddy?</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/let-me-finish-house-public-hair.jpg?itok=--TtKHYE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/let-me-finish-house-public-hair.jpg?itok=KHDLLUuW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>While every player submits their feedback on the image and prompt it's two players that go head to head presenting their response. Players will have a set amount of time to make a case for their argument, here's where people can let their presentation skills and improv chops fly as they try to convince the other players.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In my conversation with <em>Let Me Finish</em> director Warren Arnold he actually shared that this game was originally called Where's the Butt? after the initial pitch was given of an image of a mailbox with the caption 'Where's the Butt?' prompting wildly different responses from those in the room.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once everyone has presented players will then vote on the best response. At this time other players can even jump in to tell the two players who presented, and whoever else might be around why they're wrong. I enjoyed this feature, but I could also definitely see a scenario where you're playing with someone who always wants their own thoughts heard might abuse it.</p>
<p><em>Let Me Finish</em> does an amazing job highlighting just how differently our minds all function. When presented with the exact same stimulus and criteria the places that we all go in our minds as humans is incredibly different.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/let-me-finish-appliance.jpg?itok=S2ZUV6rT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/let-me-finish-appliance.jpg?itok=e4GUNsm_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>With the aspect of presentation, a lot of the core humor was definitely reliant on those presenting, and how willing everyone was to die on the hill that they had made for themselves. If players are shy, or aren't likely to speak up for their own silly opinion then it might be a bit harder to get this game off the ground.</p>
<h2><em>Jackbox Naughty Pack</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>I was cautious going into this wondering just how well an R-Rated <em>Party Pack</em> would be but with the direct influence of spicier prompts leading to spicier jokes, and the indirect influence of crazier player responses fitting into the theme it's unmistakable that Jackbox Games has absolutely stuck the landing.</p>
<p><em>Fakin' It All Night Long</em> continues to be an incredible way to play a deduction party game against your friends where everyone gets to be a part of the action. <em>Dirty Drawful</em> creates a creative outlet for players to not only draw unhinged creations but also respond to them. <em>Let Me Finish</em> gives players a platform to offer their unrequested opinions on silly ideas and have a way to let out some antagonism in the spirit of good fun.</p>
<p>This might not be the <em>Party Pack</em> to play with your family at <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="f0e3124d-2375-4674-91c2-64f67638d635" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/best-new-board-games-to-play-with-family-this-thanksgiving">Thanksgiving</a>, but it's definitely one to share with your group chat.</p>

These new instanced scenarios, known as Delves, can be quite lucrative if you know how they function and where to look for the best loot after completion. With the help of a seasonal NPC, we can take on several scenarios that give us loot at the end of each Delve, and the end of the week, just as with Raids, Mythic dungeons, and PvP.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197209" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Boys Star Karen Fukuhara On Kimiko’s Character Arc, Karate, And More" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="319" data-playlist="197209,196923,196922" data-current="197209"><div><p>The Boys Star Karen Fukuhara On Kimiko’s Character Arc, Karate, And More</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197209/197209_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197209/197209_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197209/197209_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197209/197209_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22759.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>There are many moving parts to Delves and how they function, so let’s take a look at all you need to know to score big items each week.</p><h2 id="h4730"><a id=""></a><strong>How Delves Work in World of Warcraft</strong></h2><p>Delves function in a similar way to Mythics dungeons—the scenarios are static and do not change by the week, but there can be variations in the hazards that are seen as the underground dwellings are traversed. The objectives, bonuses, and bosses can also switch up on a dime, so we may not always have to run the Delve the same way each time to bag bonus rewards.</p><p>During the Main Story quest line, you’re introduced to Delves and run your first one in the Isle of Dorn. This main quest line shows you the ropes, teaches you how to make your NPC stronger or swap their role, and gives you the nitty gritty on what to expect as you make your way through the other Delves all around the map. There are also Delve Tiers, unlocked once your character has reached level 80.</p><p>One thing worth noting is that there are 11 Tiers total, but you will not have access to tier four or higher Delves until you have reached level 80, have a 548 item-level piece of armor in every slot, and complete the entire Campaign for <em>The War Within. </em>To unlock Tiers higher than four, you will need to complete the previous Tier in its entirety—completing Tier four opens up Tier five, completing Tier five opens up Tier six, etc.</p><h2 id="h4731"><a id=""></a><strong>Delve Rewards And The Great Vault</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="c218a39e5e871176d0e00155bac8b8c7" data-recommend-id="image://c218a39e5e871176d0e00155bac8b8c7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Meeting with a Delve Guide." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Meeting with a Delve Guide." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blizzard / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c218a39e5e871176d0e00155bac8b8c7" data-recommend-id="image://c218a39e5e871176d0e00155bac8b8c7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Meeting with a Delve Guide." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Delves are a great way to score some hefty loot solo, but of course also works well with a party if you would rather bring a few friends. Some rewards can only be earned via achievements by completing multiple Delves, including the mounts Delver’s Dirigible and  the Ivory Goliathus. At the end of each Delve, you will come upon a Treasure room that has trunks containing gear specifically for your class and level, as well as quest items, Resonance Crystals, Undercoins, cosmetics, Companion Upgrades, and more.</p><p>The higher Tier the Delve, the better rewards you can get your hands on, but Tier 11 is just there to boast about to your friends and gain achievements from. There’s also a weekly World Event known as the Delves Bonus Event, that gives better rewards for completing Delves that week.</p><p>As for the Great Vault, <em>The War Within </em>replaces the PvP line in the vault with the World option. Just as with Mythics or Raids, you will need to complete three, six, or 12 Delves to unlock all of the available loot within the Great Vault. The quality and Item Level of the gear within the Great Vault will depend on the difficulty of the Delves completed.</p><p>Delves are a great way to bolster your loot intake in <em>The War Within</em>, and completing weekly events and unlocking slots in the Great Vault can get you some gear equivalent to Heroic Raid gear and Mythic 15+ quality.</p><hr><p>For more information on what’s new in <em>The War Within</em>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/world-of-warcraft-war-within-hero-talents-guide-1851645954&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/world-of-warcraft-war-within-hero-talents-guide-1851645954">check out our guide to the new Talent Tree</a></span>, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/world-of-warcraft-the-war-within-warband-system-guide-1851631239&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/world-of-warcraft-the-war-within-warband-system-guide-1851631239">the Warband System</a></span> to see how you can trade your newly acquired gear to Alt characters to make even more progress!<br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Given the significance of the UK in gaming development it is surprising how rare games set here are. Even those that do exist tend to be either quaint backdrops like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2015/08/12/everybodys-gone-to-the-rapture-review/">Everybody’s Gone to the Rapture</a> or ‘ye olde’ period pieces like Chivalry. Hollowbody breaks this trend by being set in a future dystopian version of an abandoned British city; taking this uncannily familiar location and using it to produce a love letter to classic survival horror. The resulting title is up there with the very best of indie survival horror games and feels like a lost classic from the PS2 era.</p>
<p><iframe title="Hollowbody  - Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M9vRLnwYO14?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>I’ve been following the development of Hollowbody for a couple of years and developer Headware Games has done a great job in chronicling the process of indie game production through their social media presence. I get a real kick out of this kind of information and seeing a game develop from early prototype through pre-release demos and finally the finished build is always a joy. From the very beginning Hollowbody has had a clear vision and a distinctive aesthetic and this has ensured that the final game is successful, both as its own thing and as homage to past greats.</p>


<p>The futuristic setting of Hollowbody feels like a banal Blade Runner – Edge Jogger, maybe? – complete with flying cars and neon skies. Everything feels like the future except, of course, for the exclusion zone, the site of a mysterious outbreak that left a twenty mile area sealed off for the wider population’s protection. The only people to venture into the exclusion area are never heard from again. Until, that is, your partner Sasha heads in to find out what happened and you have to go in to find her. The background takes in equal parts Resident Evil, Contagion, and Escape from New York and immediately established a clear narrative and emotional reason for Mica risking her life and I appreciated the generally understated but drip-fed nature of the story-telling here. No lengthy expositions or overloading but instead notes and uncanny radio interference combine to offer suggestions but not solutions as to what happened.</p>


<p>Visually, Hollowbody is superb. The PS2 era design looks fantastic, especially as you can up the resolution if you wish to achieve the kind of result that is normally only possible when upscaling PS2 titles via emulation. The world-building is similarly great and the early environments you explore felt eerily familiar but with a dark and deadly twist. Sound design is also a highpoint here as the atmospheric audio ensures that you are always on edge and occasional stabs of music at key events jar you into action. The full voice acting is totally off brand with the genre classics though, as it is actually excellent throughout and often gives a real emotional hit.</p>
<p>Streamlining the classic survival horror form, Hollowbody retains the mechanics and feel of the genre, but finetunes some aspects to avoid the usual frustration points. Rather than the limited inventory that is so ubiquitous in the genre (and which affected <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/11/04/signalis-review/">Signalis</a> to such a degree) here you can pick up everything you need and carry it with you. That being said, there is less to collect than in other games as the focus is on exploration and occasional puzzles, rather than overly intricate escape rooms.</p>

<p>Juggling weaponry is less of an issue than normal as you can equip one melee weapon and one firearm and can switch between them through shortcuts similar to those found in third person action combat games. Early on you’ll rely on a pistol and a plank with nails in it, but more powerful weapons are scattered around for you to find. In fact, some firearms are hinted at in the achievements but I didn’t find them in my first playthrough, suggesting areas I missed.</p>
<p>The opening stages of the game take place in the tower block that was featured in the demos, and I initially thought the whole game would involve making my way up to its heights. Fortunately the range of environments is much greater than this. You’ll find yourself exploring the residential areas more generally, a churchyard, and underground areas before you reach the end of the game.</p>

<p>One area with less variety, however, is the enemies you face. Whilst there are the stalwarts of lumbering zombies, horrifying dogs, and the occasional larger foe, the focus is clearly less on these than the narrative and world-building. Combat itself is solid and there is the expected risk and reward in terms of taking on foes or evading them whilst managing limited ammo. Indeed there are very few unavoidable enemies throughout, with only a few set piece moments forcing you to fight.</p>
<p>Puzzles are well designed, but not as constant as in some titles in the genre. The tower block in particular had quite a lot of rooms that had no gameplay purpose, but did add to the feel of dread and tragedy that pervades the game. One general tip for new players is to make sure that you examine and read the descriptions of items in your inventory as an early puzzle took me far too long to solve, as I hadn’t made the lateral connection to an item I was carrying all along. I would also recommend having a paper and pen on hand as there are a couple of moments where you need to collect information, and it is generally useful to make a note of puzzles you haven’t yet solved.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nightingale-realms-rebuilt-update-out-now-new-gameplay-trailer-revealed/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Inflexion Games released a new game overview trailer showcasing the Nightingale: Realms Rebuilt update for the gaslamp-fantasy PVE survival-crafting game. So far, Realms Rebuilt is the biggest update for Nightingale since its release in February 2024. Although the "all reviews" section for the game is tagged as Mixed, recent reviews are Mostly Positive, suggesting good things for those who have begun experimenting with the Realms Rebuilt update.</p>
<p><iframe title="Nightingale: Realms Rebuilt Update 0.5 - Gameplay Overview" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-k91qf7lSEU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Nightingale: Realms Rebuilt update adds a new handcrafted campaign that sends players exploring gravity-torn deserts, corrupted forests and much more, as well as overhauling the crafting and progression system after listening to player feedback. To add more excitement to the game, new dungeons and boss battles have been added, as well as new weapons for players to experiment with and new challenges to overcome.</p>
<p>With the release of this update, Nightingale is currently 40% off on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1928980/Nightingale/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> and the Epic Games Store. The game is still in Early Access on PC, suggesting there is plenty more to come to make Nightingale a fully-fledged product.</p>
<p>"The Realms Rebuilt update is the culmination of all the invaluable feedback we've received from the community over the last several months of Early Access," says Aaryn Flynn, CEO of <a href="https://wccftech.com/nightingale-director-isnt-worried-about-saturation-survival-is-having-a-moment-and-its-great-for-everyone/">Inflexion Games.</a> "We hope that it feels like a whole new Nightingale journey, improved and more immersive, whilst retaining the core elements that the community loves about adventuring through the realms."</p>
<p>To give the game more substance, the Nightingale: Realms Rebuilt update includes a new parametric crafting system so that players can maximize the potential of their equipment, new dungeons and bosses so that players can test and experiment with their Realmwalker skills, as well as an expansive campaign. As explained above, the campaign takes players on a journey to reignite the Crossways to try and unlock the path back to humanity.</p>
<p>For those who haven't seen this game, Nightingale is a PvE survival-crafting game where players have to discover, explore and survive in the Faewilds while working to overcome peculiar challenges set in a Victorian gaslamp fantasy world. The game allows players to play the game solo or team up with friends, allowing for a composition of up to five people. To explore new Realms, players will have to craft Realm Cards, as well as build their own estates to be able to survive in the aggressive world of Nightingale: Realms Rebuilt.</p>

That’s because in the late hours of the night, with a few drinks in everybody, there isn’t anything quite as fun as gathering around the TV and cracking stupid jokes facilitated via the series’ hilarious collection of minigames. Much of that comes down to the <em>Jackbox Party Pack</em>’s ease of use.</p><p>For the uninitiated, <em>Jackbox </em>utilizes the most common device in existence today—our phones. While one person is required to own each pack on a console or PC, which is how you host games, the other players connect and play through their phones. It’s remarkably simple, and makes the mess of collecting enough controllers for a game of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/super-mario-party-the-kotaku-review-1829480351&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/super-mario-party-the-kotaku-review-1829480351"><em>Mario Party</em></a></span> or a match of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/halo-infinite-the-kotaku-review-1848159022&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/halo-infinite-the-kotaku-review-1848159022"><em>Halo</em></a></span><em> </em>a non-issue. The time between someone suggesting that we start a game of <em>Jackbox </em>and actually playing a game is miniscule. And the variety of games on offer means that you never get bored.</p><p>With the release of the <em>Naughty Pack</em>, there are now 11 collections of minigames available for <em>Jackbox</em>. What each minigame has in common is the use of player input, by which I mean that they all revolve around players typing in words, drawing cartoons, or voting in polls to decide the winner. Because of this, every round of a given game is unique, playing up the inside jokes and particular interests of the people playing. For example, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/fibbage&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/fibbage"><em>Fibbage</em></a></span>—perhaps the quintessential <em>Jackbox </em>game—lets every player input a fake answer to a trivia prompt in the hopes of fooling their opponents. And sure, playing it that way can be fun, but it’s more fun to just turn these prompts into big jokes and vote on what is funniest. Playing to the group gets even more fun in <em>Fibbage: Enough About You</em>, which explicitly turns the game into a joke about the people playing.</p><p>If all of that sounds like the perfect recipe for a great party night you’d be right, and you’d be a fool to miss out on the current Steam sale, which ends on September 19. Every party pack is discounted, with some up to fifty percent off. If you just want to buy the whole package, it can be yours for $116.92, which might sound like a lot but is much lower than the usual $279.90 price tag. Trust me, it’s worth it for the hours of fun you and your friends will have. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> PS5 Pro Everything To Know</p>
      </div>
<p>The people who may be interested in purchasing a PS5 Pro are those who feel they "must have the latest and greatest PlayStation tech." Everyone knows someone who always buys the newest iPhone, after all. As Piscatella reminded us, plenty of people paid $1000+ for a base PS5 model in 2020 when the system came out through third-party sites due to shortages.</p><p>"And, according to Circana's Checkout service, PlayStation 5 already attracts the highest percentage of high-income household purchasers than other console platforms in the US," Piscatella said. "49% of PS5 hardware US buyers in the three-month period ending July 2024 had household incomes over $100k per year, as compared to 43% of Xbox Series buyers and 40% of Switch buyers."</p><p>Piscatella admitted the PS5 Pro price at $700 (and that's before tax and add-ons, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/where-to-buy-a-disc-drive-for-ps5-pro/1100-6526391/" data-ref-id="1100-6526391">like the $80 disc-drive</a>) is "expensive," but, again, it's not aimed at the everyday PlayStation player.</p><p>The analyst didn't have a firm prediction for the number of units the PS5 Pro could sell at launch, noting it would depend in part on the number of units available. That being said, Piscatella said he believes the PS5 Pro could make up 15%-20% of total PS5 consoles sold in the first two months after launch. That percentage should go down in the months after, he said.</p><p>Looking back at the PS4 Pro, Piscatella said the console made up about 13% of total lifetime PS4 unit sales and about 15% of lifetime PS4 dollar sales.</p><p>"I'm estimating PS5 Pro to finish the generation somewhere between 9-15% of total lifetime PS5 units, with a slightly higher percentage in dollars because of its higher price," he said.</p><p>$700 is a lot of money--there is no denying that, so Piscatella said he understands the "mixed" reaction online about the price tag in particular. But he pointed out that the reality of the video game market today demonstrates that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-could-prompt-a-shift-to-more-expensive-games/1100-6526121/" data-ref-id="1100-6526121">people will pay more</a>.</p><p>"The console market is stratifying in many ways. Some games have $249 Collector's Editions, games often offer a few days of early access so long as someone is willing to pay $99.99+ for that game. Premium gamepads and headsets are offered at premium price points... The list goes on," he said.</p><p>There was a time when only one version of a game, one version of a controller, or one version of a console existed--but those days are gone. "Companies are trying to maximize the dollars they can generate from both price-sensitive and price-insensitive consumers. This has been a bit of a painful transition for many console fans. I get it, but it's where we're at, and this trend is not going to slow anytime soon," Piscatella said.</p><p>Piscatella's commentary largely matches up with what Piers Harding-Rolls of Ampere Analysis said earlier this week in an <a href="https://www.ampereanalysis.com/insight/ps5-pro-sony-pulls-its-pro-strategy-lever-to-engage-playstation-enthusiasts" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">open letter.</a> He wrote that the PS5 Pro is aiming at the "enthusiast" audience, along with people who have yet to buy a PS5 at all and want to get the latest and best model.</p><p>Harding-Rolls, too, said he understands the "commentary" surrounding the PS5 Pro's hefty price tag, which is larger than the price gap between the PS4 and PS4 Pro when that system debuted in 2016.</p><p>"PS5 Pro pricing reflects Sony’s adjusted strategy to protect its margin, general supply chain inflation and a lack of direct competitor to its mid-cycle upgrade compared to last generation (where Microsoft was preparing the Xbox One X)," Harding-Rolls said. "The lack of competition means it is an easier decision for Sony to run with a higher price point to protect its existing margins. For most prospective PS5 consumers, the standard edition will represent the value sweet spot."</p><p>Harding-Rolls also talked about how he expects the launch of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">Grand Theft Auto VI in 2025</a> to "drive a wave of upgrades," with a portion of the audience eyeing the PS5 Pro to play the long-awaited Rockstar title. The analyst also went on record in forecasting PS5 Pro sales of 1.3 million units during the launch window, which is less than the 1.7 million PS4 Pro consoles sold at launch in 2016.</p><p>By 2029, the PS5 Pro could sell around 13 million units, Harding-Rolls, and this would put it in line with the <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/hard_soft/index.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Wii U, which achieved that many consoles sold during its lifetime.</a></p><p>In addition to announcing the $700 PS5 Pro, Sony this week <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-controllers-are-now-more-expensive/1100-6526346/" data-ref-id="1100-6526346">raised the price of DualSense controllers by $5.</a></p><p>This news came after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-hardware-sales-are-on-the-decline-but-sony-is-still-looking-healthy/1100-6525590/" data-ref-id="1100-6525590">Sony revealed that PS5 hardware sales were down</a> about 27% year over year for the company's first quarter of fiscal year 2024--April 1 to June 30. Historically, console prices drop over time due to the component costs coming down, but due to the pandemic and other factors, that isn't the case this time around. As mentioned above, PS5 console prices have gone up in Japan and other parts of the world, but not the US. Sony has said its price increases are <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2022/08/25/ps5-price-to-increase-in-select-markets-due-to-global-economic-environment-including-high-inflation-rates/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">related to global economic conditions</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">For its part, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-series-x-consoles-and-xbox-game-pass-subscriptions-are-getting-a-price-increase/1100-6515385/" data-ref-id="1100-6515385">Microsoft has also raised Xbox and Game Pass prices</a>, leaving <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-wont-raise-switch-prices-despite-growing-costs/1100-6506564/" data-ref-id="1100-6506564">Nintendo as the only one of the big three console manufacturers to keep prices steady this generation</a>.</p><p>For more on the PS5 Pro, be sure to check out GameSpot's rundown of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-ps5-pro-enhanced-game/2900-5758/" data-ref-id="2900-5758">all the PS5 Pro-enhanced games so far.</a> The system launches on November 7. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-preorder-guide-price-release-date-amazon-best-buy-walmart/1100-6526406/" data-ref-id="1100-6526406">Preorders for the PS5 Pro open</a> on September 26.</p>

As a discipline, UX ensures that we keep our players at the center of our processes and solutions. We are here to help the team design the whole player experience, which includes—but is not limited to—UIs. This means that we have to approach the game from a holistic perspective, including a wide range of different disciplines in our work.</span></p><p>Image via Paradox Interactive.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Crusader Kings III </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">is a grand strategy game set in the Middle Ages, released in September 2020 and developed by Paradox Development Studio. Unlike many grand strategy games, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Crusader Kings III</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is character-driven, with most game interactions filtered through the lens of a specific character. The game is also succession-based; the character you play as will typically have an heir, who you will play as after your demise. It's a grand strategy game in which you're free to set your own goals, with a world seen through a dynastic lens as opposed to a national one.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">By now, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Crusader Kings III</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is approaching its fourth birthday, a fact plainly visible by the presence of all the additional content that's been released since its launch. With this wealth of additional content adding complexity to the game, it's important for us to ensure that our players can understand how to use the systems we introduce. This isn't something we do by making our game mechanics simpler or easier, but by clearly communicating to the player how they can interact with various aspects of the game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A whole lot of things can happen in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Crusader Kings III</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. This is one of the strengths of the game, but it also creates a whole host of edge cases that can be tricky to deal with. There's only so much control we can exert over the game once we set things in motion, and we want the introduction to the game to feel as genuine as possible, even if we're easing the player into things. For instance, what happens if the player character dies of pneumonia while you were trying to teach them about how they can recover from illnesses?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Once we unpause the game, anything can happen. Because of this, it'd be impossible to try to map out a decision tree of carefully structured tutorial prompts. Instead, we have to approach the game as an open-ended sandbox. We can try to guide the players, but ultimately they're the ones making the decisions, and we have to respect that. Besides, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Crusader Kings III</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is at its best when unexpected things happen.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This article will dive deep into the recent changes to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Crusader Kings III'</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">s main tutorial. What motivated us to try it out, why now, and how did we do it?</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Why make another tutorial?">Why make another tutorial?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As a studio, we always aim to make our players want to play and enjoy the game more, which is a metric we measure through the number of monthly active users our game has. While expanding and updating the game can help us achieve this goal, it has also led to us introducing a number of new mechanics that aren't covered by the in-game tutorial. The telemetry data we gather shows that the tutorial has a significant impact on the retention rates of our players, despite the fact that it doesn't cover all the mechanics you'll need to know to succeed. All of this, coupled with a number of small pet peeves the UX department had with the tutorial as a whole, meant it was a good candidate for an experiment.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Instead of spending a large amount of time ideating and iterating on a perfect new tutorial, we thought a better approach would be to try an experiment in the form of a quicker, more concise tutorial. This way, we can gather data and feedback, which can help us better understand what kind of tutorialization works for our game. The hope is that this kind of initiative will help us understand how best to teach our players about new mechanics in upcoming releases. If the experiment turns out to be a success, that also means we've improved the gameplay experience for our new players, which is a nice added bonus.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While the idea had been brewing for some time, an initiative from our game director and the marketing department focused on new player acquisition: </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/crusader-kings-iii/legends-of-crusader-kings-iii">"Legends of Crusader Kings III</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">", seemed like an excellent opportunity to try it.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="New player experience">New player experience</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Speaking of which, what </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>is </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">the new player experience in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Crusader Kings III</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> like? This is quite the multilayered question, seeing as players come into the game with a variety of experiences. Have they played Paradox games before? Are they completely new to grand strategy games? Generally speaking, it's very easy to get overwhelmed when you start the game for the first time. This is something that we've been aware of for some time and also an aspect we thought we could at least attempt to mitigate through the introduction of a new tutorial.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A key principle that we can utilize here is the idea of progressive disclosure. This is a fairly straightforward concept in interaction design, which posits that one way to make users feel like a complex interaction is easy to interact with is by adding complexity bit by bit. Progressively, if you will. This is something we can introduce into a tutorial by, for instance, only showing parts of the interface when you're first starting out.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The process">The process</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Starting out, it's important to understand what it is we're trying to solve. What are the tutorial's core problems? Why are they problems to begin with? How have we, or other designers, tried to solve these problems in the past? These are the fundamental questions that we try to answer in this phase of the design process.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's important for us to not only tackle these questions through quantitative means, but also qualitatively. The data we gather through telemetry helps us understand where we should focus our efforts, but it's not a crystal ball we can peer into to divine the perfect solution to any problem. In order to deliver a satisfying solution to a problem we discover, we need to consider not only our players but also the greater context in which the problem exists.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A key part of this is analyzing the strengths of tutorials in games in similar spaces to ours. A common theme we discovered in titles such as </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Civilization VI</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Against the Storm</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was the utilization of a narrative to frame the tutorialization. Another source of inspiration that helped us solidify the idea of progressive disclosure was the completely text-based game </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Silent Heaven</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Because design is a highly iterative process, understanding what our peers do well is an important aspect of the problem-solving process.</span></p><p>Tutorials in other games. Image via Paradox Interactive.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">After taking a look at some other games, it was time for some introspection. What does the current, longer tutorial do well? What does it do less well? One part of understanding this came from telemetry data, which we used to measure the impact of the tutorial on new players. Broadly speaking, we found that telemetry data indicated that finishing the tutorial wasn't a major determining factor in whether or not a player decided to keep playing. While this doesn't tell us the whole story, it does indicate that something about the tutorial was lacking.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A particularly intimidating aspect of the tutorial, especially from the perspective of a new player, is its length and information density. It takes a long time to complete, and it presents the player with a lot of information, not all of which is immediately useful. All the tutorial textboxes featured in the full tutorial can be seen in the image below. In total, the full tutorial presents the player with 67 sequential boxes full of explanatory information.</span></p><p>Comparison between old (left) and new (right) tutorial steps. Image via Paradox Interactive. </p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Not only does this take a long time to process and understand, but much of it is also superfluous since many of our players turn to video tutorials or other online resources to better understand the game once they've started playing. This led us to look for a way to craft an introductory experience that respects their time while still introducing them to the complex mechanics that we know our players love.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Once we had a burgeoning understanding of the problem we were trying to solve, it was time to start exploring possible solutions. This started with a few initial whiteboard sessions with relevant stakeholders from various disciplines, allowing us to explore a variety of ideas and possible flows that a new tutorial could follow. Something that was agreed upon fairly quickly was that the new tutorial should be faster to complete than the old one.</span></p><p>Whiteboarding Session. Image via Paradox Interactive.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To figure out what the new, shorter tutorial should contain, we turned to the preexisting one. We wanted to extract all the important parts of it and compress them into something more digestible. The first step of this was to figure out what didn't feel strictly necessary to communicate to the player right away, and remove it. After doing this, we were left with roughly one-third of the 67 messages mentioned prior. These needed rewriting and reformatting to be properly implemented into the game, but they served as a baseline that we could continue to build upon.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While it would have been beneficial to explore other options, there simply wasn't enough time for it. Because of this, we decided to evaluate the proposed flow to get some sense of whether or not it was something that was worth moving forward with. We met with other disciplines to gather initial feedback, leading to further iteration and changes to the tutorial flow itself. Code-wise, this meant cutting the parts of the proposed tutorial that would be a lot of effort to implement without providing much in terms of actual player value, while QA and game design provided us with insights into what we should focus on communicating to the player.</span></p><p>Tutorial Flow. Image via Paradox Interactive.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The time constraints meant we had to carefully consider what kind of prototyping approach to utilize for the project. Ultimately, we settled on using the game itself as the prototyping toolbox. This approach has two primary pros, namely that it minimizes the time it takes to move from prototype to implementation, and that it closely mimics the actual gameplay experience we're trying to achieve. Fortunately, this also served as a good opportunity to iron out a few UI bugs that had been bothering us for some time.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One of these bugs was the fact that the GUI windows we use to display tutorial text didn't dynamically adjust its size. While this was a fairly minor bug, it made the tutorial experience feel unnecessarily cluttered and complex, even when the actual text content was short.</span></p><p>Improperly sized tutorial window. Image via Paradox Interactive.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One important aspect that we focused on was the concept of progressive disclosure—that is, as mentioned before, revealing information gradually to help players better understand the concepts we wanted to cover. One example of this is how we decided to gradually reveal information in the character panel.</span></p><p>Revealing information gradually. Image via Paradox Interactive.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">After the linear part of the tutorial was done, we shifted our focus to a softer onboarding experience for newer players. We focused on creating a handful of events that serve as a form of narrative hook for the player while also gradually introducing them to game mechanics which they'll frequently have to interact with.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">These events illustrate to the player that there are several ways to play and interact with the game and encourage roleplaying by highlighting that certain options are only available because of specific traits tied to the character you're playing. Since events are a core part of the game, we felt it was important to tutorialize them in some way, which led to us adding explanatory text within the tooltips, something we don't typically do for regular events.</span></p><p>Above, a sample tutorial event. Images via Paradox Interactive.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Both of these sections, the linear tutorial and the events onboarding the players, were playtested internally. While we follow heuristics and guidelines when designing, these aren't a substitute for proper user testing. The </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Crusader Kings III</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> development team is a group of lovely, passionate people but we all collectively suffer from the curse of knowledge, meaning our perspective on the game isn't necessarily reflective of our playerbase. Therefore, we made sure to try the tutorial on people who primarily work on other games in the office. This led to another round of changes, which ended up becoming the final iteration of the tutorial, which you can play right now!</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Final words">Final words</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As this was an experiment, we're keeping the old, longer tutorial in the game as well so we can see how the two compare through telemetry. While we hope this new tutorial affects retention positively, there's a silver lining even if it doesn't. Knowing what doesn't work can be valuable, and regardless of what the data tells us, it'll help us make informed decisions in our future onboarding efforts.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I think the primary takeaway we have from this experiment is that you shouldn't be afraid to try things. No result is a bad result as long as you're willing to learn from it. Playtesting is incredibly valuable for this, but we primarily use it to gather qualitative feedback, meaning it's difficult to find quantitative data we can act on without releasing something publicly. So, go out there! Break stuff! Iterate! Make stuff that's better than what came before it!</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>There’s a new PS5 system software update available now that’s bringing some big (and some long overdue) features to the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PlayStation 5</a> console, including a new Welcome hub, party sharing and the wide launch of personalised 3D audio profiles.</p>
<p>The Welcome hub is a new customisable space that is available today for “select players” in the US, and will be rolling out over the next few weeks for the rest of the world. This brings customisable widgets and backgrounds to the PS5 home screen, so you can forefront features like battery monitoring, your personal trophy collection and more whenever you boot up the console. This should make for a much more engaging alternative to the old Explore tab – you’ll also be able to set your own background here, for a much needed personal touch.</p>



<p>Then there’s party sharing, which lets you send out chat links on other platforms and have them bring other people directly into a voice chat, both via their smartphone app and via PS5, and whether they’re in your friends list or not. It’s just another little route for establishing links between people, and will be rolling out gradually over the next few weeks.</p>
<p>And then we have features that were in testing with the most recent beta system update. Personalised 3D audio for headphones and earbuds is the big one here, helping you to tune the 3D spatial audio to your specific hearing. This has been something in the pipeline ever since the PS5 launched, though back then Sony considered taking photos to scan people’s ears – something that Apple and others do for Bluetooth earbuds.</p>

<p>Here’s what it will look like:</p>
<p><iframe title="PS5 UI | Personalised 3D Audio Profile setup" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QhZzPyc-Zas?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>There’s also adaptive controller charging on the PS5 Slim and upcoming <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a>, which is kind of nice, and per-user Remote Play settings.</p>
<p>The update is available to download right now, though as mentioned, some of these features will be rolling out more gradually over the coming weeks.</p>

			<p>In some way, Assassin's Creed Shadows marks the end of an era for the Ubisoft series, being the last entry in the franchise to feature the role-playing game mechanics originally introduced in Assassin's Creed Origins. In other ways, however, the upcoming next entry in the series will mark the beginning of a new era for the franchise, sporting some technological advancements that will not only make it the most immersive and visually advanced Assassin's Creed game to date but that will also benefit future games.</p>
<p>During last month's Gamescom, I attended a preview session focused on the game where Art Director Thierry Danserau provided an in-depth look at how Ubisoft Quebec recreated feudal Japan. To understand Japanese culture, the developer went back to school, painstakingly analyzing documents and pictures to properly represent such a unique culture. All the hard work, according to the game's Art Director, will pay off, as players will be pleased by how the game will represent the Japanese culture of the time.</p>
<p>Right from the start, Assassin's Creed Shadows was developed as a current-generation-only game, and its creation was centered around three pillars - photorealism, realization, and dynamism. To support photorealism, the development team spent some time in Japan and took a lot of photos to better represent the country's unique aspects, which are unlike most locations in the world. As such, they also had to revise shaders to properly recreate the region in the game. Also, this recreation will be rendered at a more realistic scale, and it won't feature the entirety of the country but only its central regions.</p>
<p>Adding to photorealism will be ray-traced global illumination, which will also provide better ambient occlusion. Global illumination will be further enhanced by the use of virtual geometry for static objects, a first for the series, and evidently inspired by Unreal Engine 5's Nanite.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/AC-Shadows-Gamescom.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>As for realization, the team went all out to make Assassin's Creed Shadows the most visually advanced entry in the series. This will be immediately evident to players thanks to one of the most dynamic worlds ever made for the franchise, powered by the next iteration of the Anvil engine, which now supports a huge number of objects on screen and a new wind engine that allowed the team to create dynamic wind and spray. Thanks to the advancements of the Anvil Engine, this dynamic wind affects almost every object in the game's world, including bodies of water, leading to the creation of dynamic spray. Up to ten thousand particles can be shown on screen at a time.</p>
<p>The Assassin's Creed Shadows world will be made more dynamic than ever with some other very interesting features, such as the implementation of different seasons and a lot of weather conditions. These not only influence how the world and even clouds look but also have a deeper impact on gameplay, as during Winter, for example, there's no grass to hide in, which can make some stealth sequences more challenging. Weather changes also influence gameplay, as there could be situations where visibility is reduced, forcing players to adapt to the situation.</p>
<p>Check out some of these improvements in the newly released world trailer, embedded below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Assassin's Creed Shadows: World Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zKua34QXhMA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Unfortunately, I wasn't able to actually experience how all this will come into play in Assassin's Creed Shadows, as the presentation featured very little gameplay, but on paper, this sounds very interesting and could definitely help the game set itself apart from the previous entries in the series as well as other open-world games based on a similar setting, such as Sucker Punch's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ghost-of-tsushima-duty-heavier-than-a-mountain-death-lighter-than-a-feather/">Ghost of Tsushima</a>. Thankfully, we won't have to wait too long to experience all this ourselves, as the game launches on November 15th on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S worldwide.</p>
