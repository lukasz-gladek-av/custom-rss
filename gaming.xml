A limited edition will also be available for 12,980 yen. <span id="more-903455"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via MAGES.:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p><em>Rent-A-Girlfriend</em>, the popular romantic comedy by Reiji Miyajima with over 13 million copies sold and serialized in Weekly Shonen Magazine (<a title="Companies > Kodansha [15 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/kodansha">Kodansha</a>), finally makes its console game debut. Become Kazuya Kinoshita, a worthless college student at a Tokyo university, and live the part-time job lifestyle on Enoshima with charming heroines Chizuru Mizuhara, Ruka Sarashina, Sumi Sakurasawa, and Mini Yaemori in this game-original story. Additionally, by viewing all endings, you will be able to witness Mami Nanami’s story.</p><p><strong>An Original Story Set in the Summer on the Island of Enoshima</strong></p><p><a title="Companies > Experience [210 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/experience">Experience</a> an original love story that could have occurred during the third season of the TV anime. Kazuya Kinoshita gathered the funds to shoot a movie starring Chizuru Mizuhara via crowdfunding, but it turned out not enough! To make up for the insufficient funds, Kazuya Kinoshita stays on the island of Enoshima for the summer working part-time jobs with the four heroines. It will be impossible for something not to happen while under the same roof—Kazuya Kinoshita’s delusions are in full effect!</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Each Heroine is Fully Voiced</strong></p><p>Each heroine is fully voiced by their same voice actor from the TV anime, allowing you to enjoy the game as if you were watching the show. This includes Chizuru Mizuhara (voiced by Sora Amamiya), Mami Nanami (voiced by Aoi Yuuki), Ruka Sarashina (voiced by Nao Touyama), Sumi Sakurasawa (voiced by Rie Takahashi), and Mini Yaemori (voiced by Yuu Serizawa). Additionally, the game features a game-original theme song called “Cider no Mukou” sung by the five heroines.</p><p><strong>Limited Edition Includes a Four-Disc Drama CD and Official Soundtrack</strong></p><p>The limited edition includes a four-disc drama CD and original soundtrack. The drama CD features four situations that recreate Kazuya Kinoshita’s delusions (maid, non-blood-related sister, newly-married life, and high school student), allowing you to experience fantasy situations as imagined by him. The soundtrack CD features over 30 tracks and totals at over two hours in length, and includes the game-original theme song “Cider no Mukou” sung by the five heroines.</p></blockquote><p>View the first screenshots and box art <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/gallery/rent-a-girlfriend-the-horizon-and-the-girl-in-the-swimsuit/august-4-2024/">at the gallery</a>.</p><h2><span>Screenshots</span></h2><div id="carousel_903460"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Nintendo's Q1 2025 <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2024/240802_2e.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">financial report</a> has been released, and the numbers regarding hardware sales aren't too surprising overall. Nintendo Switch sales have decreased significantly, with 2024 being their lowest year. This quarter of the fiscal year, they sold 2.1 million Nintendo Switches between April 1 and June 30, a significant decrease of 46%.</p>
<p>Their total net sales are down by 46.5%, to 246.6 billion Yen, compared to 461.3 billion Yen during the first quarter of 2024's fiscal year. Their operating profit decreased by a significant 70.6%, with ordinary profit dipping by 55.3%. However, this most likely doesn't come as a surprise to most people.</p>
<p>With the Nintendo Switch being seven years old, it is not surprising that sales are starting to drop significantly. Both their dedicated video game platforms, mobile games, and IP-related income experienced severe drops. Consolidated hardware sales dropped by 46.4%, with mobile and other IP-related incomes dropping by 53.8%.</p>
<p>Nintendo acknowledges the overall drop in mobile and IP-related sales, saying it's "mainly due to the decrease in income from visual content related to The Super Mario Bros. Movie."</p>
<p>That said, they made a 42.8% profit on other sales, such as merchandise from official Nintendo stores and playing cards, which brought their sales up from 1.9 billion Yen to 2.8 billion Yen.</p>
<p>All of the Nintendo Switch models suffered a significant blow to sales. The original Nintendo Switch suffered the least with a drop of 18.4%, with&nbsp; <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-lite-oled/">Nintendo Switch Lite</a> sales dropping by 56.1% and Nintendo Switch OLED Model sales dropping by 46.3%</p>
<p>Looking at their software sales, two of their IPs were on top for selling over a million units. These two games were Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door and Luigi's Mansion 2 HD. One other title reached a million units, but it is not disclosed in the financial report as to which game that is.</p>
<p>Sales are drastically different from the previous fiscal year's first quarter. Last year saw the release of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, which also saw special edition Nintendo Switches released to celebrate the release. Alongside Zelda, The Super Mario Bros. Movie was released, which boosted sales massively.</p>
<p>Overall, the sell-through in this fiscal year is below the level of previous years. Despite that, sales for Princess Peach: Showtime! and Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door remained stable. However, these two games combined don't match the amount of sell-through sales Nintendo made with The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. Princess Peach: Showtime! and Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door account for approximately half of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom's sales.</p>
<p>Nintendo has a jam-packed year for game releases, so it's possible the next quarter of the fiscal year will be better for them, with games such as The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom and Super Mario Party Jamboree being released.</p>

        <p>"F*** it, I'm putting my clown makeup back on."</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Brace yourself, Half-Life fans – rumours of Half-Life 3 have been resurrected once again, this time originating from the unassuming resume of a voice actor.</p>
<p>There's a chance that by the time you read this,  Natasha Chandel's <a href="https://www.natashachandel.com/resume/">website</a> has already been, uh, revised, but right now, if you scroll down to the "voice over" section, you'll see reference "Project White Sands (video game)".</p>
<p>Chandel did not name the character(s) she provided voice work for, but the project is clearly marked as belonging to Valve.</p>

<p>As noted by the members of the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1ek3943/valve_is_working_on_a_title_under_the_codename/">Gaming Leaks and Rumours subreddit</a>, "white sands" is much more likely to pertain to Half-Life 3 than, say, Left 4 Dead 3, not least <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1ek3943/comment/lghyf57/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">because</a> "White Sands is a park in New Mexico...

<p>Is this all-out proof? Nope. Sorry. But at the very least, it's proof Valve is possibly developing another game in addition to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/now-theres-leaked-footage-of-valves-new-game-deadlock">Deadlock</a>, and if it's <em>not</em> Half-Life-related, that is an extraordinarily cruel codename to use…</p>
<p>Court documents recently revealed detailed employment statistics for Valve, the company behind the ubiquitous PC storefront Steam, the Steam Deck handheld, and - yes, still - a team dedicated to game development.</p>
<p>Altogether, that's just <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/steam-is-massive-but-far-fewer-people-work-at-valve-than-you-might-think">371 people employed by Valve in 2021</a>, for a company believed to bring in around $6.5bn a year. EA, home to FIFA/FC, which also generates around $6.5bn annually, had 13,700 staff on the payroll this year.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
