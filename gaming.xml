            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The routine is familiar by now. A new online shooter with bright, colorful graphics launches and rockets up the charts despite the fact that you maybe haven’t even heard of it. Or maybe it just has a really forgettable name. But everyone seems to be talking about it, and it’s free, so you figure you may as well jump in. This moment of promise and anticipation may end up being the best this game will ever be — and there’s a good chance that feeling won’t last long.</p><p>I could be describing any number of games, but the most recent example is <em>Highguard</em>, which just launched on the PS5, Xbox, and Steam. The 3v3 shooter is the first release from Wildlight Entertainment, a new studio made up of veterans from <em>Apex Legends</em>, <em>Titanfall</em>, and <em>Call of Duty</em>. That pedigree is enough to pay some attention to the game, which was originally revealed as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/841973/the-game-awards-2025-annoucements-news-trailers/archives/2">the final announcement at The Game Awards last month</a>. But it’s also doing some interesting things. The developers call it a “raid shooter,” but I’ve found it easiest to understand as a sort of first-person shooter take on a MOBA like <em>League of Legends</em>; each team has a base, and your job is to balance getting improved gear, protecting your own base, and completing various objectives to take down your enemies’ HQ. Also, you can ride a bear.</p><p>It’s a complicated setup, and after a few matches I’m not entirely convinced I fully understand the flow of matches, which could be a problem for wider adoption. It’s certainly not as pick-up-and-play as something like <em>Fortnite</em>. Though as you’d expect from people who worked on <em>Titanfall</em>, the action feels great, with excellent gunplay and smooth movement. It’s also a hero shooter, so you pick from characters with <em>Overwatch</em>-style ultimate powers that can let you quickly turn a battle in your favor, or smash through your opponents’ defenses. They can be a lot of fun when you pull them off properly.</p><p>When you’re in the midst of a tight skirmish, defending your teammates while they try to defuse a bomb, the appeal of <em>Highguard</em> is apparent. At its best it’s fast and tense and forces you to be decisive. But its complex nature also means that things can feel a little strange and messy. For one thing, the team sizes are small yet the maps are large, and so you spend a good chunk of each match wandering around a mostly empty level searching for chests to improve your armor or find a better gun. You do have a mount to speed this up, but even still, I’ve found the early portions of matches to be incredibly slow and not very exciting.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/4/24235163/concord-cancellation-live-service-games">As the ill-fated <em>Concord</em> showed</a>, the most important thing for a new online shooter is what it does differently, although even that isn’t a guarantee of success. But you need a hook to compete in a space with such established players as <em>Fortnite</em>, <em>Counter-Strike</em>, and the annualized behemoth that is <em>Call of Duty</em>. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/795232/ea-battlefield-6-hit-launch-deal"><em>Battlefield 6</em> managed to break through with sheer force of will</a>, while the likes of <em>Valorant</em>, <em>Helldivers 2</em>, and <em>Apex Legends</em> have settled into a seemingly steady place where they aren’t the biggest games, but they have a strong, healthy player base. But the list of failures is also large: <em>Anthem</em>, <em>Spectre Divide</em>, <em>XDefiant</em>, <em>Spellbreak</em>, just to name a few. Many had interesting hooks — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/29/23187883/activision-blizzard-spellbreak-acquisition-battle-royale-world-of-warcraft">It’s <em>Fortnite </em>but fantasy!</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24211078/spectre-divide-preview-mountaintop-fps-game">You can control two bodies at once!</a> — but it wasn’t enough.</p><p>As much fun as I’m having with <em>Highguard </em>during the launch week, I’m also not convinced that its strategic matches, slick gunplay, and oddball fantasy setting are enough for lasting success in such a competitive space. It’s different, but not <em>that</em> different, and it can be hard to explain what it really is. The odds are certainly against it. So for now I’ll just enjoy the experience while it lasts — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/864146/bungie-marathon-release-date-march-5th-price">and be ready to do this all over again in March</a>.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTk3"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Webster</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/868558/highguard-online-shooters]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/darkest-dungeon">Darkest Dungeon</a> developers Red Hook have announced that game files for Mythic's troubled boardgame adaptation will be given away to project backers, after grimly concluding that Mythic are no longer able to manufacture or deliver the thing.
</p>
<p>
The Darkest Dungeon boardgame was Kickstarted in 2020, soaking up $5.7 million in funding. Based in Luxembourg, Mythic Games have done well out of crowd-funding, raising over $19 million in five years, but they have been struggling financially nonetheless. They <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1162110258/darkest-dungeon-the-board-game/posts/3557431">asked DD boardgame backers to chip in more money</a> in 2022, after material and shipping costs spiked amid the Covid pandemic and the opening stages of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.</p>
<p>Mythic finally went into liquidation this December, reportedly following a criminal investigation into fraudulent behaviour and misappropriation of funds, which was terminated for lack of evidence. The company’s closure has left several projects worth millions of Kickstarter dollars in purgatory. There are many Ancestor quotes we could invoke here, I guess. I'm going with "more dust, more ashes... more disappointment."

</p>
<p>
Prior to biting the dust, Mythic managed to ship the first of two “waves” of Darkest Dungeon boardgame materials to backers. Amid the liquidation proceedings, a representative of the company also told <a href="https://boardgamewire.com/index.php/2025/12/10/darkest-dungeon-board-game-maker-mythic-games-officially-liquidated-fails-to-deliver-on-millions-of-dollars-worth-of-crowdfunding-projects/">Board Game Wire</a> that they would provide backers with the STLs – aka, digital 3D models that you can use to print game pieces - for both waves.</p>
<p>This was actually impossible at the time, however, because Mythic don’t own the copyright on Darkest Dungeon's designs, but a former Mythic staffer has now secured permission from Red Hook to share the files.
</p>
<p>
“As many of you know, the financial situation at Mythic Games has been strained for the past several years,” Red Hook <a href="https://www.darkestdungeon.com/news/regarding-mythic-games-and-the-darkest-dungeon-board-game/">write on their official site</a>. “We have been keeping an eye on the situation, hoping for the best. Unfortunately, at this point, Mythic Games is no longer able to manufacture or deliver the Darkest Dungeon board game.
</p><p>
“We put our trust in Mythic Games to deliver on their promises and uphold the Darkest Dungeon name,” the post continues. “We won’t mince words, their collapse and inability to fulfill Wave 2 orders is an enormously disappointing development and we know it deeply affects many Darkest Dungeon fans. 
</p>
<p>
“Recently, we were contacted by an ex-Mythic employee who asked for our blessing to distribute the project files to all backers. While we at Red Hook don't own or control the board game files themselves, we were happy to give our permission for our copyrighted material within those files to be distributed to backers for non-commercial use.”
</p>
<p>
If you backed the Darkest Dungeon boardgame, you should now have an email from the Kickstarter campaign with a link to “all game files, including files of the rules, 3D models and more”. If you haven’t received the email, give darkestdungeonrescuefiles@gmail.com a shout.
</p>
<p>
It’s good that some of the project has been salvaged, but email attachments aren’t a patch on getting a chunky new Crusader figurine in the post. “Unfortunately, Red Hook has neither the board game manufacturing expertise nor have we had the ability to divert funds of the scale required to remove whatever obstacles Mythic has faced without endangering our own operations,” the videogame's creators conclude on their site. “We only hope that this final gesture can be a silver lining in an otherwise disappointing situation.”

            <guid>1417756</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>For months ahead of <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em>‘s February release date, rumors have persisted that the game is “<a href="https://screenrant.com/resident-evil-9-open-world-rumors-good-bad/">open-world.</a>” That would certainly be a significant shift away from previous games, but it’s not something players should expect from <em>Requiem</em>&nbsp;<a href="https://gameinformer.com/2026/01/26/resident-evil-requiem-director-sets-the-record-straight-this-isnt-an-open-world-game">according to director Koshi Nakanishi, who said as much in an interview with <em>Game Informer</em></a>.</p> <p>“[The development team] did just want to make clear one point,” Nakanishi said while speaking to <em>Game Informer</em>. “They’ve seen some speculation of whether there’s any open-world elements in the game, and they just want to set the record straight that this isn’t an open-world game.”</p>

 <p>He continued: “The main concept behind this game is combining the very different gameplay of Grace and Leon into a cohesive package, and having those two gameplays represent the <em>Resident Evil</em> series, and I think when you play the game, you realize that, or you will find as well that the development team picked the best approach to do this.”</p> <p>For years, the industry has been obsessed with open-world design. People want more freedom, more hours, more map. But the notion that <em>Requiem </em>might be an open-world game didn’t sit well with <em>Resident Evil</em> players who love the series’ linear, tightly controlled storylines. The horror of <em>Resident Evil</em> is informed by its design, and an open world would significantly shift the way players experience it. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0mgOPbpagc">Footage shown last month of a city street with cars and pedestrians</a> sparked <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1q5dlc8/resident_evil_requiems_path_tracing_trailer_by/">some of that open-world speculation</a>, which can now be hushed thanks to Nakanishi’s statement to <em>Game Informer</em>. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-the-final-preview">In its <em>Requiem</em> preview, <em>IGN </em>said</a> that Grace’s portions of the game should be “familiar to anyone who has played&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 2</em> or&nbsp;<em>7</em>.” Leon’s sections, meanwhile, “stirred up our muscle memory of playing <em>Resident Evil 4</em>,” <em>IGN</em> said.</p>

 <p><em>Resident Evil Requiem</em>, the ninth mainline game in the franchise, will be released on February 27. Capcom’s last <em>Resident Evil</em> Game, <em>Resident Evil Village</em>, was released in 2021.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>IEM Katowice is officially no more, and the competition has moved to Krakow for 2026. This monumental change seemed drastic at the time, but fans are now readying themselves to visit a new city for this supersized tournament. In this guide, we’re breaking down everything you need to know about IEM Krakow 2026, including the schedule, teams competing, and where to watch it.</p>



<p>If you’re interested in IEM Krakow betting or just want to watch your favourite teams and players enjoying Counter-Strike 2 action live on stream, read on.</p>







<h2 id="h-iem-krakow-2026-schedule-and-location">IEM Krakow 2026 Schedule and Location</h2>



<p>IEM Krakow 2026 will take place at the TAURON Arena in the city of Kraków, Poland. It’s set to run from January 28th to February 8th, and in that time, 24 teams will fight for the lion’s share of a massive $1 million prize.</p>



<p>Here’s the <strong>IEM Krakow 2026 schedule and format:</strong></p>



<p><strong>Play-In Stage</strong></p>



<p>During this stage, 16 teams come together for the Play-In round, which features a double-elimination bracket and a series of best-of-three matches. It’s a whittling round here, and only the top eight will make it through to the next round to face the higher-seeded competitors.</p>



<p><strong>Group Stage</strong></p>



<p>The Group Stage includes the eight successful teams from the Play-In Stage and the eight that had already qualified with a higher seeding for IEM Krakow. The teams will compete along another double-elimination pathway, with each group being made up of eight teams in total.</p>



<p>The Group Stage <strong>winners </strong>go through to the semi-finals, the <strong>runners-up </strong>advance to the Quarterfinals as <em>high seeds</em>, and the <strong>third-place teams </strong>go through to the Quarterfinals as <em>low seeds</em>. Only the top three teams from each group will land in the Playoffs.</p>



<p><strong>Playoffs</strong></p>



<p>The Playoffs will crown the champion at IEM Krakow 2026. This is a single-elimination bracket with a best-of-five grand final that will see six teams fight for the grand prize – $400,000.</p>



<h2 id="h-iem-krakow-2026-teams">IEM Krakow 2026 Teams</h2>



<p>Here is the full list of the teams qualified to compete at IEM Krakow 2026:</p>



<p><strong>Directly Qualified</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>FURIA</li>



<li>Team Vitality</li>



<li>Team Falcons</li>



<li>Team Spirit</li>



<li>Natus Vincere</li>



<li>MOUZ</li>



<li>FaZe Clan</li>



<li>The MongolZ</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Play-In Teams</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Aurora Gaming</li>



<li>B8</li>



<li>Legacy</li>



<li>G2 Esports</li>



<li>Team Liquid</li>



<li>3DMAX</li>



<li>Astralis</li>



<li>PARIVISION</li>



<li>HEROIC</li>



<li>paiN Gaming</li>



<li>FUT Esports</li>



<li>Ninjas in Pyjamas</li>



<li>Passion UA</li>



<li>BC.Game Esports</li>



<li>NRG</li>



<li>GamerLegion</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-iem-krakow-2026-predictions">IEM Krakow 2026 Predictions</h2>



<p>Team Vitality enters the running as the primary title contender, despite recent losses. For a safe IEM Krakow bet, you’d consider backing them, or for similar odds, Team Spirit. FURIA has been on a resurgence of late, and the Brazilian roster could make for a middle-of-the-road bet if you’re playing outrights.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, a swing-tier squad like Team Liquid and Ninjas in Pyjamas could manufacture an underdog win that could result in a nice return for Counter-Strike betting fans.</p>

<p>It’s time to crawl out through the Fallout one more time with episode 8 of Fallout Season 2. Amazon’s stunning adaptation is reaching its conclusion, and Season 2’s episode 8 release date draws closer than a Bloatfly to your irradiated presence.</p>



<p>The Ink Spots famously sang about not wanting to set the world on fire, and yet, Amazon’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/fallout/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fallout</a> adaptation has constantly been on fire. Every episode has knocked it out of the park. Fallout Season 2 has been a joy to watch from start to finish, and the high stakes are about to be raised one more time in New Vegas.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-is-fallout-season-2-episode-8-coming-out-release-date-explained">When Is Fallout Season 2 Episode 8 Coming Out? Release Date, Explained</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Episode 8 will show great steel once more. Credit to Amazon</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Tuesday, February 3, is the official release date for Fallout Season 2, episode 8.</strong></p>



<p>The last couple of episodes of Season 2 have been rejigged by Amazon slightly. But you have no excuse for missing it now with this information! The reason for Amazon’s tinkering with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-season-2-episode-7-release-date-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">episode 7</a> and episode 8 was “Due to strong participation and interest,” which, in short, was to make it available for more regions earlier and cut down on potential spoilers.</p>



<p>No one wants a finale ruined for them, making this a commendable gesture by Amazon.</p>

<p><strong>The United States claims the first release time for Fallout Season 2 Episode 8 with a 6 PM PT start time on February 3. Insider Gaming has also provided more time zones for you to check out, including GMT and AET.</strong></p>



<p>It’s the United Kingdom who are probably most at risk for an episode 8 spoiler due to the 2 AM start time! Whereas many other regions are getting more favorable start times.</p>



<p>Take a look at this table and see when Season 2 episode 8 airs for you.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Region</strong></td><td data-align="center"><strong>Fallout Season 2 Episode 8 Dates &amp; Release Time</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Pacific Time (PT)</td><td data-align="center">6:00 PM—February 3</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Central Time (CT)</td><td data-align="center">8:00 PM—February 3</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Eastern Time (ET)</td><td data-align="center">9:00 PM—February 3</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)</td><td data-align="center">2:00 AM—February 3</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Australian Eastern Time (AET)</td><td data-align="center">1:00 PM—February 4</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">New Zealand Daylight Time (NZDT)</td><td data-align="center">3:00 PM—February 4</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>If episode 8 is even half as good as the rest, then Fallout’s newest batch of TV is about to go out with a Megaton ending, atomic bomb-sized bang.</p>

		<p>The Witcher has no need for Tinder when journeying across the Northern Kingdoms, when he’s caught in a love triangle between Yenn and Triss. Here, though, he is now trapped in the Tinder-like left and right swiping of Reigns: The Witcher. It’s the second crossover spin-off between Reigns’ kingdom management and a popular fantasy series, but there’s a distinctly different set up to this game than before.</p>
<p>Now, obviously, Reigns: The Witcher stars Geralt of Rivia, but where you’d play as the ruler of a kingdom in the earlier games of this series and have to appease and balance the whims and desires of various factions, now you’re playing as an adventuring hero. It’s quite a shift, though Nerial has stuck with a familiar format. Kind of.</p>



<p>Geralt of Rivia isn’t really the most personable of characters. No, he’s not as monstrous and inhuman as the legends that precede him would have the general people believe, but he still needs a strong PR campaign to be seen as more than just a necessary evil. Enter Dandelion to sprinkle a little musical sparkle across his adventures, turning Geralt into a folk hero over time.</p>
<p>At least that’s the plan. with Reigns: The Witcher wrapping up the adventures within the context of Dandelion performing to a packed house. But telling stories of Geralt’s adventures is pretty tricky. You can find yourself down some unusual rabbit holes, lose the consistent narrative threads, and bend the truth a little too far.</p>

<p>The game opens with his first effort, with talking dragons, captured lovers and Geralt being burnt to a crisp, but it’s just an opening gambit, as each successive adventure leads to Dandelion finding new sources of inspiration.</p>

<p>There’s less of a single narrative thread through each play, as you’re still met by individuals that each present you with a binary choice and an instant resolution to their problem or request. A farmer might ask you to lure in a beast to spook his overly milky goats, a noble could want a particular monster’s head to adorn their mantelpiece, some townsfolk might request your help in warding off a siren living in the woods nearby, or some other mythical beast will need defeating. It seems quite rare that a situation will have a direct narrative follow up or counterpoint, and they’re almost always swiped away and resolved without issue.</p>
<p>That’s generally true when dealing with monsters and creatures too –&nbsp;you can choose to tell the siren to leave or lop off their head –&nbsp;but some will rope you into a new combat minigame that completely shifts the pacing of the game. Instead of letting you take your time, now there’s a beat to match and move to in a block-dropping puzzler.</p>

<p>Geralt roams the bottom edge of a 5×5 grid, moving left or right each beat, and all you can do is guide his direction as enemy attacks, offensive strikes and healing potions descend from the top. It’s tricky to get the hang of and need a good bit of foresight to evade some of the trickier formations that emerge. Take too many hits and it’s game over, with Dandelion having to come up with a better story next time.</p>
<p>Most decisions will have an impact to the performance, pleasing or displeasing humans, non-humans, sorcerers and monsters. The goal, as with previous games, is to keep all four of these in balance. Fall too low and Geralt meets a gristly end. Max one of them out and he’s lured into some hedonistic equivalent. You can find yourself backed into a corner,</p>

<p>You also have some added overarching goals with the inspiration points that Dandelion can draw upon. Three cards are drawn at the start, providing buffs and modifiers to make certain groups easier to please, harder to displease, add a bit of romance, or add a murderous lilt as companions can meet an untimely demise at the hands of monsters. Meeting their requirements, whether it’s flirting with people, finding a serial killer, or something else, then adds to the experience Dandelion gets at the end of a tale and his inspiration.</p>
<p>Reigns: The Witcher is an interesting twist and reframing of the simplified kingdom management series. There’s a lot that will remain familiar, a lightness to how quickly you flit between situations with a simple swipe, and plenty of amusing deaths to find. After a fleeting introductory hour and a bunch of early deaths, I’m curious to see how deep Dandelion’s imagination goes.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Around two months ago, the <strong>Embracer Group</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/embracer-group-sells-cryptic-studios-arc-games-retains-right-to-remnant-fellowship/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold off</a> developer <strong>Cryptic Studios</strong> (the team behind MMO games <strong>Champions Online</strong>, <strong>Star Trek Online</strong>, and <strong>Neverwinter</strong>) and publisher <strong>Arc Games</strong>, which were acquired by members of Arc Games' management team.</p>



<p>Today, Cryptic is announcing that veteran game developer executive <strong>Jack Emmert</strong> has returned to the role of <strong>Chief Executive Officer (CEO)</strong>. Key emphasis on the word returned: Emmert began his career in the gaming industry at Cryptic in 2000, right at the studio's foundation, and was eventually promoted to CEO in 2011. He left the company in December 2015. <span>After a brief stint at&nbsp;<strong>Perfect World Entertainment</strong>, Emmert joined&nbsp;<strong>Daybreak</strong>&nbsp;as CEO, managing the superhero MMORPG&nbsp;<strong>DC Universe Online</strong>&nbsp;and later working on an unannounced MMO when the studio changed its name to </span><strong><span>Dimensional Ink Game</span>s</strong>.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/jack-emmert-on-dimensional-inks-total-independence-and-whats-next-for-the-dcuo-team/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I first interviewed him during this time</a>, just before COVID went global. Back then, the game was unknown; we'd later learn it would have been a superhero MMO based on <strong>Marvel IPs</strong>, but Daybreak <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-mmorpg-canceled-as-investment-is-refocused-on-smaller-projects-based-on-current-ips/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">canceled it in 2022</a>. The following year, Jack Emmert <span>founded a new studio,&nbsp;<strong>Jackalyptic,</strong>&nbsp;with <strong>NetEase</strong>'s help, and </span><a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-mmo-qa-jack-emmert-wants-an-accessible-game-that-represents-the-ip-with-care/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span>I interviewed him about an upcoming MMO&nbsp;</span>based on the <strong>Warhammer</strong> franchise</a>. Unfortunately, that game <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-warhammer-mmo-is-also-canceled-netease-shuts-down-jackalyptic-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">got canceled, too</a>, amid many other projects and studio closures ordered by NetEase.</p>



<p>Now, Emmert comes back home, in a way. As part of the Cryptic news, I've been able to chat with him again about his return to the CEO position and what that means for the games currently managed by the California-based developer.</p>

</p></figure>



<p><strong>Jack, I think the last time we spoke, you were working at Jackalyptic on a Warhammer game. I’m guessing you probably cannot talk about anything that happened there.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jack Emmert:</strong> Not really. I loved my time at NetEase and Jackalyptic; everybody was terrific. I have zero hard feelings; NetEase treated us wonderfully. Things didn't work out—that's the game industry. I've been through this rodeo many times before and I have a lot of gratitude. But I have even more gratitude that this opportunity came out of nowhere. Right as one chapter in my life was coming to a close, a brand new one started. It is unbelievable to me that I'm back at Cryptic.</p>



<p><strong>You were there from the beginning as one of the founders. What are your first impressions of being back?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jack Emmert:</strong> It’s fascinating. Often as an adult, if I travel back, I find myself reverting into the kid that I was—the old behaviors and the old mannerisms. It's hard to escape. But what's interesting about returning to Cryptic is that I've changed, and so has Cryptic. We're learning about each other for the first time. Some parts are familiar, but most of it isn't. It's fascinating to see how Cryptic grew in my absence. I'm learning so much from the teams and everything that they've accomplished. I'm honored that they would have me back. I hope with all the things that I've learned over the past 10 years that I can bring something new to the table, not just what I was during the first 16 years of my career at Cryptic.</p>



<p><strong>A couple of months ago, Cryptic itself, along with Arc Games, underwent a change in management. Are you 100% in charge of your own destiny?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jack Emmert:</strong> Yes, we are. We are 100% in charge of our own destiny. I'm thrilled. I know the guys from Arc Games from back in the Perfect World days; they are super smart. I am absolutely thrilled to be on this journey. Even better, Arc Games is fully committed to Cryptic Studios, and the support that we're getting is incredible. Our teams on all of our games are bigger today than when I left 10 years ago. That shows that Arc really believes that while these games are older, they still have a lot to offer, and they have great fans.</p>



<p><strong>Are you working remotely or are you back in the studio proper?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jack Emmert:</strong> I'm working remotely from Austin, Texas. Most of the studio is remote. I'm a big believer in that model; it increases the quality of life a lot. There certainly are challenges with communication, but those are solvable if the team is committed. I think it's the way to go with game development.</p>



<p><strong>As the new CEO of Cryptic, will you oversee all the games closely?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jack Emmert:</strong> Absolutely. And I don't just oversee; I’m going to be the games' biggest fan. I've been playing and grinding away in Neverwinter, getting to know the new systems and how content is organized. I'll do the same thing with Star Trek Online and Champions Online. Unless I know those games as a player, I don't really offer much to the teams. I don't know the tools anymore, and if I were just a business CEO, I would just be saying "make more money." Anybody off the street can do that. In order for me to add value, I need to be able to understand those games as a player and contribute meaningfully to decisions on development.</p>



<p><strong>Can you share briefly where the games are at and what's coming next?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jack Emmert:</strong> Right now, I'm still coming up to speed, as I only started two weeks ago. My impression is that the teams have very solid plans for content moving forward. I'm not intending to upset those in any way because I think they are good plans. As we start moving further into the future, I'll be collaborating more on what we should do. I'm also highly committed to looking at ways for us to re-engage players who have dropped out. The success of WoW Classic and Guild Wars shows the value of these nostalgic relaunches. Our games have been around for over 15 years now, and there are a lot of people who have played all three of them.</p>



<p><strong>Does that also include Champions Online? It seems Star Trek Online and Neverwinter are updated more regularly. Is that going to change with Champions Online?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jack Emmert:</strong> Change happens if there's a demand. If you play Champions and you love it, come back, because Arc is going to give us the support for any game that shows growth. Period. I’m bullish on Champions; we've got some stuff, but we could use you. Come on back, build a champion, and let's make that game great. The superhero MMO niche hasn't really been cornered quite yet; it’s an opportunity for us to do some great stuff together.</p>



<p><strong>Could such opportunities involve being available on more platforms, like the Nintendo Switch 2?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jack Emmert:</strong> I'm not going to eliminate any opportunity. We did put DC Universe Online on the Nintendo Switch, so I understand the market to a degree. We'll be looking at any opportunity to get these games in people's hands.</p>



<p><strong>What do you think about the future of the industry? Do you see new investment happening from Western developers in MMOs?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jack Emmert:</strong> It would be difficult for anybody to go to a Western publisher and ask for money to develop an MMORPG. The track record with Western publishers and MMORPGs is not very good for a lot of reasons. However, I think there's a lot of opportunity to launch a game that isn't necessarily an MMO at the start, but grows into something. A model like Warframe is a really good one; it is vastly bigger than it ever was when it first launched. That is a direction many games could go. A multiplayer story-based RPG could add an open-world component through an update or expansion. Instead of a hundred-million-dollar investment all upfront, you're making a series of $20 million bets so that at the end of five to seven years you have that big MMO, having paid for it and grown the community along the way.</p>



<p><strong>It's interesting you mentioned Warframe. Greg Street told me the same thing: that Warframe started small and grew over time, and it could be a model for future MMOs.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jack Emmert:</strong> I know Greg quite well. I would not be surprised to see someone bootstrap a very small product, get some initial success, and continue to invest in it. Subnautica was like that, too. I think that's where you're going to see the new MMOs. To MMO fans, I'd say be patient; if you support a product and love it, just keep supporting it. It'll get there.</p>



<p><strong>When can players expect the next big updates for Cryptic's games?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jack Emmert:</strong> I have a rough idea of the battle plans. I was just reviewing them and I've got some surprises up my sleeve. We will roll them out as soon as we're able to nail down dates.</p>



<p><strong>Can you share the approximate size of each team and whether there is overlap between them?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jack Emmert:</strong> In general, I'm not a fan of sharing personnel between teams. I like teams that are dedicated to a product because they know its ins and outs. I can't share exact team sizes as that is confidential information, but they are bigger than when I left. Our licensors, Paramount and Wizards of the Coast, are terrific and they’ve extended their hands to help out with tie-ins and other collaborations.</p>



<p><strong>I recently re-downloaded Neverwinter and noticed that the PC version still doesn't have official controller support, even though the game is available on consoles. Are you going to add it?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jack Emmert:</strong> That's a great suggestion. I never even thought about it before, but I'll write that down.</p>



<p><strong>A lot of PC players play on gamepads nowadays, and it’s good for accessibility too.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jack Emmert:</strong> Absolutely, it's a great idea.</p>



<p><strong>Thank you for your time, Jack, and good luck.</strong></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/breathtaking-leaked-pre-alpha-images-of-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-are-salt-in-the-wound-for-fans-in-mourning/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>If you went back in time to January 2025 and told someone that a year from now, <strong>Ubisoft</strong> would <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-major-reset-cancels-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake/">undergo a "<em><strong>major reset</strong></em><strong>"</strong> that would change the face and structure of the company</a>, they might not have been too surprised by the news. If you then added that this reset would also include the cancellation of the long-awaited <strong>Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake</strong> (<a href="https://wccftech.com/beyond-good-and-evil-2-still-in-development-after-ubisoft-major-reset/">while <strong>Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2</strong> remained in production</a>), that might've caught them off guard.</p>



<p>But that is indeed how things shook out, with the remake indeed cancelled, as Ubisoft ultimately decided it did "<em></em><em>not meet the new enhanced quality</em>" standards it is enforcing in this new era of the company's history. <a href="https://x.com/princeofpersia/status/2014018590396105121">A statement shared from the official X (formerly Twitter) account</a> for the Prince of Persia franchise shortly after the official reset announcement claimed that "<em>While the project had <strong>real potential</strong>, we weren't able to reach the level of quality you deserve, and continuing would have required more time and investment than we could responsibly commit<strong>,</strong>"</em> adding that the team did not want to release something they felt fell below players' expectations, and that this cancellation "<em>does not mean we're stepping away from the franchise</em>."</p>



<p>Now, as the dust continues to settle around Ubisoft with <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-launches-voluntary-layoff-program-ubisoft-paris/">more layoffs incoming</a></strong> and unions representing Ubisoft employees <a href="https://wccftech.com/french-union-claims-ubisoft-ceo-has-no-knowledge-or-understanding-of-his-company-after-major-reset/">calling for chief executive officer <strong>Yves Guillemot</strong> to recognize that he and the rest of the company's top brass are the issue</a> and not the people who actually make the games, a leaked workshop showcasing an early pre-alpha build of the Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake from 2024 has fans mourning the lost project even more.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1qob510/prince_of_persia_sot_remake_2024_presentation/">The workshop presentation was initially found on Reddit</a>, though it was quickly copyright-claimed by Ubisoft and has since been taken down. Though not quickly enough, it would seem, as <a href="https://x.com/princeozzyX/status/2016120310559334435">X (formerly Twitter) user princeozzyX</a>, also known under the Prince of Persia Universe handle, compiled specifically the images of art and in-game screencaps that at least one fan called "<em>breathtaking</em>," while others add that the game, even in an unfinished state, already looked "<em>beautiful" </em>and that they are now "<em>even more upset</em>" over its cancellation.</p>

<p>Impressive as these images may look to some, the reality is that we don't know the full story behind the game's cancellation. That said, we can make assumptions about project mismanagement, especially when looking at the game's public history and the fact that the same leadership group that allowed this to happen is also the one that led Ubisoft to lose <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-lost-nearly-95-of-value-in-eight-years-34-share-price-drop-after-major-reset/"><strong>95% of its value in the last eight years</strong>.</a> </p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-being-teased-by-ubisoft-listings-surface-on-amazon/">After leaks pointing to its imminent reveal</a>, Ubisoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/prince-of-persia-remake-announced/">officially announced the remake in September 2020</a>, with a release date set for early 2021. The reception was less than ideal, with many fans calling out its lacking visuals. But the reality of the time was that we all knew it could get better, so there wasn't too much concern as long as the gameplay was solid.</p>



<p>Months after its reveal, <a href="https://wccftech.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-delayed/">its release date was pushed back slightly further into 2021 to March</a>, but before it could reach that March release date, <a href="https://wccftech.com/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-was-just-delayed-indefinitely/">Ubisoft announced the game had been delayed indefinitely</a>. The <a href="https://wccftech.com/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-delay-2022-no-e3-showing/">launch was pushed to 2022</a>, before the project was <a href="https://wccftech.com/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-ubisoft-montreal/">taken from the <strong>Ubisoft Mumbai</strong> and <strong>Ubisoft Pune</strong> studios, who were previously leading it, to <strong>Ubisoft Montreal </strong>in May 2022</a>. Almost a year to date later, in May 2023, it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-fully-rebooted/">announced that the game was officially <strong>rebooted</strong> and back in the concept phase</a>.</p>



<p>After that, <a href="https://wccftech.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-has-passed-an-important-milestone-ubisoft-says/">development updates were scarce and vague</a>, and despite <a href="https://wccftech.com/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-dev-team-adds-ubisoft-toronto-far-cry/">Ubisoft putting more teams on the project</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-details/">the initial look at the graphical overhaul</a> looking promising, <a href="https://wccftech.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-is-rumored-to-release-in-january-2026/">with a 2026 release even said to be sometime in January 2026</a>, it was ultimately not enough for Ubisoft to consider putting the game out.</p>

            <p>Well, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/shush-helldivers-2s-redacted-regiment-warbond-is-all-about-being-sneakily-stealthy-and-silently-suppressed">last one</a> might have only appealed to folks open to taking on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-gets-new-stealth-missions-today-and-its-super-slimmed-install-size-version-is-finally-ready-to-take-over">a mission that demands a bunch of crouch-walking</a>, but you can't say <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>'s second warbond of 2026 isn't offering plenty of bang for your buck. It's got an exploding hammer. There's other stuff in this Siege Breakers warbond too, but I'll be honest, none of that can boast being a stick with a thing that goes boom taped to the end.</p>

<p>So, without further ado, let me crack open the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/509603414731131980?l=english">notes</a> for this warbond, which is set to release on February 3rd, and wax lyrical about the CQC-20 Breaching Hammer. To be fair to Arrowhead, they've arguably downplayed it in marketing terms, at least when it comes to wordly description. "This sledgehammer can do straight smashing, or it can have an explosive charge attached to its head to drive the point home," they write.</p>
<p>Ok. Annnnnnnnnnndddd there it is in the trailer being bonked down onto the bonce of an automaton by a diving Helldiver who subsequently disappears in a big exploding cloud of fire and explosions. Naturally, it seems that following a killer blow like that, you can just dust yourself off, stick a new explosive charge to your hammer's head and bash on. All in all, I'd say there's plenty of potential for slapstick antics and kills worthy of being uploaded to YouTube with a title that's just <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_t9z9KWZE">Steve Urkel's catchphrase</a> in all caps.</p><p>While we're here, I suppose I'll tell you about the rest of the stuff in Siege Breakers. There's the returning LAS-16 Trident from the first <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a>, this time with six fireable beams instead of three. Building on the hammer's explodey vibes are a belt-fed grenade launcher dubbed the GL-28 and a single-shot missile launcher called the EAT-411 Leveller. On second thought, the Leveller might be just as fun as the hammer.</p>
<p>Rounding out the major additions is a "spherical, projectile-blocking shield" you can lob out for some cover,  a studded heavy armour set dubbed the SA-8 Ram, and a medium set called the SA-7 Headfirst. Both of the latter come with a passive ability that regenerates your stamina whenever you take damage, meaning you can go all night long. Well, at least until you run out of health.</p>

            <p>
Good news everybody! Geralt of Rivia is dead. He lies beneath a pile of naked, sculpted, drunken bodies in a castle ballroom. Actually, that’s not right - he’s been eaten by a dragon. Actually, that’s not right either - he drowned himself in a flagon of syrup. Fair audience, please consider which of these tragic eventualities is most befitting of your hand-claps and progression points. None of them meet your standards? Then I, Dandelion, must sing Geralt’s death anew.
</p>
<p>
Nerial and Devolver Digital have partnered with CD Projekt RED to make <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/reigns-the-witcher">Reigns: The Witcher</a>. I’m sure I don’t need to explain that this is a new version of Nerial’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/reigns-review-pc">cherished</a> card-swiping narrative <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy game</a>, which takes place in The Witcher’s grotty and magical medieval universe. The game casts you as temporarily embarrassed ‘master poet’ Dandelion, who is both Geralt’s best mate and very often, the biggest pain in his arse. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Dandelion and Geralt have a bet on that Dandelion can’t become an ‘immortal bard’ in one year. To win the bet, Dandelion must spin progressively fancier, longer, sillier and more thrilling tales about Geralt’s heroism, all of which seemingly end in his demise.</p>
<p>As in regular <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/reigns">Reigns</a>, this is done by drawing event cards and swiping left or right to make decisions that fill or empty four gauges at the top of the screen. There’s also a combat system, which sees you tapping to make Geralt hop left or right on a grid of descending damage, spell and attack icons. Between tales, you’ll channel your audience’s initially grudging applause into level-ups that unlock new starting story concepts and modifiers. "Geralt The Bathed", for example, makes Geralt stink less, improving his standing with certain kinds of people, though I imagine there will be repercussions of the “got smelled stalking a werewolf” variety.
</p><p>
I’ve had a quick fiddle with a preview build, and this seems like it’ll scratch your itch if you enjoy either The Witcher or Reigns, though it has yet to surprise me, and is likely best played on a phone. The writing is as daft and bouncy as you’d expect from both Dandelion and the writers of Reigns. The Reigns artstyle is perhaps a bit worn-out at this stage - there have been three other spin-offs, including <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/reigns-game-of-thrones">Reigns: Game of Thrones</a> - but it remains crisp and suave with some nifty takes on Tarot. The music readily conjures the taverns of the Nilfgaardian Empire.
</p>
<p>
I’m interested to see whether there are nods to the other cardgames in The Witcher universe – both the porno pin-up collecting from the 2008 original game, which we Don’t Talk About Nowadays, and the more recent, beloved Gwent. Mostly, though, I just want to see how far Nerial can warp Geralt and The Witcher universe via Dandelion’s improvisations, particularly given that CD Projekt are dialling up the seriousness with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a>. Do a custard pie-based death, next, Dandelion. You can make it some kind of sex scene, if you wish.

            <title><![CDATA[Mining Crystals In Highguard Is So Damn Satisfying]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/mining-crystals-in-highguard-is-so-damn-satisfying-ps5-pc-steam-2000663527</link>
            <guid>1417699</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Shooting guns in <em>Highguard</em> is fun and feels very good. But the most satisfying thing to do in the newly released free-to-play raid shooter doesn’t involve guns. Instead, it happens whenever I get a chance to smash some crystals using a minigame that rewards perfection in a smart way.</p> <p>In <em>Highguard</em>, which is out now on PC, PS5, and Xbox, you have the chance to visit shops during your match to buy shields, guns, ammo, upgrades, and other gear. But nothing in this world is free. Well, I guess <em>Highguard</em> is free, but whatever, my point is that you need some cash to buy this stuff. Actually, not cash but blue crystals. Bits of blue crystals, to be more precise. You get some from killing enemies and raiding or defending bases, but a fast and efficient way to get a lot of crystal shards is to mine the large deposits that litter the map. And mining these larger veins of crystal is satisfying.</p>

 <p>On PS5, you click the right stick to begin a simple timing minigame that lets you quickly smash through a big crystal deposit with a satisfying series of sounds and a big crushing blow at the end. Every time I do this perfectly, I feel good. I love it. I sometimes take a moment to break a few more crystals, even if I don’t really need to, because smashing them perfectly is such a joy. I may at one point have been caught off-guard and quickly killed by two enemy players because I was distracted while mining crystals. Awkward.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000663552" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000663552"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000663552">©Wlidlight / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>What really helps make this process feel good, besides the wonderful “<em>dink, dink, crash</em>” noises and timing minigame, is that when you perfectly nail it, the game gives you a reward: The next crystal you mine will break instantly. Oh, buddy, you better believe that feels good.</p>

 <p>Now, I would like to point out that I actually have to go mine for crystals during the middle of a long match so I can buy some shields, which isn’t my favorite part of <em>Highguard</em>. In fact, a lot of the economy around mining crystals and spending them likely needs to be tweaked to make it less annoying early on and less of a pain in the later part of a long round. But that doesn’t change the fact that the actual act of mining in <em>Highguard</em> makes me feel good. I love it. They should add a mode all about harvesting crystal shards and taking them back to your base, and whichever team has the most after five minutes wins. I’d play the heck out of that.</p>

<p>The voice actor who portrayed Lara Croft in the first game has been cast in Amazon’s live-action Tomb Raider series. </p>



<p>The Tomb Raider live-action series recently revealed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/amazons-tomb-raider-announces-multiple-castings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multiple castings</a>, including Sigourney Weaver, Jason Isaacs, Martin Bobb-Semple, Bill Patterson, and more. However, it seems that one of the names wasn’t included in this list, and it might be a very big one and a nostalgic voice that the die-hard fans might remember. </p>







<h2 id="h-keeley-hawes-joins-live-action-tomb-raider-series">Keeley Hawes Joins Live-Action Tomb Raider Series </h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tv/38027622/keeley-hawes-amazon-prime-lara-croft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Sun</a>, Keeley Hawes, who voiced Lara Croft in the original game, will star in Amazon’s live-action Tomb Raider series. However, she wouldn’t be playing the titular role of Lara Croft, as that has been reserved for Game of Thrones star <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sophie-turner-lara-croft-first-look-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sophie Turner</a>. There’s also an image from the set that surfaced in the report, showing Hawes in a long raincoat and a shopping bag in her hand. </p>



<p>Readers have already started speculating what role she could be playing, with many guessing it could be Lara Croft’s mother, Lady Amelia Croft, the Countess of Abingdon. However, that hasn’t been confirmed yet. </p>



<p>Hawes has spoken about still meeting fans of the game, stating they are “some of the nicest people I have ever met.” These meet-ups usually go down with her “making them a new answering machine message”. She still sees that as a good thing, stating that fans are so passionate about Lara Croft, with the character being around for over 20 years, and was “a huge part of the teenage years of so many people.” </p>

            <title><![CDATA[ARC Raiders Bird City—New Headwinds Map Condition, Explained]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Map Conditions are a key part of what keeps ARC Raiders feeling fresh and exciting, as they can fundamentally change how a map is played. Not all of them are that drastic, though, and Headwinds’ Bird City is a simple but notable Minor Map Condition. </p>



<p>Headwinds is the first major update for ARC Raiders in 2026, and it brought with it a nice selection of content. The new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-trophy-display-project-guide-all-requirements-rewards-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Trophy Display Project</a> is perhaps the star of the update, but don’t sleep on Bird City.</p>







<p>If you’re wondering what’s different with Bird City in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-2026-roadmap-live-tracker/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a> and where you can play it, then you’re in the right place. </p>



<h2 id="h-what-maps-is-bird-city-on-in-arc-raiders">What Maps Is Bird City On In ARC Raiders?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Look out for the Bird Icon. Image by Insider Gaming. </figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Bird City, the new Minor Map Condition in ARC Raiders, is exclusive to the Buried City map. </strong></p>



<p>Every hour, map conditions refresh in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/a-prime-specimen-arc-raiders-arc-deforester-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a>, with Major and Minor Conditions shifting between the line-up. If you’re looking to jump into Bird City, though, you’ll need to keep your eye on Buried City, as it won’t feature anywhere else.</p>



<p>The lore behind it is that when the Cold Snap defrosted, birds were able to return from their migration. Now they’ve returned in their masses, and they’re making nests all across Buried City—with loot ripe for the taking. </p>

</figure>



<p><strong>The main thing to look out for during the Bird City Minor Map Condition is the nests that are laid in chimneys across the map.</strong></p>



<p>Considering it’s only a Minor Map Condition, it makes sense that nothing drastic has changed, but it does pose a nice chance to earn some extra loot. The birds have laid nests across Buried City, and you can search them all for Trinkets and Epic Loot. It’s by no means guaranteed; in fact, it’s fairly rare, but these nests are more than easy to find, so get searching!</p>







<p>Here’s the full list of changes made to Buried City during the Bird City Minor Map Condition:</p>



<ul>
<li>Increased amount of Trinkets</li>



<li>Increased amount of Birds</li>



<li>Increased amount of Ziplines</li>
</ul>

            <p>Last week, Ubisoft canned the long-in-development <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</a> remake amid a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-and-more-cancelled-by-ubisoft-with-layoffs-potentially-on-the-horizon">raft of cancellations and delays</a> which have come to serve as the starting bell for a bunch of organisational changes that are currently crystalising into <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-propose-cutting-up-to-200-jobs-at-paris-headquarters-as-unions-reportedly-agree-three-day-strike">job cuts</a>. Now, actor Eman Ayaz has released a video in which she discusses having learned last week that three years worth of her work on an unnamed project had been tipped down the drain. </p>

<p>The video doesn't see Ayaz specify that the project she's talking about is the Prince of Persia: Sands of Time remake, with the actor claiming early on that she's "still under NDA". According to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/after-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-cancelation-actress-says-shes-lost-3-years-of-work-and-found-out-via-the-internet">IGN</a> and <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/it-was-devastating-prince-of-persia-remake-actor-found-out-the-game-was-cancelled-via-the-internet/">VGC</a>, Ayaz has seperately reposted some comments from fans which suggest the Sands of Time remake is the project she's referring to here.</p>
<p>"I've dedicated the last three years of my life to this project and spent those years getting to know the team, which has become like a family to me," Ayaz said. I've watched it grow through countless stages of development and I've waited and waited for the day that it was finally going to be released and I could finally talk about it. And this week I found out through the internet that the project has been cancelled."</p><p>According to the actor, she found out about the cancellation after her brother spotted an article about it. "I was just in total shock," she recalled. "Just last month or two months ago, I had filmed marketing for this project. Everything had been running smoothly and that was the last that I had heard and we were all really looking forward to it being released this year."</p>
<p>Ayaz claimed she turned down "other opportunities" while working on the project and opted to keep coming to work on it with a broken foot. Following the cancellation, the Canadian Pakistani actor has had to abandon plans to apply for a visa to work in the US and aim to land gigs there off the back of having the now-cancelled project on her resume.</p>
<p>In their statement about the Sands of Time remake's cancellation, Ubisoft wrote that "while the project had real potential, we weren’t able to reach the level of quality you deserve, and continuing would have required more time and investment than we could responsibly commit". The company also added that they "didn’t want to release something that fell short of what The Sands of Time represents".</p>
<p>"Sadly, the entertainment industry is not really just about entertainment," Ayaz said towards the end of her video. "It's about guaranteeing a cash flow. And that means making decisions that treat people's lives as collateral damage and art as disposable content. I'm not the only person that this decision affects, and it's a really sad thing to see the aversion to risk in the entertainment industry."</p>

              <p><span>Mega Starmie, the long-legged starfish alien(?) mega-evolved Pokémon that debuted in </span><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i><span> has been a surprising breakout star since October. Many fans </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-starmie-patrick-star-jokes-2000636057"><span>couldn’t stand the thing’s goofy design</span></a><span>, but it’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-starmie-jokes-memes-videos-art-2000638556"><span>actually kind of a beast in the game</span></a><span>, so folks are coming around on the meme machine. However, after making its </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-horizons-anime-mega-starmie-friede-episode-2000654235"><span>horrific anime debut</span></a><span>, Mega Starmie has now made its way to another side of the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>community where it has started wreaking havoc: competitive TCG play.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000663535" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000663535"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000663535">© The Pokémon Company / Bulbapedia</figcaption></figure> <p><span>The </span><a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Mega_Starmie_ex_(Nihil_Zero_21)"><span>Mega Starmie ex card</span></a><span> launched as part of the Japanese Nihil Zero booster set last week, and in just a few short days, it’s becoming a staple in competitive tournaments overseas. As </span><a href="https://www.wargamer.com/pokemon-trading-card-game/mega-starmie-ex-decks-winning"><i><span>Wargamer</span></i></a> <span>lays out, the card is consistently helping players place in Japanese tournaments thanks in no small part to its Jet Blow attack, which does a whopping 120 damage to the opponent’s active Pokémon as well as 50 damage to one on their bench. As such, Mega Starmie ex puts constant pressure on your opponents in a way that sounds kind of broken. </span></p>

 <p><span>Some are even using it alongside the </span><a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Risky_Ruins_(Mega_Evolution_127)"><span>Risky Ruins stadium card</span></a><span> which damages monsters on the bench for an additional 20 HP, so you can feasibly wipe out some benched cards pretty quickly with the right combo. Mega Starmie itself is pretty bulky, too, with 330 HP, so knock it off the field can take some time, and by then, you might already have taken too much damage.</span></p> <p><span>Mega Starmie’s off-putting design and weirdly human mannerisms give it the air of an absolute gremlin troublemaker, so I guess it makes sense that every time it shows up in a different </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>game it’s a menace. The Mega Starmie ex card has three variants, including a secret illustration that makes it look like some kind of kaiju monster stomping over a city. It’s fun to see The Pokémon Company leaning into this thing’s chaos energy.</span></p>

              <p>Looking to take health and fitness a bit more seriously in 2026? You need a solid smartwatch by your side to keep track of your goals and monitor your health levels better. Garmin makes some of the top options around, and you can upgrade to its highly-rated Vivoactive 5 without paying the full price.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6902/">That’s thanks to Amazon, as the retailer has knocked an impressive 35% off its usual $300 price, dropping it down to $195</a>. This offer applies to the stunning Ivory version. Some other colors are discounted too, but the prices may vary. For instance, you can grab the Navy model for $200, while the Orchid version is sitting at $191.</p>

<h2>Comes With Over 30 Workout Apps</h2>
<p>This watch flaunts a colorful AMOLED display that’s both bright and spacious. It makes it easy to view your stats in any lighting condition, from bright rooms to dark outdoors. The watch itself is also quite lightweight, so you can comfortably wear it for extended periods.</p>
<p>It’s packed with a wide range of health features. We’re talking body battery monitoring, which helps you see your energy levels throughout the day, and get personal insights into how well you’re resting. There’s a built-in sleep coach that monitors your sleep patterns, and shares tips on improving them over time, plus Heart Rate Variability status for a deeper understanding of your overall wellbeing. You’ll also receive a morning report at the start of your day, as soon as you wake up. These reports include a detailed overview of your recovery, sleep, and daily calendars, which you can use to plan your day accordingly.</p>



<p>Fitness enthusiasts will appreciate the over 30 GPS and indoor sports apps that come built right into the watch. You can use these to record everything from your runs, walking, cycling, and even swimming sessions. Additionally, wheelchair mode tracks pushes instead of steps, and includes push and handcycle activities with preloaded workouts for strength, cardio, HIIT, yoga, and other challenges specific to wheelchair users. The workout benefit and recovery time show how each session affects your body, alongside the time you need to recover. You can even train for marathons using the free adaptive 5K, 10, and half-marathon training plans curated by expert coaches.</p>
<p>When you have the watch connected to your smartphone, you will be able to view all your emails, texts, and alerts right on your wrist. Android users can respond to texts using the on-watch keyboard, as well as view photos shared with you! Other than that, you can manage music and even make contactless payments on the go. Best of all, Vivoactive 5 includes built-in incident detection, which sends your live location automatically to contacts when it notices a fall or crash.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6902/">There’s a lot more to like about this watch, especially now that you can pick it up for just $195</a>. You’re saving $105 on an option that makes it easy to hit fitness goals, plus monitor your health better. Several color options are going for less, so you can pick the one that fits your aesthetics the best. Be sure to act fast, as the retailer might push the price back up any time now!</p>

            <guid>1417645</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-impressions-titanfall-2-apex-multiplayer-shooter-2000663136"><em>Highguard</em></a> is out now after a really weird period of time in which it seemed like everyone had an opinion on a game that we’d only seen two minutes of <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-game-awards-trailer-rust-hero-shooter-interview-2000663137">via a Game Awards finale trailer</a>. Anyway, it’s finally here, and I’ve played about six hours of the new free-to-play FPS so far. While I’m not an expert, I have put enough time in solo and with friends to come to one conclusion: 3 players versus 3 players is a problem.</p> <p>How a match in <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-launch-pc-ps5-free-to-play-servers-is-it-good-titanfall-apex-2000663135"><em>Highguard</em></a> works is that two teams of three spend a bit of time setting up defenses at a base, then everyone rushes out into a big map to find loot, and eventually they all race to a large sword that forms somewhere and which can be used by one team to break into the other’s big base. Then a raid happens, with the attacking team trying to blow up key locations like in a match of <em>Counter-Strike</em> with limited respawns, while the defenders try to take them out and stop the assault. Eventually, one team will win, and the other will lose. These matches can be tense and come down to one awesome play by one player. And this is a problem in a 3v3 format.</p>

  <p>I think a key aspect of online competitive multiplayer games that doesn’t get talked about much is that you need enough players to let people “blame” someone else.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-review-steam-ps5-campaign-multiplayer-2000633379"><em>Battlefield 6</em>,</a> for example, is really good at providing you and your friends plenty of other people you can blame for losses or slow victories. And even <em>Call of Duty</em>, which has smaller lobbies, still has more than 3v3 in most modes, which lets less skilled players feel less pressure to perform perfectly. “It’s okay, there are a few other people. I’m not ruining the match!” And as someone who is good at some shooters and bad at others, being able to blame others or not feel like I’m the sole reason we lost is very helpful.</p>

 <p><em>Highguard’</em>s 3v3 format and focus on tactical teamwork means there’s nowhere for people who are learning or less-skilled players to hide. I had a match in which a teammate I’d been randomly matched with seemed to be still getting the hang of the game, which makes sense as it just launched, but they failed in some team fights and screwed up a key 1v1 battle, and it led to us losing. The other rando I was with wasn’t kind on the mic. Will that less-skilled player want to come back?</p>

 <p>3v3 also just feels like too few people for <em>Highguard’s</em> massive maps. The moment one person splits off, they are likely to run into two or three enemy players if they push too far, and that’s a fight they’ll likely lose. With 4v4 or 5v5, people could split up but still have at least a partner to help. It could make base defense more exciting as you could more evenly split yourselves between the bombs and make rotating less necessary, which would help when playing with no-mic randos.</p> <p>I’m not suggesting that developer Wildlight can just go in, flip a switch and instantly turn <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-already-has-over-7000-negative-reviews-on-steam-2000663220"><em>Highguard</em></a> into a 4v4 or 5v5 game. But, if the team is looking for a way to bring in more players and make it easier for casual shooter fans to enjoy what it offers, I think upping the playercount in a “casual” mode that also contains a few other tweaks could go a long way toward helping <em>Highguard</em> stick around and even grow.</p>
