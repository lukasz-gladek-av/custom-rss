<p>Originally founded in 2008 by ex Retro Studios developers Mark Pacini, Todd Keller, and Jack Mathews, Armature has primarily worked on ports, starting with the PS Vita version of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/psvita/metal_gear_solid_hd_collection">Metal Gear Solid HD Collection</a>.</p>
<p>It soon ventured into the world of VR and was acquired by Meta Platforms in 2022, a company that, at the time, were very keen to put all of its efforts into the metaverse. Now that tech bros around the world are obsessed with AI, Mark Zuckerberg has seen fit to steer away from VR.</p>
<p>The result is the closure of three key VR studios: the aforementioned Armature Studio alongside both Twisted Pixel Games and Sanzaru Games. Overall, around 10% of Meta's Reality Labs division has been laid off.</p>
<p>We sincerely hope the folks at every studio affected find their feet in due course. Heck, maybe Retro Studios can snap up Pacini, Keller, and Matthews again..? We'll have to wait and see.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Kurt Kuhlmann</strong> worked at <strong>Bethesda Game Studios</strong> as a designer for two decades, during which time he was the co-lead designer on <strong><a href="http://wccftech.com/review/skyrim-special-edition-review-when-some-polish-is-not-enough/">The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</a></strong>, a game that could potentially go down in history as the studio's biggest hit ever. He was also known as the series "<em>loremaster</em>," and though he's no longer with Bethesda, in an interview with <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/the-elder-scrolls/bethesdas-former-elder-scrolls-loremaster-on-why-he-left-starfields-communication-breakdowns-and-how-he-wanted-the-elder-scrolls-6-to-be-the-empire-strikes-back/">PC Gamer</a>, Kuhlmann claims he was in line to lead up <strong>The Elder Scrolls VI</strong>, and if he had it his way, we'd be looking at a major <strong>Star Wars</strong>-inspired style of game for the long-awaited entry in the Elder Scrolls series.</p>



<p>Kuhlmann was never officially offered the job of lead designer on The Elder Scrolls VI, but according to him, Bethesda boss <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ai-can-speed-up-game-development-human-intention-is-what-makes-our-stuff-special/">Todd Howard</a></strong> had verbally offered him the role following the completion of Skyrim. In fact, according to Kuhlmann, if not for <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/fallout-76-wearisome-wasteland-wandering/">Fallout 76</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-the-elder-space-scrolls/">Starfield</a></strong>, we would've gotten The Elder Scrolls VI a lot sooner.</p>



<p>"<em>Of course, after <strong>Fallout 4</strong> we didn't go to TES6, we made Fallout 76, and then even then we didn't make TES6, we made Starfield," </em>said Kuhlmann<em>, "which became this extremely long project compared to other ones. So from my point of view, I've been waiting like 11 years to be the lead on TES6</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>I was obviously one of the old-timers there and had a lot of experience. <strong>Bruce [Nesmith]</strong> and I had been the co-leads on Skyrim</em>," Kuhlmann continued, "<em>I think most people would call it a successful project, so I thought that it wasn't unreasonable for me to think that I could be a successful lead on TES6. It wasn't just my expectation—I had been told that that was going to happen</em>. <em>And they made the decision, no, you're not going to be the lead.</em>"</p>



<p>Not being given the lead was what stamped home the reality for Kuhlmann that "<em>what I wanted and what he wanted were different at that point</em>," when it finally came to pass that the studio would focus on The Elder Scrolls VI. That, alongside the fact that Bethesda had grown to a point where it functioned in a way that wasn't compatible with how he preferred to operate, contributed to his leaving in 2023.</p>



<p>But if he had been given the lead, and if he had it his way? The story we would've gotten in his version of the game would've been the "<em>Empire Strikes Back</em>" moment for The Elder Scrolls. </p>



<p>"<em>I had in my mind that TES6 was going to be like The Empire Strikes Back</em>," said Kuhlmann. By the end of it, the Thalmor, the elven supremacists who were on the fringes of Skyrim's story, would've seemed to have won, save for the player doing something at the very end of the story to leave a hopeful, cliffhanger ending that would lead into The Elder Scrolls VII. "<em>So you've preserved hope for the future, but overall it looks like the Thalmor are on the march</em>."</p>



<p>Kuhlmann admits that he doesn't believe his idea would've gone far with the rest of the team. Making a game is not like making a movie. After waiting more than a decade for The Elder Scrolls VI, if it ended with evil winning, and a cliffhanger for good potentially succeeding in the next game, which could very well be another decade away, players might not have appreciated it as much as Kuhlmann. "<em>That's not a good way to end a game and say, yeah, we'll see you in 10, 15 years</em>," Kuhlmann said.</p>



<p>Still, it's interesting to hear Kuhlmann's side of the story, and to hear a little more insight into The Elder Scrolls VI, which we've not seen hide nor hair of <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-vi-starfield-announced/">since its far-too-early reveal back in <strong>2018</strong></a>. Now that Starfield is out of the way, at least we know the studio is working on it, as Todd Howard and other Bethesda executives <a href="https://wccftech.com/bethesda-speaks-on-the-elder-scrolls-vi-development-can-confirm-its-going/">can say nothing more than "<em>it's going</em>"</a> and that <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-vi-still-a-long-way-off-says-todd-howard/">the game is still "<em>a long way off</em>"</a> when it comes to the game's development progress.</p>



<p>And while Kuhlmann may be right that players wouldn't have loved his Empire Strikes Back, the reality is that no matter what Bethesda does, it won't be able to live up to expectations, as former Bethesda artist <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-do-you-beat-that-why-the-elder-scrolls-vi-is-in-a-no-win-situation/"><strong>Nate Purkeypile</strong> rightly calls the game a "<em>no-win</em>" situation</a>. </p>

              <p><span>The ongoing battle between </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/how-cory-in-the-house-ds-went-from-bad-forgotten-game-1842525482"><i><span>Cory in the House</span></i></a><span> and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-rpg-review-in-progress-1851777402"><i><span>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</span></i></a><span> to decide which will ultimately be crowned the top user-rated game on Metacritic rages on, but an unforeseen consequence of the conflict has resulted in second-hand copies of the Nintendo DS Disney game skyrocketing in price in online marketplaces.</span></p> <p><span>As </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-metacritic-cory-in-the-house-ds-game-2000659380"><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span> first reported on Tuesday</span></a><span>, something strange was brewing over on Reddit: a seemingly organic campaign to get the long-memed 2008 Nintendo DS game </span><i><span>Cory in the House</span></i><span> to the top of Metacritic’s user-rated rankings and beat 2025’s GOTY. </span><span>When I originally reported on the story, </span><i><span>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</span></i><span>, the current top-ranked user-rated game on the platform, had just dipped from a 9.6 to a 9.5. </span><i><span>Cory in the House </span></i><span>had just risen from 9.3 to 9.4. The meme was about to become a reality.</span></p>

 <p><span>Since then, things have simultaneously changed drastically and also somehow stayed exactly the same. </span><i><span>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</span></i><span> is still clinging on to a 9.5 rating, but </span><i><span>Cory in the House</span></i><span> is back down to a 9.3. </span><span>The big change is in the number of ratings on Metacritic. I made a note on the 13th that the PS5 version of</span><i><span> Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</span></i><span> had roughly 23,351 ratings. Now it has 23,654 user ratings. On the other hand, </span><i><span>Cory in the House</span></i><span> had roughly 2,400 ratings on the same date. Now that’s climbed up to whopping </span><a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/disney-cory-in-the-house/"><span>4,666 user ratings</span></a><span>. Actually, nevermind, I typed that and then immediately refreshed the page. Now it’s up to 4,684.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">As a result of users flooding metacritic &amp; pushing the game to the #2 spot of all time, sealed copies of Cory In The House have skyrocketed by more than 3000% in the past 2 weeks. <a href="https://t.co/nlVkLGWP0V">pic.twitter.com/nlVkLGWP0V</a></p> <p>— Resell News 💸 (@resellnews) <a href="https://twitter.com/resellnews/status/2011945080198930695?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 15, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>The point is, the focus is less on review-bombing </span><i><span>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</span></i><span>, as some had assumed, and more on reverse review-bombing </span><i><span>Cory in the House. </span></i><span>That also probably goes some way toward explaining the recent meme-fueled price increases for physical copies of the Nintendo DS game on eBay. </span><span>The first writer to spot this story seems to have been </span><a href="https://www.cllct.com/sports-collectibles/auctions/cory-in-the-house-meme-makes-video-game-flop-a-collectible-hit"><span>Cllct’s Will Stern</span></a><span>.

              <p>The<em> Inverse</em> gaming section is dead. Four staff, including Deputy Editor Shannon Liao, were laid off from the website on Friday as it reportedly “divests from gaming.” It’s a shift that comes as owner Bustle Digital Group pivots to being an “influencer company,” whatever that is.</p> <p>Launched in 2015 by Dave Nemetz, who previously co-founded <em>Bleacher Report</em>,<em> Inverse</em> began life primarily as a tech and science website before later pivoting to entertainment and gaming. It will seemingly now only cover movies and TV as the gaming side of its masthead has been wiped out. Several staff, including Liao, shared the news on Bluesky.</p>

 <p>“After flying back from Vegas last week, I was just laid off from <em>Inverse</em> today,” she <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/shannonliao.bsky.social/post/3mcki3gpiy22o">wrote</a>. “<em>Inverse</em>‘s gaming section is being shut down as the company ‘divests’ from gaming content.

Last February, it was being <a href="https://www.curbed.com/article/bryan-goldberg-bustle-digital-media-back-rent-lawsuit.html">sued for $3 million</a> it allegedly owed in back rent.&nbsp;CEO Bryan Goldberg, who also co-founded <em>Bleacher Report</em>, <a href="https://www.adweek.com/media/bdg-targeting-record-profits/">then announced in May</a> that profits were soaring and the company’s cost-cutting era was behind it.</p>

 <p>By the fall, however, he was pitching the investor world on a new pivot. “We are the next generation influence company,” Goldberg <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/10/14/bdg-media-bustle-scary-mommy-nylon">told<em> Axios</em></a> last October. The idea was to turn style and clothing audience members into cash-generating influencers by giving them special access to brands. The whole thing still sounds really weird, but apparently 12,000 people applied. It’s basically the unpaid blogger network that <em>Bleacher Report</em> pioneered, but for Instagram.</p>

<p>It seems that the worlds of Fortnite and Fall Guys are going to collide again as a new collaboration has been teased. </p>



<p>A lot of rumours around Fortnite collaborations have been surfacing lately, with names like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-office-x-fortnite-collaboration-could-be-coming-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Office</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-rumored-to-be-working-on-a-minecraft-collab/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Minecraft</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-x-chainsaw-man-could-be-the-next-anime-collaboration-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chainsaw Man</a>, and more popping up. However, these were just rumours; now we have a confirmed collaboration on the way, and it’s with a game that Fortnite has already collaborated with in the past. </p>







<h2 id="h-fall-guys-mention-a-ball-in-fortnite-collaboration-tease">Fall Guys Mention ‘A Ball’ in Fortnite Collaboration Tease</h2>



<p>The confirmation of the 2026 collaboration between Fortnite and Fall Guys comes via an <a href="https://x.com/FallGuysGame/status/2012164984047120647" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> post (formerly Twitter) from the latter. The post states, “Beans caught practicing… something involving a ball. Might want to keep an eye on this, Fortnite.” Players have already started speculating what the “ball” could mean, with some guessing it’s basketball-related, while others think it could be related to other sports that involve a ball. </p>

<p>Fortnite and Fall Guys collaborated back in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-fall-guys-collab/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2024</a>, through the ‘Where We Fallin’ event. In this special event, players had to find a Golden Bean Idol, which would then transform them into a Fall Guys bean and let them compete in an obstacle course in the sky. Players would earn Gold, Silver, or Bronze tier loot based on how quickly they complete the course.</p>



<p>The Fall Guys collaboration also made it to Creative, where players could not only create their own obstacle-course-filled islands but also explore 6 Islands published by Mediatonic. </p>







<p>In other news, check out the Fortnite update 39.20 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-39-20-patch-notes-january-9/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">patch notes</a>, which introduced the South Park collab to the game.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Bethesda’s former Elder Scrolls loremaster has revealed his idea for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-vi">The Elder Scrolls 6</a> story, and how it would have set up The Elder Scrolls 7.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an interview with <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/the-elder-scrolls/bethesdas-former-elder-scrolls-loremaster-on-why-he-left-starfields-communication-breakdowns-and-how-he-wanted-the-elder-scrolls-6-to-be-the-empire-strikes-back/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PC Gamer</a> discussing his dissatisfaction with working at Bethesda and subsequent departure from the company following the release of Starfield, Kurt Kuhlmann said if he had got the chance to lead The Elder Scrolls 6 it would have been like the beloved Star Wars movie The Empire Strikes Back.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kuhlmann, who left Bethesda in 2023 after more than 20 years at the studio, said that in his story the elven supremacists the Thalmor would not only have been the big bad of The Elder Scrolls 6, but they would have ended the game on the road to victory. This, he said, would have turned Elder Scrolls’ long-running ‘player is the chosen one’ who achieves a definitive victory at the end of the game plot on its head, saying that while you would have “preserved hope for the future” by the end of The Elder Scrolls 6, “overall it looks like the Thalmor are on the march.”</p><span data-cy="faceoff-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">The problem, Kuhlmann said, is that he doubts Bethesda would go for an Elder Scrolls game with a “bad” ending such as this, and a cliffhanger is "completely unfeasible" because it takes so long for Bethesda to release new mainline games in the fantasy series. "That's not a good way to end a game and say, yeah, we'll see you in 10, 15 years,” he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Alas, Kuhlmann’s idea is just that: an idea, and it’s unlikely that the actual storyline of The Elder Scrolls 6 will turn out to be anything like it. As for when we’ll find out, it could be some time yet. Last year, amid increasing pressure from fans for some information on the game, Howard said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/im-preaching-patience-the-elder-scrolls-6-is-still-a-long-way-off-todd-howard-warns-fans-teases-potential-shadowdrop"><u>The Elder Scrolls 6 wouldn’t be out for some time</u></a>. In an interview with <a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/fallout-4-anniversary-todd-howard-interview" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>GQ magazine</u></a> to celebrate the release of Fallout 4 Anniversary Edition, Howard said The Elder Scrolls 6 is “still a long way off,” adding: “I’m preaching patience. I don’t want fans to feel anxious.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">More recently, speaking to <a href="https://gameinformer.com/exclusive-interview/2025/12/16/bethesda-gives-us-an-update-on-the-elder-scrolls-vi-development" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Game Informer</u></a>, studio design director Emil Pagliarulo pointed to GTA 6’s high-profile delays as the “smartest thing they could do.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“What do fans really want?” he asked. “Do they want a game that comes out before it should and doesn’t meet their expectations? Or do they want the turkey that is in the oven for long enough to be delicious when it finally comes out of the oven, you know? That’s what I think people are going to want. So, we’re going to take our time and as long as it needs to be great.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN Elder Scrolls Review</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this month, former veteran Bethesda developer Nate Purkeypile said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/im-sure-there-will-be-more-death-threats-again-former-bethesda-dev-wonders-how-the-elder-scrolls-6-will-meet-expectations-after-top-10-game-of-all-time-skyrim">Bethesda may get “hateful comments” even if <u>The Elder Scrolls 6</u> ends up just being as good as Skyrim</a>, which he considers to be one of the top 10 games of all time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In January last year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-6-announcement-is-now-as-old-as-skyrim-was-when-the-elder-scrolls-6-was-announced"><u>The Elder Scrolls 6 announcement became as old as predecessor Skyrim was when The Elder Scrolls 6 was announced</u></a>. Skyrim was released on November 11, 2011, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/06/11/e3-2018-the-elder-scrolls-vi-announced-at-bethesda-press-conference"><u>The Elder Scrolls 6 was revealed on June 10, 2018</u></a> — 2,403 days afterwards. It is now seven-and-a-half years since the announcement, and we’re no closer, it seems, to the release of the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When the six-year anniversary of The Elder Scrolls 6 announcement arrived in June 2024, even Bethesda chief Todd <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-6-teaser-is-now-6-years-old-and-even-todd-howard-paused-to-say-oh-wow-that-has-been-a-while"><u>Howard paused to say, "oh wow, that has been a while."</u></a> The Elder Scrolls 6 is at least in production, with Bethesda confirming <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-6-officially-in-early-development-but-dont-expect-to-hear-about-it-soon"><u>it had entered "early development" in August 2023</u></a> and "early builds" were available in March 2024.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Purkeypile said he assumed Bethesda announced The Elder Scrolls 6 so early because the studio was announcing Starfield at a time when it had already been so long since Skyrim came out, so “we needed to make sure people were not just pissed at us.” He continued: “it’s a very expensive way to do that, though. Those trailers are not cheap.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <p>Julian Gerighty, a long-time key cog at Massive Entertainment, has announced that he's departing the Ubisoft-owned studio after 12 years to go and work on Battlefield at EA. His departure swiftly follows Ubisoft <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/having-asked-division-devs-to-lay-themselves-off-ubisoft-are-now-cutting-55-jobs-at-massive-and-ubisoft-stockholm">revealing earlier this week</a> that they're planning to lay off staff at Massive, with a voluntary redundancy process late last year reportedly having not resulted in enough departures to stave off this bloodletting.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the publishers have opted to take the opportunity of Gerighty's departure to reassure folks that The Division series is just fine.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"While we’ll miss him, his mark will live on at Massive and we’ll continue to bring the world he’s been part of creating to our players for years to come,” Ubisoft wrote in <a href="https://x.com/UbiMassive/status/2012157010784186856">said statement</a>. "For our players, don’t worry, Agents. Our teams who built this world with Julian are still here, carrying it forward with an ambitious, unchanged commitment for the future with The Division 2, The Division 2: Survivors, The Division Resurgence and The Division 3."</p>
<p>"It's time for me to hang up my go bag (keeping the watch) as I go on another grand adventure," Gerighty wrote in his own <a href="https://x.com/jgerighty/status/2012156450039033939">departure tweet</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Deadpool, Marvel’s merc with a mouth who loves to spout off meta jokes and wink at the camera, is the kind of gimmick character that can come together like a spectacular, fourth-wall-breaking fireworks show or </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/deadpool-vr-is-a-game-for-deadpool-fans-and-nobody-else-2000645514"><span>be so grating and obnoxious</span></a><span> that he can push you away from a project entirely.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>In </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-review-hero-shooter-overwatch-netease-1851717975"><i><span>Marvel Rivals</span></i></a><span>, Wade Wilson can’t just hijack the whole game with his antics; he has to synergize with the established dynamics of other heroes’ tool kits and banter. As such, developer NetEase has found a ton of really smart and funny ways to slot Deadpool into the game that are additive, rather than disruptive. And yes, he drops a fair amount of fun pop culture references to media both in and out of the Marvel universe.</span></p>

 <p><span>Deadpool’s in-game abilities and behavior </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/deadpool-marvel-rivals-role-fourth-wall-break-meta-2000659834"><span>include numerous nods to his tendency to break the fourth wall</span></a><span>, with comic-book-style panels and pop-ups often appearing around him, </span><a href="https://x.com/HoshizoraTTV/status/2012008202855203157"><span>in-character ability descriptions</span></a><span> that you can swap to the straightforward, “emotionless” descriptions written by the NetEase team for clarity’s sake if you prefer, and even the ability to have conversations with announcer Galacta.</span></p>

    <p><span>His banter with </span><i><span>Marvel Rivals</span></i><span>’ other heroes is full of nods to pretty much every facet of the Marvel multimedia franchise. He makes references to the </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/8EaW9rnSJNc"><i><span>Rivals</span></i><span> community leakers</span></a><span> and memes as well as to the MCU’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/avengers-doomsday-teaser-leak-thor-doom-trailer-avatar-2000654848"><span>fumbling multiverse saga</span></a><span>, and there’s also an </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/waHFQEfGY-c"><span>“It’s Morbin’ Time!” line</span></a><span> referencing the notorious Sony</span> <span>flop </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/morbius-memes-twitch-movie-morbing-time-nintendo-switch-1848987370"><i><span>Morbius</span></i></a><span>. As </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-is-desperate-to-make-avengers-doomsday-the-biggest-event-of-2026-2000659295"><span>pretentious and self-important as Marvel has become</span></a><span> in the past 20 years as its movies have shifted pop culture, Deadpool does usually act as a reminder that someone in the writing room is paying attention to the criticism people have been levying at the franchise for years now. Even </span><i><span>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine</span></i><span> was </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/x-men-movies-best-worst-ranked-deadpool-logan-wolverine-1851595435"><span>taking shots at the MCU from the inside</span></a><span>.</span></p>

   <p><span>But it’s not all Marvel references. It’s fitting that in a video game Deadpool would borrow lines from series like </span><i><span>Pok</span></i><i><span>é</span></i><i><span>mon</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Grand Theft Auto</span></i><span>, and </span><i><span>Super Mario</span></i><span>. There’s some stuff from other media as well, like </span><i><span>Spongebob Squarepants</span></i><span>. From the looks of it, voice actor Alejandro Saab ad-libbed several of these lines and “can’t believe” that NetEase kept them in the game. Oh, and you’ll also find some memes like “67” and “Hawk Tuah” in the mix. The “67” one is </span><a href="https://x.com/nerdyomniman/status/2011606344210792595"><span>pretty clever, at least</span></a><span>, and can’t be spammed like the one in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-soldier-76-6-7-emote-season-20-release-date-2000651668"><span>another hero shooter</span></a><span>.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY KEPT ALL OF THIS!

                <p>The Italian Competition Authority is investigating Activision Blizzard over claims that the mobile games Diablo Immortal and Call of Duty Mobile engage in "misleading and aggressive practices."</p><p><a href="https://en.agcm.it/en/media/press-releases/2026/1/PS13020-PS13039" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The watchdog said</a> the games are structured in such a way to encourage people to "play more often, extend their gaming sessions, and take up promoted offers" through "the possible use of deceptive user-interface design."</p><p>"Examples include repeated prompts, both during and outside gameplay, urging users not to miss out on rewards--also through in-app messages and push notifications--as well as to purchase time-limited items before they become unavailable," the group said.</p><p>"These practices, together with strategies that make it difficult for users to understand the real value of the virtual currency used in the game and the sale of in-game currency in bundles, may influence players as consumers--including minors--leading them to spend significant amounts, sometimes exceeding what is necessary to progress in the game and without being fully aware of the expenditure involved."</p><p>The group further claims that the parental controls in Diablo Immortal and Call of Duty Mobile default to options "that offer a lower level of protection for minors," including allowing in-game purchases, social features, and "unlimited play time."</p><p>The Italian Competition Authority also said it wants to look into how Diablo Immortal and Call of Duty Mobile go about collecting personal data. "It seems that consumers--including minors--are led to select all consent options, including consent to profiling for commercial purposes, in the belief that they are faced with a mandatory choice," the group said.</p><p>GameSpot has reached out to Activision Blizzard for comment. The company and its franchises are now owned by Microsoft following the company's blockbuster $75.4 billion buyout.</p>

            <p>Senior producer for The Division series Julian Gerighty has announced his departure from Ubisoft, heading over to Battlefield Studios.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/UbiMassive/status/2012157010784186856">In a statement posted to social media</a>, the official Massive Entertainment account posted its fond farewells to Gerighty. It reads: "Today we want to share that Julian Gerighty, executive producer on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tom-clancys-the-division">Tom Clancy's The Division</a> franchise is heading off on to a new adventure at Battlefield Studios. While we will miss him, his mark will live on at Massive and we'll continue to bring the world he's been part of creating to our players for years to come.</p>
<p>"Julian, your legacy is part of this studio and remember: once an Agent, always an Agent."</p>

<p>This post ends with a short paragraph reassuring fans of The Division that the series will be left in good hands now that Gerighty is leaving, concluding: "Our teams who built this world with Julian are still here, carrying it forward with ambitious, unchanged commitment for the future with The Division 2, The Division 2: Survivors, The Division Resurgence and The Division 3."</p><p><a href="https://x.com/i/status/2012156450039033939">Gerighty himself posted a personal update</a>, stating: "It's time for me to hang up my go bag (keeping the watch) as I go on another grand adventure. The Division future burns bright, and I can't wait for you to discover what the teams have been working on. Long live The Division"</p>
<p>This news comes only a few months after <a href="https://x.com/UbiMassive/status/1979546362405351487">Massive Entertainment had to curb rumours that Gerighty was leaving the company</a>, and just one week after <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE_C1ueUnss">he took part in an interview during the New Game + showcase</a>. During this interview he described The Division 3 as "a monster", and shared his belief it would have: "as big of an impact as The Division 1".</p>
<p>Despite this peculiar timing, it does appear as if both Massive Entertainment and Julian are leaving on good terms. Which is nice, we should all be so lucky. The Division 3, the project he is leaving behind, still hasn't got a release date are <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-quietly-confirms-its-working-on-the-division-3">remains a bit of a mystery over at Ubisoft and Massive</a>. One wonders if we'll be seeing it soon...</p>

<p>While the free ver. 3.0 update arrived a little earlier than expected for <em>all</em> users (Switch 1 <em>and</em> 2), yesterday marked the big release of Nintendo's latest paid Switch 2 upgrade. This one includes a resolution bump, the new Megaphone item, Mouse Mode integration, and beefed-up online capabilities to make the most of GameChat.</p>
<p>It's something of a slight package, considering there's no free path between the two (it'll only set you back £4.19 / $4.99 to upgrade, but still), and that was our Alex's biggest gripe in his <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition">6/10 review</a>. "It makes things a bit prettier, has a few more options to take advantage of the console’s new features," he wrote, "but all in all, it’s not an especially exciting upgrade".</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:196240 @ 1768586314 -->
<p>But of course, this is Animal Crossing: New Horizons that we're talking about, perhaps <em>the</em> defining game of the Switch generation, so we want to hear what you think too.</p>
<p>Whether you've spent the whole day getting to grips with the latest addition to the NS2E lineup, or you're just diving in for the first time, you can tell us what you make of the upgrade in the following poll. And don't worry if you want to change your mind later on, you can come back whenever and do exactly that!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>On the onset of this year's edition of <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">CES</strong>, NVIDIA took advantage of one of the key tech shows of the year to <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-5-6x-mfg-240hz-gaming-400-games-available-on-all-rtx-gpus/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">introduce NVIDIA DLSS 4.5</strong></a> which, in its early iteration, left pretty much everyone <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">stunned</strong>, delivering in <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-5-in-quality-mode-delivers-better-image-quality-than-native-resolution-in-red-dead-redemption-2/"><strong>Quality mode better than native resolution quality in <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Red Dead Redemption 2</em></strong></a> and<a href="https://wccftech.com/this-really-puts-a-nail-in-amd-fsr-redstones-coffin-clair-obscur-expedition-33-nvidia-dlss-4-5-performance-mode-stuns-with-image-quality-close-to-native-4k/"><strong> close to native resolution image quality in Performance mode in <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33.</em></strong></a></p>



<p>The impressive image quality, however, comes at a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">performance cost</strong> on previous-generation <strong>RTX 20 and 30 series GPUs</strong>, as older-generation cards lack <strong>FP8 support</strong>, which NVIDIA DLSS 4.5 leverages to deliver its stunning results. However, the performance hit may not be as severe as expected on some older GPUs, such as the RTX 3080.</p>



<p>A new comparison video shared on YouTube by <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://www.youtube.com/@MxBenchmarkPC"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">MxBenchmark PC</strong></a> compares <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">Cyberpunk 2077</strong></em> running at 4K, 1440p, and 1090p resolutions at Ultra Settings and with ray tracing with Ultra Performance mode at 4K resolution, Balanced mode at 1440p resolution, and Quality mode at 1080p resolution using the following presets:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>DLSS 3 - Preset E</strong></li>



<li><strong>DLSS 4 - Preset K</strong></li>



<li><strong>DLSS 4.5 - Preset L for Ultra Performance and Preset M for everything else</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>The results are, as YouTube user darknuance_ix put it, <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"not bad at all."</em> While the <strong>performance hit is noticeable</strong>, it's, on average, <strong>lower than expected</strong> - in the <strong>8, 12 FPS range at all resolutions</strong> from NVIDIA DLSS 3 to DLSS 4.5. </p>



<p>As such, the latest version of the upscaler powered by the 2nd-generation Transformer model may still be a viable option for those still rocking RTX 20 and 30 series cards, who also have the option of setting a lower base resolution and still enjoy excellent image quality to offset the performance loss, although how effective this will be will obviously vary depending on the game.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/gryphline-announces-arknights-endfield-pc-beta-test-system-requirements-revealed/">After multiple beta tests</a>, publisher <strong>Gryphline</strong> and developer <strong>Mountain Contour's</strong> action RPG and factory management game, <strong>Arknights: Endfield</strong>, is finally due to launch globally next week on <strong>January 22, 2026,</strong> and over <strong>35 million players are pre-registered</strong> and ready for its arrival.</p>



<p>The news came along with a new launch trailer that you can see below, which, based on its comments, is more than successful at getting players hyped up for next week's launch. While the release date was initially revealed at <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/tga/">The Game Awards</a></strong> with a live performance <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Xm45NwWOlo">from <strong>One Republic</strong> performing the song featured in the trailer below,</a> at the time of that performance, the game only had 30 million players pre-registered.</p>



<p>This means the game received another <strong>5 million</strong> pre-registrations over the holiday period, which also unlocked the final tier of community rewards for players, <a href="https://endfield.gryphline.com/en-us#milestone">per the game's official website</a>.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Alongside the hype trailer above, Gryphline and Mountain Contour also released two more trailers. An Operator story trailer titled "<em>The Five: Sparks that Shatter the Darkness</em>," and a gameplay trailer that shows off a bit of the action and environments players can expect when they jump into the free-to-play action RPG next week. Here's the story trailer:</p>

</p></figure>



<p>After Arknights: Endfield's last beta test, Wccftech's Kai Tatsumoto not only got a chance to go hands-on with the upcoming action RPG, but he also got to speak with the game's lead designer and producer. In his preview, Kai wrote, "<em>Being an entirely new genre and set in the far future from the original game, Arknights: Endfield aims to be something that can draw brand new players in that might have otherwise overlooked the original tower defense game. The gacha action RPG genre has become competitive in recent years, but Endfield’s AAA presentation and emphasis on base building might do well to set it apart from the competition</em>."</p>

              <p>Kathleen Kennedy, who helped produce and create films like <em>Jurassic Park, E.T., </em>and <em>Indiana Jones,</em> is <a href="https://gizmodo.com/dave-filoni-lucasfilm-kathleen-kennedy-2000706230">officially stepping down</a> from her role as Lucasfilm president after holding the position since George Lucas left following the Disney deal in 2012. And in a new interview with Kennedy, the longtime producer and filmmaker shared some updates on various<em> Star Wars</em> projects, and the one <em>Star Wars</em> project that left her with regrets.</p> <p>On January 15, after announcing her departure from Lucasfilm, <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/01/kathleen-kennedy-exit-interview-1236665253/"><em>Deadline</em> posted a lengthy interview</a> with the outgoing producer and president covering a whole lot of ground. Depressingly, Kennedy seems to be excited about AI and wants to work with the tech to make new stuff. She also told the outlet that she’s been planning this exit for a few years now and hand-picked her successors, <em>Clone Wars</em> creator Dave Filoni and veteran ILM manager Lynwen Brennan. And while she’ll still be around producing future <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-best-and-worst-parts-of-every-star-wars-movie-1850406311"><em>Star Wars</em> movies</a>, including Ryan Gosling’s <em>Starfight</em>er and the upcoming <em>Mandalorian and Grogu</em> flick, it’s clear from this interview that Kennedy was tired of Disney not wanting to take more risks on projects like <em>Andor</em>.</p>

 <h2>A new <em>Star Wars</em> trilogy and an update on the Ben Solo movie</h2> <p>Perhaps the biggest news to come out of this interview is Kennedy sharing the status of various<em> Star Wars</em> movie projects and<a href="https://deadline.com/2025/02/kathleen-kennedy-clarifies-lucasfilm-exit-star-wars-future-1236304421/"> confirming that the previously announced <em>Star Wars </em>trilogy</a> being led by screenwriter Simon Kinberg is still happening, at least for now.</p>

 <p>“<a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-celebration-ashoka-trailer-rey-new-jedi-order-1850313084#:~:text=Plus%20two%20more,%2C%20%5Band%5D%20Ashoka.%E2%80%9D">[James] Mangold’s is really on the back burner</a>, as is Soderbergh’s [Ben Solo film],” Kennedy told the outlet. “I think the ones by Taika and Donald [Glover] are still somewhat alive. That’s going to really be up to the new team to figure out. Dave, I know that Dave [Filoni] and Lynwen [Brennan] are very much on board with what Simon [Kinnberg]’s doing, and that would be a new trilogy. In the timeline of things, that takes you well into 2030 plus. So that’s really what’s up next.”</p>

 <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-trilogy-skywalker-saga-episode-10-11-12-kinbe-1851692144">It was previously reported that this new <em>Star Wars</em> trilogy</a> wouldn’t be connected to the <em>Skywalker Saga</em>, but it is also possible that things have changed. Kennedy makes it clear in this interview that putting together <em>Star Wars</em> movies takes many years of dedication, and a lot of directors and filmmakers aren’t willing to commit to such an undertaking. That likely explains the large number of canceled and delayed <em>Star Wars</em> movies over the last seven years or so. As for the status of Kinberg’s first film in this new trilogy, it doesn’t sound close to filming at all.</p>

 <p>“[Kinberg is] working right now.,” said Kennedy. “He wrote something that we read in August, and it was very good, but not there. We’ve pretty much upended the story, and then spent a great deal of time on the treatment, which he finished literally about four weeks ago. And it’s a very detailed treatment, like 70 pages. And so he is expected to give us something in March.”</p>

 <p>I wouldn’t get too excited about this trilogy yet. Remember that Rian Johnson, who directed <em>The Last Jedi,</em> was tapped to direct a new trilogy of films after his 2017 <em>Star Wars</em> movie was a big hit. But according to Kennedy, the negative firestorm online scared him away, and he got distracted with <em>Knives Out</em> and its sequels. So who knows if this new trilogy will happen anytime soon or ever.</p>

 <h2>Regrets and concerns about studios being too afraid of risk</h2> <p>Elsewhere in the interview, Kennedy called the script for the <a href="https://kotaku.com/disney-killed-adam-drivers-cool-star-wars-movie-for-the-dumbest-reason-2000637628">Ben Solo movie</a>, whose existence was leaked publicly by Adam Driver last year and got fans very excited, “great.” And it could still happen, according to her. “Anything’s a possibility if somebody’s willing to take a risk.” However, that seems unlikely as the longtime Lucasfilm boss explained that, at the moment, Disney and other big studios aren’t interested in taking bold swings and big risks.</p> <p>“Right now we’re in an era where companies are so risk-averse, and I get it,” said Kennedy. “I hear all the conversations. They’ve got Wall Street to please, and I get it, but I also believe that that’s what contributes to things disappearing, ultimately. I just think you have to take those chances. Everything I just reeled off to you is taking a bit of a chance because none of those filmmakers are just walking in trying to do the same old, same old. I’m excited by that, but the studio’s nervous about that, and that’s kind of where it sits at the moment.”</p> <p>And as for whether she has any regrets from her time as president of Lucasfilm, <a href="https://kotaku.com/what-we-liked-and-didnt-like-about-solo-1826489974">Kennedy listed the 2018 <em>Solo</em> spin-off movie</a> as the only one because, according to her, they tried to replace Harrison Ford, and that was always going to be a nearly impossible challenge.</p> <p>“We were so excited about that idea,” said Kennedy. “And then when you’re into something, and you realize fundamentally, conceptually, you cannot replace Han Solo, at least right now. As wonderful as Alden Ehrenreich was, and he really was good, and is a wonderful actor, we put him in an impossible situation. And once you’re in it and once you’re committed, you’ve got to carry on. I think I have a bit of regret about that, but not about the moviemaking and filmmaking. I don’t have regrets about that. I just think that conceptually, we did it too soon.”</p>

		<p>Clawing its way to the number one spot as our most wanted video game of 2026, <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/marvels-wolverine">Marvel’s Wolverine</a> has carved up the competition as <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/ratchet-clank">Ratchet &amp; Clank</a> and <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/marvels-spider-man">Spider-Man</a> developer, <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/insomniac-games">Insomniac Games</a>, prepares to show us more of this hugely anticipated PlayStation exclusive.</p>
<p>With <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/sony">Sony</a>’s release schedule having looked a little light in terms of first party blockbusters, the company is no doubt hoping that lighting will strike twice following the mammoth commercial success of its web-slinging Spider-Man series. However, instead of taking that tried and tested open world formula fuelling these games and applying it to a different superhero, Insomniac is going for a change in not only genre, but tone as well.</p>
<p><iframe title="Marvel’s Wolverine - Gameplay Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s3pDMUWlA6I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Marvel’s Wolverine looks set to be the grittiest, most mature game the studio has worked on since the Resistance trilogy on PlayStation 3. It makes sense, really: to try and sanitise a comic book character so steeped in violence and bloodshed would be absurd, but that’s not to say Wolverine won’t be as visually rich or character-driven as the recent trio of Spider-Man adventures.</p>
<p>James “Logan” Howlett requires no introduction. With his trademark claws and superhuman healing factor, he’s the perfect protagonist for a combat-heavy action game, with a rogue’s gallery of villains to slice and dice his way through. For those who remember, 2009’s X-Men Origins video game tie-in was one of the best of its era, though the action genre has changed a lot, especially since the early 2010s.</p>

<p>We’ve yet to see a full combat demo though it’s hard to imagine Insomniac passing up the opportunity to craft another clever, layered web of gameplay mechanics which embodies what the lead character is best known for. We’re expecting acrobatic lunges, spinning claws, and some rather gnarly takedowns as teased in Sony’s most recent trailer.</p>

<p>Part of what made Marvel’s Spider-Man such a big hit was its refusal to cart out yet another adaptation of his origin story. While Wolverine’s own past has been explored numerous times in movies (without mentioning the myriad comic book arcs over the years) there’s plenty there for gamers to sink their claws into without it being overly familiar. From what we’ve seen and heard, it appears as though Marvel’s Wolverine will visit various flashpoints in the character’s life, including his escape from Weapon X, his pursuit of a quiet life in Canada, and a trip to Madripoor.</p>
<p>We also know who will play Wolverine in this upcoming video game adaptation with Liam McIntyre lending his gravelly voice to the X-Men legend. Speaking of X-Men, what we’re perhaps most excited for is seeing how other famous faces make their way into the game with Mystique and Omega Red due to make an appearance. If Sony is going all-in on creating a Marvel gaming universe, it will also be interesting to see how this game links back to Spider-Man.</p>
<p>There’s no launch date for Marvel’s Wolverine just yet though we’re expecting it to land sometime in the second half of 2026, perhaps even looking to capitalise on the snowballing excitement surrounding Avenger’s Doomsday and its December theatrical release.</p>

            <p>According to long-time Bethesda developer and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a> co-lead designer Kurt Kuhlmann, he was originally told he'd be leading the charge on basting the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-elder-scrolls-6-is-progressing-really-well-bethesda-shout-from-the-kitchen-as-they-baste-a-gta-shaped-turkey">great turkey</a> that is the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-6">The Elder Scrolls 6</a>. That didn't end up coming to pass and, having left Bethesda back in 2023, the developer's now spilled the beans as to the sort of story he envisioned the follow-up to The Elder Scrolls 6 telling.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>According to Kuhlmann in a chat with <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/the-elder-scrolls/bethesdas-former-elder-scrolls-loremaster-on-why-he-left-starfields-communication-breakdowns-and-how-he-wanted-the-elder-scrolls-6-to-be-the-empire-strikes-back/">PC Gamer</a>, Todd Howard verbally promised him this role in the aftermath Skyrim's release. At that point, a return to the Elder Scrolls was pencilled in to be next up once <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a> was out of the door - the studio instead ended up taking lengthy detours to make <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/starfield">Starfield</a>.</p>
<p>"It wasn't just my expectation - I had been told that that was going to happen. And they made the decision, no, you're not going to be the lead." Kuhlmann recalled. "So, Todd said, 'Well, we want you to have an important role in the project.' But what I wanted and what he wanted were different at that point." While he does cite it as a factor in his decision to leave Bethesda for his current gig, alongside changes in the likes of communication process during development that the company's growth in size over time has brought about, the developer said with hindsight that he reckons he might not have enjoyed being lead on the game.</p>
<p>As for the direction he might have taken its story in had he been in charge of shaping that, Kuhlmann pointed to The Empire Strikes Back. As Skyrim's events heavily foreshadow, the Thalmor-led Aldmeri Dominion - lead by elven supremacists seeking control over all of Tamriel - would be making more strides towards that goal. Rather than being an all-powerful "chosen one" directly standing up to this enemy, the player would instead have more lowkey role, with the ending involving them keeping hope for an eventual victory in a future Elder Scrolls entry by succeeding in a task like keeping a handy heir alive.</p><p>However, that last part is something the developer's not sure would have worked or gotten the thumbs up, since it leans into unhappy ending or cliffhanger territory, with the pace of game releases nowadays making ending on such notes for a game this size a potentially unpopular choice.</p>
<p>All in all, the broad strokes Kuhlmann outlines for his story are the sort of path I've long seen Skyrim as pointing the series' narrative in, minus perhaps the protagonist's power being limited to 'person who can't use world-shattering abilities to destroy the bad right now'. Whether that would have made for a great Elder Scrolls game is something we'll likely never know unless the dev has just accidentally revealed what happens to be Bethesda's current plan too.</p>
<p>My money's very much on an adventure which revolves around that mudcrab merchant from Morrowind taking over Tamriel by buying up all of its prominent beverage-making businesses and then somehow tanking the stocks in every other industry on the Imperial City exchange. Some tale <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-elder-scrolls-6-in-the-summerset-isles-would-be-cool-or-so-recently-unearthed-daggerfall-era-dev-dd-notes-have-convinced-me">set in the Summerset Isles</a> would also probably be cool.</p>
