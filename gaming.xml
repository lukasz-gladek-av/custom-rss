            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/berserk-board-game-set-for-worldwide-release<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>An official Berserk board game is coming. Fans of the iconic dark fantasy manga can relive its most horrific action-packed moments from the comfort of their table. Better still, thanks to some official partnerships, the game will be coming to store shelves worldwide.</p>
<h2>The <em>Berserk</em> Board Game Announcement</h2>
<p>According to an official press release, the design, production, and sale of the <em>Berserk</em> board game will be handled by Monolith Board Games. Monolith is a France-based board game developer. It was founded in 2014 and has a respectable history of well-designed board games, including <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/222514/batman-gotham-city-chronicles"><em>Batman: Gotham City Chronicles</em></a>,<em> </em>and <em>Claustrophobia 1643</em>.</p>

An official <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=1113444893542668">Facebook post</a> by Monolith provides additional information. It states the game will use an original game system and be accessible, rich, and intuitive.</p>
<p>Monolith Board Games has several partners producing the <em>Berserk</em> board game. One is Hakusensha, the Japanese manga publishing company behind the manga. The other is Digital Catapult Inc. which specializes in producing and selling media overseas. The latter will distribute English and French language versions of the game in Europe and North America.</p>
<p><em>Berserk</em> is a brutal dark fantasy manga the late Kentaro Miura created. It debuted in 1988 under Hakusensha's semimonthly Young Horses magazine. It tells the story of Guts, a swordsman traveling through a hostile world for revenge. The manga was acclaimed for its mix of Western fantasy trappings, visceral bloody action, bleak atmosphere, and Lovecraftian cosmic horror.</p>
<p>After almost forty years, <em>Berserk's</em> cultural influence cannot be overstated. It spawned several anime, film, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/berserk-and-band-of-hawk-review-tell-me-why" rel="noopener" target="_blank">game adaptations</a>. It has inspired character archetypes and weapon designs for Square Enix's <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Final Fantasy</em></a> series. But its most overt influence is on creative director Hidetaka Miyazaki, the one behind the <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dark-souls" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Dark Souls</em></a> series and <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/elden-ring" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Elden Ring</em></a>.</p>
<p>At time of writing there is no confirmed date of completion or sale for the <em>Berserk</em> board game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/is-fallout-76-crossplay-answered/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>With the immense popularity of Fallout 76 following the live-action television series, more players than ever are flocking to post-apocalyptic Appalachia. But they’re spread far and wide across multiple systems. With that in mind, is Fallout 76 crossplay?</p>



<h2 id="h-does-fallout-76-support-crossplay">Does Fallout 76 Support Crossplay?</h2>



<p>Unfortunately, Fallout 76 does not support crossplay completely. There’s a caveat, of course, because it shouldn’t be too simple to play with your friends cross-platform, right? </p>



<p>You can play Fallout 76 crossplay between PC and Xbox Series X|S, but only when playing on the Game Pass version of the multiplayer wasteland adventure. </p>



<p>If you purchased a digital copy from the Xbox Store and your pal purchased a copy through Steam, you cannot play together.</p>



<p>Will the game ever receive crossplay support? There’s no telling. Microsoft is making a huge push to put its games on every platform imaginable, and that often means cross-platform support to some extent. However, the most significant blockage preventing crossplay from moving forward successfully is usually Sony.</p>







<h2 id="h-can-you-transfer-fallout-76-saves-between-systems">Can You Transfer Fallout 76 Saves Between Systems?</h2>



<p>I hope you’re ready for a little more disappointment, sadly. You cannot transfer save files between systems in Fallout 76. If you previously created a character on the PC version but went out and bought an Xbox Series S on sale, you must start an entirely new save file on the console.</p>



<p>At the very least, it’s an opportunity to test out a new build!</p>



<hr>



<p>Whether you jump in-game with a friend or not, you’ll likely want to start accumulating resources for crafting and construction. Here is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-gold-scrap-in-fallout-76/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how to get Gold Scrap in Fallout 76</a>! Before you boot up the game, however, why not sign up for the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/visit/newsletter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Newsletter</a>?</p>

But one day, a shocking series of murders involving a mysterious <a title="Companies > crim [21 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/crim">crim</a>son beast sets the wheels of fate in motion once again. Various factions spring into <a title="Genres > Action [1,990 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a> – both those who abide by the law to uncover the truth and those looking to capitalize on any new developments wherever possible, no matter how sinister.</p><p>With chaos once again looming on the horizon, the spriggan Van Arkride receives an unexpected visitor, prompting his own investigation. Who is behind the murders, and what is their goal? The sands of time bring old and new faces together for this thrilling second installment in the <em><a title="Series > Trails [54 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/trails">Trails</a> through Daybreak</em> saga.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Story</strong></p><p>Year 1209 of the Septian Calendar.</p><p>The threat posed by Almata has passed. Peace has finally returned to Calvard. And, for a time, that peace goes uninterrupted—until a CID special forces unit is slaughtered by an unknown assailant.</p><p>With authorities working to contain the situation, criminal forces take the chance to make their own moves.</p><p>Meanwhile, a spriggan by the name of Van Arkride begins his own investigation—after prompting from an unexpected visitor.</p><p>Who could be responsible for this massacre? What was their objective? And how does it all relate to Agnes’ search for the eighth Genesis?</p><p>A crimson beast’s roar. A chance meeting with a boy and girl, both embroiled in a mysterious search. These are the circumstances that lure Arkride Solutions down the trail of an inescapable fate.</p><p><strong>System</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Battle System</strong> – The game builds on the seamless transition between field battles and command battles introduced in the previous game with new mechanics that can be used in both: Cross Charge &amp; EX Chains! Mastering the use of these two combo mechanics can provide you with overwhelming firepower to use against your opponents.</li><li><strong>Cross Charge</strong> – If you manage to Perfect Dodge an enemy’s attack during a field battle, the Cross Charge icon will appear! Pushing the correct button while the icon is on-screen will swap in another party member, who will simultaneously execute a charge attack on your foe! As a bonus, the party member that you swap in will have enhanced attack power for a period of time.</li><li><strong>EX Chains</strong> – EX Chains can be activated by fulfilling specific conditions during command battles. Once these conditions have been met, using a craft or normal attack against a stunned enemy will automatically activate an EX Chain! This allows party members with SCLM activated to launch a simultaneous attack that will also impact nearby enemies, dealing massive damage.</li><li><strong>Choose Your Chapters</strong> – Van and his collaborators will not always travel together during the events of Trails through Daybreak II. At times, some of the group may split off in order to take care of tasks in different areas of Calvard concurrently. Because of this, each act contains multiple chapters you can play in any order. Progress the story in the order you choose! Each chapter features a different cast of characters as we see their side of the act’s story play out. Once you’ve completed your chosen chapter, the next one will start up automatically.</li><li><strong>Unique Missions</strong> – Certain chapters will feature missions that utilize the unique skillsets of the characters in that chapter’s party. For example, directly controlling the holo core AI, <a title="Games > Mare" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/mare">Mare</a>, to hack the orbal network, or using Swin to silently tail a suspicious individual.</li></ul></blockquote><div id="carousel_896903"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>Characters</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Van Arkride</strong> – The man at the head of Arkride Solutions. A lover of sweets, saunas, and orbal cars. Due to his job as a spriggan, Van has a tendency to take on legally-questionable jobs. However, the fact that he occasionally walks on the edge of the law does not preclude him from doing good by others—as is evidenced by his numerous personal contacts. While tracking down the Oct-Geneses at Agnes’ request, Van developed the ability to transform into an armored form known as the Grendel with the help of Mare, the holo core installed within his combat orbment. It was with this new ability that he was able to fend off the mafia group known as Almata. Having once terrorized the entirety of the Republic, Almata was eventually brought to its knees by the Arkride Solutions team during the fight for the Oct-Geneses. Upon the quelling of this threat, however, they decided to temporarily go their separate ways. Now left to himself in a less-than- lively office, Van is free to return to his lone-wolf lifestyle once more.</li><li><strong>Agnes Claudel</strong> – A first-year at the prestigious Aramis Academy who currently serves on its Student Council. Despite her polite manner of speaking and at times meek demeanor, Agnes has shown great strength and determination while employed at Arkride Solutions—especially when facing off against the seedy underbelly of society. Agnes first met Van while searching for eight prototype orbments known as the Oct-Geneses, which she inherited from her great-grandfather. As thanks for taking on her request, she began working as one of Arkride Solution’s part-time assistants. At present, Agnes has recovered seven of the eight Geneses. Unfortunately, while continuing her search for the last remaining Genesis, she’s had no choice but to also divide her time between preparing for the Aramis Academy Festival and periodically helping out around Arkride Solutions. Regarding her relationship with Van, she both respects and admires him as her employer. However, she seems to be harboring some more amorous feelings for him as well…</li><li><strong>Elaine Auclair</strong> – An A-rank bracer affiliated with the Calvard branch of the Bracer Guild. She is occasionally referred to by the moniker “Beauty’s Blade.” Due to her dignified beauty and masterful skill with a sword, Elaine tends to catch the eye of the media more often than not. Unfortunately, this also leads to talent agencies offering her contracts for modeling and acting—she always declines. Outside of being the poster girl for the Bracer Guild, Elaine has no present interest in joining the world of entertainment. During her high school years, she enjoyed a brief and fleeting romance with Van before he suddenly vanished without so much as a word. It was only recently, after seven years, that the two were able to reunite. Although their lingering feelings for each other have left their current relationship a bit tense, their time fighting Almata together was able to strengthen their bond once more. Some time after the events involving Almata and the Oct-Geneses, Elaine received word that the Central Intelligence Department’s elite Gamma Squad had been brutally murdered by an unknown assailant, and that a ‘crimson’ monster was spotted at the scene of the crime…</li></ul><p><strong>World</strong></p><ul><li><strong>The Republic of Calvard</strong> – A large country located in the central region of the Zemurian continent. Its current leader is President Roy Gramheart. Due to the unfortunate circumstances created by the desertification of eastern Zemuria, Calvard has a substantial history of receiving both immigrants and refugees. The resulting mixture of cultures and ethnicities has made the country into something of a melting pot. One hundred years ago, Calvard was under the heel of its monarchal rulers. It was only after Sheena Dirke and her compatriots brought about a democratic revolution that the nation was transformed into a democratic republic. Though in constant conflict with Erebonia over the control of bordering regions, Calvard has recently been on the receiving end of reparations from the empire following the Battle of Jormungandr. These reparations enabled Calvard to enter a period of rapid growth and development, leading to its eventual overtake of Erebonia as the most powerful nation on the continent. Regarding the region’s recreational interests, recent technological advancements in orbal vehicles and filmmaking have caused a boom in both the motorsports and orbal cinema industries.</li><li><strong>Messeldam</strong> – A moderate-sized city located in the north of Calvard. Due to its long-standing role as one of the Northern Sea’s major trading ports, Messeldam was often tasked during the days of monarchal rule with the delivery of imports to the capital of Oracion—along with fresh seafood, of course. Although the port remains active to this day, developments in airship technology have greatly diminished its significance. The city itself, however, remains an important gateway to Remiferia and its surrounding nations. Unlike Langport, Messeldam possesses very few tourist destinations. That being said, the townscape’s architecture tends to be quite popular with visitors, as its design has seen little change in the past century. The city’s Eastern and Central Eastern populations are fairly meager due to its geographical location. As such, it lacks a community that values cultural traditionalism. This has, fortunately, been a boon for Messeldam, as new art movements and customs are accepted with relative ease. It was this very attitude that led to the city serving as the venue for the Orbal Film Festival for a number of years, until its relocation to Tharbad in 1208.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch the western announcement trailer and a <em>Trails</em> series overview trailer below.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Bayle the Dread Dragon Guide | Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">You might have thought Igon was a sad, broken man, but you haven't yet seen the depths of his resolve. Later, as you climb the mountain, you slay a few dragons who stand in your way--first one, alone, and then two together. After winning the battle against two dragons at once, you hear laughter. It's Igon, and seeing your performance convinces him that you're the partner he's been waiting for. He <em>cuts off his own finger</em>--that's how summoning NPCs works in Elden Ring--and gives it to you, begging you to summon his soul in your fight against Bayle.</p><p dir="ltr">And reader, you should absolutely summon Igon in the fight against Bayle.</p><p dir="ltr">There are those players who are resistant to using summons, whether they're NPCs, spirit ashes, or other players. The release of Shadow of the Erdtree has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-rings-dlc-difficulty-discourse-is-getting-old-spot-on/1100-6524592/">rekindled a lot of discussion around the practice</a>, thanks to the perception among many that the DLC expansion can be annoyingly difficult. It does, at times, feel a little uneven, especially because of its half-baked <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-scadutree-fragments/2900-5485/">Scadutree Fragment</a> leveling system that's both wholly separate from traditional leveling and highly dependent on exploration and, to some degree, luck, in order to advance.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4329285-igonlament.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4329285" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4329285-igonlament.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4329285"></a><figcaption>When you first find Igon, he has already been wrecked trying to fight dragons, but he is in no way done.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4329285-igonlament.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Summons are a release valve on Elden Ring's difficulty, offering ways to even the odds for players who are maybe less skilled, less dextrous, or generally just less able to deal with some of the game's tougher bosses. And then there are those people who never summon, who make it a point to talk about how they never summon, and who ruin any potential to constructively discuss difficulty in game design and how it might be adjusted so that more people can physically play and enjoy a game while still allowing that game to convey the emotions and experiences the difficulty exists to create.</p><p dir="ltr">The sad vanity and arrogance of some of those people caused them to miss out on Igon. It's almost like From Software specifically used Shadow of the Erdtree to call out those people, because like with Igon, there are a number of points in the DLC where summoning a character is essential for advancing their particular story and includes interesting dialogue and fascinating moments you can't get any other way.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63TTIrhZcqM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/63TTIrhZcqM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">None is so fascinating as the story of Igon, though.</p><p dir="ltr">The thing about Bayle is that he is, like, the worst and most-evil dragon. He once fought the dragon Elden Lord, the multi-headed Lord Placidusax, to a standstill. If you played through Elden Ring already, there's a good chance you found and killed Placidusax yourself in Farum Azula, so you know how rough that battle would have been. You can see what it did to Bayle--he's missing half a leg and uses his tail to keep himself standing, and he has a couple of Placidusax's actual heads still buried in his back.</p><p dir="ltr">Igon made it his vow to kill Bayle, and even with his ruined legs, he intends to finish the job. And when you summon him in the fight, he comes in <em>screaming</em>--"CUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURSE YOUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYLE"--with a monologue that's almost equivalent to the roars the huge Bayle himself is issuing as you challenge him. Actor Richard Lintern (The Crown) makes his video game debut in voicing Igon and absolutely slaughters it.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4329289-igonmeme.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4329289" data-ratio="0.96617647058824" data-width="680" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4329289-igonmeme.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4329289"></a><figcaption>Source: Elden Ring Alerts on Twitter. </figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4329289-igonmeme.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The monologue is totally unexpected, and it's what makes Igon incredible. He comes into this fight ready to do <em>murder</em>, literally too angry to die. It was especially fun for me, because as Igon was yelling his vow to destroy Bayle and how we were about to kick this dragon's ass, I'd already been in the fight for a good minute or so, and I was halfway across the arena with a massive dragon swinging me around like a dog with a chew toy.</p><p dir="ltr">I can't stress enough how much of a phenomenal madman Igon is. This dude <em>just met me</em>. I ran into him at the bottom of the mountain with his legs thrashed, which immediately raises the question of, how did Igon, who wanted to go fight Bayle, end up <em>there</em>, already injured? Did he go up against the dragon alone? Did he get <em>tossed</em> there? Is that what happened to his legs?</p><p dir="ltr">He takes a minute to lament his fate and deal with the overwhelming pain, and you leave him. And then you find him again, where he watches you kill a couple of dragons. Despite not having the use of his legs, he got there <em>ahead of you</em>, and he decides that your martial prowess means you're the one he wants to take him back into the fight against Bayle, once and for all. Shadow of the Erdtree's Captain Ahab will stop at nothing to kill that damnable dragon.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4329290-baylewings.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4329290" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4329290-baylewings.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4329290"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4329290-baylewings.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Beating Bayle was one of the best moments of Shadow of the Erdtree for me, and at least half of it was because, as Igon screamed in the background, he and I did it "with a hail of harpoons!" This is the stuff I love about Elden Ring--the stuff that expands the world, that makes it feel like more than just you wandering a dead civilization, killing whoever's left. Fighting Bayle with Igon was phenomenal, with him screaming his head off, contributing almost nothing but hype the entire time, and heightened the danger and intensity of the battle all the more. The fight wasn't diminished because I had help; it was enriched and expanded because fighting Bayle meant something to Igon, and thus, it meant something to me. He has more personality than most From Software characters, and I hope they take a page from his ludicrous bellowing and overbearing obsession to make more memorable folks like him in future games.</p><p dir="ltr">It's pretty clear that fighting Bayle with Igon is the way From Software meant it to be experienced, and I'm glad some weird gatekeeping and purity testing didn't keep that from me. Beating a challenging boss is cool, but I'll remember Bayle a lot longer because of Igon.</p>

			<p>It's long been maintained by GTA V fans that a proper single-player DLC/expansion never came because GTA Online became too much of a focus for Rockstar Games following its enormous and continued success over the years.</p>
<p>Now, at last, we have some sort of confirmation from former Rockstar camera artist Joe Rubino, who worked on Max Payne 3 and GTA V. In a video interview <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uikfph7oQoE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with YouTuber SanInPlay</a>, he said:</p>
<p><em>A lot of the team went to do Red Dead Redemption 2 right away (after the launch of Grand Theft Auto V), and I kind of took on this other project that was a standalone DLC for Grand Theft Auto that never came out. That was my thing. I was one of the main editors and camera artists and did a lot of the on-stage stuff. We split our teams into two. I stayed on GTA Online and then this DLC, which Steven Ogg (the actor that played Trevor) was a very important part of.</em></p>
<p><em>Then some of the team overlapped and went to Red Dead Redemption 2 early on, and then we just kind of did this, because when that game got shelved, we spent so much money. A lot of that stuff, though, did end up making it, I believe, into later iterations of GTA Online. It's not like they wasted it. It was really, really good. What happened was when GTA Online came out, it was so much of a cash cow, and people were loving it so much that it was hard to make an argument that a standalone DLC would out-compete that. I think looking back now I would say that you could probably do both, you know? But that was a business decision that they made.</em></p>
<p><em>I was a little upset about that. Actually, a lot of the reason for me being a little sour at that time is that I was like, guys, this shit's awesome. Let's keep going, let's finish this. We went about probably halfway through it and then we put a pause on it because GTA Online was just so... People were going crazy (about it).</em></p>
<p>With Rockstar's resources, Rubino's point that the studio could have likely finished a halfway-done GTA V story standalone DLC makes sense. It was likely a decision made by the executives rather than the creative people, who would have certainly loved to release the content.</p>
<p>GTA Online is still running strong to this day. The studio has just <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-online-bottom-dollar-bounties-update-out-now-adding-bounty-hunts-dispatch-work-and-new-vehicles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> the Bottom Dollar Bounties update and promised more to come throughout the rest of the year.&nbsp;With GTA VI currently <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-fall-2025-confirms-take-two/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slated for Fall 2025</a>, it'll be interesting to see how Rockstar handles the transition between the respective games' online modes.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/maono-maonocaster-g1-neo-pd100x-review/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>When you’re doing any sort of content creation, whether it be streaming, podcasting, recording, or whatever, one of the most important areas of your setup needs to be the microphone you use. A quality microphone will help you go from a poor production to top level in no time, and will let your listeners enjoy the soothing sounds of your voice the best way possible.</p>



<p>Of course, there are a lot of options out there that it can be tough finding that balance between what you can afford and good quality. One company trying to bridge the gap between affordable and quality is Maono.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The company has a number of microphone options for all budgets. Recently, it released its new PD100X mid-level microphone to go along with its Maonocaster G1 NEO audio interface. I’ve spent the last couple of weeks using the setup as my daily driver for content, and I’m here to tell you whether or not I think it’s something you should consider if you’re looking to get into content creation of any kind.</p>



<h2 id="h-maono-maonocaster-g1-neo-amp-pd100x-review">Maono Maonocaster G1 NEO &amp; PD100X Review</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.maono.com/products/g1neo-and-pd100x-gaming-bundle-for-game-streamers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Retailing for $119.99 as a package</a>, it’s hard to find a better mic and mixer bundle for a better price. But price is only one part of the equation. How does everything perform under use?</p>



<p>Starting with the mixer. To be perfectly honest, it’s one of the nicer and most functional audio interfaces that I’ve used. It looks basic and only supports one XLR input, but what it does, it does really well.</p>



<p>The Maonocaster G1 NEO features 48V phantom power for your microphone and a number of streamer-friendly features without having to do much of a setup. There’s a noise reducer option that blocks out background noise such as fans quite well along with a SideChain feature that automatically lowers the volume of the music you have playing through your interface, turning it into a properly adjusted backing track for your voice over.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There’s a simple voice changer button that adjusts the pitch of your voice if you’re into that sort of thing as well as a toggle for directly monitoring your sound through your headset. A lot of expected features, but it comes with another feature that went from being a nice-to-have to one that I can’t live without: a sound board.</p>



<p>On the device there are four extra buttons that you can use for a soundboard. From simple sound effects to clipping and using songs, you can use it for pretty much anything you can think of. Lastly, the board features Bluetooth connection, allowing you to sync your phone or any other Bluetooth audio source to pass through music, sound effects, or anything else.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h3 id="h-how-does-the-mic-sound">How Does The Mic Sound?</h3>



<p>While the interface is really nice, none of it matters if the PD100X microphone isn’t a quality sound. On that front, the word to use with it is: okay.</p>



<p>Don’t get me wrong, it’s not a bad mic. Like I said, it’s okay. It’s just one that you’ll need to do some work with to get it rolling out of the box. </p>



<p>It does a solid job of blocking out background noise immediately, something that even the more pricey mics can struggle with. The PD100X also is quality on keeping away any noise behind the microphone, a benefit of the cardioid polar pattern.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th>Specification</th><th>Details</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Connection</td><td>USB/XLR</td></tr><tr><td>Mic Type</td><td>Dynamic</td></tr><tr><td>Polar Pattern</td><td>Cardioid</td></tr><tr><td>Frequency Response</td><td>40Hz-16kHz</td></tr><tr><td>Sample Rate</td><td>48kHZ/24-bit</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Where the PD100X doesn’t perform well is handling peaking and general level stability. Every time I used it, even if I left settings alone, the slightest adjustment of your position to the mic will have you frustrated at the levels. It’s not a major problem if you’re pre-recording content or doing something that will need multiple takes. However, it can get annoying for both you and your listeners/viewers when you are doing something live and you get comments on the sound issues.</p>



<p>There are also too many issues with the gain where the slightest change will have you sounding like you are speaking through a drive-thru speaker box. I found myself messing with the gain and general audio levels too much when doing live content that it took away from the overall presentation.</p>



<h6>READ MORE: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/logitech-g-has-a-new-gaming-keyboard-and-its-impressive/">Logitech G Has A New Gaming Keyboard, And It’s Impressive</a></h6>



<p>Should you not want to use a mixer, the PD100X also comes with a USB cable that can be connected directly to your PC. Both have their pros and cons like XLR not letting you use the RGB on the mic and the USB connection pickup up and and all clicks on the on-board wheel and mute button.</p>



<p>Additionally, should you connect via USB, you can use the Maono Link or Maono Arena apps for mixing purposes. Just know you’ll need to create an account in order to use their software.</p>



<h2 id="h-maono-maonocaster-g1-neo-amp-pd100x-review-verdict">Maono Maonocaster G1 NEO &amp; PD100X Review Verdict</h2>



<p>As a package, the Maono Maonocaster G1 NEO and PD100X are solid, especially at such an affordable price point. The interface has a lot of nice features and works well even with other branded XLR mics. Hell, I even hooked up my guitar to it via XLR, and found that it worked pretty well for that, too.</p>



<p>The mic, on the other hand, just doesn’t do much for me. It’s an okay entry level option if you decide to go with it. Just be ready, as I said, to do a bit of manual work getting it to sound right. The frustration of constantly adjusting the levels and dealing with clipping just turns me off too much when there are other options that work better straight out of the box. It also would be nice if you could just buy the interface on its own. Unfortunately, it seems that if you really want the Maonocaster G1 NEO, you have to get the mic with it.&nbsp;</p>

A report from the site reveals the apparent release date alongside a handful of other details about its price and purchase options. Sports gaming fans are said to have two purchase options: Standard and Ultimate. It appears the former comes with the base experience for $69.99, while the latter offers seven days of early access starting on September 20 for $99.99. EA Play subscribers can also take advantage of early access thanks to a 10-hour trial.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/05/ea-sports-fc-24-1720200479056.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>EA Sports FC 25 is expected to launch in September with an early access option.</figcaption></figure></output><p>FC 25 hasn’t been officially revealed yet, but Dealabs expects to see it announced within the next 10 days.

For reference, last year’s FC 24 launched for PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X | S on September 22, 2023.</p><p>EA’s soccer outings were previously known as FIFA but saw <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fifa-name-change-ea-sports-fc"><u>a shift following the expiration of a nearly 30-year partnership with the FIFA brand</u></a>. The fallout has resulted in the name change to EA Sports FC and a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-sports-fcs-new-logo-is-here-and-its-very-pointy"><u>new logo</u></a> as the series has moved to kick off a new beginning.

<p dir="ltr">As for the rest of the patch, a fix for the Tortured Gift of Amulets chest in Helltides means it will thankfully soon reward more items as originally intended. Boss summoning materials will be worth more gold, so players who aren't keen on actually using them can now vendor them for more profit. The sale price for Blackened Femurs, Gurgling Heads, and Trembling Hands are increasing from 20,000 to 50,000 gold, while Stygian Stones will increase from 70,000 to 150,000 gold.</p><p dir="ltr">In another change, the drop rate for Elixirs is going down, meaning players may need to rely more on crafting Elixirs to suit their needs. Conversely, the drop rates for Tempering manuals is increasing "to be more consistent." Last but not least, a welcome UI change for Tempered items will mean items will display icons for the associated Tempering affix category, instead of all Tempered affixes sharing the same icon.

It then received four seasons’ worth of content over the last 12 months. But after its more recent update,<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/exoprimal/status/1809175429737062400?&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/exoprimal/status/1809175429737062400?" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Capcom has confirmed</a></span> it’s done expanding the live-service dino shooter after just 348 days. </p><p>On July 5, Capcom announced that “all planned <em>Exoprimal </em>seasonal content is now complete” and confirmed that starting on July 11, past seasons will just rotate in and out each month. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://info.exoprimal.com/en/pages/important_240705_001/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://info.exoprimal.com/en/pages/important_240705_001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Capcom said in its blog post</a></span> that <em>Exorprimal</em> isn’t shutting down.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bethesda-has-outlined-what%E2%80%99s-coming-in-fallout-76%E2%80%99s-milepost-zero-update.920040/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/bethesda-fallout-76-milepost-zero/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Later this year, Fallout 76’s twentieth major update is set to hit the platform, and it has been dubbed Milepost Zero. This relatively impactful update is set to overhaul a few core mechanics in the game – and add a few that the community will welcome with open arms. It’s going to follow on from the Skyline Valley update that introduced the first new base map region to the game <strong>ever</strong>, so it’s fair to say that Fallout 76 is on a roll right now.</p>



<p>It doesn’t have a date just yet, but it’s assumed Milepost Zero will drop in September 2024.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-s-milepost-zero">What’s Milepost Zero?</h2>



<p>Milepost Zero is the twentieth major Fallout 76 update, and it’s set to usher in the game’s eighteenth season. We’re a long way from 2018, and Fallout 76 now has a bustling audience that’s more than receptive to these super-sized patches. Earlier this year, when <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-tv-show-five-seasons/">the Fallout TV show</a> was released, Fallout 76’s popularity skyrocketed, with the game breaking player count records with ease.</p>



<p>Bethesda Game Studios has revealed what’s coming to Fallout 76 in Milepost Zero.</p>



<p>The most important change is the rework to Legendary Crafting. In the PTS, players can start getting their hands on this very soon, but it’ll be a few weeks until it arrives in the full game. The new Legendary Crafting proposal will see Legendary Cores effectively cast aside, with players instead getting ‘Legendary Particles’ when they scrap Legendary Weapons. They’ll then convert these Particles into Legendary Mods, subsequently spending Legendary Modules to apply them to Legendary Weapons.</p>



<p>I know that was an awful explanation.</p>



<p>Here’s the basic rundown:</p>



<ol>
<li>Scrap Legendary Weapons to potentially get mods or pick up plans for mods from trading or through events.</li>



<li>Scrap more Legendary Weapons to earn Legendary Particles.</li>



<li>Use Legendary Particles to craft Legendary Mods (that you unlocked earlier).</li>



<li>Use Legendary Modules to apply the mods to your weapons.</li>
</ol>



<h3 id="h-what-else-is-new">What Else Is New?</h3>



<p><a href="https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/5zcmPPBTXDh7V6q8MxkmBJ/inside-the-vault-milepost-zero-public-test-server" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bethesda is introducing a new event</a> or questline called ‘Bump in the Road’, which will see players <strong>start their own Caravan Company</strong>. It has been suggested that this will allow players to unlock special constructs from rewards they get by doing Blue Ridge Caravan Company quests and events, and these constructs will take the form of <strong>Outposts</strong>. These outposts can be placed in addition to C.A.M.P.s, and they’ll have NPC vendors in them.</p>



<p>This is all yet to be fully confirmed by BGS.</p>







<p>Elsewhere, Mischief Night is set to return in the event rotation, and speaking of C.A.M.P.s, Bethesda is introducing a core mechanic that’ll please the best builders in the community. With Milepost Zero, a fresh feature called Best Builds will be introduced, marking special, voted-for C.A.M.P.s on the map with a ribbon and allowing users to vote on them, pushing their prestige even higher. </p>



<p>Along with that, there’s the usual array of balances – including a combat-based overhaul – and bug fixes, plus a few quality-of-life improvements for good measure.</p>



<p>Not bad.</p>

It also pointed out that it's already approved the Fortnite app, and that the issue highlighted in the thread is limited to the Epic Sweden AB Marketplace app.</p><p>Epic previously announced that it would bring its digital storefront and Fornite back to iOS in Europe <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fortnite-will-return-to-ios-but-only-in-europe">earlier this year</a>. That's thanks in large part to the EU's Digital Markets Act and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/apple-finally-lets-other-companies-launch-their-own-storefronts-on-the-app-store">the resulting changes made to Apple's polices</a> that made it possible for third-party companies to launch their own storefronts on the App Store. </p><p>Today's statement is only the latest in Apple and Epic's ongoing regulatory feud, with Epic having taken Apple to task over the 30% cut it takes in in-app purchases. It led to a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/epic-vs-apple-became-the-internets-trial">heavily followed antitrust trial in 2021</a>, with the legal battle <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/apple-scores-another-win-in-epic-antitrust-dispute">continuing over the years</a>. </p><p>Epic's case could be one of the first to demonstrate how Apple and other major companies affected by the DMA deal with the regulations. In March, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/eu-dma-investigation-apple-meta-google">EU regulators opened an investigation</a> into Apple, Google, and Meta over non-compliance with the DMA policies, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/apple-becomes-the-first-tech-company-charged-with-violating-eus-digital-markets-act-rules">with it being revealed in June</a> that Apple would be the first company to face charges over it. </p><p><em>Alex Stedman is a Senior News Editor with IGN, overseeing entertainment reporting.

                <p>Regular viewers of Games Done Quick are probably familiar with Peanut Butter the dog, a Shiba Inu who has been trained by his owner, JSR_, to play older video games in return for treats and praise. For a canine, Peanut Butter's gaming skills are impressive even though he's largely following his owner's lead. But in this year's Summer Games Done Quick, Peanut Butter may have delivered the highlight of the annual event by hitting a walk-off home run to win the game.</p><p>Peanut Butter was playing the SNES classic, Ken Griffey Jr. Presents Major League Baseball, in a game that was tied 3-3 in extra innings. And at just under 30 minutes into the game, Peanut Butter nailed a two-run homer to win with a 5-3 score. The clip posted above only features Peanut Butter's last-second heroics.

It took months of training, but Peanut Butter was a dedicated learner and a very good boy throughout the process.</p><p>"Within the first day of training, he could press the button on command," recalled JSR_ .

When they were first offered, it was as a choice between two stratagems: either the mines or a rocket launcher. Players had to choose between the liberation of two planets, which correspond to one of the stratagems, and whichever was freed first awarded its weaponry. The rocket launcher won and the mines were shelved till the next major order. </p><p>A little later down the line, the community was tasked with the even larger major order with the goal of killing two billion Automatons—one of <em>Helldivers 2</em>’s enemy factions, and a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;http://v&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="http://v/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">particularly brutal one to fight</a></span>. As a reward for completing the major order, players were offered a second chance at the anti-tank mines. This time around, the <em>Helldivers 2 </em>player base fell short of the goal, though it’s unclear whether it was due to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-player-count-down-failing-major-orders-1851500257&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-player-count-down-failing-major-orders-1851500257">dwindling numbers</a></span>, lack of interest in the reward, simply coming up short against such a tall order, or some mix of all these forces.</p><p> Last month, Arrowhead once again offered the mines as a choice between two outcomes: <em>Helldivers 2 </em>players were placed in their very own trolley problem and forced to pick between saving the literal children of Super Earth or a factory that’d manufacture the mines. The community picked the kids.</p><p>Which brings us to the present major order and its pretty simple goal: the liberation and defense of the planet X-45. It’s so straightforward that the major order has already been completed with days left on the timer. <em>Helldivers 2 </em>players fear there’s an ulterior motive behind the defense of X-45, though. You see, most major orders are clear about the rewards that’ll be handed out upon completion, but the current one mostly obscures that fact.</p><p>Instead, this major order’s reward has been referred to most often as “weaponry from the First Galactic War.” At first, players suspected this might be the return of a weapon from the original <em>Helldivers</em>, which could still be the case. That notion hasn’t completely swayed the conspiratorial sort, who are now utterly convinced that this is Arrowhead’s (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-galactic-war-game-master-joel-1851297376&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-galactic-war-game-master-joel-1851297376">and specifically Joel’s</a></span>) way of tricking players into <em>finally </em>unlocking the mines.</p><p>Folks in the <em>Helldivers 2</em> subreddit, have been popping off with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1dvpefx/arrowhead_after_the_last_time_we_failed_to_get/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1dvpefx/arrowhead_after_the_last_time_we_failed_to_get/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posts joking about the conspiracy</a></span>. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1dvj5pn/its_trap_retreat_retreat_they_want_to_give_us_the/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1dvj5pn/its_trap_retreat_retreat_they_want_to_give_us_the/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">One post</a></span> is, in all caps, titled, “ITS TRAP.

I’m kind of inclined to believe them and here’s why.</p><p>Mines aren’t as sexy as a new gun, which makes sense why players aren’t too keen on getting them. The order to kill two billion automatons was poorly timed, seeing as how the game was still recovering from the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-psn-steam-account-linking-explained-sony-1851455071&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-psn-steam-account-linking-explained-sony-1851455071">PSN kerfuffle</a></span> that nearly <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-playstation-live-service-pc-games-1851458983&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-playstation-live-service-pc-games-1851458983">cost it and Arrowhead their respective good reputations</a></span>, and was suffering from lower playcounts than usual. The trolley problem seemed to be poking fun at the mines’ unique situation, but also seemed like a tacit admission from the developers that it was an unpopular choice. How <em>else</em> could the developers get these tools into our hands outside<em> </em>of outright tricking us into earning them? It’s like hiding a dog’s medication in their food.</p><p>X-45 has become a popular planet since Arrowhead rolled out the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-jungle-biome-reactions-1851553947&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-jungle-biome-reactions-1851553947">new jungle biome</a></span>. Players have already been flocking to any planet rocking the new look, so why not place a major order there to ensure that the bulk of the active player base is supporting the completion of the major order? Besides that, most major orders have been more drawn-out affairs split across the defense or liberation of several planets. In the case of this one though, we literally just need to hold one planet, and everyone’s already there. It’s no wonder that there are still 3 days to complete the goal and it’s already done.</p><p>I don’t know what to believe at this point, but I do know that it’d be really fucking funny for Arrowhead to have duped its community into backing this effort just to give them the mines. I’m on my knees literally praying that next week rolls around and we’ve all got them unlocked. It’d make my entire life.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

I’m a couple hours in myself and not regretting it. </p><p>The real question facing prospective <em>Daybreak </em>players, as with almost every <em>Trails</em> game, isn’t whether it’s worth playing, but whether it’s a worthy starting point. It’s the 11th main game in the series, which is itself technically a subseries of Falcom’s <em>The Legend of Heroes </em>games. For that reason, in addition to the fact that, until recently, some key games hadn’t ever been localized, it’s always been incredibly confusing for outsiders to wrap their heads around how each sequel relates to one another and the best order to play them in, a challenge former <em>Kotaku</em> editor Jason Schreier <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/how-to-get-into-trails-one-of-the-best-rpg-series-out-1786275078&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/how-to-get-into-trails-one-of-the-best-rpg-series-out-1786275078">tried to tackle nearly a decade ago</a></span>. </p><p>In the years since, Falcom has finally brought overseas players up to speed with a steady drumbeat of ports, localizations, and new releases. But this also meant that every time a new<em> Trails </em>game arrived, uninitiated RPG fans would often go from “oh neat!” to “oh, oh god...” In part, that’s because diehard <em>Trails</em> fans will always tell you to start at the beginning with 2004's <em>Trails in the Sky. </em>There are <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Falcom/comments/16pdzd2/charting_the_trails_should_you_start_with_the/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Falcom/comments/16pdzd2/charting_the_trails_should_you_start_with_the/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">payoffs and reveals</a></span> that players will miss if they jump past it. That game originally made its way west on PSP before getting a Steam version in 2014. But unfortunately there’s no modern way to officially play it on console unless you want to spend over $100 on a used copy. </p><p>More importantly, starting at the beginning means playing all 10 games that preceded <em>Daybreak</em>. The <em>Trails in the Sky </em>trilogy contains two other games, <em>Trails in the Sky SC </em>and <em>Trails in the Sky the 3rd,</em> both of which are also exclusive to PC among modern platforms and take a collective<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://howlongtobeat.com/?q=trails%2520&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://howlongtobeat.com/?q=trails%2520" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> estimated 120 hours to complete between them</a></span>. Then there is the Crossbell saga, which consists of <em>Trails from Zero </em>and <em>Trails to Azure</em>. Despite originally coming out over a decade ago, both were recently ported to PS4 and Switch in addition to PC. Combined, that’s another 80 hours of playtime. </p><p>Finally, you have the <em>Cold Steel </em>games, which build on the worlds, characters, and conflicts of the previous games in a five-game arc that wraps up with <em>Trails of Reverie</em>. The first two games are only available on PS4 and PC. <em>Cold Steel III</em>, <em>IV</em>, and <em>Reverie</em> are also on Switch. For these games you’re talking roughly another 250 hours. If you’re looking to go on an epic RPG adventure whose deep worldbuilding and character arcs grow across several games, well, you’re in luck! But if that’s you, then you probably already decided to dive into <em>Trails</em> long ago. And even if you don’t feel the need to start all the way at the beginning, telling someone to play five games before starting <em>Daybreak </em>is still a tall order. </p><p> I’m someone who’s dabbled in a handful of<em> Trails</em> games over the years just to see what all the fuss was about but never got deep into any of them, let alone finished a complete arc. If you’re like me, desperate to become <em>Trails</em>-pilled but short on time, <em>Daybreak</em> might be your savior. It’s the start of a completely new storyline that, while it weaves in past history and pivotal moments, isn’t going to bog you down with the guilt of coming into a messy drama in the third act. Even better, there’s a free demo on PlayStation and Switch if you want to test it out before committing.</p><p>  <em>Trails Through Daybreak II</em>, meanwhile, has been out in Japan since 2022 and will likely get ported west next year or the year after. Then there’s <em>Kai no Kiseki</em>, the latest game in the <em>Trails</em> series and the third game following the exploits of Van Arkride. There’s no formal release date yet, but it’s supposed to come out in Japan before the end of 2024. For now it seems like U.S. players will be waiting until 2026 or beyond for that one, plenty of time for <em>Daybreak </em>converts to dig back through the rest of the series. And by plenty of time, I mean just enough if you spend at least 45 minutes a day playing<em> Trails</em> from now until then. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<section><p>Apex Legends' story has just kept going the past five years, and there's still no concrete endpoint in sight.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>I love the episodic storytelling used in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/apex-legends/" data-ref-id="5000-492612">Apex Legends</a>--it's a big reason why I'm still logging into the game every week after five years. How developer Respawn has told this story has changed numerous times since 2019, ranging from social media posts and evolving in-match quips to datamining bamboozles and a YouTube miniseries. The battle royale's story is always changing and evolving in both how it's told and what it's focusing on, shifting most recently by killing off a long-standing major villain who worked outside of the Apex Games and introducing a brand-new baddie who's actually competing against the legends in the arena, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-season-21-alter-was-not-easy-to-add/1100-6523141/">Alter</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">The lore is ever-growing as each new season brings with it new characters, locations, or storylines, becoming harder for new players to grasp what's going on. As a player looking at it from the outside, writing for any live-service game seems like a Sisyphean task--like the game itself, the story has to just keep going and presumably the narrative as a whole becomes increasingly unwieldy. Having to tell an endless story is at odds with how storytelling traditionally works in practically every medium, and there's the added complexity of needing such a story to evolve in a way that supports the ongoing development of a video game and any changes in its mechanics.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Apex Legends: Double Take Collection Event Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">To better grasp what it's like to put a story like Apex Legends' together, I spoke with lead writer Ashley Reed. We talked about how Season 13's Newcastle was originally planned for Season 7, how lucky happenstance plays a huge part in telling the game's story, and how--at one point--the plan was for Apex Legends to get multiple new legends per season.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>When it comes to writing Apex Legends, how far ahead are y'all? Are there efforts to not have too much of each season's story pre-written or does that not matter much?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">There's layers to it. There's--I almost want to call it the meta layer--the layer that may never exist. The layer where, when we create our characters, we're like, "Okay, this is this person, and in a traditional story, what is their arc?" Because that helps determine what this character wants, and what this character does not have. And that's what makes them interesting. For most of the characters, we have an idea of, if we were to snap our fingers and do the movie version, how [their story] would end. But that can transform over time because [a live-service game] is a living, breathing thing, and a lot of those endpoints have changed pretty significantly over time. A couple of them have already happened, like Pathfinder's endpoint happened when he found his creators. So now he has a new adventure to go on.</p><p dir="ltr">So there's that level, and then we will start integrating fairly early with the content in new seasons. We usually know about a year in advance the gist of what a season is going to be, so we'll start engaging with that like, "Okay, what's the narrative that can go with this thing that you're working on? Does it need a narrative? Does it fit with this aspect of the universe? Could one of the existing characters be an announcer for whatever this is?" We don't like waiting until the season before because then it feels very rushed and our timelines for recording dialogue are actually quite long. I think I can say this. I think it's okay. Right now, we are finishing dialogue for Season 23.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4329265-s5_loba2.png" data-ref-id="1300-4329265" data-ratio="0.54248810333107" data-width="1471" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4329265-s5_loba2.png" data-ref-id="1300-4329265"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4329265-s5_loba2.png"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>Oh, wow. And we're still in the middle of Season 21 right now.</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Yeah. So we have to know exactly what the characters are going to need to say now. It was a couple of weeks ago when we started writing it. So we don't want to wait until too far after this at all. We'd really like to have some idea of what we're doing with the story before that. But because we know where we've been, we know where we're going, and we can have the scaffolding in place for the general gist of what the story's going to be.</p><p dir="ltr">I'm still using this wrong, but the meta narrative level is really helpful because we'll know the trajectory for a character or a place or something like that. And then as new information is introduced, we're like, "Oh, that fits. That happens to work." We have this thing internally that we call "seamless storytelling," which means something happened by happenstance that fits perfectly with something we wrote before and we're like, "Nailed it." Actually, a funny story: We were working on Catalyst--the personality, the proclivities, and the interesting crystals and all that--and it just so happens, completely separately, the map design team was working on a moon map.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Wait, so Catalyst and Broken Moon--despite seemingly being built in tandem and narratively fitting together perfectly--were each designed separately? </strong></p><p dir="ltr">There are times like that where it's an amazing happy accident. But I will say, like Edna from The Incredibles, "Luck favors the prepared." If you've got an eye out for that stuff, you can grab onto it and move by.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4329266-s15_catalyst.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4329266" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4329266-s15_catalyst.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4329266"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4329266-s15_catalyst.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>How did the shift in Apex Legends' content pipeline affect the writing process for legends and the story overall? Y'all used to have to get a new legend ready to go with a story and everything every season, and a brand-new map every four seasons.</strong></p><p dir="ltr">It's true, we did. And it's funny because you probably would've thought it was solely a team health measure because maps and legends are our highest lift--they take a very long time to do. I think conservatively, each legend from their very, very starting point to launch is a year at least of really consistent work. Same with maps. Maps take a full year to do. So they are a very heavy lift and we love them, we love working on them, but that cadence was very difficult. There was a dream when Apex first launched to actually release new legends more frequently.</p><p dir="ltr"><em><strong>More </strong></em><strong>frequently? Do y'all hate yourselves?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Oh, very quickly we figured out that nope, nope, nope--not going to be possible to do it to the level that we were happy with. That was becoming so much of a grind that as much as we loved, it risked burning people out. So [team health] was one of the measures. But also we did start to see--and I'm no expert in this--but around Season 12, people actually being like, "Oh my God, stop adding characters." When Mad Maggie showed up, they were like, "I am having trouble keeping up with the constant changes to the meta in this game because the new characters keep getting added." So we actually got feedback that people were like, "Stop adding people." We're like, "Oh, okay, okay." So from a storytelling perspective, the characters and maps are obviously a very easy thing to hang your hat on. They're the center of everything at that point because they're very new, very big, very heavy in content and there's a lot you can do with them.</p><p dir="ltr">So doing them less is a loss, but at the same time, it can be a bit of a crutch because the same way people are saying, "Hey, I'm having trouble keeping track of the game because there are so many new characters," there's also, "Well, what about my fave? You haven't done content for my fave in a long time," which we'll acknowledge. We're like, "Oh God, so-and-so hasn't gotten any new stories." So it gives us time to actually sit with the existing characters and do more with them. And obviously we still want to keep adding new characters, but we don't want to abandon the characters that people already love and really identify with.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4329267-s5_loba3.png" data-ref-id="1300-4329267" data-ratio="0.54414784394251" data-width="1461" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4329267-s5_loba3.png" data-ref-id="1300-4329267"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4329267-s5_loba3.png"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>I am, in fact, one of those players. Please refocus the story back on Vantage. Not so that we learn more about her--she's great and all--but so that her mom comes back into the spotlight. </strong><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hot-drop-apex-legends-has-made-vantage-mom-too-interesting-i-want-to-play-her/1100-6505989/"><strong>I really want to know more about Vantage's mom</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p dir="ltr">I like that you love her because that's, I would say, one of our biggest difficulties. We do want the characters to have lives outside the [Apex Games]. But there's a not insignificant portion of the fan base who don't consume additional content--and that's fine--but then they get in and they're like, "Who are they talking about?" The only relationships they're aware of are between the characters. And we're like, "We don't want to just have characters who only interact with each other and have no work-life balance, but what is that happy medium of not emphasizing outside characters too much so if you just play the game, you still get the experience, and everybody feels fully fleshed out?" But I do appreciate that you like the NPCs because it's very easy for us to not focus on them.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Though, sometimes when y'all do, it's to really bamboozle us. Like when Bangalore started really coming back into the spotlight after Season 9 and it gives us a chance to learn more about Jackson. And then a few seasons later, you're like, "Haha, got you! He's a playable character now named Newcastle."</strong></p><p dir="ltr">I thought we were almost overplaying our hand on it. I'm glad we got to do that whole Bangalore story. We were thinking about that pretty hard for a while. God, I think we were talking about Jackson early, but I think there were active efforts to get him in as early as Season 7.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>That's a lot earlier than Season 13. So why release Horizon, Fuse, Valkyrie, Seer, Ash, and Mad Maggie first if you're trying to get Newcastle in there?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Basically we were looking for a kit that would suit him, and some kits would pop up in playtesting and we were like, "That feels right," but then they would just not play very well, so they went away. But then, finally, in Season 13, we were like, "This is the one. This is the guy." But there were active attempts to get Jackson in there. [His relationship with Bangalore] is too juicy. This relationship is too perfect. There's a few important NPCs that I think would be a struggle to put in. We've said that Horizon would never shoot [her son] Newton. I don't think Ballistic would struggle shooting his son--I think he'd be a little more open to it. Nathan is also a fully grown man who has a bone to pick.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4329268-s13_newcastle5.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4329268" data-ratio="0.57264050901379" data-width="1886" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4329268-s13_newcastle5.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4329268"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4329268-s13_newcastle5.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>You've spoken on this a bit, but when looking at Apex Legends' story, it feels like Seasons 1-7 are pretty heavily focused on the legends interacting with each other in the arena and then Seasons 8-18 shifted focus to follow the legends' lives outside of it. Is the focus of the story going to remain pretty firmly on the legends' lives outside of the arena going forward, or do y'all have plans to shift the perspective again?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">I don't want to speak too far in the future because obviously anything can change. I really love the IP, so there's a lot that you can do with the IP. Obviously there's been three different games in this space with three wildly different places. So there's a lot that I think can be done in this universe, but for Apex Legends itself, the game, I do think we have interest in shifting back to the in-arena interactions because that's where most people's experience is. It was really cool to be able to look at what the characters' interactions are outside the sphere. And I do think we still want to talk about that to a degree. We do want the characters to feel well-rounded and they've got other things going on because if they're just faceless avatars in this arena, then that's not Apex.</p><p dir="ltr">Obviously, we have experimented with doing things outside [the Apex Games]--a big bad villain who exists out there and isn't someone who actually fights in the games. But then we realized that wasn't integrating with the actual game that people play. So that's why the change in direction that we're headed, the new thing we want to try out. You can see those ebbs and flows of we did this, now let's try this.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Apex Legends' story has always been told in other mediums--social media, comics, a mobile game for a while--how do y'all keep track of all that?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">We have a wiki that got built that keeps track of all this information, and we have a lot of internal documents that wiki summarizes. It's good that we have a team because we can reference each other and be like, "Hey, do you remember what this was? Did we say this? Can you triple check the names of all of Bangalore's brothers? Where did we say Xenia was from again?" We will crowdsource the information amongst each other because it is a lot to keep track of, but the wiki and our internal documents make it a little bit easy. But they are huge. We're very careful about triple-checking ourselves to make sure we don't wreck anything.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>This interview was edited for both brevity and readability.</em></p>

                <p>Elden Ring got its latest patch and multiple nerfs have arrived for some of the Shadow of the Erdtree expansion's most-powerful weapons. To start, the arcane scaling of the Bloodfiend's Arm has been decreased and the status buildup associated with the weapon's heavy attack was also reduced. Pre-patch, the weapons Lightning Perfume Bottle and Frenzyflame Perfume Bottle occasionally dealt double damage, but that bug has now been repaired.</p><p>There are a few fixes in the patch that make weapons more powerful. The Carian Sorcery Sword got increased Intelligence scaling, but got worse base damage in turn. The patch repairs a bug where enemies would heal after Black Knife Tiche's maximum HP reduction/gradual HP reduction effect wore off.</p><p>The patch notes also address some performance issues, though it may require a little tinkering in your settings. For example, some PC versions might have ray tracing enabled by default. Check your graphics settings to turn it off. On PS5, you can improve the game's frame rate by using "rebuild database" on the PlayStation's safe mode. As <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-rings-pc-issues-might-be-due-to-an-unexpected-source/1100-6524593/" data-ref-id="1100-6524593">previously stated</a>, some PC issues might be caused by third-party applications related to mouse behavior.
