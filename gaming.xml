In response to the questions, CFK and 21c.Ducks plan to introduce all the various aspects of <em>Chrono Sword</em> to the world.</p><p>In the action RPG genre, combat systems are a key component of gameplay. <em>Chrono Sword</em> maintains the action elements of the souls-like genre while providing new shades unique to <em>Chrono Sword</em>, all to provide a more immersive gameplay experience. Let’s look into the innovative combat systems featured in <em>Chrono Sword</em>.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><em>Chrono Sword</em> centers around the heavy enemy and player hits common to the Soulslike genre, but various attack commands make the action faster and more intense.</p><p><strong>1) Quick Evade</strong></p><p>Instead of a roll, a quick press of the evade button allows players to skirt out of the way of enemy attacks.</p><p>In contrast with rolling away, which can help with avoiding attacks, evade allows for a stable evade detection system that allows players to avoid enemy attacks while setting up for a counterattack.</p><p><strong>2) Attack Cancel</strong></p><p>During an attack, a well-timed press of the action cancel button allows players to cancel the current attack and continue into a quick successive attack or immediate block/evade. The timing and efficiency of attack canceling can vary depending on the weapon selected.</p><p><strong>3) Finishing Attacks</strong></p><p>If players drive through an enemy after an attack cancel, enemies will fall to their knees in a brief stun animation. If players then close in on the stunned enemy and press the interact button, they will perform a finishing attack for a great deal of damage.</p><p><strong>4) Skill Attacks</strong></p><p>If players press a direction button while charging a strong attack, they will perform a strong skill attack that changes the attack into a completely different movement. There are two command skill attacks for each weapon.</p><p><strong>5) Useable Items</strong></p><p>Players can use a variety of items in combat by pressing the Use Item button.</p><p><em>Chrono Sword</em> has an arsenal of short-range and long-range weapons. Firing arrows can add damage from a safe distance or keep an enemy in a stunned state, and whetstones can imbue a weapon with fire, frost, or lightning properties.</p><p><strong>■ About the Game</strong></p><p><em>Chrono Sword</em> is a pixel art Soulslike action RPG developed by Korean dev team 21c.Ducks that tells the story of the dark gothic fantasy world of Adelnor, where players must travel between the past and future to unlock its secrets.</p><p>Revealed first to the public in 2019, this Soulslike action RPG garnered a great deal of interest in Korea and abroad for its unique pixel graphics and gameplay. Selected as the first game in the collaboration campaign by North American crowdfunding site Kickstarter and the global game testing platform Game Round.Inc in 2020, it raised over seventy thousand dollars to successfully reach its funding goal.</p><p><em>Chrono Sword</em> is a new take on the Soulslike genre, departing from the full 3D <a title="Genres > Action RPG [1,415 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg/action-rpg">action RPGs</a> on the market, choosing instead to fashion their Souls-like with pixel art and a quarter-view perspective. Since the announcement of this game, indie team 21c.Ducks has poured their hearts and souls into developing a strong storyline and advancing both the action and RPG elements of their Souls-like entry.</p><p><em>Chrono Sword</em> renders its vast, three-dimensional world in pixel graphics. Players then step into the role of ‘time traveler,’ venturing freely between the past, present, and future in maps that seamlessly transition without loading screens. Developer 21c.Ducks has featured <em>Chrono Sword</em> in game exhibitions at home and abroad, where it was noted and awarded for its gameplay. They then took this experience and used it to further improve both gameplay and level design.</p><p>In addition, it has built on the heavy hits known to fans of the Soulslike genre while implementing new systems to create quicker, fiercer action.</p><p><em>Chrono Sword</em> featured the latest demo version at the <a title="Companies > Happinet Corporation [39 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/happinet-corporation">Happinet</a> booth at the Tokyo Game Show 2024, where it succeeded in attracting the attention of many players. After being unable to show its new face for so long, this new version of <em>Chrono Sword</em> drew attention as it focused on the action and RPG elements of the game, setting it apart from the demo released during the Kickstarter campaign.</p><p>Building off of this interest, <em>Chrono Sword</em> participated in the Steam Next Fest starting on October 14, 2024, where it was seen by even more players from around the globe. It succeeded in attracting even more interest by releasing a version touting more content than the one featured at Tokyo Game Show 2024.</p><p>21c.Ducks began their development path in 2015 with mobile game <em>Timing Hero</em>, moving onto release <em>Super Pixel Racers</em> on PC in 2018, distinguishing themselves for their abilities in game development and raising awareness about their company. Then once they unveiled <em>Chrono Sword</em> in 2019, the game was nominated for the Grand Prix / Judge Selection / Excellence in Art awards at the Busan Indie Connect Festival (BIC) that very year. Then in 2022, it won a special award for excellence at the Burning Beaver festival.</p></div><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Thanksgiving isn't traditionally the time for receiving gifts, but that's not stopping Digital Extremes from doing a giveaway of its own. The developer behind Warframe is offering its 2008 third-person shooter <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dark-sector-review/1900-6188387/" data-ref-id="1900-6188387">Dark Sector</a> for free, but you only have until November 30 to claim it.</p><p>Digital Extremes shared the announcement on X, as well as <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/29900/Dark_Sector" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dark Sector's page on Steam</a> where the game is temporarily yours for the taking.</p><p>Digital Extremes credits Dark Sector for inspiring Warframe, and the game was initially released on PC, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3. The story puts players in control of covert operative Hayden Tenno as he embarks on a mission behind enemy lines in the Eastern European nation of Lasria. He'll soon discover that there's a deadly secret that leaves him infected by a bio-weapon called the Technocyte Virus.</p><p>Ordinarily, the Technocyte virus turns its victims into mindless killing machines. Hayden avoided that fate--for now at least--and he's been left with superhuman abilities that may give him the edge if he wants to make it out of Lasria alive.</p><p>During the summer, Digital Extremes offered up a preview for Warframe's next expansion, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warframe-1999-looks-like-the-party-of-a-lifetime/1100-6526024/" data-ref-id="1100-6526024">Warframe: 1999</a>. The story thrusts players on an alternate Earth, and it looks very intriguing so far. Additionally, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warframes-developer-partners-with-make-a-wish-to-feature-child-in-upcoming-expansion/1100-6525153/" data-ref-id="1100-6525153">Digital Extremes granted a child's Make-A-Wish</a> to be a voice actor in the upcoming expansion when it arrives later this year.</p><p>If you're looking for more recent games and big sales, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tons-of-popular-pc-games-are-discounted-for-black-friday/1100-6527990/" data-ref-id="1100-6527990">check out our Black Friday roundup</a>!</p>

Solving these problems first required a concrete understanding of what the core game is, and to obtain that, the team had to experiment.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Becoming an expert in the game you are designing">Becoming an expert in the game you are designing</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Part of the process is becoming an expert in your game, right?" Brode says. "When we first started out, I didn't know the right number of cards per location, the right number of locations, the right number of turns for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Marvel Snap</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the right number of energy to start with. We tried seven turns and five turns, and starting on turn two and nine cards per location and four cards per location, three cards per location and two cards per location, and infinite cards per location. We tried everything."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Eventually, Brode continues, these variables coalesce into the foundation of the product, and once that's all settled, you can go about the business of actually designing cards. But how much viable content can your new game actually support?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"You need to actually make sure you can make a bunch of stuff," Brode says. "Like if your goal was 'Hey, let's make Tic Tac Toe a live service game,' and we're gonna add cards you can play before every turn of Tic Tac Toe … there's a couple designs that may be kind of interesting and not broken but not that many."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For this hypothetical, Brode would ideally design out a year's worth of content just to see if the idea had legs. "Even if you don't end up shipping any of those cards, you're like, 'Oh my God, I've used all the design space, Tic Tac Toe is too simplistic. I just can't come up with another 500 of these for the next 10 years.'"</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Second Dinner is sitting at the Godot table">Second Dinner is sitting at the Godot table</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant also speaks with Brode about Second Dinner's embrace of Godot for another project that's already in development. The engine has grown leaps and bounds over the last few years, Brode says, thanks in-part to its open source nature and the responsive folk shepherding the project. And for his team specifically, Godot offers tremendous value in its ability to issue over-the-air updates for "literally anything."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Because we're writing the whole game in [GDScript] … this means if we wanted to do something like launch on a platform that is maybe notoriously difficult to get new content and new features shipped live to players quickly, well, we can just do that over the air without having to go through an approvals pipeline for [a] AAA platform," says Brode. "That could take a long time and we just don't have to do that. We can just quickly get stuff to players in a day or something. That's really mega, especially for a live service project."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Listen to the rest of our really mega conversation on your podcast platform of choice, and might we be so bold as to suggest adding </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://gdconf.com/">GDC 2025</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to your March to-do list for more valuable insights from leading developers?</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Editor-in-Chief, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Danielle is the editor-in-chief of Game Developer, with previous editorial posts at Fanbyte, VICE, and Polygon.

            <p>Let's face it, nothing important happens in December. I'm scheduling 24 advent calendar posts this week and then spending the rest of the year eating boxes of Cadbury Mini Yule Logs Triple Chocolate. So it's no surprise that Devolver have announced their remaining slate of games aiming for release in 2024 are actually coming out in 2025.
</p>
<p>The games that slipped are <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baby-steps">Baby Steps</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skate-story">Skate Story</a>, and Stick It To The Stickman. Devolver released the news with typical style, via the 15th annual Devolver Delayed awards, which you can watch below.

<p>I enjoyed the in memoriam section for games that released this year which can therefore no longer be delayed, all of which are currently available at a discount via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/developer/DevolverDigital/sale/autumnsale2024">Devolver's autumn sale on Steam</a>.
</p>
<p>Baby Steps is the pick of the Delayed Three that I'm most looking forward to. It's a literal walking simulator from Bennett Foddy and the makers of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ape-out">Ape Out</a> in which you pilot limbs individually to steer your pyjama-clad protagonist up a mountain, like a marriage between <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/qwop">QWOP</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/getting-over-it">Getting Over It</a>, and whichever third-person game with a mountain you care to choose from. Skyrim? Jusant? I bet God Of War's got a mud-soaked hill in it somewhere.
</p><p>Skate Story is Tony Hawk's Pro Skater if Tony Hawk was a demon made out of glass. Stick It To The Stickman is that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hw4wzwYeZ0Y">Flash animation you watched 20 years ago</a> but with a physics simulation and made by the Broforce developers. I want to play both of these games, too.
</p>
<p>Check out the graphic design on these bad boys. The blurriness on the image of the mini roll isn't my camera, that's actually how it looks on the box.

                <p>Plague Inc. developer Ndemic just dropped a surprise sequel to the smash hit Plague Inc. Instead of a pessimistic pandemic simulator, the sequel is a sunny strategy game about rebuilding after the end of the world.</p><p>After Inc. is set in the aftermath of Plague Inc.'s zombie scenario. It tasks you with running human civilization in the United Kingdom after a zombie apocalypse. Unlike its predecessors, After Inc. has an optimistic hue. The aesthetic is colorful and painterly, in contrast to the harsh UI of Plague Inc. or the cold satellite-map style of Rebel Inc., a previous follow-up about combating insurgencies.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1690/16904437/4406661-after-inc-screenshot-1.png" data-ref-id="1300-4406661" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1690/16904437/4406661-after-inc-screenshot-1.png" data-ref-id="1300-4406661"></a><figcaption>A screenshot of After Inc. showing off the game's bright, lush aesthetic and friendly UI.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1690/16904437/4406661-after-inc-screenshot-1.png"></figure><p>In an interview with newsletter <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/after-inc-plague-inc-ndemic-pandemic" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game File</a>, game designer James Vaughn said, “I've tried to make a more happy and optimistic game this time." In each session, you play as the leader of a settlement. You combat zombies, search for resources, navigate communal disputes, and research new tech. Playing through a scenario lasts around 20 minutes and will unlock meta upgrades that affect future settlements.</p><p>After Inc. costs $2, the same price as Rebel Inc. and $1 more than Plague Inc. The store page claims this is a "special sale price" to mark the game's launch. Ndemic promises "no 'consumable microtransactions,'" meaning any content you spend money on will last in the game forever. The app store page promises that it will be "updated for years to come."

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/no-mans-sky">No Man's Sky</a> didn't get off to the smoothest of starts, but eight years after its controversial launch, Hello Games' exploratory space sim has reached a significant milestone, finally gaining enough favourable player reviews on Steam to shift its overall rating to "Very Positive".
</p>
<p>
When No Man's Sky released back in August 2016, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-sky-isnt-going-over-well-on-steam">player sentiment was such</a> that it quickly found itself damned with an "Overwhelming Negative" rating on Steam. It took two years and a number of significant updates for No Man's Sky to secure enough positive reviews that its average tipped over to "Mixed", and then a further three years after to that to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-five-years-no-mans-sky-has-finally-hit-mostly-positive-reviews-on-steam">reach an all-time user review average of "Mostly Positive"</a> in 2021.
</p>
<p>
As Hello Games' Tim Woodley explained at the time, "Each percentage point becomes exponentially harder to earn as you move up the ratings. Moving from 20 percent positive to 21 percent positive may only require a few hundred positive reviews whereas moving from 69 percent to 70 percent needed 10,000 positive reviews. This is why it's so rare for games to change their All-Time rating and why we'd assumed that we might never be able to."

<p>
Another three years - and a total of 35 free content updates - later, No Man's Sky has finally achieved the seemingly impossible, turning its initial "Overwhelmingly Negative" rating <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/275850/No_Mans_Sky/">into "Very Positive"</a>. That means 80 percent of its 245,857 Steam reviews are positive - which is to says it's secured 196,686 blue thumbs up versus 49,171 red thumbs down. Addressing the milestone, studio boss Sean Murray <a href="https://x.com/NoMansSky/status/1861859832187211963">wrote</a>, "Holy shit you guys - it happened. ALL REVIEWS: Very Positive. Thank you, thank you, thank you. You have no idea what this means to us."
</p><p>
No Man's Sky's next challenge, then, will be to nudge into the prestigious "Overwhelming Postive" category inhabited by the likes of Sekiro, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/persona-5">Persona 5</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a>, Hades, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dead-cells">Dead Cells</a>, the Silent Hill 2 remake, and Half-Life: Alyx. That's a significantly tougher goal, however, requiring 95 percent of life-time reviews to be positive. In other words, assuming No Man's Sky doesn't receive a single negative review from this point forward, it'll need a total of 983,420 positive reviews - or 786,734 more than it has now. By which point the <em>actual</em> universe might be 16 minutes away from obliteration.
</p>
<p>
Regardless, the shift to "Very Positive" is still an incredible achievement, and testament to the incredible work Hello Games has put into its space sim over the last eight years. No Man's Sky's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-sky-rolling-out-cross-save-support-from-today-as-ps5-pro-enhancements-arrive">most recent update</a> released earlier this month, introducing cross-save support, PlayStation 5 Pro enhancements, and the return of Mass Effect's Normandy. It's the sixth major update this year, following on from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-skys-the-cursed-is-a-spooky-expedition-for-halloween-set-in-a-collapsing-reality">October's spooky The Cursed</a> (which, among other things, introduced flying saucer ships for players), while other 2024 additions have included <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-sky-gets-reel-in-new-aquarius-fishing-update">fishing</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-sky-orbital-update-overhauls-space-stations-today">refreshed space stations</a>, and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-skys-borrows-some-of-light-no-fires-fancy-tech-for-a-planetary-overhaul-in-latest-update">massive world generation overhaul</a>.
</p>
<p>
Up next for Hello Games is its procedural planet adventure Light No Fire, which we've not had an update on since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-sky-studio-unveils-procedural-fantasy-planet-adventure-light-no-fire">last year's reveal</a>. Perhaps we'll finally see more during December's The Game Awards, but regardless, it sounds like No Man's Sky journey is far from over.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/slipways">Slipways</a> was the best grand strategy game I'd played in years, because it tossed out all the genre's micromanagement in favour of a strategy puzzle where all your exploiting, expanding, et ceteraing could be squeezed into an hour's play. That game began as a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pico-8">PICO-8</a> prototype by designer Jakub Wasilewski before being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/slipways-review">polished to a fine shine in its full release</a>.
</p>
<p>All of which is just lead-in to talking about Solitomb, a solitaire-based dungeon crawler in which you fight demons by building hands of playing cards. It's currently - heywaitaminute - a pay-what-you-want PICO-8 prototype by designer Jakub Wasilewski where "all money earned goes towards making the bigger version possible." Like Slipways, it already seems like a frightfully clever piece of design.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>You can play Solitomb in <a href="https://krajzeg.itch.io/solitomb">your browser for free right now</a>. 
</p>
<p>Hit the how-to-play button in-game to <a href="https://html-classic.itch.zone/html/12080108/tutorial/index.html">go to this webpage</a>, which is the basic tutorial. If you've played solitaire before, the very basics are familiar: there are stacks of cards spread at the top of the screen, with some facing upwards. After that just about everything else is different.
</p><p>The cards themselves represent either the different types of monster you can fight, or the attack, shield, and potions you can take into that fight. The number on each card represents its efficacy. You build stacks of up to five cards - any lower numbered card can be placed on top of another - and drag them into your hand to start the fight. The aim is to defeat a certain number of a certain kind of enemy or to clear a pathway forward in order to reach the next level of the dungeon.
</p>
<p>Which probably all sounds a little abstract, but makes sense almost as soon as you start playing. Want to defeat a beast of five strength? Pair it with a sword of five strength. Want to win the fight without taking damage? Add a shield of 4 strength and a potion of 1 or higher, and drag all four cards together into your hand. Now do this again and again to clear all the cards in front of you, making sure not to squader power on lesser battles, to run out of health, or to run out of attack cards altogether.
</p>
<p>There are umpteen other systems layered atop this basic combat math. The dungeon houses an impatient demon and if you make too many dragging and stacking moves before you trigger combat, you'll start to take damage. There are damage bonuses for combos, such as cards of the same suit, rank or consecutive ranks. You choose a character class before a run, with a passive buff and a special ability, and there's a between-level shop for purchasing new cards and upgrades. Later floors introduce new card types. Prototype or not, it already seems rich in strategic potential.
</p>
<p>Head over to <a href="https://krajzeg.itch.io/solitomb">the Solitomb page on Itch to give it a try</a>. Or if you never got around to trying Slipways, you can pick that for half price right now <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1264280/Slipways/">over on Steam</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/digital-extremes-double-devstream-confirmed-warframe-1999-soulframe-pre-alpha/">Digital Extremes</a> and Valve are currently giving away free copies of Dark Sector, the third-person title made by the Warframe devs. From today until November 30, PC games will be able to obtain this game for free by visiting the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/29900/Dark_Sector/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam store page</a> for Dark Sector. This game is a third-person action shooter that was first released on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 in 2008 and then was ported to Steam in 2009. If you've been wanting to try this game out but weren't sure whether you want to spend money on it, this is a great time to get hold of it and add it to your backlog.</p>
<p>Dark Sector is a game that does have mixed reviews, mainly based on the visual design of the game. This game has been compared to Resident Evil 4 and Gears of War by critics. Themes that were seen in Dark Sector were also seen in Warframe. For example, the name Tenno is seen very frequently throughout Warframe, as that is the name of the faction that is controlled by players.</p>
<p>In this game, you play Hayden Tenno (voiced by Michael Rosenbaum), a man who works at the CIA. In this game, you witness Hayden go through a transformation, as he has been infected with the Technocyte Virus on his right arm, which then begins to take over his entire body. As a result of the Technocyte Virus, you see his psyche begin to deteriorate. However, he begins to gain superhuman powers, including the ability to grow a bladed glaive on his arm. With this glaive, he can throw it at his enemies with precision. As you progress through the game, you see Hayden begin to transform further, and his powers evolve, making him a deadly force to be reckoned with.</p>
<p>Dark Sector's main focus is a single-player campaign, but the game also features a multiplayer game mode. At the moment, it's uncertain whether the multiplayer game mode is still active, but due to the game being free on Steam for now, it's possible that the multiplayer game mode will still be active and available to play.</p>
<p>The Steam Autumn Sale is also on right now, which will provide many discounts for any games that may be on your wishlist.</p>
<p>Will you be playing Dark Sector?</p>

            <p>Announced last year, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/exo-rally-championship">Exo Rally Championship</a> does what the name suggests: takes the rugged, weather-battered terrain of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/exo-one">Exo One</a>'s interplanetary journey and replaces the ponderous plot and gravitational rise-and-fall spaceship movement with a six-wheel, space buggy rally competition. Or put another way, if Exo One was Christopher Nolan's Tiny Wings, then this is Colin McRae's Interstellar.
</p>
<p>Now there's a demo, and it's substantial with a tutorial, a 10 stage rally, and three "ever-changing Daily Stages with online Steam leaderboards."

<p>This is no rally game reskin, but takes full advantage of the setting. The landscapes you're speeding across are vast and unforgiving, crater-marked, littered with boulders, and battered by rain, lightning and meteors. It's only possible to make your way across them because your six-wheel-drive rover can catch considerable airtime on the low-gravity planets.
</p><p>Land too hard and you'll lose a wheel or other valuable part of your machine, however. That's where air jets come in, which let you shunt your buggy around in mid-air to correct your orientation or soften your touchdown. The tutorials take you through using them in different scenarios, and it's a lot to consider. Enough that it's simultaneously intimidating but exciting to see what dedicated players can wring from these physics.
</p>
<p>It's a stark contrast to what I wrote about in my <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/exo-one-review-a-gorgeous-sci-fi-marble-run-that-lacks-pace-or-friction">Exo One review</a>, a game which I felt lacked friction after you'd got to grips with its comparatively simple controls. Exo Rally Championship seems to have friction in spades, and promises a rich simulation with the ability to tune your rover, the need to repair it, and with tire and fuel types to match to different planetary destinations in the full game.
</p>
<p>That full game is still "coming soon", but you can grab the demo now <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2262020/Exo_Rally_Championship/">from Steam</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>We’ve witnessed a lot of turmoil surrounding the development of Assassin’s Creed Shadows, with delays and controversy marring the title before its release. Well, as it turns out, there may be a reason why the upcoming AC game is so controversial. It appears Assassin’s Creed Shadows is going to be the first game for a number of game developers at Ubisoft. While it’s common practice to bring in new talent regularly and keep the old-timers on their toes, it would seem much of the team behind Shadows is completely green behind the ears.</p>



<p>In an appearance at the External Development Summit 2024 (XDS24), Assassin’s Creed Executive Producer Marc-Alexis Côté said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>One of the things that I’ve noticed since the pandemic is that we have a lot of juniors in our teams. Probably half the team that’s building Assassin’s Creed is building a game for the first time.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>While the video below is set to begin approximately where Marc-Alexis Côté spoke about the game’s development, you can watch the full keynote from XDS24 here:</p>

                                        <p dir="ltr">Video games have traditionally been an expensive hobby, but thanks to the latest advances in cloud streaming, it's now easier--and more affordable--than ever to get into gaming. One of the best cloud gaming services is Amazon Luna, which lets users play some of the latest games in up to 4K quality directly on devices they already own--no expensive console or gaming PC required. If that sounds like something you're interested in, we've put together this comprehensive explainer for Amazon Luna so you can see how easy it is to sign up and get playing.</p><h2 dir="ltr">What is Amazon Luna?</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4406070-lunadevices.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4406070" data-ratio="0.552" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4406070-lunadevices.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4406070"></a><figcaption>Amazon Luna</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4406070-lunadevices.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Amazon Luna is a cloud gaming service that allows users to stream games directly from the cloud to various devices without needing a gaming console. You can think of it like the video game version of Amazon's Prime Video service, where instead of downloading and running games directly on your hardware, they're stored and played remotely via Amazon's Web Services (AWS) servers.</p><p dir="ltr">There are a lot of benefits to cloud gaming compared to traditional console or PC gaming. For one, you can access your library of games from a long list of devices, including Windows PCs, Macs, Fire TV streaming devices, Fire tablets, Chromebooks, iPhones, iPads, Android devices, and select smart TVs. While you'll need a strong, stable internet connection for the best gameplay experience, cloud gaming can be much cheaper, too, since all you need is a Luna account, a controller, and one of the supported devices--many of which you probably already own. That means there's no need to buy an expensive gaming console or PC.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How Much Does Amazon Luna Cost?</h2><p dir="ltr">Amazon Luna requires a paid membership to access most of its games and features, but multiple subscription plans and optional add-ons are available to suit your preferences.</p><h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Luna+ membership</strong></h3><p dir="ltr">The primary plan is <strong>Luna+</strong>, which costs <strong>$10/month</strong> and gets you access to over 100 games that are playable at no extra charge, including a mix of AAA games like <strong>Devil May Cry 5</strong> and <strong>Middle-earth: Shadow of War</strong>, and indies like <strong>Overcooked</strong> and <strong>Guacamelee</strong>.

Amazon's minimum network requirements are 10Mbps internet speeds for 1080p gaming and at least 35Mbps for 4K. You'll also want to use a hardwired Ethernet connection whenever possible. If you play over Wi-Fi, you will want to use 5Ghz routers (though 2.4Ghz Wi-Fi is also supported).

The <em>GraviTrax</em> system allows you to build mazes that literally fire marbles, or gravity spheres as they're known, around a track, racing and interacting with other gravity spheres as they go. We're not going to review the&nbsp;<em>GraviTrax</em> Action-Set Death Star, as we've already reviewed the system, but in this article, I'm going to look at my 5 favorite pieces that the Death Star set adds to your&nbsp;<em>GraviTrax</em> tracks.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<em>GraviTrax</em> Action-Set Death Star is a full starter set for&nbsp;<em>GraviTrax</em>, so if it's your first time picking it up, it contains everything you need to build and play. The set includes 190 pieces of track, including corners, runners, special pieces, and the base it all fits into, which is the Death Star at the lower level, and an Imperial Destroyer and Millennium Falcon at the upper levels. The set also includes 6 exclusive marbles, with unique etchings on them for Luke Skywalker, Darth Vader, Han Solo, and 3 Tie Fighters, along with X-Wing and Tie Fighter pieces that sit above the corners to add further immersion in the setting.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<em>GraviTrax</em>&nbsp;system allows you to add this set to existing sets or add further sets to this one once you've mastered it. The instruction booklet takes you through building the pieces and then increasing the complexity of tracks before you set off to explore builds on your own.</p>

<p>The<em> GraviTrax</em> Action-Set Death Star includes 4 X-Wing and 4 Tie Fighter miniatures that sit above the track corners on stands and add immersion to the tracks. The X-Wing is my first favorite piece from the set. They don't interact with the track itself, but they do help with the <em>Star Wars</em> feel, especially when viewed alongside the Death Star board.</p>

<p>My second favorite piece is the pole steps (name not official). The little cups on the top of the poles catch the gravity sphere, and momentum pushes the pole towards the next pole, where it drops it into the next cup, and so on. You do need to make sure there's some speed going into the first cup, otherwise, it doesn't move and the track ends there for that particular sphere, but hit it right, and it's quite satisfying to see them pass over each step and then continue along the track.</p>

<p>The catapult is pretty special which is why it features as my third favorite <em>GraviTrax</em> Action-Set Death Star piece. The speed at which it enters the holder at the bottom coverts into how fast it whips over the top, carried by the two counterweights. Then it either continues on its journey, or like in the image above from one of the set builds, it goes straight into a slide, which did arrest some of its momentum here, but whip it onto a straight track and it can really get some speed up.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/star-wars-gravitrax-death-star-9.jpg?itok=wTFW_y-c 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/star-wars-gravitrax-death-star-9.jpg?itok=aFdUERir 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Piece 4 - Gravity Well</h2>

<p>The Gravity Well, our fourth favorite piece, is a drop into a slide, that can be rotated within the tile to face any direction you want. The slide itself does arrest the speed of the gravity sphere, so it won't plunge straight in and out, but once it exits the slide, it will already have a decent amount of momentum to keep it going. The piece in the image above fits into the Millennium Falcon level (and also the Death Star level piece), which looks great once set up, and feels really immersive as it drops the marble down and onwards.</p>

<p>By far my favorite piece is the Magnetic Cannon. This piece appears like a stop, with a solid magnet blocking the track, but when a gravity sphere strikes it, a gravity sphere on the other side of the magnet is fired back onto the track. These offer a range of options like reversing the direction of a gravity sphere, adding full momentum on the bottom level to fire round with a new lease of life, or making pieces strike together when they meet at central tiles. This piece feels the most Star Wars, like punching a hyperspace drive.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/video-game-champion-brings-retro-game-collecting-fun-to-gaming-tables<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Arcane Wonders has announced an English language release of <em>Video Game Champion</em>. The acclaimed tabletop developer has announced they will localize this retro-inspired board game from its original Brazilian Portuguese version.</p>

<h2><em>Video Game Champion</em> English Launch</h2>

<p>According to an official press release. <em>Video Game Champion</em> is a family-friendly competitive board game for 2-5 players. It puts players in the shoes of a child in the 1990s, a world full of pizza bagels, video game cartridges, and rental stores. The goal is to get the most impressive collection of video games and be the coolest kid in the neighborhood.</p>

You'll navigate earning an allowance, convincing your parents to buy you games, and doing chores to save up for the latest cutting-edge 16-bit game releases. Those resources include money chips, button chips, and "I owe you" chips.</p>

<p>These decisions are taken via an Action Grid, which includes studying, reading gaming magazines, or completing household tasks. In addition, you will need to raid store shelves to find the best "fictional releases." After all, you don't want to just buy these games; you want to make time to play them too.</p>

<p>The titles in <em>Video Game Champion</em> aren't official releases, but they invoke the spirit of the era courtesy of 16-bit inspired box art and titles like "<em>Dragon Scales</em>" or "<em>Neow Racing</em>".</p>

This is a line of bespoke, critically acclaimed board game products hand-selected by board game reviewer Tom Vasel. This line includes the acclaimed Japanese board game <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/ito-card-game-getting-western-localization" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Ito</a>.</em></p>

<p>Furthermore, this is an English localized version of the Brazilian Portuguese version, <em>O Born Do Videogame</em>, designed by Patrick Matheus and André Luiz Silva Negrão. This is notable since the game was released in 2023 in Dutch, French, and German.</p>

<p><em>Video Game Champion</em> is available now at both online and physical retail outlets. It is currently being sold at an MSRP of $59.99.</p>

<p>A terminally ill fan of the Borderlands series was given the opportunity to play Borderlands 4 after his plea reached developer Gearbox.</p>



<p>Caleb McAlpine, a Borderlands fan with Stage 4 terminal cancer, was flown out with a friend to Gearbox Software in order to experience the upcoming game. In a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/borderlands3/comments/1h01zdn/just_an_update_thank_you_everyone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">post on Reddit</a>, McAlpine spoke about his experience at the studio. </p>



<p>After meeting the developers and CEO Randy Pitchford to playing an early build of Borderlands 4, he wanted to express his thanks to everyone who helped make this dream a reality. </p>



<p>“We got to play what they have for Borderlands 4 so far and it was amazing,” McAlpine said. “I don’t know if I will be around when the game Comes out but I just want to say thank you to all of you for all of your love and support and for helping in making this happen. It truly was an amazing experience and it was just awesome.</p>



<p>Borderlands 4 is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-announced-at-opening-night-live/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scheduled to launch sometime</a> in 2025 for Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC. More details about the game will be announced at a later date.</p>



<p>McApline’s latest prognosis as of October was that he had less than two years if chemotherapy slowed the progression of the cancer. </p>



<p>We wish Caleb all the best in his current fight. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/fortnite-vbucks-fraud-credit-card-bank-chargeback<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last Thursday, I woke up to an interesting notification: My credit card had declined on an otherwise routine transaction. “Maybe I’m just out of money,” I groggily considered, early-day brain fog preventing me from entering a state of full-on panic. A few hours later, my bank informed me of the true culprit: Somebody had fraudulently obtained my card info and had been using it to make purchases for weeks.&nbsp;</p><p>These included expensive jackets, regular trips to a kava bar, multiple OnlyFans subscriptions, and nearly $100 worth of in-game <em>Fortnite </em>items. Fortunately, the bank was able to resolve the situation relatively painlessly, but it got me wondering: What happened to those <em>Fortnite </em>items?&nbsp;</p><p>The bank issued a chargeback to Epic, meaning the company would not get to keep my money. But <em>Fortnite </em>skins, emotes, and whatnot are digital goods, theoretically infinite in supply unlike, say, a nice jacket or an amount of kava that I’m not sure is healthy. If this person was allowed to keep the items, Epic would suffer no (immediate) material harm.&nbsp;</p><p>Out of curiosity and a small amount of schadenfreude, I decided to ask Epic how it handles these situations – how the company responds once it has received a payment dispute resulting in a chargeback. An Epic spokesperson pointed me in the direction of <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/chargebacks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a bespoke page</a> on the official <em>Fortnite </em>website concerning these matters.</p><p>“Once a chargeback is filed, we will remove any purchased items that are associated with the chargeback from the account,” the page reads, meaning that this random person whose habits I’d come to know a strange amount about by way of them robbing me almost certainly lost their ill-gotten <em>Fortnite </em>goods. Bummer!</p><p>They won’t be able to get the items back, either – at least, for a time. My largely-circumstantial nemesis split their in-game purchases between two separate transactions on two different days, meaning two chargebacks. Unfortunately for them, Epic currently employs a two-strikes-and-you’re-out system.</p><p>"After two or more chargebacks,” reads <em>Fortnite</em>’s chargebacks page, “the account from which the unauthorized purchase was made will be blocked from making purchases across Epic products for up to one year."</p><p>Epic used to be even stricter about this stuff. For a time, it would ban accounts associated with chargebacks, but has since made changes to “better account for certain non-fraud-related scenarios that could result in a chargeback.” An Epic spokesperson told Aftermath that such scenarios could include a player initiating a chargeback “for an unwanted purchase instead of contacting Epic's Player Support to obtain a refund for a real money transaction.” Following those changes, Epic claims to have restored at least some accounts that were banned under the previous policy.&nbsp;</p><p>The Epic spokesperson would not provide examples of circumstances in which the company now bans accounts. “We do not disclose what leads to a permanent ban so players cannot game our system,” they told Aftermath.&nbsp;</p><p>All of which is to say, at the very least, the person who spent nearly $100 of my – and by virtue of Aftermath being a subscription-driven site, your – hard-earned dollars on <em>Fortnite </em>is now bereft, certainly of items if nothing else. This might seem like an instance of justice being served, but I find it difficult to feel entirely good about any of it. People don’t generally steal for kicks; they do it <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10354492/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">because they’re in need of something</a>, whether that means supplies and shelter or simple joys.</p><p>On top of the aforementioned digital and non-digital goods, the person who got a hold of my card info also spent a truly alarming amount on insurance. I can’t fault them for that! If I suddenly found myself playing with what felt like house money, I’d almost certainly do the same. I don’t think I’d buy <em>Fortnite </em>items, but that’s more a matter of taste than anything else.</p><p><strong>Update 11/27/24: </strong>Clarified language around when Epic bans accounts as opposed to temporarily blocking their ability to make purchases.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Forza Horizon 5 was all set to launch on PlayStation 5 (PS5), but the game’s release on the console was ultimately delayed. That’s according to a new claim by known leaker eXtas1s.</p>



<p>In a post on <a href="https://x.com/eXtas1stv/status/1861854891389432228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a>, they said that the release was delayed over the summer, but made sure to clarify that it wasn’t cancelled. It was then said that the belief is that the game would be a success on PS5 and that it’s still in the plans. </p>



<p>“It will arrive,” they said via translation. “I don’t know when, but it will arrive.”</p>

<p>As far as why Forza Horizon 5’s release on PS5 was delayed, that wasn’t revealed by eXtas1s.</p>



<p>Over the past year, Xbox has made more of an effort to bring its exclusive games to other platforms, including the PS5. Earlier this year, the company released <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hi-fi-rush-pentiment-are-first-xbox-games-coming-to-other-consoles-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hi-Fi Rush and Pentiment</a> on the system. It was also revealed over the summer that Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, another Xbox console exclusive, would <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-confirmed-for-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">make its way to PS5 in 2025</a>. Current reports <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-is-targeting-an-april-2025-release-for-ps5-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suggest an April 2025</a> release date for the game.</p>



<p>As with any rumors, please take them with a grain of salt until a release is officially announced or </p>
