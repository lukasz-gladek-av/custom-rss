            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/13/24320607/lenovo-legion-go-8-leak-gamepad<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Earlier today, <a href="https://x.com/evleaks/status/1867499994090963132">Evan Blass revealed</a> an unannounced Lenovo Legion Go S handheld gaming PC with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/13/24320477/lenovo-legion-go-s-steamos-handheld-gaming-pc-rumors">an <em>extremely</em> intriguing twist</a>: a Steam button that suggests it could be the first third-party SteamOS handheld, and thus the first true competitor to the Steam Deck.</p><p>But that handheld gaming PC apparently won’t be alone: Blass just provided <em>The Verge</em> with these images of a new, larger Lenovo Legion Go as well. </p><p>As you can see, this Legion Go plans to keep the detachable Joy-Con like gamepads and kickstand that were the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24088011/lenovo-legion-go-review">single most distinctive features of the original</a> — and they’ll keep the “FPS mode” where you can plop one of those controllers on a disc-shaped skate and use it like a vertical mouse. </p><p>But one model may also swap out the Legion Go’s 8.8-inch IPS LCD screen for one with an OLED panel at the same size, according to the original filenames of these images. That should mean improved colors and deeper blacks, and potentially improved response times.</p><p>We don’t have any specs or marketing claims yet, though, like the all-important battery life size. Nor have we gotten a glimpse of the ports on this system. There is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/6/24237735/amd-z2-extreme-gaming-handheld-pc-chip">an AMD Z2 Extreme chip coming</a> that could likely be the core of this handheld, but we don’t yet know.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24088011/lenovo-legion-go-review">In my review of the original Legion Go</a>, I was mixed on the detachable controllers with their sharp-ish edges and loads of extra mouse buttons that made them awkward to hold. These one seem to be far more smoothly sculpted, though, with revised mouse buttons on the right detachable pad, and a cover you can place over the mounting rail so the copper charging pins don’t poke your palm.</p><p>The images we’ve seen do <em>not</em> feature a Steam button, so it’s quite likely Lenovo is still hedging its bets with Windows in addition to SteamOS.</p><p>But we <em>are</em> much more confident in our prediction that the smaller Lenovo Legion Go S will be a SteamOS handheld. Blass showed me filenames that suggest the S will be “powered by” Steam, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/6/24315098/valve-steam-machines-steamos-steam-deck-vr#:~:text=Valve%20now%20has%20an%20explicit%20label%20for%20third%20parties%20to%20create%20%E2%80%9CPowered%20by%20SteamOS%E2%80%9D%20devices">mirroring Valve’s new branding guidelines</a> for “Powered by SteamOS” devices. </p><p>Valve defines “Powered by SteamOS” as “hardware running the SteamOS operating system, implemented in close collaboration with Valve.” </p><p>We’ve reached out to Valve and Lenovo to hopefully learn more.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It has been confirmed that Geralt of Rivia <strong>will indeed appear </strong>in The Witcher 4, but everyone involved is NDA’d out of their minds and can’t say exactly in what capacity he’ll surface.</p>



<p>It was just a few days ago that Doug Cockle, the veteran voice actor behind Geralt, confirmed that he’d ‘been slapped’ by CDPR for commenting about appearing in The Witcher 4. Now, CDPR itself has confirmed that Geralt will appear in the upcoming title, which was unveiled this week at The Game Awards.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-on-the-path">On The Path</h2>



<p>In the first trailer for The Witcher 4, a few seconds were reserved right at the tail end for a line from Doug Cockle in true Geralt form. It referenced staying on ‘the path’ that Witchers follow, and it commented on this being the beginning of a new saga.</p>



<p>The Witcher 4 will star Ciri in a leading role, which shouldn’t come as a surprise to the franchise’s truest fans. It has always been about Ciri, after all – it was <strong>expected </strong>that she’d take up the mantle of ‘The Witcher’ in this all-new game from CDPR.</p>



<p>In an interview <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/geralt-is-in-the-witcher-4-and-that-is-indeed-doug-cockles-voice-in-the-trailer-cd-projekt-confirms" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">with IGN</a>, CD Projekt confirmed:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Geralt will appear in the game, but we don’t want to spoil his role precisely. You’ll have to wait to learn more for now.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>At the end of Blood and Wine, the final expansion for 2015’s The Witcher 3, Geralt effectively retired to a vineyard in Toussaint. What he’s been doing since then is anyone’s guess, but it’s now assumed to be canonical that Ciri took up the silver sword and went Witchering in his place. </p>



<p>In the trailer for The Witcher 4, we see an empowered Ciri consuming potions and using signs, which means she’s undergone the Trial of the Grasses, at the very least.</p>



<p>Perhaps Geralt of Rivia will appear in The Witcher 4 in a similar role that Vesemir served in The Witcher 3, as a wise old mentor.</p>

<p>Have you ever wanted to own a 1/2 scale replica of The Witcher’s Ciri of Cintra? Well, thanks to Pure Arts, you can now do just that – but it’ll set you back $3,000.</p>



<p>Recently, the high-end collectables company unveiled a brand-new Ciri statue (nice timing), and it stands almost four feet tall. It’s limited to just 500 pieces and it’s arguably the most detailed statue I’ve seen in my entire life.</p>



<p>Do you think you’ll invest in the ultimate Ciri statue?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-unreal-detail">Unreal Detail</h2>



<p>Pure Arts’ Ciri of Cintra statue is nothing short of mind-blowing.</p>



<p>For $3,000, you’re getting a ‘hyperdetailed’ statue with glass eyes, individually punched synthetic hair, silicone skin, ‘real clothing’, and metal weapons. The team has assembled a design that uses real leather, hand-sewn elements, removable accessories, and a polyresin base for durability.</p>



<p>It weighs a whopping 14 kilos – 20.5 kilos if you include the packaging.</p>



<p>The statue depicts Ciri as she appears in 2015’s The Witcher 3, standing on a plinth alongside a piece of headgear (or perhaps <em>a head</em>) from one of the riders of The Wild Hunt. She’s midway through drawing her silver sword, looking intense and standing ready for a fight.</p>



<p>Pure Arts has also produced a similar statue of Geralt of Rivia. It’s almost the same size and weight as the Ciri statue, but the team has ramped up the detail on this one, individually implanting each beard hair on his face. It’s unparalleled, truly.</p>



<p>It’ll cost up to $300 to have these items shipped, and the Geralt of Rivia statue costs $3,499 for starters, so you’ll need to be prepared to part ways with a pretty penny to secure these figures.</p>

Game director Alex Cox recently talked about why the team at Hangar 13 chose that setting and time for the new Mafia game after the latest entries were set in later time periods of mob history.</p><p>Cox said in an <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/12/12/mafia-the-old-country-preview/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">interview with Xbox </a>that while the first three Mafia games explored different eras of the American mafia, the team "loved the idea of heading to Sicily and exploring the early years of this fearsome crime organization."</p><p>For comparison, the original Mafia took place in the 1930s, with Mafia II picking up in the 1940s. Mafia III, meanwhile, was set in the late 1960s.</p><p>Cox went on to say that making The Old Country has been a "refreshing departure" for Hangar 13, as its staffers got to work on elements of the "rugged Sicilian countryside" as opposed to the busy cities of the other Mafia games.</p><p>"Building this story has been a great experience for everyone at Hangar 13--first learning about Sicilian history and the origins of the Mafia, then adapting that into an exciting criminal adventure," Cox said.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrB-tEzp7ag" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FrB-tEzp7ag" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In particular, though, Cox said he's excited about elements of the time period, including horses, vintage vehicles, and knife duels. Taking place in the early 1900s means cars with hand-crank engines will appear in The Old Country, he said. "We've never had the player riding on horseback before! Galloping across the Sicilian countryside feels incredibly freeing and is unlike anything we've done in the past," Cox explained.</p><p>While no entry in the Mafia series has been set completely in Sicily, the first mission in Mafia II, titled <a href="https://mafiagame.fandom.com/wiki/The_Old_Country_(Mafia_II_Chapter)" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Old Country</a>, takes players to Sicily in 1943.</p><p>Developers from Hangar 13 visited Sicily to get a firsthand look and feel for the island and its culture. Cox went on to say that Hangar 13 has been working with a "local Sicilian partner" that gave the studio "invaluable guidance." The team also consulted Sicilian history experts to help the developers nail down things like era-appropriate bricks, music, and even swear words.</p><p>Because The Old Country is set in the early 1900s, players won't have access to modern weapons, so the game aims to make combat feel "more tactical and deliberate."</p><p>"We've leaned heavily into the 'tools of the trade' of a Sicilian Mafioso, from lupara shotguns to stiletto blades. There's real grit to these older, more traditional weapons," Cox said.</p><p>Finally, although The Old Country features a new main cast of characters and aims to appeal to newcomers to the series, Cox said existing fans "will get a kick out of how Mafia: The Old Country connects to the rest [of the franchise]."</p><p>The Old Country releases Summer 2025 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>

Here’s that trailer, which you might have missed if you were watching as it got somewhat buried under all the <em>other </em>big reveals of the night. </p><p>If you’re a <em>Turok</em> fan like me, after watching this trailer your probably had a similar question: Wait, this is a third-person shooter? And yes, it is. In a new post on the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://blog.playstation.com/2024/12/13/turok-origins-announced-for-ps5-first-gameplay-details/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/12/13/turok-origins-announced-for-ps5-first-gameplay-details/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Official PlayStation Blog</a></span>, Saber Interactive game director Jesus Iglesias explained why they made the shift to third-person, considering the classic franchise is mostly known as an FPS series. </p><p>“We’re all big fans of the previous games and the franchise overall,” said Iglesias. “But ultimately we wanted to explore a different direction from the previous <em>Turok </em>titles.”</p><p>“Saber has a rich history of making third-person shooters and our experience in that space gives us a unique opportunity to evolve the franchise while keeping familiar elements that make for a great <em>Turok </em>experience. We’ve created a fresh take on the classic <em>Turok </em>franchise that fans both old and new will enjoy.”</p><p>I guess it does make sense that Saber Interactive, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/world-war-z-is-almost-the-left-4-dead-successor-ive-wan-1834174006&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/world-war-z-is-almost-the-left-4-dead-successor-ive-wan-1834174006">who previously developed <em>World War Z </em></a></span>and this year’s well-reviewed <em>Space Marine 2 </em>(both third-person shooters), would go that direction with <em>Turok</em>, but it still seems odd to me. However, I loved <em>Space Marine 2</em>, so I’m still excited to play <em>Turok: Origins</em>. </p><p>As for just how this latest <em>Turok </em>ties into the bigger franchise, Saber Interactive isn’t ready to say, but does suggest it will have some connections. Iglesias also confirmed that while <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://turokorigins.com/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://turokorigins.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Turok: Origins</em></a></span><em> </em>supports co-op, like <em>Space Marine 2</em>, it can be played solo as well. </p><p>The shift to third-person is unexpected, but I suspect fans will be more open to this entry in the series than the last new release, which was 2019's cuddly isometric action game <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/G2rJYBOIAxo&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/G2rJYBOIAxo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Turok: Escape from Lost Valley.</em></a></span><em> </em></p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>It's 12 days until Christmas, and Larian Studios is once again bringing Baldur's Gate 3 games and puzzles to fans until the big day. <a href="https://advent.larian.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">This year's advent calendar</a> games are jigsaw puzzles, with today's puzzle being a nine-piece puzzle that plays a video from Aiofe Wilson, Larian's senior communications developer, and CEO Swen Vincke.</p><p>Larian did similar things with other games like Divinity 2, but with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-update-with-cross-play-12-new-subclasses-detailed/1100-6528108/" data-ref-id="1100-6528108">Baldur's Gate 3's final patch on the way</a>, it makes sense to celebrate the game one more time and to hype up what's coming down the pipeline.

That's when Vincke interrupts and takes it away.</p><p>"Sorry about that! Uh, no. This thing? It needs a lot more time in the oven. By the time it's going to be finished it's going to be so big," Vincke exclaimed. "For the time being? You're going to have to wait."

                <p>Bandai Namco is making a bold pivot for Pac-Man’s 45th anniversary next year with Shadow Labyrinth. Announced at The Game Awards, the new game is a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pac-man-reimagined-as-a-hollow-knight-inspired-2d-action-platformer-shadow-labyrinth/1100-6528429/" data-ref-id="1100-6528429">wild reimagining of the iconic yellow puck</a>. Instead of a family-friendly arcade game, Shadow Labyrinth is a much darker take on the franchise that appears to pull inspiration from hits like Hollow Knight and Ori and the Blind Forest.

                <p>Nearly 20 years after its release, Okami is getting a sequel. The project was announced during The Game Awards, and while we still don’t have a specific release date or platforms, Hideki Kamiya is confirmed to be spearheading the game. That means you have plenty of time to play through the original in anticipation of Okami 2, and right now, you can grab the Steam version of <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dpbolvw.net%2Fclick-100770772-13797872%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.fanatical.com%252Fen%252Fgame%252Fokami-hd&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fprep-for-okami-2-with-this-deal-for-nearly-60-off-okami-hd-on-pc%2F1100-6528465%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Okami HD</a> for just $8.59 (was $20) on Fanatical. This deal expires on December 25, so you only have a couple of weeks to cash in on the offer.</p><p>Though Okami was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/okami-review/1900-6157846/" data-ref-id="1900-6157846">originally launched on PS2 in 2006</a>, it was remastered and released as Okami HD on various platforms, including a port to PC in 2017.

Most are based in Maryland.&nbsp;</p><p>“With a union, we are looking forward to collectively pushing for improvements to the workplace, including job security, protections against AI, better pay and benefits – in an industry that we’re so deeply passionate about,” ZOS United wrote on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/zosunited.bsky.social/post/3ld5jhqnqfs26" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bluesky</a>.</p><p>ZeniMax more broadly is home to a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23495140/microsoft-zenimax-media-union-vote-qa-workers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">QA union</a> that staged <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/zenimax-union-workers-strike-in-protest-of-microsoft-remote-work-and-outsourcing-policies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a strike in November</a> over return-to-work and outsourcing policies.

I love movies and games about isolation. I think, in my ideal reality, I’d be aimlessly floating in a little space station, with excellent wifi and perhaps a module for my wife and kid. When I see such circumstances represented in games, I’m always absolutely intrigued. From <em>No Man’s Sky</em> to <em>Subnautica</em> to <em>Raft</em> to 2008's <em>Minecraft </em>even, I’m so drawn into the serenity of solitude. And despite having a name I cannot remember thirteen seconds after last typing it, <em>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</em> immediately gave me those same vibes.</p><p>It’s not a genre vibe, I should add. Clearly this looks like a fighty-fighty game that sees you battling evil robots, rather than some sort of survival sim. It’s just about being someone who’s content with their own company. A misanthrope? No, not quite. Let’s go with “introvert.”</p><p>I also just instantly liked the character. Apparently she’s called Jordan A. Mun, a bounty hunter, clearly pursuing an obsession that her agent wishes she’d leave  alone. The newspaper clippings on her ship show that she used to be part of a legendary band of criminals called the Five Aces, and among their number was the person she’s now chasing: Colin Graves, played by actor Kumail Nanjiani (<em>The Big Sick</em>, <em>The Eternals</em>). We can extrapolate that the gang broke up, and now she’s hunting them all down.</p><p>Mun, played by Tati Gabrielle, is just so immediately personable. She’s twinkle-eyed, gleeful in her refusal to follow her agent’s advice, and thanks to some stunning motion capture and art, conveys vast amounts about her character through the smallest expressions. I want to hang, except neither of us would actually want to hang. We’d nod at one another, then sit at separate ends of the ship.</p><figure id="" data-id="fd606d5d0f6ed4b790fa81502dbbcafa" data-recommend-id="image://fd606d5d0f6ed4b790fa81502dbbcafa" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1084" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A wall of newspaper clippings and a photograph of the Five Aces." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A wall of newspaper clippings and a photograph of the Five Aces." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Naughty Dog / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fd606d5d0f6ed4b790fa81502dbbcafa" data-recommend-id="image://fd606d5d0f6ed4b790fa81502dbbcafa" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1084" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A wall of newspaper clippings and a photograph of the Five Aces." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>And while the hitting a robot with a sword element of the trailer didn’t exactly make me leap out of my chair in delight, I’m finding myself in the weird position of being delighted that this is a Naughty Dog game, despite my, er, not exactly enthusiastic history with the studio’s output.</p><p>In fact, when it comes to Naughty Dog’s games, I’m quite the downer. I absolutely cannot stand <em>Crash Bandicoot</em>—it seems like the anathema of gaming to me, a game in which you can’t see where you’re going and have to fail to progress: bleurgh. It’s <em>Rick Dangerous 3D</em>. Then, due to my being pretty much PC-only during the PS2/3 era, I totally missed out on the first releases in the <em>Uncharted</em> series. When <em>The Last of Us</em> came out I was intrigued, but then I instantly absolutely detested it. I hated it! Like, in a way I would normally characterize as somewhat problematic in a person!</p><p>I hated the way it so callously killed a child purely as a means to give motivation to some dullard bloke (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-last-of-us-hbo-tv-show-ps5-game-remake-episode-1849995987&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-last-of-us-hbo-tv-show-ps5-game-remake-episode-1849995987">I wrote about this in more detail a while back</a></span>), and I hated that it was a cover shooter at a time when <em>everything </em>was a cover shooter. I found it arrogant and irritating in the extreme! </p><figure id="" data-id="9520c21f7af69cbaac1b9f9ac2ef5a9b" data-recommend-id="image://9520c21f7af69cbaac1b9f9ac2ef5a9b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Mun charges toward a four-armed robot wielding a giant glowy sword thing." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Mun charges toward a four-armed robot wielding a giant glowy sword thing." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Naughty Dog / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9520c21f7af69cbaac1b9f9ac2ef5a9b" data-recommend-id="image://9520c21f7af69cbaac1b9f9ac2ef5a9b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Mun charges toward a four-armed robot wielding a giant glowy sword thing." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Now, I’m not defending any of this as some sort of critical position. It’s pure emotion, a visceral reaction that is quite unlike me, and given so many people whose opinions and intelligence I love and respect enjoy the game so much, I feel sure I am missing out. (I’ll still argue that it was a grotesque, awful “fridging” though, and probably fold my arms.)</p><p>But I did eventually catch up on <em>Uncharted</em>, and big news: those games are great! I really enjoyed them! I had issues, and bloody hell, crates. But yeah, really lovely games, with—and here’s the key—fantastic, personable storytelling.</p><p>And it’s this that makes me think, “Actually, maybe I’ll bother to grind through yet more hitting robots with swords, if it means I get to experience acting as good as I saw in this trailer and a story deserving of that character, I’m in. (Shout-out to whoever is playing the agent as well—I loved her delivery so much too!) I’m ready to go. I have such good vibes! I want to be the cool space criminal bounty hunter who thrives on her own!</p><p>Of course, it could end up being be stinky-poops (a critical term you likely aren’t familiar with). I don’t know! No one does. Forming conclusions on this game after a single trailer would be perhaps <em>deeply</em> stupid. But if I’m going to allow myself a moment of vibes-based enthusiasm, of all the games in that teetering pile of commercials, this is the game that got me. I’m excited.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/is-elden-ring-nightreign-starting-a-fromsoft-multiverse<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">For the first couple of minutes, the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/elden-ring-nightreign-official-gameplay-reveal-trailer-the-game-awards-2024">trailer for Elden Ring Nightreign</a> is… not exactly predictable, but certainly understandable. It’s Elden Ring like we’ve never seen it before, remixed and reassembled, but still unmistakably a return to The Lands Between. And then… <em>is that The Nameless King from Dark Souls 3?</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">And then you rewind and pay closer attention. Yes, that <em><strong>is </strong></em>The Nameless King from Dark Souls 3, and he’s not the only boss from FromSoftware’s back catalogue making a comeback. Another rewind and another closer inspection reveals that friendly NPCs from Dark Souls have also arrived in the world of Elden Ring. Not only that, but even gameplay mechanics from across the developer’s portfolio of work have found their way into this upcoming co-op roguelite. And so there’s one question that burns brighter than any other:</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Is Elden Ring Nightreign introducing a FromSoftware multiverse? </h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/dark-souls-3/Nameless_King">The Nameless King</a> is one of the most ruthless opponents in Dark Souls 3. He’s a significant figure in the series' lore, having first been detailed in the original Dark Souls and its sequel before finally appearing in the flesh as an optional boss in the final part of the trilogy. He’s known for his imposing dragon mount and ability to channel lightning, both of which are seen in the final minute of Nightreign’s trailer. There’s no mistaking him: this isn’t a tribute, homage, or lookalike: The Nameless King is a foe in the next Elden Ring game. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/13/elden-ring-nightreign-nameless-king-1734104806196.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Nameless King flies by atop his steed in Elden Ring Nightreign. Image credit: FromSoftware</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If seeing wasn’t believing, the official Dark Souls social media channels have confirmed that elements of the series will appear in Nightreign, albeit in a characteristically cryptic manner. “In the Night, ancestral foes await - remnants of a fire that once burned bright,” reads the post on X, which accompanies a repost of the Nightreign trailer. </p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">In the Night, ancestral foes await - remnants of a fire that once burned bright.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ELDENRING?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#ELDENRING</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NIGHTREIGN?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#NIGHTREIGN</a> launches on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC Digital in 2025. <a href="https://t.co/TyPLQabumO" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/TyPLQabumO</a></p>— Dark Souls (@DarkSoulsGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/DarkSoulsGame/status/1867384137361043506?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">December 13, 2024</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The two series are definitely being linked, then. And so other familiar creatures begin to make a lot of sense. Two further Dark Souls enemies can be spotted among Bandai Namco’s marketing materials. One minute and 22 seconds into the trailer, we see a team of warriors battling with a grotesque, multi-limbed beast, its exposed ribcage set aflame by a player’s explosive bolt. Longterm fans will instantly recognise this foe as the Centipede Demon from the original Dark Souls, albeit with a significant graphical facelift. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/13/elden-ring-nightreign-centipede-demon-1734104943135.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The grotesque Centipede Demon from Dark Souls 1... in Elden Ring? Image credit: FromSoftware</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Just a few seconds earlier there’s a shot of a crawling spider that evokes the arachnid-infested areas of Dark Souls 2. But the golden evidence of Dark Souls 2’s involvement can be found in a screenshot released alongside the trailer, which straight up reveals that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/dark-souls-2/Freja">The Duke’s Dear Freja</a>, a colossal eight-legged nightmare, will make an appearance in Nightreign. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/13/elden-ring-nightreign-dear-freja-1734103157777.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Nightreign's characters do battle with The Duke's Dear Freja from Dark Souls 2. Image credit: FromSoftware</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s a boss from each game in the Dark Souls trilogy, then. But there’s more evidence to suggest that it's not just the enemies of FromSoft’s flagship series that have found their way into Elden Ring. At the trailer’s mid-point we’re introduced to a woman who wears an ornate metal face mask over her eyes and nose – the unmistakable attire of Dark Souls 3’s Fire Keeper. Now, I have to admit that this character’s voice does not sound like an exact match to the original character. But actors are not always available to reprise old roles, and – alongside all the other evidence – it doesn’t seem a stretch to suggest our old Firelink Shrine companion may be a big part of Nightreign’s story. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Mechanical Mixup</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Returning friends and foes are the obvious thing to get excited about, but there are smaller, potentially more impactful gameplay elements seen in the trailer that also point to something of an overlapping multiverse effect. Rather than allowing you to create your own character, Nightreign asks you to step into the shoes of a pre-defined hero with their own unique skillset. Of the ones revealed so far, Duchess and Wylder are of the most interest. Duchess’ exquisitely tailored outfit immediately brings Bloodborne to mind. While I’m not yet convinced by fan theories that this is an alternate version of Lady Maria, I am excited by her quickstep ability, which replicates the dodge mechanic of FromSoft’s beloved Lovecraftian nightmare. Wylder, meanwhile, has access to a grappling hook that replicates some of the utility of Sekiro’s own prosthetic tool.  </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/13/elden-ring-nightreign-stake-driver-1734103085208.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">A character weilds what looks to be a crossbow-like version of Bloodborne's Stake Driver weapon. Image credit: FromSoftware</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s hard to claim these elements are multiversal in the same way as the literal appearance of old bosses, but it’s fascinating nonetheless to see these elements bleed into Elden Ring. Afterall, the unique gameplay flavours of each FromSoft game are as important as the bosses. Further, non-character-specific mechanics include the ability to clamber up walls akin to the hero of Sekrio, being carried by a spectral bird from one location to another in a manner similar to the Giant Crow ride in Dark Souls, and what really does seem to be a medieval fantasy version of Bloodborne’s Stake Driver attached to Wylder’s arm during the battle against the Centipede Demon. As a long-time FromSoft fan, it’s hard not to be excited about all this. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Law of Lore</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">As with anything FromSoftware creates, there’s a natural urgency to want to know how everything fits into the lore. There’s only so much to know at this very early stage, but <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-fromsoftware-game-director-explains-why-the-spin-off-exists-reveals-whether-george-r-r-martin-was-involved-and-why-fans-shouldnt-call-it-a-live-service">our own interview with game director Junya Ishizaki</a> at least gives us a starting point for theories. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We'd like fans to think of Nightreign as an Elden Ring spin-off, first and foremost,” Ishizaki explained. “The story is completely separate and parallel to the world of Elden Ring’s. If you had to tie it in some way, we had the events of the shattering in the original game. After the events of the shattering, this is a completely separate branch of the Elden Ring story.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So Nightreign is a separate timeline. Post the shattering, anything could have happened in this version of Elden Ring’s history. But no matter what kind of tale is written in this world’s own warped history books, the end result is the reign of the Night Lord – this new game’s ultimate foe. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The Nox live under a false night sky, in eternal anticipation of their liege. Their Lord of Night.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you feel like you’ve heard that name before, it’s probably because you’ve either read plenty of item descriptions in Elden Ring or watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOJ5rCT_D6Q&amp;ab_channel=VaatiVidya" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VaatiVidya’s lore video about the Nox</a>. In the interest of time, here are your CliffsNotes: the Nox are the people you encounter in the underground Eternal Cities of Nokron and Nokstella, where they – according to in-game descriptions – “live under a false night sky, in eternal anticipation of their liege. Of the coming age of the stars. And their Lord of Night.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lord of Night. Night Lord. Could it be that Elden Ring Nightreign depicts a timeline in which the age of stars has arrived and the Lord of Night has risen? If so, the Nox are the keepers of the mimic tear – are the things we see mimics of things from other worlds? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">A little more theorycraft suggests an alternate option. That post on the Dark Souls X feed spoke of “remnants of a fire that once burned bright.” That seems to be a reference to The First Flame, which could be extinguished in the finale of Dark Souls 3. Are the Centipede Demon, Duke’s Dear Freja, and The Nameless King “remnants” of The First Flame?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While we’re having fun, we know that the extinguishing of The First Flame is just one of multiple endings to Dark Souls 3 – endings that all, theoretically speaking, would produce their own timeline. Could it be that this alternate timeline for Elden Ring, ruled over by the Lord of Night, has merged with The End of Fire timeline of Dark Souls? Only time will tell if the lore really is so deep and thoroughly-plotted, and if this really is the start of a FromSoft multiverse… or if Nightreign is just FromSoftware letting loose and having a bit of fun. My money is on the latter.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Back in 2019, Elden Ring’s director Hidetaka Miyazaki said that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/03/08/dark-souls-creator-would-love-to-try-making-a-battle-royale-game">he was interested in making a battle royale game</a>. Five years later we have an Elden Ring multiplayer roguelike that features what appears to be a shrinking circle of death. But who could have guessed that, on the day FromSoft announced a game with battle royale elements, that the thing we’d be obsessing over was the return of a gargantuan bastard from Dark Souls 3? One thing is clear: you can count on FromSoft to continuously surprise us. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Senior Features Editor. </em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> The Witcher IV – Official Cinematic Reveal Trailer Breakdown</p>
      </div>
<p>The girl in question is named Mioni, and her family and the townspeople aren't the only ones using her. Kalemba states that Ciri is also using Mioni as bait by allowing her to sing the song that summons the monster, the Bauk. However, Ciri isn't willing to risk Mioni's life after that, so she sends her back to the village before the fight with the Bauk begins.</p><p>Unfortunately for Ciri, her hard-fought battle against the Bauk appears to be for nothing when she discovers that Mioni has been murdered by the townspeople. Intriguingly, Kalemba suggested that there is a way to save Mioni from her fate. He then hinted at choices and the resulting consequences for those decisions. So perhaps it's possible to slay the monster and keep Mioni alive. Or maybe the cost of Mioni's survival means the Bauk must be spared. We can only speculate for now.</p><p>Kalemba also recently explained how <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/cyberpunk-2077-review/1900-6417622/" data-ref-id="1900-6417622">Cyberpunk 2077</a>'s difficult development has inspired CD Projekt Red to make beneficial <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-dev-say-it-has-learned-from-its-cyberpunk-2077-mistakes/1100-6528468/" data-ref-id="1100-6528468">changes to the way The Witcher 4 is being developed</a>. The team has teased that The Witcher 4 will be "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-devs-tease-some-of-what-cd-projekt-red-is-planning/1100-6528173/" data-ref-id="1100-6528173">bigger and better</a>" than both Cyberpunk 2077 and The Witcher 3. It's currently unknown when The Witcher 4 will be released, as the project only recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-has-more-than-400-people-working-on-it-full-production-begins-this-year/1100-6522263/" data-ref-id="1100-6522263">ramped up its team to over 400 developers</a> and began full production.</p>

                <p>A new trailer for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/deepest-fear/" data-ref-id="5000-653855">Deepest Fear</a> has gone live, showing off more of the game's '80s Hollywood horror vibe. The world premiere for Deepest Fear was seen during the PC Gaming Show last week, and this is the first look at the gameplay of Deepest Fear revealed more details about the game and the monstrous creatures that will plague players as they explore a flooded deep-sea facility.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ommmPUX86P4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ommmPUX86P4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Developed by Variable State--the studio behind games like Last Stop and Virginia--Deepest Fear puts players in the shoes of Dr. Danni Carroll as she way fights her way to the heart of a sinister project that could have dire consequences for humanity.</p><p>Inspired by classic horror and action films like The Abyss, The Thing, The Fly, and Total Recall, the game has a retro-future art direction combined with a metroidvania level design. Throw in mutilated bodies, all manner of organic nastiness, and some wonderfully analogue technology, and you've got a game that looks like it was pulled straight from a David Cronenberg film set.</p><p>The environment of the Neptune facility that players will explore is full of nightmarish entities, which can potentially emerge from any water source or submerged space. Essentially, if there's a puddle or a body of water, something nasty and homicidal is lurking in it and is ready to give you a jump-scare.</p><p>To make things more challenging, the facility is prone to flooding and you'll have to make use of your wits and an arsenal of tools to uncover the mysteries of lurking set seven miles under the ocean. A release date for Deepest Fear hasn't been announced yet, and so far, it has only been confirmed for PC.</p>

                <p>The classic arcade game, Screamer, is getting new life in 2026 as an anime-inspired racing game. Developer Milestone revealed a stylish trailer during <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/classic-racing-game-screamer-roars-back-to-life-as-an-anime-inspired-tale-of-revenge-and-greed/1100-6528404/" data-ref-id="1100-6528404">The Game Awards</a>--and while it didn’t show off any gameplay, it looks like the studio is drawing heavily from manga and anime to craft a racing game with multiple character arcs and a nuanced storyline. Troy Baker--voice actor from The Last of Us--is also said to be involved. If you’re excited about seeing how Milestone reimagines this popular 1995 arcade game, preorders are now available at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DQBK9CK2?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://howl.link/wt11a1idwz641?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https://www.gamespot.com/17341094666082?u1=subid_value" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Best Buy</a>.</p><h2>Screamer Preorder Bonuses</h2><p>No preorder bonuses are available for Screamer. The game was just announced and isn't launching until some time in 2026, so it's possible preorder bonuses could be announced eventually. We’ll be sure to update this article if anything new is revealed.</p><p>Screamer will be receiving additional support from Polygon Pictures, as the animation studio is creating a variety of cutscenes for the game. Polygon Pictures previously worked on projects like Tron: Uprising, Transformers Prime, and Pacific Rim: The Black.</p><p>There’s still a lot we don’t know about the upcoming game, so be sure to stay tuned for more details--including a full gameplay reveal.</p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-exclusive-pokemon-tcg-holiday-premium-collection-gets-big-discount/1100-6528386/">Amazon-Exclusive Pokemon TCG Holiday Premium Collection Gets Big Discount</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dualsense-ps5-controllers-get-big-discounts-new-chroma-model-for-only-54-at-amazon/1100-6527935/">DualSense PS5 Controllers Get Big Discounts - New Chroma Model For Only $54 At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/woot-has-over-40-nintendo-switch-game-deals-including-many-of-the-best-exclusives-and-rare-finds/1100-6528302/">Woot Has Over 40 Nintendo Switch Game Deals, Including Many Of The Best Exclusives And Rare Finds</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-minecraft-creeper-mini-fridge-is-on-sale-for-only-29-at-walmart/1100-6528276/">The Minecraft Creeper Mini Fridge Is On Sale For Only $29 At Walmart</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-metal-puzzles-restocked-at-amazon-still-on-sale-for-only-15/1100-6522395/">The Legend Of Zelda Metal Puzzles Restocked At Amazon - Still On Sale For Only $15</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/demon-slayer-blu-rays-steeply-discounted-at-amazon-swordsmith-village-arc-launched-today/1100-6526820/">Demon Slayer Blu-Rays Steeply Discounted At Amazon - Swordsmith Village Arc Launched Today</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-collectors-edition-up-for-preorder-at-amazon/1100-6524003/">Indiana Jones And The Great Circle Collector's Edition Up For Preorder At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/get-dark-souls-board-game-for-only-51-and-roleplaying-sourcebook-for-30/1100-6527696/">Get Dark Souls Board Game For Only $51 And Roleplaying Sourcebook For $30</a></li>   </ul> </div>
