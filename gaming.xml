            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/clank-board-game-buying-guide<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Clank! is a deck-building adventure that's very much worth your consideration. The game is for 2-4 players, and while the recommendations say that it takes 30-60 minutes to complete, matches go about double that or more, especially with more players. So sit down and get ready, because it’s time to deck-build your way out of a dungeon before the monsters get you.</p><p>Clank!, made by Dire Wolf Digital and Renegade Game Studios, is a competitive game that integrates a base <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-all-time">board game</a> with cards and tokens. Movement is pushed forward with cards gained in the deck-building portion of the game. As with any <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deck-building-board-games">deck-building game</a>, you’ll start with a small collection of cards to start, but advancement will require more cards to be added through your turns. </p><p>You’ll take turns moving and exploring dungeon depths, collecting cards and artifacts, gaining mastery, and evading a boss, which in your starter game is, of course, everyone’s favorite medieval adversary: the dragon. Go through the dungeon's depths with rewards and you will score well. But wait, it’s not so simple.</p><p>When all players are knocked out of the dungeon (unless playing in a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-2-player-board-games">two-player game</a>, where the first player to do this will make the game end), successfully exits on their own or with the help of townspeople (a few spaces on the game board above the depths of the dungeon), they will add up their accumulated scores. Scores are added on acquired treasures (artifacts and other tokens gained along your journey through the dungeon), the value of gold tokens, and cards with a green amount visible in the top right-hand corner. The amount on the cards includes everything you’ve had in your collected journey- not just the ones in your hand.</p><p>The game also has an optional companion app (available for both <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.direwolfdigital.Renegade&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US&amp;pli=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Android</u></a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/renegade-games-companion/id1046548265" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Apple</u></a> users) that can be integrated into play. With the app, you’ll add a further dimension to the experience. You can also play it as a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-solo-board-games">solo board game</a> if you want to go deep alone. </p><h2>The Base Game</h2><h3>Clank! A Deck-building Adventure</h3><div><div id="164688"><p><h3>Clank!</h3></p></div><div id="164694"><p><h3>Clank! Legacy: Acquisitions Incorporated</h3></p></div></div><p><strong>Contents</strong>: Two-sided game board, 180+ cards, 80+ tokens, 30 cubes, 4 player meeples in different colors, 24 dragon cubes, cloth dragon bag, dragon monster meeple</p><p><strong>MSRP</strong>: $65.00 USD2</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>4 Players (best with 3)</li><li>20-30 minutes</li><li>Ages 13+</li></ul><p>The original base game of assorted dungeon hijinx is needed to start your adventure through what may be a series of dungeon exploits. It will guide your adventure through a simple dungeon with obstacles, even at the base game. Future expansions and packs can be added to the game to enhance the difficulty and boss monsters that seek to end your trek to defeat.</p><h2>Expansions</h2><p>Clank! has two types of expansions. The original expansions follow a similar medieval approach to the base game. They add obstacles and other medieval and fantasy-type bosses. The other expansion type goes a different route, which is more geared toward players with a deeper understanding of the game. Those expansions are broken up into space-themed dungeons and legacy playing. Space-themed editions have an expanded board and have space as their fantasy direction. Legacy editions of games are intensive versions which incorporate multiple versions of the game. They will involve numerous playthroughs to complete. As a standard, you won’t finish a legacy game version of really any game on one game night, regardless of which game it is. That’s no different with Clank!’s versions. You’ll have to sit through multiple nights of dungeon-crawling gaming for those. </p><h3>Standard Fantasy Style Expansions</h3><h3>Sunken Treasures</h3><div id="201702"><p><h3>Clank! Sunken Treasures</h3></p></div><p><strong>Contents</strong>: Two new maps, a marketplace board, more dungeon cards, Treasure rooms added to the board, room challenges from environments, and card effects brought on by discarding cards. Two-sided game board, 36 cards, market board, 5 tokens</p><p><strong>(Base Game Required)</strong></p><p><strong>MSRP</strong>: $35.00 USD</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>2-6 Players</li><li>20-30 minutes</li><li>Ages 13+</li></ul><p>This first expansion adds new sunken depths to your dungeon experience. The addition of water and environmental elements can force players to incorporate new strategies involving timing and skill. Will you sink to the bottom in defeat or will you tread water and escape to the surface unscathed?</p><h3>The Mummy's Curse</h3><div id="201703"><p><h3>Clank! The Mummy's Curse</h3></p></div><p><strong>Contents</strong>: Mummy monster in addition to the dragon, a mummy curse die, additional cards and rewards tokens, artifact changes. Two-sided game board, 41 cards, 31 tokens, market board, dragon meeple, mummy meeple, pyramid die</p><p><strong>(Base Game Required)</strong></p><p><strong>MSRP</strong>: $35.00 USD</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>2-4 Players</li><li>30-60 minutes</li><li>Ages 12+</li></ul><p>Think a dragon was a tough enough adversary for your dungeon crawl? The addition of the mummy monster will add further challenges to the dungeon. It works with curses that change the dynamic, causing havoc and frustrating the dragon. As mentioned in the contents portion, the Mummy's Curse also changes the route to acquiring artifacts in the game. The artifact changes made in this second edition of the game where a player can use an action to gain an artifact in the room (the first two editions didn’t allow for that), become a mainstay approach for all subsequent game versions.</p><h3>Expeditions: Gold and Silk</h3><div id="201704"><p><h3>Clank! Expeditions: Gold and Silk</h3></p></div><p><strong>Contents</strong>: Double-sided game board, 8-point artifact, 3 mining bonus tokens, market board, 4 player meeples, 12 web tokens, 3 mining bonus tokens, spider meeple character monster </p><p><strong>MSRP</strong>: $25.00 USD</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>2-4 Players</li><li>30-60 minutes</li><li>Ages 12+</li></ul><p>Two additional boards with a gold mine are key to this treacherous Gold &amp; Silk expansion dungeon. A spider opponent adds danger as you explore gold mines filled with gold veins and treasures. Webbed rooms create further danger. Successfully navigating the mine may result in additional treasures hidden in a section the spider has placed in its secret lair. Will you get through the spun silk before the spider gets you? </p><h3>Temple of the Ape Lords</h3><div id="201705"><p><h3>Clank! Expeditions - Temple of the Ape Lords</h3></p></div><p><strong>Contents</strong>: 1 two-sided game board, 1 Ape boss meeple, 4 player meeples</p><p><strong>MSRP</strong>: $25.00 USD</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>2-4 Players</li><li>30-60 minutes</li><li>Ages 14+</li></ul><p>This version of the game adds several elements which may make players go bananas. It integrates apes into the dungeon, bringing a barrel full of assorted shenanigans. Movement on the board can be rotated in some spaces. This version also allows for a mini-campaign mode for playing two different versions of the game- each on their side</p><h3>Clank Adventuring Party</h3><div id="201706"><p><h3>Clank! Adventuring Party</h3></p></div><p><strong>Contents</strong>: side board used for 5-6 players, 30 cubes in 2 additional colors, 6 player meeples, 6 character boards, 127 cards (including 6 starter decks each with 10 cards), 90+ tokens, Hexavultus boss meeple, rules</p><p>(The base game is required, but this expansion is also compatible with Clank! Legacy.)</p><p><strong>MSRP</strong>: $35.00 USD</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>2-6 Players</li><li>60-120 minutes</li><li>Ages 13+</li></ul><p>In Clank! Adventuring Party, you’ll gain six new adventures to choose from to guide you through the dungeon. Each adventurer in this edition will wield its own connected powers. Most are typical magic and fantasy types characters such as the dwarf, orc, elf, and mage. However, there are also a couple of animals too. You can play as a robot monkey or a cute kitten with some bite to it. This version also adds a new villain: Hexavultus. Which party will you choose to go into the depths this time? Choose wisely.</p><h2>More Expansions &amp; Add Ons</h2><p>There are multiple versions of space-type expansions in the series. The game operates a bit differently with a changeable spaceship-type board. There are three space versions of the game available. Clank in Space is the first in the series. Others in the space edition of expansions are <a href="https://zdcs.link/W0qy6" target="_blank"><u>Clank in Space: Apocalypse</u></a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/rdwy5" target="_blank"><u>Clank in Space: Cyber Station 11</u></a>.</p><p>A legacy version of the game based on a comic and podcast was created. That version is called <a href="https://zdcs.link/mV3yJ" target="_blank"><u>Clank! Legacy Acquisitions Incorporated</u></a>. </p><p>There are also character Packs (to be used in the legacy after they’ve completed the legacy version of the game: the <a href="https://zdcs.link/ZRBbv" target="_blank"><u>Upper Management Pack</u></a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/lVnyN" target="_blank"><u>The C Team Pack</u></a>.</p><p>Several promo cards can be added to the game. <br>
<strong>Bottom Line</strong></p><p>With a <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/201808/clank-a-deck-building-adventure" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>7.8 rating on Board Game Geek</u></a> and multiple dungeons to unlock, Clank! is a solid choice for your gaming adventures. The base game is tons of fun to play on its own accord, but each expansion adds an assortment of new adventures. My main complaint is that, sadly, despite the irony of the game being made by a company with “digital” in their name, Clank! isn’t available to play digitally. Their side companion app is a great addition to things, but I wish there were more ways to play. Clank! And its expansions are massive games with tons of pieces. Older kids will love this, but families, especially those with younger kids in the house, will dread when pieces go missing. Moving past those two items, the game is a highly enjoyable adventure in fantasy dungeons with enough challenges to keep folks entertained for a long time.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/duckside-hands-on-preview-dayz-and-rust-inspired-open-world-survivalbut-youre-a-duck</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/duckside-hands-on-preview-dayz-and-rust-inspired-open-world-survival-but-youre-a-duck.891846/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/duckside-hands-on-preview-dayz-and-rust-inspired-open-world-survivalbut-youre-a-duck<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Survival games like DayZ or Rust remain hard to beat, but Duckside presents an interesting challenger. Developed by tinyBuild Riga in Unreal Engine 5 with producers from Hello Neighbor, Duckside is a new persistent open-world survival game where ducks have become combat-trained. Taking the fight to both humans and fellow mallards, I recently went hands-on with the beta. So far, it's a quacking good time.</p><p>I respect that Duckside doesn't justify its unusual premise. There are currently no flimsy narratives or ridiculous origin stories explaining why ducks can suddenly wield weapons or craft tools. All we know is that they've become tired of being hunted and began fighting for freedom. Unfortunately, these new birds of prey can't shake those territorial instincts between each other. This island has become a fierce battleground, offering 50-person servers and PvE against human NPCs across a day and night cycle.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Duckside - IGN Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Using ducks over humans provides unique perks, and the flight mechanics feel great. Some issues with draw distance are noticeable, though tinyBuild confirmed this will be addressed as development progresses. Regardless, taking to the skies feels like a breeze. The stamina system ensures you can't reach unreasonable heights. Landings are usually smooth, yet even fliers can take fall damage, so this requires some precision. Sure, flying makes you an easier target and you could take evasive action. Getting the drop on enemies is considerably more fun, and shooting others when flying is surprisingly entertaining.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Shooting others when flying is surprisingly entertaining.</p></div><p>Arming yourself should be your first priority since leaving the nest unprepared can have dire consequences. Crude options like a crossbow work in a pinch, though ducks have arguably never been more terrifying than seeing one with a sawed-off shotgun. Shelter is another essential consideration when everyone wants to kill you, and location is just as crucial as building quality. While flying across the map is both quick and convenient, being on the island's fringes isn't ideal but neither is making yourself an easy target. Crafting a nest secures a respawn point within your base.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Basic materials are fittingly obtained by pecking objects like trees or rocks alongside abandoned storage cans. I enjoyed how Duckside incentivises moderation as over mining a tree can cause it to collapse, alert other ducks of your presence. Item blueprints can also teach you new recipes for item crafting, but researching new items comes at a cost, so you must use your resources wisely. Key items can be obtained by raiding human outposts like the port area or an abandoned swimming pool, a risky proposition that feels suitably rewarding when you succeed. If you get complacent, well. As the old saying goes, duck around and find out. Since intruders could storm your base at any point, keeping these materials hidden is essential for long-term survival. I learned the hard way that death empties your inventory. </p><p>Of course, you can't stay hidden forever like a lonely duckling. Fortune favors the bold, and I appreciate how Duckside stops you from becoming too comfortable. Alongside a hunger meter, bases eventually deteriorate, though they can be upgraded for increased longevity. Using a persistent server means anything you have could be gone when you next return. Some might scream fowl play, though it's a welcome challenge. Getting too greedy could turn you into someone else's golden goose, so put those materials to good use while you have them. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Duckside - First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>One of Duckside's more enjoyable server-wide objectives involves the shrine. You can initiate a sacrifice using white feathers collected by killing other ducks or by offering hunters licenses obtained from humans. That creates a parachute airdrop filled with supplies that everyone can see across the map to effectively encourage a risk vs. reward situation, though I never saw this directly.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Basic materials are fittingly obtained by pecking objects like trees or rocks alongside abandoned storage cans.</p></div><p>You could go it alone but Duckside's a game best experienced with others. Squadding up and working towards a loosely defined common goal, likely involving resource gathering and raiding someone's base, is highly entertaining. My session with the developers ended on an explosive notepad and despite a successful base infiltration, my celebration was brief. To my amusement and despair, I completely forgot about nests allowing respawns and immediately paid the price. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Alone, that likely would've been frustrating. As a team effort, it was hilarious and tinyBuild's take on open-world survival has teeth. Even though it's an early bird, Duckside shows considerable potential and I'm keen to see how this premise expands. A release date remains unconfirmed but you can jump into the open beta eggsclusively on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2682580/DUCKSIDE/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam</a> today.</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Despite its Pixar-esque graphics and adorable little creatures known as the Rot, Kena has challenging combat with a precision parrying system. Throughout the colorful odyssey across lands corrupted by a malignant force, players have to drive back the forces corrupting the majestic world, save restless spirits, and harness the adorable power of the Rot to work through puzzles. It tells a touching story about overcoming tragedy and is simply an all-around great game.</p><p>"Kena: Bridge of Spirits uses a different perspective on familiar gameplay ideas to create tons of exciting combat and a deep emotional connection with its world," Phil Hornshaw wrote in the review for the game, scoring it 9/10 in our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/kena-bridge-of-spirits-review-dont-fear-the-reaper/1900-6417744/">Kena: Bridge of Spirits review.</a></p><p>Alongside a photo mode, new game+, and other welcome post-launch updates and improvements, the Xbox version of the game includes the following extras:</p><ul><li>Digital soundtrack</li><li>Golden Rot skin</li><li>Unique Kena staff</li><li>Retail exclusive sticker sheet</li><li>Xbox exclusive pirate-themed hats</li></ul><p>If you've already played Kena on PlayStation, you should check out all of the PS5 exclusives on sale right now during <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-days-of-play-2024-ps5-deals/1100-6523751/">Days of Play</a>.</p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mad-max-5-film-limited-edition-4k-collection-and-furiosa-steelbook-up-for-preorder/1100-6523703/">Mad Max 5-Film Limited Edition 4K Collection And Furiosa Steelbook Up For Preorder</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cuphead-delicious-last-course-art-book-has-never-before-seen-content-limited-edition-up-for-preorder/1100-6523733/">Cuphead Delicious Last Course Art Book Has Never-Before-Seen Content, Limited Edition Up For Preorder</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-sports-college-football-25-preorder-guide-ps5-xbox-series-x/1100-6523506/">Walmart Has An Exclusive Edition For EA Sports College Football 25</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More Best Gaming &amp; Tech Deals This Week Links (4)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/paper-mario-thousand-year-door-nintendo-switch-preorder-guide/1100-6521751/">Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door Preorders - Release-Day Delivery Still Available</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/save-over-60-on-12-months-of-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-with-targets-limited-time-deal/1100-6523230/">Save Over $60 On 12 Months Of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate With Target's Limited-Time Deal</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-world-championships-nes-edition-preorder-guide-nintendo-switch/1100-6523267/">Nintendo World Championships Deluxe Set Preorders Are Only Available At Select Retailers</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-portal-restock-guide/1100-6520876/">PlayStation Portal Is Back In Stock At Multiple Major Retailers</a></li>   </ul> </div>

<p data-characters="328" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">I was watching the Guerilla Collective Stream today when <em>W.I.L.D. Tactics’</em> trailer <a href="https://youtu.be/V6-rr6Lfbfw?si=s_yCj1Iw6fczRXRj" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hit the air</a>. It seemed familiar. I was certain I hadn’t seen it before and didn’t recognize the art style, but there was something familiar. Then the Wild Gentlemen logo flashed on screen, and I knew. This is a <em>Chicken Police </em>spin-off.</p> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="WILD Tactics | Official Reveal Trailer" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V6-rr6Lfbfw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="440" data-current-count="740" data-injectable="true"><em>Chicken Police</em> is something that <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/indie-spotlight-chicken-police/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I always hover around</a>. I named the next mainline game in the series, <em>Chicken Police: Into the Hive</em> my <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/destructoids-most-anticipated-games-of-2024/">most anticipated game of 2024</a>. What draws me to these games is the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/zipps-cafe-is-a-short-form-prologue-game-with-heart/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">obvious passion behind their world-building</a>. It doesn’t necessarily matter what form the games take, but that storytelling is just delectable. I’d make a finger-lickin’ reference there, but I’ve done that enough in other articles.</p>
 <p data-characters="392" data-current-count="392" data-injectable="false">While the trailer for <em>W.I.L.D. Tactics</em> is entirely a flashy animated teaser with no gameplay, screenshots and information have <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2384640/WILD_Tactics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">arrived elsewhere</a>. It’s a turn-based strategy game made in the vein of <em>XCOM</em> but with the series’ noir stylings and anthropomorphic characters. It promises 15 story-focused missions that range from stealth to all-out assault, and 12 characters to carry them out.</p> <p data-characters="173" data-current-count="565" data-injectable="true">While press material pushes the “story-focused” angle, there is squad and base management, upgrades, and a social system between the characters to keep things dynamic.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="41" data-current-count="41" data-injectable="false">They had me at “World of Wilderness.”</p> <p data-characters="126" data-current-count="167" data-injectable="false"><em>W.I.L.D. Tactics </em>currently doesn’t have a release window, but will be coming to PC. Other platforms will be announced later.</p>

<p data-characters="248" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">After a successful open beta earlier this year, TinyBuild has announced that a second open beta for <em>Duckside</em> is now live. More than 150,000 players jumped into the first beta and the developer is expecting many more to take up the call to arms now.</p> <p data-characters="468" data-current-count="468" data-injectable="true"><em>Duckside</em> is a PvP, PvE base building and crafting title set in a persistent open world where players can form groups, create a base of operations, and then head out on missions to raid others, attack marked locations on the map, and cause all kinds of Mallard mayhem. The game is a lot like <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-rust/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rust</a></em>, with regular server wipes to keep things interesting and help avoid any single group becoming overpowered or allowing players to collect and hoard everything on the map. </p>
 <h2 id="h-duckside-s-second-open-beta-brings-meaningful-changes-and-a-fun-new-hat" data-injectable="false"><em>Duckside</em>‘s second open beta brings meaningful changes and a fun new hat</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="DUCKSIDE Demo Trailer | Play Now | Rust-like survival with PVP and Base Building but you're a DUCK!" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VbaNL8rvkMw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="299" data-current-count="599" data-injectable="true">The second open beta for <em>Duckside</em> will be live from <strong>June 6, 2024, until around June 17, 2024</strong>, though it could go on for longer, depending on how many players try it out. TinyBuid has implemented a slew of new features to keep this beta interesting, even for those who played hours of the first one. </p>
 <p data-characters="241" data-current-count="241" data-injectable="false">For example, two new defensive structures have been added, both of which should be on every player’s radar for raiding. These are the ship port and the missile silo, both of which will require you to tackle a group of humans to enter. </p> <p data-characters="298" data-current-count="539" data-injectable="true">You can take advantage of new explosive ammo that will make short work of your enemies, build stronger bases with roof hatches for quick escapes, locate mysterious duck-shaped obelisks for in-game buffs, and try out the PvP or PvE-focused servers if you want worlds with or without fellow players. </p>
 <p data-characters="324" data-current-count="324" data-injectable="false">Note that you’ll need to build quickly if you want to see everything the game has to offer with regular server wipes every Mondy and Thursday. By using the command “/GetHatForBeta” in-game, you can get yourself a Rubber Ducky Hat free of charge every time you log in, so there’s no need to stash it. </p> <p data-characters="449" data-current-count="773" data-injectable="false">In <em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2682580/DUCKSIDE/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Duckside</a></em>, players must gather resources and build bases so they can eke out an existence in a world filled with other potentially hostile ducks. It’s up to you whether you band together with others to create a utopian society or become a warring group that destroys any signs of life. I love the communities that band together in <em>Rust</em> and can’t wait to see what sort of societies emerge after a few weeks in <em>Duckside</em>‘s servers. </p>

Here are the best teams for Clorinde focusing on two of her best reactions: <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/genshin-impact-dendro-reactions-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aggravate and Hyperbloom</a>.</p> <h2 id="h-teams-for-quicken-clorinde" data-injectable="false">Teams for Quicken Clorinde</h2> <p data-characters="418" data-current-count="418" data-injectable="true">Aggravate is the easiest reaction for Clorinde to trigger consistently. All you need is an off-field Dendro teammate to apply the occasional hit of Dendro. Clorinde’s best Dendro teammates are <strong>Nahida, Dendro Traveler, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-baizhu-builds-weapons-and-teams-in-genshin-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Baizhu</a>, </strong>and <strong><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-yaoyao-healer-builds-in-genshin-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yaoyao</a>.</strong> Kirara and Collei can also work, but they’re harder to recommend. Pick one or two of these Dendro teammates to trigger Quicken, which will enable Clorinde to trigger Aggravate.</p>
 <p data-characters="415" data-current-count="415" data-injectable="true">Once you have your Dendro teammate(s) picked out, you can fill in with some flex units of your choice. I recommend an Anemo unit like <strong>Sucrose </strong>or <strong><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-kazuha-builds-in-genshin-impact-updated-4-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kazuha</a></strong> to amplify Clorinde’s Electro damage. Alternatively, <strong><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-zhongli-builds-weapons-and-teams-in-genshin-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zhongli’s</a></strong> shield provides some defensive utility while making enemies weaker to all elements. You can also double up on Electro units with <strong><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-fischl-builds-weapons-and-teams-in-genshin-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fischl</a>, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-beidou-builds-weapons-and-teams-in-genshin-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Beidou</a>, Yae Miko, </strong>or <strong>Kujou Sara. </strong>Mix and match as you like!</p>
 <h3 id="h-example-teams-for-quicken-clorinde" data-injectable="false">Example teams for Quicken Clorinde</h3> <ul data-found-items="4" data-current-count="160" data-injectable="false"> <li>Clorinde – Nahida – Baizhu – Zhongli</li> <li>Clorinde – Dendro Traveler – Sucrose – Beidou</li> <li>Clorinde – Yaoyao – Sucrose – Fischl</li> <li>Clorinde – Yaoyao – Kazuha – Kujou Sara</li> </ul> <figure data-current-count="460" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via HoYoverse</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-teams-for-hyperbloom-clorinde" data-injectable="false">Teams for Hyperbloom Clorinde</h2> <p data-characters="251" data-current-count="251" data-injectable="false">Hyperbloom teams are similar to Quicken teams, but with added Hydro. When Hydro reacts with Dendro, it creates a Dendro Core on the ground. When Clorinde hits a Dendro Core with an attack, she will trigger Hyperbloom, dealing Dendro damage to enemies.</p> <p data-characters="387" data-current-count="638" data-injectable="true">Since Hydro can remove the Quicken status from enemies, having constant Dendro application becomes more important. This increases the value of <strong>Nahida</strong> and <strong>Dendro Traveler</strong>, since these characters are better at applying Dendro from off-field. As with Quicken teams, pick one or two Dendro teammates, making sure you have at least one who can provide consistent off-field Dendro application.</p>
 <p data-characters="282" data-current-count="282" data-injectable="false">Then, pick a Hydro teammate. My recommendations are <strong><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-furina-builds-weapons-teams-genshin-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Furina</a>, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-xingqiu-builds-weapons-and-teams-in-genshin-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xingqiu</a>, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-yelan-builds-weapons-and-teams-in-genshin-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yelan</a>, </strong>or<strong> <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-kokomi-builds-weapons-and-teams-in-genshin-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kokomi</a>.</strong> These characters are all capable of applying Hydro from off-field. Make sure you only have one Hydro unit, though, since too much Hydro can reduce Clorinde’s damage by interfering with Quicken.</p> <figure data-current-count="582" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="405" data-current-count="405" data-injectable="true">If you still have an open team slot, and you have your Dendro and Hydro needs covered, feel free to add a flex unit of your choice. <strong>Fischl</strong> is still good, since Oz won’t target Dendro Cores, letting Clorinde trigger most of the Hyperblooms. Anemo units like <strong>Sucrose</strong> or <strong>Kazuha</strong> are great too. <strong>Zhongli</strong> makes for a good shielder, since he will increase both Clorinde’s Electro damage and Hyperbloom damage.</p>
 <h3 id="h-example-teams-for-hyperbloom-clorinde" data-injectable="false">Example teams for Hyperbloom Clorinde</h3> <ul data-found-items="4" data-current-count="160" data-injectable="false"> <li>Clorinde – Nahida – Baizhu – Furina</li> <li>Clorinde – Dendro Traveler – Xingqiu – Zhongli</li> <li>Clorinde – Nahida – Kokomi – Fischl</li> <li>Clorinde – Dendro Traveler – Yelan – Sucrose</li> </ul>

<p data-characters="281" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The Tesla Tower is one of the many stationary turret Stratagems in <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/tag/helldivers-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Helldivers 2</a></em> that you can unlock after some time. It looks pretty good from the demo video and has pretty good stats, so if you want to know more before taking it on a mission, here’s everything you need to know.</p> <h2 id="h-how-to-get-the-tesla-tower-in-helldivers-2" data-injectable="false">How to get the Tesla Tower in <em>Helldivers 2</em></h2> <p data-characters="163" data-current-count="163" data-injectable="false">To get the Tesla Tower in <em>Helldivers 2</em>, you will need to be <strong>level 15 and spend 8,000 Req Slips</strong>. It’s part of the Bridge section in the Stratagem Management menu.</p> <p data-characters="74" data-current-count="237" data-injectable="false">Once purchased, you can then equip it before shipping out on your mission.</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">How to use the Tesla Tower in <em>Helldivers 2</em></h2> <p data-characters="110" data-current-count="347" data-injectable="false">To use the Tesla Tower, you will call it down like any other turret. Once it lands, you can’t move it.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="341" data-current-count="688" data-injectable="true">Unlike other turrets where you can see where it’ll attack next, the Tesla Tower attacks enemies within its shock radius. You can see roughly how far it’ll attack, so you ideally want to stay away before you end up dead. You can go prone to avoid getting hurt or killed, but it’s best to just be away from the Tower’s radius entirely.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false">Is the Tesla Tower worth using?</h2> <p data-characters="269" data-current-count="569" data-injectable="true">The Tesla Tower is only worth using at lower difficulties fighting Terminids in <em>Helldivers 2</em>. It’s amazing when it can take down small and medium enemies, but once you start facing heavier targets like Bile Spewers, Chargers, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-how-to-kill-a-bile-titan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and Bile Titans,</a> it’s nearly worthless.</p>
 <p data-characters="110" data-current-count="110" data-injectable="false"><strong>Most heavier enemies can walk through the Tower’s radius and crush it before it can deal significant damage.</strong></p> <p data-characters="175" data-current-count="285" data-injectable="false">Also, the Tesla Tower is nearly useless when fighting Automatons. A majority of the attacks this faction has are all ranged, so they can easily take this down from afar.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="212" data-current-count="497" data-injectable="false">So, if you want to farm low-level defense missions for quick Medals and Req slips, the Tesla Tower will be good there. Otherwise, at higher levels, like 5-Hard and higher, it’s going to be destroyed in seconds.</p>

<p data-characters="203" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>EA Sports FC 24</em> is set to introduce the UEFA Euro 2024 update today, June 6, 2024. The free update will be themed around the international tournament, featuring the top footballing nations across Europe.</p> <p data-characters="423" data-current-count="423" data-injectable="true">As part of this free update, Ultimate Team mode players are set to receive a free player pick. The options include Netherlands’ Virgil van Dijk, Italy’s Federico Chiesa, Germany’s Florian Wirtz, France’s Ousmane Dembele, England’s Jack Grealish, and Spain’s Alvaro Morata. The player pick will only be available for Ultimate Team players who have played the mode between December 18, 2023, and January 16, 2024.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="255" data-current-count="555" data-injectable="true">Details on what the update offers have now been revealed and a Euro 2024 tournament has been added, and here is <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-play-euro-2024-in-ea-fc-24-all-game-modes-explained/">how to play Euro 2024 in <em>FC 24</em></a>. The free update arrives ahead of the official Euro 2024 tournament in Germany which commences on June 14, 2024.</p>
 <p data-characters="358" data-current-count="358" data-injectable="false">The official announcement post features a picture of the same players available as a free item, donning the kits of their respective international teams. This at least confirms these kits will be available across the Euro 2024 update for players, and more kits from the participating nations at the tournament in Germany are expected to be available as well.</p> <p data-characters="397" data-current-count="755" data-injectable="false">EA’s <em>FIFA 23 </em>title featured a World Cup 2022 update which brought content for Ultimate Team as well as offline game modes, and a World Cup tournament mode was introduced. The update did arrive with a fresh set of animations before kick-off, showing off fans entering the stadium to cheer for their nation, but the overall update did not receive a favourable response from the game’s community.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/warframe-rakta-dark-dagger-how-to-get-build-and-is-it-worth-getting/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=warframe-rakta-dark-dagger-how-to-get-build-and-is-it-worth-getting<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="287" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The Rakta Dark Dagger is an interesting weapon in <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/tag/warframe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warframe</a> </em>because it’s one of the game’s weaker weapon types, yet provides many favorable qualities. It also is kind of hard to get if you’re a newer player, so in any case, here’s everything you need to know about the weapon.</p> <h2 id="h-how-to-get-the-rakta-dark-dagger" data-injectable="false">How to get the Rakta Dark Dagger</h2> <p data-characters="193" data-current-count="193" data-injectable="false">To get the Rakta Dark Dagger, you have to <strong>purchase it from the Red Veil Syndicate for 125,000 standing</strong>. To even get that much to hold at once, you also need to be max rank with them or Exalted.</p> <p data-characters="226" data-current-count="419" data-injectable="true">If you aren’t allied with them when you chose your Syndicate, you have to resort to trading with another player who is. In that case, you will more than likely have to pay another player who is in the Red Veil with Platinum.</p>
 <p data-characters="122" data-current-count="122" data-injectable="false">The Rakta Dark Dagger will usually cost between <strong>25 to 40 Platinum</strong> when you are looking to trade with others in-game.&nbsp;</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">Rakta Dark Dagger build</h2> <p data-characters="158" data-current-count="280" data-injectable="false">Here is a decent build with which to use the Rakta Dark Dagger. This will be using a standard melee build, so it won’t revolve around stealth and finishers.</p> <p data-characters="20" data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><strong>Stance: </strong>Pointed Wind</p> <ul data-found-items="8" data-current-count="620" data-injectable="true"> <li>Condition Overload</li> <li>Drifting Contact</li> <li>Virulent Scourge</li> <li>Vicious Frost</li> <li>Blood Rush</li> <li>Organ Shatter</li> <li>Weeping Wounds</li> <li>Voltaic Strike</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="23" data-current-count="23" data-injectable="false"><strong>Arcane:</strong> Melee Influence</p> <figure data-current-count="323" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="240" data-current-count="563" data-injectable="true">This setup turns your weapon into a powerhouse of an AoE weapon. As you accumulate your combo counter, you’re going to be spreading Viral, Radiation, and Shock statuses to nearby enemies, making them all prone to Condition Overload.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="172" data-current-count="172" data-injectable="false">Pair that with the weapon’s passive ability. Now you’re generating shields constantly from the Radiation procs. That will help you survive a lot longer in later levels.</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">Is the Rakta Dark Dagger worth using and getting in <em>Warframe</em>?</h2> <p data-characters="171" data-current-count="343" data-injectable="false">The Rakta Dark Dagger is very much worth using. It may be a single dagger weapon, but with the right build, it’s one of the stronger “stat sticks” in the game.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="274" data-current-count="617" data-injectable="false">The weapon can also make builds that <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-use-shield-gating-in-warframe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">utilize shield gating a lot more viable</a>. Having yet another damage source generating shields will ensure that you won’t die as fast. 5% shield leech isn’t a lot, but when you’re constantly hitting Radiation procs, it’s a godsend.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bungie-awards-destiny-2-players-painfully-slow-clap-emote-due-to-an-undefined-issue.891765/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/bungie-awards-destiny-2-players-painfully-slow-clap-emote-due-to-an-undefined-issue/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=bungie-awards-destiny-2-players-painfully-slow-clap-emote-due-to-an-undefined-issue<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="325" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The launch of <em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em> has been packed with <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-fix-destiny-2-error-code-weasel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">error codes</a> and server queues, though some of us are able to get in and play the campaign. Outside of the new playable content, Bungie also seems to have created an issue with the Painfully Slow Clap emote, but it won’t explain exactly what the problem is. </p> <p data-characters="424" data-current-count="424" data-injectable="true">The same week that <em>The Final Shape</em> was released, Bungie added the Painfully Slow Clap emote to the Eververse Store for 200 Silver. This is about $2/£2, but the problem is, the emote is exactly the same as another emote that was in the original <em>Destiny</em>. While Bungie is usually very specific about the issues impacting <em>Destiny 2</em>, it’s been strangely vague on this one, leading some fans to believe a mistake was made. </p>
 <h2 id="h-bungie-is-giving-the-painfully-slow-clap-emote-away-for-free-and-refunding-anyone-who-purchased-it" data-injectable="false">Bungie is giving the Painfully Slow Clap emote away for free and refunding anyone who purchased it</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="355" data-current-count="655" data-injectable="true">The official Bungie Help account on Twitter, where we’ve all been watching for server maintenance notifications around <em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em>‘s launch <a href="https://x.com/BungieHelp/status/1798430155381367175" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that every player would be getting the Painfully Slow Clap emote due to an issue. You’ll be contacted regarding a refund if you purchased it while it was charging players. </p>
 <p data-characters="114" data-current-count="114" data-injectable="false">The fact that the issue hasn’t been disclosed made this post stand out to me and many other <em>Destiny 2</em> fans. </p> <figure data-current-count="414" data-injectable="true"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Due to an issue, we have made the Painfully Slow Clap emote available to all players. Players who purchased the emote prior to this change will be contacted at a later date for next steps.</p>— Bungie Help (@BungieHelp) <a href="https://twitter.com/BungieHelp/status/1798430155381367175?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 5, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure>
 <p data-characters="287" data-current-count="287" data-injectable="false">The replies to the post are brilliant, with some players saying what we’re all thinking, “Painful clap for the painful launch.” Others, though, want to know exactly what went wrong. “Please elaborate on said issue, I’d like for this to happen more often.”</p> <p data-characters="442" data-current-count="729" data-injectable="true">After I did some digging around, it appears that Bungie is giving this emote out to every player because it was already released in the first game. A post on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1d897cg/the_painfully_slow_clap_emote_in_eververse_is/#:~:text=MagnaVis-,The%20%22Painfully%20Slow%20Clap%22%20emote%20in%20Eververse%20is%20exactly%20the,emote%20you%20have%20for%20free.&amp;text=Is%20this%20bugged%2C%20or%20are,can%20ignore%20this%20post%20now." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Destiny 2</em> subreddit</a> brought this fact to light, and Bungie developers were quick to respond, explaining in response to the post asking if the game was meant to charge for the emote that, “Thanks for the report, this is not intended and we are currently investigating.”</p>
 <p data-characters="325" data-current-count="325" data-injectable="false">I think user Mak on Twitter puts everyone’s thoughts on this matter into context best. “The issue was that it was identical to a free green emote everyone already has. Unclear if the emote in the shop was supposed to be something different or a simple oversight by not realizing we already have the emote.” </p> <p data-characters="578" data-current-count="903" data-injectable="true">As I mentioned above, Bungie is usually pretty specific about issues impacting <em>Destiny 2</em>. The vagueness on this particular subject, without even referencing the fact that it was being discussed on the game’s subreddit, suggests that there may have been an oversight when adding it to the game. Given the sheer amount of content that’s been added to <em>Destiny 2</em> over the years, let alone everything that players brought over from the first game at launch, it’s surprising that this is the first time players have been accidentally charged for an identical emote. </p>
 <p data-characters="242" data-current-count="242" data-injectable="false">Don’t worry about picking the Painfully Slow Clap emote up from the Eververse Store because it should already be in your inventory. When I checked, the fee had been waived and I was informed the item was already redeemed on my account. </p>

		<p>Bioware have announced a full reveal of the next Dragon Age game on Tuesday June 11th 2024 but ahead of that they have revealed the title, Dragon Age The Veilguard. Well, that’s what the image shows, Bioware write it with a colon, Dragon Age: The Veilguard, so who knows which is correct.</p>



<p>“After Dragon Age: Inquisition launched, the studio was given an incredible opportunity to explore, test, and validate a variety of gameplay concepts as we worked to determine what the next Dragon Age could look like,” explains Gary McKay,&nbsp; Executive Producer, for Dragon Age, and General Manager at BioWare.</p>
<p>“We brought everything to the table which, yes, even included a multiplayer concept. The time we spent experimenting and iterating gradually taught us a lot. This work, and the amazing support from EA, helped us re-focus on creating an incredible single player game, with all the choices, characters and world building you’d expect from us.”</p>

<p>He confirms that you play as a brand new character and will be supported by “seven unique” companions. “You’ll unite this team of unforgettable heroes as you take on a terrifying new threat unleashed on the world. Naturally, the Dread Wolf still has an important part in this tale, but you and your companions – not your enemies – are the heart of this new experience,” adds Gary.</p>
<p>The full reveal on Tuesday June 11th at 8:00am PT (a very pleasant 16:00 BST for us here in the UK) will include over 15 minutes of gameplay&nbsp; from the start of the game, You will be able to watch via the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@dragonage"><strong>Dragon Age YouTube channel.</strong></a></p>
<p>Bioware had previously revealed that Dragon Age Dreadwolf, the old title for the game, takes place in a world where the legend of Solas has grown, with different people having different opinions of him. To some he is an elven god while to others an individual that betrayed people who trusted him. Some see him as someone who is there to save others, but at a great cost. How much that of still relevant remains to be seen, it seems like the game has been reworked in the past year.</p>

            <p>
Microsoft is reportedly working on a remaster of Bungie's classic first-person shooter Halo: Combat Evolved and is eyeing up a PlayStation release - alongside multi-console releases for the likes of Hellbalde 2 and the next Doom - potentially marking a landmark moment for one of Xbox's most recognisable exclusives.
</p>
<p>
That's according to The Verge's Tom Warren, who (in the site's <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/6/24172684/microsoft-xbox-showcase-2024">paywalled Notepad newsletter</a>) says a new Halo: Combat Evolved remaster is currently in the early stages of development. It's one of several new games reportedly being considered for Project Latitude - Microsoft's internal name for its new multi-console release strategy - following multi-console launches for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-did-we-think-of-microsofts-multiplatform-xbox-soft-launch">Sea of Thieves, Grounded, Pentiment, and Hi-Fi Rush</a> earlier this year.
</p>
<p>
Other Xbox games currently being considered for a multi-console release are said to include Doom: The Dark Ages (seemingly <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesda-trademark-offers-doom-hint-as-suggestion-of-an-imminent-reveal-swirls">set for a reveal</a> during this weekend's Xbox Games Showcase), Hellblade 2, Starfield, Age of Empires 2: Definitive Edition, and Age of Mythology.

<p>
Warren notes this doesn't mark a full multi-console strategy shift for Microsoft, with the company still retaining some titles as Xbox exclusives. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gears-6-will-be-announced-in-june-leak-suggests">Gears 6</a>, Playground Games' Fable reboot, and We Happy Few developer Compulsion's South of Midnight - all set to feature in this weekend's showcase according to Warren, with the latter two likely getting 2025 release dates - are reportedly <em>not</em> currently being considered for a multi-console release.
</p>
<p>
This isn't the first time we've heard Microsoft is considering bringing more Xbox titles to other consoles, of course. Reports <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-mulls-major-xbox-exclusives-starfield-indiana-jones-for-playstation-5-reports">surfaced in February</a> claiming Starfield had been earmarked for a potential PlayStation release, alongside MachineGames' upcoming Indiana Jones and the Great Circle.
</p>
<p>
In May, it was reported Microsoft executives have been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-bosses-reportedly-pushing-for-no-red-line-around-which-xbox-games-launch-on-playstation">pushing for a no "red line" approach</a> to bringing Xbox titles to PlayStation and Nintendo platforms, in a bid to increase margins. That claim came in the wake of last year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-buying-zenimax-parent-company-of-bethesda-id-software-and-more-report">$69bn acquisition of Activision Blizzard</a>, and Microsoft's decision to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-shuts-slew-of-bethesda-studios-including-redfall-hi-fi-rush-developers">close a number of Bethesda studios</a> - including Hi-Fi Rush developer Tango Gameworks and Redfall studio Arkane Austin - as it refocuses on what it called "priority games".
</p>
<p>
There's no word on when Microsoft might announce a fresh batch of multi-console releases for its Xbox titles, but Warren says he's not expecting any Project Latitude news during <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-showcase-2024-time-date-where-to-watch">Sunday's Xbox Games Showcase</a>. That's being livestreamed at 6pm UK time (10am PT, 1pm ET) on 9th June, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-alert-confirms-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-day-one-xbox-game-pass-launch">an hour-long Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 presentation</a> will air immediately after.

<p id="s340IZ"><strong>Director:</strong> Philip Kaufman <br><strong>Cast:</strong> Donald Sutherland, Brooke Adams, Leonard Nimoy<br><strong>Where to watch: </strong>Prime Video </p>
<p id="n35rFj"><em>Invasion of the Body Snatchers</em> has a timeless, perfect premise: What if the people you know weren’t themselves anymore? What if they had been replaced by something that looked like them, talked like them, and remembered like them, but didn’t feel the same? It’s viscerally upsetting, even as an idea, which is probably why this story has been remade nearly a dozen times since the original was released in 1956.</p>
<p id="h0T8kG">But for all the remakes, the 1978 version of the movie stands out as a particular highlight. Starring Donald Sutherland and Leonard Nimoy, Philip Kaufman’s version of the story imagines a San Francisco slowly overrun by aliens who steal the faces of humans. The lurking paranoia of the original movie is similarly on display in this one, but its real step up is in the effects department. </p>
<p id="pe9G47">Where the original movie left the body snatching mostly to the audience’s imagination, this version shows the process in all its gross, gooey, alien detail. Fresh, formless bodies slide out of pods while sentient threads of plant fur creep across victims, giving details and features to the newly printed doubles, all before the person’s old body disintegrates. It’s a wildly effective, extremely off-putting effect that the movie makes tremendous use of to both heighten its paranoid atmosphere and justify it. All that, and the movie has one of the greatest endings in horror movie history. —<em>Austen Goslin</em></p>

<p id="mRWneQ"><em>Annihilation </em>might be the creepiest movie about plants ever made (with all due respect to <em>The Ruins</em>.)</p>
<p id="BbGnjc"><em>Annihilation </em>follows a group of scientists (played by a phenomenal group of actors) investigating an area struck by a meteor. The area that was hit has slowly spread and grown into what’s now known as The Shimmer, an area where nature seems to be taking over everything around it, but it’s a different kind of nature; strange, unnaturally green plants grow over everything, and creatures (animals and humans) slowly merge with the vegetation around them. At the center of all of this is a lighthouse the group must reach. <em>Annihilation</em> helps realize this strange Earth-but-not incredibly well, with beautiful and haunting production design and a finale as memorable as any horror movie on this list. — <em>AG</em></p>

<p id="8Rp2pG">Sequels to <em>The Blair Witch Project</em> are very dicey propositions. After <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23933306/blair-witch-2-book-shadows-what-the-heck-happened"><em>Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2</em></a> was greeted as a disaster immediately after release, the franchise stalled out and the idea of returning to the black forest faded from the minds of aspiring horror filmmakers. But in 2016, writer Simon Barrett and director Adam Wingard, the duo behind the excellent <em>You’re Next</em>, went back into the woods for a new <em>Blair Witch</em> sequel. And it’s actually pretty great.</p>
<p id="YcwX2r">The movie follows James Donahue, the brother of Heather from the first movie, as he sets out to investigate what happened to his sister. James and some friends, including film student Lisa, set out on an adventure through the Maryland woods and, of course, run into some very creepy activity when they get there.</p>
<p id="p8vRw3"><em>Blair Witch</em> isn’t interested in trying to recapture the formal magic of the first movie, exactly. There’s no mistaking this one for a documentary, and there’s clearly a lot more going on production-wise than a few kids in the woods with a video camera. It’s decidedly a studio version of found footage, but that isn’t a bad thing; it means the movie is full of delicately framed shots that really capture and amplify the terror of this new group of kids stuck in the woods. And when things really start to pop off in the second half, it means that we get careful, tantalizing, terrifying glimpses of whatever lurks in the darkness, but never too much to ruin the scare. <em>—AG</em></p>

<p id="9y5m2v"><em>Climax </em>isn’t for the faint-of-heart — and we’re saying that in the context of a horror movies list. The movie is set at an all-night dance party inside a gymnasium, which turns sour after someone spikes the sangria with a little too much LSD. <em>Climax </em>is told in beautifully disorienting long takes that go from dozens of minutes of uninterrupted and propulsive dance sequences to hazy walks through hallways as the camera mimics the dizzy stumbling of the movie’s characters. As the psychedelics kick in, so too do some of the attendees’ long-held feuds, leading to disastrous and horrifying consequences. It’s rare that a movie truly defies description, but if you’ve got a strong stomach and a will to see something you haven’t before, <em>Climax </em>is the perfect movie for you. —<em>AG</em></p>

What the fuck is it doing to our bodies? We don’t really know, but David Cronenberg’s 2022 body horror drama sure has an idea of what it might mean for our children. <em>Crimes of the Future</em> imagines a world where humans have lost the ability to feel pain. In addition to that, several people have developed a disturbing disorder which causes their bodies to spontaneously spawn new organs. </p>
<p id="S7SFTU">This new reality has spawned a trend: Live surgery, wherein performance artists plagued with this condition tear into their own bodies in an effort to shape meaning out of this strange new biological fact. Viggo Mortensen stars as Saul Tenser, a world-renowned performance artist who, alongside his partner Caprice (Léa Seydoux), stands on the cutting edge — both literally and figuratively — of this cultural phenomenon. When Saul’s activities catch the attention of a mysterious group of evolutionary activists, as well as the lascivious eye of a government employee named Timlin (Kristen Stewart), he’s forced to confront what he — and everyone else around him — is changing into, and whether what that is can even be considered “human” anymore.</p>
<p id="17fGm2">As macabre as it is moving, grotesque as it is sensuous; <em>Crimes of the Future</em> is an exquisite work of science fiction horror where surgery is the new sex and our very bodies have rebelled against us for the incalculable destruction we have inflicted on the planet. It’s a film that exists in intimate conversation with the anxieties of our present, as well as one that represents a stunning return to form for one of cinema’s most forward-thinking directors. Howard Shore’s growling, guttural score is engrossing, while the leading trio of performances by Mortensen, Seydoux, and Stewart are a virtual match made in heaven in bringing to life this speculative slice of post-human hell on Earth. In short: It’s a great film and highly recommended, but whatever you do, don’t see it on a full stomach. Trust me. <em>—Toussaint Egan</em></p>

<p id="qGpR9z">Kiyoshi Kurosawa’s 1997 horror masterpiece <em>Cure</em> follows Kenichi Takabe (Kōji Yakusho), a Japanese detective frustrated by an inexplicable rash of seemingly unconnected murders that nevertheless all appear to be connected, despite none of the perpetrators having known each other or having any recollection as to what possessed them to do it. When Takabe’s investigation leads him to a suspect, a student of psychology and mesmerism known as Mamiya (Masato Hagiwara), he finds himself plunged into a conspiracy that threatens to engulf anyone who gets too close.</p>
<p id="EXTxxj">In <em>Cure</em>, violence is less an act of premeditation or passion as it is a virus, coursing its way through the bloodstream of society, corrupting innocent bystanders not unlike aberrant cancer cells attacking from within without ever understanding why they did so in the first place. How do you confront a horror like that, much less stop it? The answer is as simple as it is terrifying: You can’t. <em>—TE</em></p>

<p id="5wByHh"><strong>Director: </strong>Sammo Hung<br><strong>Cast: </strong>Sammo Hung, Chung Fat, Dick Wei<br><strong>Where to watch: </strong>Criterion Channel</p>
<p id="lyXKZ6">This <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-watch/23893288/best-halloween-horror-movies-tv-watch-stream">Halloween</a>, I had one goal: Finally watch Sammo Hung’s jiangshi (<a href="https://www.polygon.com/23938529/hong-kong-horror-jiangshi-movies-china-mr-vampire">Chinese hopping vampire</a>) martial arts comedy <em>Encounters of the Spooky Kind. </em>It was finally added to streaming via the Criterion Channel earlier this fall after years of being unavailable digitally. And reader, my priorities were correct, because this movie is an absolute blast.</p>
<p id="yPMhXm">Best known for his collaborations with childhood friends Jackie Chan and Yuen Biao, Sammo’s excellence as a director, choreographer, and performer are on full display in what is frequently a one-man show.</p>
<p id="oJ9Td0">Sammo directed the movie, co-wrote it, choreographed the action, and stars as Bold Cheung, a pedicab driver and skilled martial artist who’s also kind of a dolt. He is dared to spend the night in a haunted house with a hopping vampire — a dare he accepts, because he is “Bold” Cheung, after all. What follows is a Looney Tunes-style slapstick action horror movie with legitimate scares (the vampire makeup is terrific: gray with a gross texture, like a wet papier-mâché mask), dazzling rhythmic martial arts choreography, and perfectly placed dashes of comedy (there’s even an extended<em> Duck Soup</em> homage).</p>
<p id="SLcAXo">Sammo is truly one of the greatest directors to ever do it, but he doesn’t get the proper credit globally because of the genres (and nation) he’s primarily worked in. The jaw-dropping choreography and onslaught of funny bits are outstanding, but it’s his skill with the camera that has always separated Sammo from his counterparts. </p>
<p id="cdul4X">Bringing it back to his old friend Yuen Biao for a second — Biao co-stars as the silent vampire, and does a terrific job selling the undead creature’s fight sequences with stiff limbs and startling hops. This movie is colorful, funny, scary, tense, and an incredibly fun time. If you like the Evil Dead movies, this is one you must check out; Sam Raimi basically directly ripped one of <em>Spooky Kind</em>’s fight sequences for <em>Evil Dead II</em>. —<em>Pete Volk</em></p>

<p id="BmPDBm"><strong>Director: </strong>Georges Franju<br><strong>Cast: </strong>Pierre Brasseur, Édith Scob, Alida Valli<br><strong>Where to watch: </strong>Max, Criterion Channel</p>
<p id="9GgpBw">Georges Franju’s influential 1960 film is a master class in supernatural fantasy horror. An unsettling tale about a plastic surgeon (played by Pierre Brasseur) who kidnaps young women and performs surgery on them to try and find a face replacement for his daughter (Édith Scob), <em>Eyes Without a Face </em>is equal parts haunting and beautiful. Scob’s iconic face mask in the movie was later referenced in her role in the also-excellent <em>Holy Motors</em> many decades later. —<em>PV</em></p>

<p id="0ohmYp"><strong>Director:</strong> Clive Barker<br><strong>Cast: </strong>Andrew Robinson, Clare Higgins, Ashley Laurence<br><strong>Where to watch: </strong>Prime Video, AMC+, Tubi, Pluto, Hoopla</p>
<p id="havgCr">Clive Barker’s 1987 directorial debut adapts his 1986 novella <em>The Hellbound Heart</em> to tell the story of Larry (Andrew Robinson) and Julia Cotton (Clare Higgins). The Cottons are a married couple who move into the home of Larry’s recently deceased brother, Frank (Sean Chapman), with whom Julia had a previous affair. After inadvertently being resurrected by a drop of blood spilled by Larry on the floor of the house’s attic, Frank seduces Julia into luring new men to the house so that he can drain their life force and fully regain his mortal form. Surrounding this core narrative is the the story of the Lament Configuration, a puzzle box Frank acquired before his untimely death. When solved, it conjures hellish beings known as Cenobites to the mortal plane of existence, which indulge in hellish exercises of sadomasochistic mutilation. Easily the best and most enduring of the Hellraiser movie series, Barker’s 1987 original is a must-watch for horror fans. <em>—TE</em></p>

<p id="p0O1hk"><em>Hereditary </em>is a victim of its own success. The poster child for the misguided term “elevated horror,” and the subject of more than a few memes (particularly around telephone poles), the thing that often gets lost about <em>Hereditary </em>is that it’s actually really fucking good. And it’s damn scary too.</p>
<p id="hrhmX5">The movie follows Annie Graham, a difficult mother of two, who just lost her mom. During the funeral service, Annie notices quite a few people are here to mourn the mother she thought had no friends. She eventually learns this group of old people all belonged to the same bizarre semi-cult her mother did. And that’s where the witchy stuff starts.</p>
<p id="PCQN3C">From there everything descends into a complicated mishmash of tightly coiled family drama, supernatural plotting, and years-old resentments, and it’s absolutely excellent. Who’s to say which is scarier in this movie, the verbal immolation or the literal one?</p>
<p id="g8wWbk">Even if you’ve seen it already, you probably owe this movie a rewatch. You definitely remember that it’s good, but you probably don’t remember just how great it really is. <em>Hereditary </em>is elegantly creepy, right up until the point that it becomes terrifying. You can’t really ask any more from a horror movie than that. —<em>AG</em></p>

Everything starts off well enough, but before long the kids are being attacked by demonic gates, getting eaten by pianos, or opening portals to hell — all with visually an inventive silliness few movies have ever matched. <em>House </em>isn’t all that scary, but it is weird in all the best ways, and nothing else looks or feels like it. — <em>AG</em></p>

<p id="kyYjV6"><strong>Director</strong>: John Carpenter<br><strong>Cast</strong>: Sam Neill, Julie Carmen, Jurgen Prochnow<br><strong>Where to watch: </strong>Digital rental/purchase on Amazon, Apple TV, YouTube</p>
<p id="Ti4pO1">Among the wildest movies John Carpenter has ever made (and that’s saying something), <em>In the Mouth of Madness</em> follows insurance investigator John Trent (Sam Neill), who is hired to find a missing fame horror novelist. Things become increasingly unhinged as the plots of the author’s books and the various monsters seem to invade the real world. Neill, a staple of this list, is absolutely fantastic responding to the horrors of hell, slowly becoming exactly as off-kilter as they are. By the time the movie makes it to the third act, the door to hell is halfway open and Trent is ready to dive headfirst into the void, which is honestly how every movie’s third act should go.</p>
<p id="U3T7ul">This is also the third in Carpenter’s apocalypse trilogy, which also includes two other stone-cold classics, <em>The Thing</em> and <em>Prince of Darkness</em>. They aren’t on this list, but you should watch them anyway. — <em>AG</em></p>

<p id="oj9rcm"><strong>Director:</strong> Tomas Alfredson<br><strong>Cast: </strong>Kåre Hedebrant, Lina Leandersson, Per Ragnar<br><strong>Where to watch: </strong>Hoopla, Kanopy, Plex</p>
<p id="fvqNIS">A 12-year-old Swedish boy finds a friend in a vampire who looks roughly his age, but is actually an old vampire permanently trapped in the body of a young child. The film is kaleidoscopic, each viewing revealing something different than the last. The first time I saw the film, I was a pessimistic college student, and I read the central relationship as a warning about the parasitic nature of love. After college, the children’s bond reminded me of the impermanence of youth, and why growing up is a mixed blessing. This past year, I was far more focused on the girl’s relationship with her caretaker, an older man who sacrifices everything for her existence.</p>
<p id="Ys5Hv7">The film was adapted from John Ajvide Lindqvist’s 2004 novel of the same name, which inspired not just this Swedish film, but a 2010 American adaptation, a comic-book prequel, and two stage plays. The latter has its own legacy — it was adapted by the magnificent National Theater of Scotland, and it eventually had a run at St. Ann’s Warehouse in 2015. Few books inspire so much additional great art. So I suppose I’m recommending the book just as much as the film. —<em>Chris Plante</em></p>

<p id="P04uFA"><strong>Director: </strong>James Wan<br><strong>Cast: </strong>Annabelle Wallis, Maddie Hasson, George Young<br><strong>Where to watch: </strong>Max, Tubi</p>
<p id="FO98NP">There was just no way to see it coming. After the Conjuring and Insidious franchises, plus blockbuster turns with <em>Furious 7</em> and <em>Aquaman</em>, James Wan could have cashed in chips to make another moody franchise-starter to stretch his jump-scare muscles. Instead, he made <em>Malignant</em>, a high-emotion <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22732575/giallo-movies-explained">giallo</a> stuffed into dingy <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22674065/horror-movies-like-malignant">’90s direct-to-video pastiche</a> like some kind of horror-movie turducken. Wan pulls back the layers in an almost tedious fashion: The pregnant Madison (Annabelle Wallis) is first the victim of domestic abuse, then she encounters another killer, and <em>then</em> she starts dealing with psychotic episodes tied to her childhood imaginary friend Gabriel, and <em>theeeeen</em> it’s revealed… Well, please go behold it.</p>
<p id="m53ap6">Strung together with a melodramatic cover of The Pixies’ “Where Is My Mind,” reveling in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22738928/horror-movie-tropes-explained">horror tropes</a> to the point of parody, the final twists of <em>Malignant</em> are some of the most gratifying lunacy of the year, and the acrobatic actor Marina Mazepa brings it all home in a display of gruesome ballet. I won’t explain anything more out of fear of spoilers — just get on the <em>Malignant</em> train. Wan put his dream (nightmare?) on screen for us all to enjoy. —<em>Matt Patches</em></p>

<p id="5UE6L7"><strong>Director:</strong> Frank Darabont<br><strong>Cast:</strong> Thomas Jane, Marcia Gay Harden, Laurie Holden<br><strong>Where to watch: </strong>Freevee</p>
<p id="IldJcB">Any fan of Stephen King worth their salt knows that the so-called king of horror has a lot of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-watch/23056636/stephen-king-movies-best-adaptations-list">movie adaptations of his work</a>. Few films have managed to eclipse, let alone successfully adapt, King’s capacity for horror storytelling, with the exception of (a) Stanley Kubrick’s <em>The Shining</em> and (b) Frank Darabont’s <em>The Mist</em>. </p>
<p id="EJF0Po">Darabont’s third adaptation of a Stephen King story, the film stars Thomas Jane (<em>The Expanse</em>) as a Hollywood poster artist living in Maine who, along with his wife and son and the rest of his neighbors, takes shelter in a supermarket in the wake of a mysterious storm that covers the town in a deadly mist. </p>
<p id="a3l6mR">Supernatural, otherworldly horrors abound throughout <em>The Mist</em>, but the greatest horror of all is — you guessed it — humanity itself, as seen in the way the townspeople succumb to the temptation to scapegoat those among themselves under the influence of a local religious fanatic. The ending is a gut-punch and sincerely one of the most chilling in any mainstream horror film of its time. If you’ve managed to go unspoiled until now, I won’t ruin the surprise, but needless to say, it’s worth it. <em>—TE</em></p>

<p id="Ak1W0b"><strong>Director: </strong>George A. Romero<br><strong>Cast: </strong>Duane Jones, Judith O’Dea, Marilyn Eastman<br><strong>Where to watch: </strong>Max, Peacock, Criterion Channel, Shudder, Kanopy, Tubi, Pluto TV</p>
<p id="1ERqKP">The movie that launched the modern zombie film in the United States, George A. Romero’s debut feature was written, directed, photographed, and edited by the nascent zombie film master on a shoestring budget, which only adds to the eerie atmosphere and grounded terror. In this film, a group of survivors hide out in an abandoned house in western Pennsylvania at the start of a zombie apocalypse. Led by the level-headed Ben (Duane Jones), the group not only has to deal with the conflict of zombies trying to break in, but internal conflicts stemming from disagreements on how to handle their precarious predicament.</p>
<p id="gt20gB"><em>Night of the Living Dead</em> is the first example of Romero’s typical blend of jaw-dropping (and stomach-churning) practical effects and astute social commentary. Fun fact: This movie came out a month before the MPAA film rating system, which meant a heaping amount of controversy when children were able to see the quite graphic movie in theaters. And another fun fact: <em>Night of the Living Dead </em>was never copyrighted and is in the public domain because of an error by the original theatrical distributor. —<em>PV</em></p>

<p id="vhKBrt"><strong>Director:</strong> Andrzej Żuławski<br><strong>Cast: </strong>Isabelle Adjani, Sam Neill, Heinz Bennent<br><strong>Where to watch: </strong>Shudder</p>
<p id="H96nfR">Outside of the most ardent of cinephile circles, Andrzej Żuławski isn’t a name that inspires enthusiastic recognition in the United States. Known for his transgressive brand of arthouse cinema, Żuławski’s career was stymied by Communist authorities in his homeland of Poland, with many of his early films being either heavily censored, banned, or, in one instance, nearly destroyed upon release. It also doesn’t help that the few films of his that have been released in the States have since gone out of print — though that <a href="https://www.blu-ray.com/news/?id=31906&amp;fbclid=IwAR3Uu6ISTexJGT1lEJZcZa5tpanf7zrGLKrGP9XZVNlvLeaJVHS9HpHT7ko">appears to be changing soon</a>.</p>
<p id="tBREhE">If you do know Żuławski’s name, it’s likely for his 1981 psychological horror film <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22740902/possession-review-horror-movie-doppelgangers"><em>Possession</em></a>, a film whose cult status among horror connoisseurs has only been amplified in the decades since its release by its difficulty to obtain on physical media or to view online. Fortunately for everyone, that’s no longer the case.</p>
<p id="qnqfjB">Set in Cold War-era West Berlin, Żuławski’s film stars <em>Jurassic Park</em>’s Sam Neill as Mark, a Russian spy who returns home to find that his wife, Anna (Isabelle Adjani), has left him and wants a divorce. When Anna refuses to divulge why, only saying that she has not left him for  someone else, Mark grows suspicious and has her tailed. What he eventually discovers is a horrifying secret beyond his comprehension, one which awakens a long-dormant wellspring of anxiety, resentment, and despair between the two that threatens to tear apart not only their small family, but their very sanity as well. </p>
<p id="5I02nx">Inspired by Żuławski’s own tumultuous divorce in 1976 and his subsequent struggles with suicidal ideation, <em>Possession</em> blurs the line between the autobiographical and the phantasmagorical, with hysterical performances by Neill and Adjani that vacillate between disturbing, comical, and disquietingly sympathetic. An inspiration for everything from Ari Aster’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiDPsWE4FJ8"><em>Midsommar</em></a> to the 2016 music video for Massive Attack’s “<a href="https://www.dazeddigital.com/music/article/30051/1/the-cult-inspirations-behind-massive-attack-s-new-video">Voodoo in My Blood</a>,” <em>Possession</em> is an essential watch for any serious horror fan. <em>—TE</em></p>

<p id="upM5Zt"><strong>Directors</strong>: Jaume Balaguero, Paco Plaza<br><strong>Cast</strong>: Manuela Velasco, Ferran Terraza, Martha Carbonell<br><strong>Where to watch: </strong>For digital rental/purchase on Amazon, YouTube</p>
<p id="mLBSzP">One of the best and most disturbing found-footage movies ever, <em>[REC]</em> follows a TV reporter and camera person who follow emergency workers into an apartment building, only to discover the dark truth inside: Some of the residents are turning into monsters. Set squarely in the zombie-craze of the mid-2000s, <em>[REC]</em>’s undead creatures owe quite a bit to the raving cannibal infected of <em>28 Days Later</em>, but the Spanish movie’s flesh-eaters are quite a bit creepier and more disturbed than their predecessors. While many found-footage movies obscure their scariest moments, <em>[REC]</em> uses the format to enhance its creeping dread and drag out the character’s slow careful exploration of the apartment building, ramping the tension up to 11 just in time for the downright terrifying finale. — <em>AG</em></p>

<p id="935nKR"><strong>Director:</strong> Scott Derrickson<br><strong>Cast:</strong> Ethan Hawke, Clare Foley, Fred Thompson<br><strong>Where to watch:</strong> Max</p>
<p id="31ZLAq">A desperate true crime writer, played by Ethan Hawke, moves his family into a house that once played host to an extremely gruesome crime in Scott Derrickson’s terrifically dark horror gem, <em>Sinister</em>. Despite the fact that this movie preceded the latest renaissance of true crime by several years, Hawke seems to have a perfect bead on the genre’s worst creators. He’s one of the all-time-bad horror movie parents, throwing his kids into untold danger all in the hope of writing a new book that could save his career. </p>
<p id="LuqoDF">Of course, by the time he realizes he’s actually put his family in the path of genuine danger and certain death, it’s already too late for him to write a single word. It’s a straight-over-the-plate premise that feels like you’ll see the scares coming a mile away, but Derrickson takes the story to darker and creepier places than you’d ever expect at first glance, turning it into one of the most terrifying horror movies of the 2010s. —<em>AG</em></p>

<p id="7zTqNO"><strong>Director:</strong> Egor Abramenko<br><strong>Cast:</strong> Oksana Akinshina, Fedor Bondarchuk, Pyotr Fyodorov<br><strong>Where to watch: </strong>Digital rental/purchase on Amazon, Apple TV, YouTube</p>
<p id="wRrMkx">If you’re hungry for a great piece of contemporary Russian sci-fi horror (i.e., something not directed by either Andrei Tarkovsky or Yakov Protazanov), then Egor Abramenko’s 2020 directorial debut is just the film you’re looking for. </p>
<p id="o6rTCA">Set during 1983 at the height of Cold War tensions, <em>Sputnik</em> (which for your information is Russian for “fellow traveler”) centers on Tatyana (Oskana Akinshina), an uncompromising young psychiatrist with a staunch attitude with regard to the ends justifying the means. Tatyana is recruited by the Soviet military to treat Konstantin (Pyotr Fyodorov), a wounded cosmonaut and the lone survivor of a mysterious satellite crash. Only upon arriving at the remote hospital facility housing the patient and interacting with him does Tatyana come to realize the horrifying truth: Konstantin did not in fact return from space alone; rather, his body has now become the unwitting host to an organism unlike anything seen on Earth. Caught between her duty to study the creature and her desire to save Konstantin from further harm, Tatyana must make a hard decision upon which the very survival of all humanity may rest.</p>
<p id="jc7KQt">What makes Abramenko’s debut so compelling is how it takes the basic premise of the “trolley problem” thought experiment and twists it repeatedly (and successfully) to dramatic emotional effect. Akinshina (<em>The Bourne Supremacy</em>) delivers a convincing and compelling performance as Tatyana, a woman forced to confront and overcome the uncompromising attitude that had once assured her success but now threatens to endanger not only another man’s life, but potentially the lives of everyone on the planet along with her own soul. Fyodorov, for his own part, delivers a sympathetically complex (and on occasion, implicitly sinister) performance as Konstantin, a Russian “hero” torn between his perceived duty to his country and his emotional obligation to a loved one he all but abandoned before embarking on his most recent mission. The creature design in this movie is terrific, as is the cinematography and the film’s score.</p>
<p id="aOLxIs">Having previously been slated for a world premiere at the 2020 Tribeca Film Festival and subsequently dumped on video-on-demand in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, <em>Sputnik</em> is exactly the kind of horror movie this list was intended to spotlight: a kind of rare gem of intellectually and viscerally stimulating horror that otherwise goes unappreciated if not given the opportunity to shine. <em>—TE</em></p>

<p id="PscgqY"><strong>Director</strong>: Dario Argento<br><strong>Cast</strong>: Jessica Harper, Stefania Casini, Flavio Bucci<br><strong>Where to watch: </strong>Kanopy</p>
<p id="lZ4iuY">One of the best-looking movies of all time with one of the best soundtracks of all time. What’s better than that?</p>
<p id="ZG0EYW">Dario Argento’s <em>Suspiria </em>tells the story of Suzy Bannion, an American dancer who moves to Germany to study at the prestigious Tanz Akademie. It just so happens that the academy is run by witches. As the facade of the school unravels, Suzy’s fellow students slowly start going missing or dropping dead in increasingly bizarre and horrible ways. </p>
<p id="kjvVBW">While the plot for <em>Suspiria </em>is interesting, what really makes the movie great is how it looks and how it sounds. Everything about the production design, the costumes, and the colors is eccentric in ways no other horror movie has ever matched. Couple all that with the incredible and haunting soundtrack from European rock band Goblin, and <em>Suspiria </em>becomes an unforgettable horror classic that everyone should see at least once. — <em>AG</em></p>

<p id="eFkOPu">Another shoestring production gone huge, Tobe Hooper’s 1974 masterpiece made over $30 million at the box office on a budget of around $140,000. The movie follows a group of friends who find themselves hunted by a family of cannibals in the middle of Texas, and is a chilling, violent fever dream that permanently lodges itself in the minds of those who watch it.</p>
<p id="PSr6ZZ">Eight films have followed, including a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22940937/texas-chainsaw-massacre-review-2022-netflix">Netflix version</a> in 2022, but the original stands out as an unhinged encapsulation of pure chaos and terror. At a tight 83 minutes, the original <em>Texas Chain Saw Massacre </em>is well worth the small time investment to catch up on one of the most influential horror movies ever made. —<em>PV</em></p>

<p id="UtZ0gN">John Carpenter’s postmodern creature feature takes the idea of alien monsters and makes them simultaneously more recognizable and more gross and unworldly than in any other movie in history. <em>The Thing</em>, the second adaptation of the excellent novella <em>Who Goes There?</em>, remains thrilling, terrifying, and absolutely disgusting more than 40 years after its release. </p>
<p id="cqryYD"><em>The Thing</em> follows a group of researchers working at an Antarctic base. Suddenly, a dog from a local Norwegian camp rushes into their base, with Norwegian men hot on its heels, trying to kill it by any means necessary. However, once the American crew takes the dog in and shelters it, they discover it’s an alien that can transform into any living creature, mimicking it perfectly — and that makes every one of them a suspect.</p>
<p id="ZhpT7r">It’s one of the great paranoid thriller premises of all time, but it just so happens to also be filled with gross and fantastic alien gore. There’s nothing quite like <em>The Thing</em>. —<em>AG</em></p>

<p id="Sv25r1"><strong>Director:</strong> Nahnatchka Khan<br><strong>Cast:</strong> Kiernan Shipka, Olivia Holt, Charlie Gillespie<br><strong>Where to watch:</strong> Prime Video</p>
<p id="4mWZyK"><em>Totally Killer</em> is a slasher with a sci-fi twist, not unlike the fabulous Happy Death Day movies. The movie follows Jamie (Kiernan Shipka), who has to go back in time to the 1980s to stop a masked serial killer before he kills her mom in the future. When she arrives in the past, however, the high school versions of her mom (Olivia Holt), her dad (Charlie Gillespie), and every other adult in her life aren’t exactly who she thought they’d be. </p>
<p id="SEImkZ">While <em>Totally Killer</em> isn’t the scariest horror movie on this list, it is undeniably one of the most fun. The cast elevates an already funny script thanks to some fantastic and ridiculous line readings, and the movie has a few novel approaches to time-travel shenanigans that keep the concept from ever overwhelming the movie or dragging it down with too much science. <em>Totally Killer</em> is endearingly silly with just the right amount of sweetness, making it one of the most fun and unique slashers of the last several years. —<em>AG</em></p>

<p id="t35Vz2">As many people have learned over the past few years, there aren’t that many things scarier than a video call you can’t leave.</p>
<p id="63GJH7">A masterfully contained horror movie that makes full use of its (at the time) groundbreaking gimmick, <em>Unfriended </em>is a tense teen horror movie that takes place entirely on a character’s laptop screen. Definitely watch it on a laptop if you can, and check out the very good sequel <em>Unfriended: Dark Web </em>if you dug this one. —<em>PV</em></p>
<p id="e1e8ja">From our list of the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22325729/best-horror-movies-netflix">best horror movies on Netflix</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p id="xndPcA">Levan Gabriadze’s <em>Unfriended</em> pulls the audiences through the screen — almost literally. Viewed entirely from the perspective of a computer desktop, 2014 supernatural horror film centers around a Skype call between a group of high school students who are joined by an unknown presence known only as “billie227.” What at first appears to be a prank swiftly morphs into something much more horrific, as the mysterious stranger begins to reveal terrifying secrets about each of the friends before killing them off one by one. <em>Unfriended</em> is thoroughly gripping extrapolation of our always-online world, a world where vengeful poltergeists and doxxing exist side by side and no secret or offense goes undiscovered or unpunished. <em>—TE</em></p></blockquote>

<p id="bHY54g"><strong>Director: </strong>Jordan Peele<br><strong>Cast: </strong>Lupita Nyong’o, Winston Duke, Elisabeth Moss<br><strong>Where to watch</strong>: Digital rental/purchase on Amazon, Apple TV, YouTube</p>
<p id="VKQKUT">Jordan Peele’s already a horror master just three movies into his career, but <em>Us </em>probably still doesn’t have the reputation it deserves. His 2019 psychological slasher had the unfortunate fate of following up the cultural phenomenon of <em>Get Out</em>, so it had a hard time breaking through, in the way that sophomore projects often do. But taken on its own terms, <em>Us </em>is a fantastic little horror movie with tons of atmosphere and an underground society’s worth of great scares. </p>
<p id="i2ownh">The movie follows the Wilson family, whose vacation is interrupted by the arrival of a group of doppelgängers who match up with each member of the family perfectly. The clones, it turns out, are called Tethered, and where they come from is very complicated. But before any kind of explanation of the Tethered, what we see is a parade of violent attacks, home invasions, and some very tense encounters between Lupita Nyong’o and herself. </p>
<p id="UcTZco"><em>Us</em> may not be Peele’s best movie, but it is a fascinating mix of slasher thrills and world- building, supported by a fantastic cast all operating at their A games. While the entire cast is great, Elizabeth Moss is a particular standout for her extremely brief but extraordinarily loathsome role as one of the family’s friends. Her performance gives this movie so much of its weird off-kilter vibe, and leads to some of its most unstintingly and gleefully over-the-top violence. Alongside the terrifying tone, Peele manages to build an entire second world underneath our own, and will give you a very unhealthy fear of what you’re really seeing when you look in the mirror. —<em>AG</em></p>

Dead Space fans should be keen to try <em>The Callisto Protocol, </em>a 2022 sci-fi survival horror game that wasn’t a total knockout but had plenty of the DNA that made Dead Space games great — so a perfect Game Pass game? Those looking for something new should keep eyes peeled on <em>Still Wakes the Deep</em>, horror game set on an oil rig that’s going day 1 on the service. </p>

He told IGN, “yes, you can romance the companions you want.” So it sounds like there will be no restrictions based on your character’s gender or race.</p><p>“We spent a lot of time making our companions feel authentic based on their own unique experiences within this larger fantasy world, which in turn makes the relationships you form with them feel even more meaningful,” McKay said.” We’ve tapped into<em> Dragon Age</em>’s deep lore and explored its most iconic factions to bring each of the seven companions and their stories to life,” he continued.</p><p>BioWare will likely introduce at least some of these characters when the studio releases 15 minutes of <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard </em>footage on June 11, so we’ll all get a chance to start looking for our next beau. But bringing back <em>Dragon Age 2</em> ’s free-for-all structure will be a divisive inclusion. As a gay man who sometimes feels like I lack romance options in BioWare’s games (I don’t even like Zevran in <em>Dragon Age: Origins</em>, but he was the only man I could kiss), I’m always happy to hear that everyone, especially queer folks who often get shortchanged, will get an equal slice of the pie. But <em>Inquisition</em>’s defined identities brought a lot to characters like Dorian, whose story dealt with his identity as a gay man in the <em>Dragon Age </em>universe, informed the dynamics of your relationship, and told us new things about in the process. Ultimately, you lose and gain something in either approach, and it’s in the eye of the beholder about what takes priority.</p><p>Earlier this year, I <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/video-game-romance-playersexual-baldurs-gate-dragon-age-1851253394&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/video-game-romance-playersexual-baldurs-gate-dragon-age-1851253394">talked to developers</a></span> (including ex-BioWare writer David Gaider) about why making these decisions is more than just a numbers game, and it was fascinating to hear so many perspectives about what goes into that in terms of writing, coding, and resources. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[Black Ops 6 To Have Theatre Mode, It’s Claimed]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/cod-black-ops-6-theatre-mode/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Black Ops 6 is mere days away from being revealed by Activision Blizzard, and the leaks are coming thick and fast. In the last few weeks, we’ve been drip-fed content regarding Black Ops 6 – this year’s instalment of Call of Duty – and on June 9, the game’s core premise and the multiplayer are set to be revealed in full.</p>



<p>In the latest leak, it has been claimed that Black Ops 6 will be launching with a theatre mode, which hasn’t made an appearance in a major Call of Duty title since 2020’s Black Ops Cold War.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-theatrical">Theatrical</h2>



<p>In 2010, Black Ops was released worldwide with an innovative new feature called ‘theatre mode’, and the Call of Duty content creation scene was forever changed. With theatre mode, players could create mini-movies and montages with a few button presses, diving back into recordings of their recent matches and tweaking them to their heart’s content.</p>



<p>In a recent leak posted <a href="https://x.com/BobNetworkUK/status/1798775541006520481" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">on Twitter by BobNetworkUK</a>, a reliable Call of Duty leaker, it was claimed that theatre mode will be coming back alongside Black Ops 6. That makes sense, as the last Call of Duty title to feature the iconic mode was Black Ops Cold War – the most recent game in the Black Ops sub-series.</p>



<p>Not only does this mean that content creators are about to foam at the mouth, but it also means that the shorts game is about to go wild, on-platform clip sharing might be a thing, and cheaters will be identified much easier with players getting the ability to spectate from the perspective of sus gamers with slick gaming chairs.</p>

Warren notes that it is in "early days" of development, so it is very unlikely that Microsoft will announce this project during <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-games-showcase-announced-for-june">this Sunday's Xbox Games Showcase</a>. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/06/halospeedrunblogroll-1533336736758-1717694718988.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>A Halo Combat Evolved remaster may be unveiled at the Xbox Showcase on Sunday.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Halo: Combat Evolved was developed by Bungie and initially released in 2001 as a launch game for the original Xbox gaming system. The project was the first in what would become one of Microsoft's flagship first-party IPs that has seen at least one game released on an Xbox platform since the console's release over 20 years ago. </p><p>In 2011, Microsoft published <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/halo-combat-evolved-anniversary">Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary</a>, a remake that kept the plot unchanged but introduced achievements, Terminals, and Skulls. It was the first to offer a mix of two game engines, allowing players to toggle between the original and improved graphics at the press of a button. Combat Evolved Anniversary is often regarded as the definitive version of the original Halo due to its updated visuals and achievement support, and it is the version included in the 2014 compilation <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/halo-the-master-chief-collection">Halo: The Master Chief Collection</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Every Video Game Franchise Xbox Owns After Acquiring Activision Blizzard</h3></div></output><p>In <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2001/11/10/halo-review">our review of the original Halo: Combat Evolved</a>, IGN wrote: "Is playing Halo worth the $350 it will cost for an Xbox and a game? If you can appreciate video games and have been waiting for the next step, then the answer is absolutely." </p><p>The report is part of the larger discussion of Xbox's gaming strategy after the publisher announced that some of its first-party games would <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-vision-of-the-future">see a release beyond the Xbox hardware ecosystem</a>. Some of the first previously Xbox console-exclusive games to receive multiplatform release include Grounded, Pentiment, Sea of Thieves, and Hi-Fi Rush. That list will likely grow as Microsoft continues to evolve and shift its strategy on what it wants to make accessible regardless of platform and what it will retain exclusively for its platform.</p><p>For more, check out <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gears-6-xbox-handheld-and-doom-what-to-expect-from-the-xbox-showcase">what to expect from Sunday's Xbox showcase</a> as this week's events get underway.</p><p><em>Taylor is a Reporter at IGN.

But the interesting bit of news here is that, according to the newsletter, Doom: The Dark Ages has "been earmarked as a Project Latitude game to launch simultaneously on PS5 in 2025."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/06/gears-1717695395553.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Gears of War 6 will reportedly be announced at the Xbox Showcase, exclusive to Xbox and PC. </figcaption></figure></output><p>The so-called "Project Latitude" is reportedly the internal name for Xbox's continuing push to bring its first-party titles to rival consoles. That move started earlier this year with previous console exclusives Grounded, Pentiment, Hi-Fi Rush, and Sea of Thieves <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-vision-of-the-future">going multi-platform</a>. </p><p>What <em>isn't</em> part of that Project Latitude push, however, is apparently the next installment of Gears of War. While that will apparently make an appearance at the showcase, that will reportedly be exclusive to Xbox and PC.</p><p>Regardless of their console exclusivity statuses, both games will undoubtably be huge news amid a weekend full of major gaming reveals. A new Doom game had long been theorized among fans, thanks in large part to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/oblivion-remaster-fallout-3-remaster-and-more-leaked-from-microsoft-document">leaked Microsoft court documents</a>, as well <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/doom-heavily-rumored-for-xbox-june-showcase-amid-bethesda-trademark-and-other-hints">as a recent trademark filing</a>. A sixth Gears of War game isn't entirely surprising either, as that, too, had <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/the-first-gears-of-war-6-news-will-reportedly-be-coming-this-summer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">been subject to rumors</a>. The last mainline Gear of War game came in 2019.</p><p>We'll obviously learn a whole lot more when the Xbox Showcase airs this Sunday, which IGN will follow up with a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/phil-spencer-coming-to-ign-live">chat with Phil Spencer at IGN Live</a>. In the meantime, check out <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gears-6-xbox-handheld-and-doom-what-to-expect-from-the-xbox-showcase">everything we're expecting from the showcase</a>, including possible news on a handheld Xbox. </p><p><em>Alex Stedman is a Senior News Editor with IGN, overseeing entertainment reporting.

The game also has a new name: Yooka-Replaylee.</p><p>Yooka-Laylee released on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One in April 2017, with a Nintendo Switch version following in December 2017. IGN’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/04/yooka-laylee-review">Yooka-Laylee review</a> returned a 7/10. We said: “Yooka-Laylee is a good reminder that this genre, once thought to be dead, still has some life left in it.”</p><p>Yooka-Replaylee is the result of the growth of Playtonic over recent years, it said, and “the things we have learned while working on other projects as well as the feedback we have taken on board since the original release.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Yooka-Replaylee Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Here are the Yooka-Replaylee key features, per Playtonic:</p><p>• MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN EVER – With an art and animations overhaul and enhanced performance and resolution, the favorite buddy duo has never looked or moved better.</p><p>• NEW AND IMPROVED CHALLENGES – Improvements to existing in-game challenges and many entirely new challenges to discover and undertake!</p><p>• NEW COLLECTIBLE CURRENCY – Capital B's inept minions have dropped their hard-earned coins all over the place. Collect the official currency of the Hivory Towers to spend on video games' most beloved sentient vending machine.</p><p>• NAVIGATING THE WORLD – Now you can get lost in the game, not in the world! A brand-new world map and challenges tracker helps you know where you are and what needs to be done. Hooray!</p><p>• VENDI HAS PLENTY TO OFFER – Tonics are back with all new flavors! With the option to equip multiple game-changing enhancements, you can truly customise your playstyle. And as if that wasn't enough, Vendi has new lines of merchandise for the modern fashionable adventurer.</p><p>• REVISED CONTROLS &amp; CAMERA – A new tweaked move set allows you to combine moves more fluidly while the new camera controls makes framing the action a breeze.</p><p>• A DREAMY ORCHESTRAL SOUNDTRACK – The original score from famed video game composers Grant Kirkhope (Banjo-Kazooie) and David Wise (Donkey Kong Country) returns but as a beautifully arranged orchestral score. Now seriously, clean out those ears.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Yooka-Laylee spawned a 2D spin-off, <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/yooka-laylee-and-the-impossible-lair">Yooka-Laylee and the Impossible Lair</a>, which released on Nintendo Switch, PS4, Xbox One, and PC in 2019. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/10/03/yooka-laylee-and-the-impossible-lair-review">IGN gave that one an 8.7</a>. "Yooka-Laylee and the Impossible Lair brings the dynamic duo down to a 2.5D perspective to deliver one of the best platformers we’ve seen in years," we said.</p><p>Expect more on Yooka-Replaylee during a Q&amp;A session set for June 11.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

<p data-characters="272" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">After a year back in the workshop, MultiVersus returned on May 28, with new features, characters, and stages. One week of action gave the development team a good idea of what needed to be adjusted, and Player First Games responded with the first batch of buffs and nerfs. </p> <p data-characters="522" data-current-count="522" data-injectable="true">Before jumping into the MultiVersus1.01 update patch notes, Player First Games <a href="https://x.com/multiversus/status/1798452443849584699" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that performance improvements, end game statistics, and the option to turn off team colors won’t be a part of this update, but will be added at a later date. In addition, the development team assured players that the option to purchase extra lives was a bug and has since been removed from the title. And despite a series of changes in this update, Iron Giant will still be unavailable while a few more issues get ironed out. </p>
