            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/wizards-of-coast-takes-over-commander-format-following-abuse-to-rules-committee<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Earlier this week, the Commander Rules Committee updated <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/latest-magic-gathering-commander-ban-list-update-enrages-fanbase" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the ban list</a> for <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering's</em></a> Commander format. It was a contentious change to the meta that enraged fans so much that Wizards of the Coast will take over the committee's duties.</p>
<h2>The Future of Magic: The Gathering Commander Format</h2>
<p>In an official <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/on-the-future-of-commander">blog post</a>, WIzards of the Coast explained their plans for curating the Commander format for <em>Magic: The Gathering</em>. The post starts with commending the Commander Rules Committee, a small group of five passionate talented individuals. Individuals that contribute to the committee while working full-time jobs and raising families.</p>

Due to the escalating outrage of recent events, personal threats have been sent to committee members, Wizards of the Coast expressly states a zero tolerance policy on this front.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;This is something we will not tolerate. No matter how you feel about something in Magic, it is never appropriate to threaten somebody. Everyone at Wizards of the Coast is united on this front—we will not hesitate to take action against individuals who threaten to harm community members or employees.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The CRC corroborated WIzards of the Coast's official statement. In a thread of <a href="https://x.com/mtgcommander/status/1840783614294069286">social media posts</a> on X (formerly known as Twitter), the CRC stated that they could no longer operate as an independent entity as a result of these threats. They are sad that this marks the end of an era, but WOTC has assured them that they do not wish to change the vision of Commander as a community-focused format.</p>

<p>According to the post, both the CRC and the design team are still in preliminary conversations about the future of Commander. This includes a new approach to deck power level and more guidance for players looking for a format that suits their style of play.</p>

According to the developer, <em>Neva </em>will follow the growing relationship between the two, who start as unlikely allies before becoming inseparable companions. </p><p>I’ve been excited for <em>Neva </em>for a while now and it looks like an improvement in so many ways from Nomada’s stunning debut. <em>Neva </em>maintains the platforming of <em>Gris</em>, but builds upon it with way more mechanics, which are incredibly welcome! For instance, this time around <em>Neva </em>will feature combat and Alba will make use of her sword when fighting off monsters rather than in <em>Gris</em>, where the protagonist avoids conflict at all costs. It seems like when Alba and the wolf first find one another, Alba must work to protect it, but as the wolf grows, it might become an ally in combat, and can maybe even be directed.<br></p><p><em>Neva</em>, much like <em>Gris </em>before it, is absolutely gorgeous. Ever since its debut trailer, I’ve been in awe of its style, which feels much looser than <em>Gris</em>’ sharp linework, and consequently more expressive. It is also more naturalistic than Nomada’s previous game, seemingly placing an emphasis on the collapsing world in an effort to reflect the real life consequences of climate change on our ecosystems. If that’s the case, <em>Neva </em>appears to be a beautiful tragedy, and I wouldn’t be surprised if just like <em>Gris</em>, it’s a hell of a tearjerker. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="6efc55c7aff1f5c4a47b98c50f559098" data-recommend-id="image://6efc55c7aff1f5c4a47b98c50f559098" data-format="png" data-width="1080" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Some Neva concepgt art.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/yoshi-p-thinks-a-final-fantasy-9-remake-would-take-more-than-one-game<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Rumors of a Final Fantasy IX remake have been echoing around RPG circles for at least year now, with series fans hopeful that they may soon get to revisit one of the most beloved entries in the series. But if a Final Fantasy IX remake does materialize, it may face some big challenges.</p><p>Speaking with the website <a href="https://www.si.com/videogames/features/final-fantasy-14-naoki-yoshida-interview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Video Games</a>, Final Fantasy XIV producer Naoki Yoshida talked a bit about what a remake might look like. He warns that it may not all fit in one game.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Top 10 Final Fantasy Bosses</h3></div></output><p>"Of course, I do know there  are requests for Final Fantasy IX to be made, but when you think about Final Fantasy IX, it’s a game with huge volume," Yoshida says. "When you think about all of that volume, I wonder if it’s possible to remake that as a single title. It’s a difficult one. It is a tough question."</p><p>Yoshida seems to be suggesting that a potential remake could go the direction of Final Fantasy VII Remake, which is in the middle of a planned trilogy. Fans have long had mixed feelings about splitting it into multiple parts, which offers the opportunity to add plenty of new elements, but also slows the pacing. As it stands, the third part of the trilogy doesn't figure to be out until 2026 at the earliest.</p><p>Yoshida is right about Final Fantasy IX being a big game. It's absolutely loaded with sidequests, minigames, and other content, and it's set in a very large world. Reproducing all of that material won't be easy for any development team that takes on a remake.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>As for Yoshida himself, he's interested in remaking a different game in the series. "The one that I would like to make myself would be Final Fantasy III, I think."</p><p>For longtime fans of the series, Yoshida is referring to the version released on the Famicom, not the Americanized Final Fantasy VI. It's a deep cut as Final Fantasy releases go, but very much in keeping with Yoshida's attitude as Final Fantasy XIV's producer.</p><p>Yoshida touches on a handful of other details in the interview, including his favorite Final Fantasy VII minigame (snowboarding), an Xbox release of Final Fantasy XVI ("we do want to release it on Xbox"), and more. In the meantime, the wait for a Final Fantasy IX remake continues.</p><p><em>Kat Bailey is IGN's News Director as well as co-host of Nintendo Voice Chat. Have a tip?

                <p>The first State of Decay game came out all the way back in 2013, and the franchise is still growing. Following 2018's sequel, State of Decay 2, a third game is now in the works for Xbox and PC.</p><p>The biggest piece of news of late on State of Decay 3 is that it's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/state-of-decay-2-new-content-updates-are-ending-as-dev-prioritizes-state-of-decay-3/1100-6526276/" data-ref-id="1100-6526276">ramping up production</a>, as developer Undead Labs winds down development on State of Decay 2 and shifts to the third game. Here in this post, we're rounding up everything we know about State of Decay 3.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="When_will_State_of_Decay_3_release_">When will State of Decay 3 release?</h2><p>State of Decay 3 was announced back in 2020 but still does not have a release date. In fact, Undead Labs and Microsoft have not said much at all about the game.</p><h2 id="State_of_Decay_3_trailer">State of Decay 3 trailer</h2><p>The first state of State of Decay 3 trailer was released in 2020. The cinematic trailer showed a character tracking an animal's blood trail through the snow, only to discover a zombified deer. Pretty scary stuff! A second trailer, which debuted in 2024, showed off more of the game's world, but was again only a (very impressive-looking!) cinematic trailer and did not contain any gameplay footage.</p><p>You can

It also lets players turn off an optional news feed widget that pulls random announcements for all of the games they follow. Unfortunately, that news feed is now infecting the rest of the console’s home screen. </p><p>Tiles for installed games used to display background art or activity cards when you scrolled over them, but following a recent change they now pull from whatever the latest item is in that game’s news feed. Sometimes the results are harmless, but other times it means anything from YouTube thumbnails to marketing for other games takes over the screen when selecting specific games to play. </p><p>“So it turns out that the recent PS5 UI update that let you disable all the advertisements on the dashboard was too good to be true,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/alfredobofa/status/1840189326883262655&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/alfredobofa/status/1840189326883262655" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a></span> user Earl Turlet over the weekend. “Now EVERY SINGLE GAME on your homescreen shows you an advertisement in the background with no way to remove them lol.” YouTuber Mystic <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQ9wgBHuEP0&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQ9wgBHuEP0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">also put together a thorough video</a></span> walking players through the changes. </p><p>The most egregious examples include a “what is Warhammer” video for <em>Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2</em>, the <em>Spider-Man: Miles Morales</em> page showing a promotional image from <em>Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse </em>which came out over a year ago, and accolade posts that plaster the art of a game with review scores and testimonials. Sometimes the newsfeed shows another game entirely, like <em>Horizon Zero Dawn: Complete Edition </em>on PS4 whose background art now shows <em>Lego Horizon Adventures</em> instead. “It’s a huge downgrade for the UI,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/1fsudpe/please_protest_the_ads_on_the_homescreen_on/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/1fsudpe/please_protest_the_ads_on_the_homescreen_on/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote one player on Reddit</a></span> calling for others to protest the changes. “<em>Elden Ring</em> is advertising a mousepad FFS.”</p><p>Hopefully, Sony reverts the change. Ideally, players would be allowed to customize the backgrounds for games just like they can on the welcome hub, choosing from official art or even their own screenshots. And if some players do want quick access to the newsfeeds for the corresponding games, maybe Sony can do a better job of displaying what they curate. In a lot of cases a simple list of the latest official headlines from the PlayStation Blog or social media accounts for those games would be a lot more useful than how the feeds are currently constructed.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
PlayStation 5 owners are reporting emotions ranging from mildly miffed to deep-seated annoyance following Sony's decision to plaster the console's homescreen with ugly artwork and often irrelevant promotional news stories following its latest update.
</p>
<p>
The changes - which appear to have been slowly rolled out over the last few weeks, gaining attention on social media this weekend -  mean the PS5 now prominently displays promotional article headlines across the centre of its homescreen alongside full-sized background images, based on whatever happens to be top of the currently selected game's newsfeed.
</p>
<p>
Now, rather than displaying aesthetically pleasing artwork when a game is highlighted as was previously the case, PlayStation 5's homescreen is a chaotic mishmash of random, busy promotional art (sometimes fighting against the existing UI) and drastically out-of-date news stories - which, in some cases, are only tangentially related to the chosen game.

<p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/horizon-zero-dawn">Horizon Zero Dawn</a>, for instance, now, somewhat confusingly, displays a huge Lego Aloy image when the game is selected, with the most prominent bit of text onscreen reading, "<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lego-horizon-adventures">Lego Horizon Adventures</a>". Some titles display promotions long past their expiration date or encouragement for a user to buy the very game they already own - while still others have somehow escaped the changes, displaying the old art just as they once did.

<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">So it turns out that the recent PS5 UI update that let you disable all the advertisements on the dashboard was too good to be true.

Home screen ads aren't exactly a rarity, of course, but Sony's implementation is a bit of a mess - not helped by the fact it seemingly can only be disabled by disconnecting the PS5 from the internet. And as users begin to familiarise themselves with the changes, they're being met with an understandable degree of discontent. "I'm starting to feel alienated by PlayStation’s choices," wrote I_pee_in_shower over <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/1fsgy7j/ps5_new_ui_update_also_brought_ads_you_cant_turn/">on the PlayStation 5 subreddit</a>, "I don't want ads, games as service or to rebuy my console halfway though cycle."
</p>
<p>
"This update sucks," added the (clearly less than cheery) cheer_up_crewcut
. "Gone is the nice artwork when you hover over the game, and you just get the stupid news articles instead. Some of them are really low-res too and it looks really ugly. Makes the home screen look terrible.
</p>
<p>
Whether Sony chooses to listen to customer pleas and rolls back the changes remains to be seen, but with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-announces-digital-only-playstation-5-pro-costs-700">£700 new console</a> looming, an unhappy player base probably isn't ideal.

		<p>Sabotage Studio has revealed Sea of Stars: Dawn of Equinox, a big free update that will add a new three-player local co-op mode, overhaul combat, revamp the prologue and much, much more.</p>
<p>Dawn of Equinox will release on 12th November, and again, it’s a totally free update for the game. Sea of Stars is out across <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a>, PS4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch and PC.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that this is separate to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBnJv-rQjMM">the Throes of the Watchmaker DLC</a> – also a free release for owners of the game, coming in Spring 2025.</p>


<p>Here’s the Dawn of Equinox update breakdown from Sabotage Studios:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>All-New Local Cooperative Play</strong> – Sea of Stars‘ story will be playable in its entirety by up to three players, with allies traversing the world together and mastering a new Cooperative Timed Hits combat mechanic.</li>
<li><strong>Combat 2.0</strong> – The addition of Mystery Locks brings a new gameplay loop around revealing the ways to break the spells of enemies each time a new type is encountered in battle. Along with “Reveal” functions added to some of the playable cast’s special skills, Combo Points now remain after battle, offering new ways to open certain encounters, or test different damage types on enemies to reveal their locks. A comprehensive balancing pass has also been done to reflect both these new changes and player feedback since launch.</li>
<li><strong>A Revamped Prologue</strong> – Implementing combat for the young versions of our heroes, the updated flow does away with the flashback structure to begin in their childhood, directly including <a title="Genres > Action [2,216 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a> in the prologue.</li>
<li><strong>Bonus Cinematic Scene</strong> – An entirely new cutscene has been added to accentuate a pivotal moment in the original adventure, referred to as “Paths on Water.”</li>
<li><strong>A Speedrunner Mode Relic</strong> – This new item activates a range of features helpful for those looking to set a new personal best or world record.</li>
<li><strong>Difficulty Presets</strong> – Three difficulty options are now available when starting a new game, which are presets using the game’s Relics. New Relics have also been added, both for quality of life and difficulty adjustments.</li>
<li><strong>Improved Parrot Relic</strong> – Sea of Stars‘ secret-tracking parrot has learned a few new tricks to better assist players tracking down overlooked challenges and collectibles.</li>
<li><strong>Quebecois Localization</strong> – A comprehensive French Canadian translation for Quebec’s finest Solstice Warriors.</li>
<li><strong>Quality of Life Improvements</strong> – A constellation of general updates and improvements spanning Sea of Stars‘ full campaign.</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the best indie games of 2023, we had plenty of praise for the homage to classic JRPGs. In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/08/31/sea-of-stars-review-a-love-letter-to-jrpgs-of-the-past/">Sea of Stars review</a>, Nic said, “</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/30/starfield-how-and-when-can-you-play-shattered-space-dlc/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Starfield: Shattered Space is now live, the first big story expansion for Bethesda’s sci-fi RPG revealing a new hand-crafted planet to explore and telling <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/17/starfield-shattered-space-deep-dive-reveals-more-about-house-varuuns-broken-homeworld/">the story of House Va’ruun</a>. But how can you get access to Shattered Space, and when can you play it within Starfield’s progression?</p>

<p>Shattered Space is available in two ways. You can get it as a separate purchase, for $29.99 / £29.99 on the Microsoft Store (with a 10% discount for Game Pass subscribers), or it’s $29.99 / £25.99 on Steam for users of that storefront.</p>
<p>It’s also bundled in with the Premium and Constellation Editions of Starfield.&nbsp;Owners of the Standard Edition can also purchase the Digital Premium Upgrade ($35 / £35 on Xbox) to access the DLC, and also get the Digital Art Book, Original Soundtrack, 1,000 Creation Credits and the Constellation Skin Pack. This applies also to Game Pass players, who can grab the upgrade and play while subscribed.</p>


<p>The DLC is an additional download – around 10GB on Xbox Series X|S – that you’ll need to grab <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/30/starfield-shattered-space-update-1-14-70-has-plenty-of-fixes-and-improvements/">alongside the latest Starfield update</a> in order to play.</p>
<p><iframe title="Starfield: Shattered Space - Deep Dive" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Br8_YASkfb8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<h2>How to access and play Shattered Space</h2>
<p>Once you’ve bought Starfield: Shattered Space – maybe you had it since day one? – how can you actually get at this new location and quest?</p>

<p>Shattered Space is woven in alongside the rest of the main game’s stories, but it’s a separate adventure that you can play almost whenever you like.&nbsp;All you&nbsp;<em>need</em> to do is play the introductory mission of the main game, ‘One Small Step’. After you’ve completed the first grav-jump to a location that is not used by a mission or triggered another encounter, players will receive a distress call and be led to the star station that introduces you to Shattered Space’s story.</p>
<p>Complete the first quest and then jump to a random planet, basically.</p>
<p>But should you take it on this early in the game? Maybe it’s best to wait. You can play Shattered Space, but Bethesda recommend reaching level 35 for the best experience.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/echoes-of-wisdom-builds-zelda-up-to-be-hero-only-to-take-it-away<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="69d43770-b33b-47b0-8f9f-ecfad39b2fc8" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-review-so-many-echoes-for-silent-protagonist"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em></a> is out, and this fresh 2D outing for the franchise is a fun romp through a chibi world as well as Zelda's inaugural leading role. Unfortunately, while the game does a lot to build Zelda up by providing her an arsenal of Echoes and limited transformation powers, as you reach the final challenge of the game the story seems happy to put Zelda back into her box as a supporting character.</p>
<p><strong>We're going into endgame spoilers, so if you haven't completed <em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em>, it's best to bookmark this and come back to it to share your thoughts on the ending.</strong></p>
<h2>Echoes and Swordplay</h2>
<p>The main power that you'll be using through your adventure is Zelda's Echoes, which she can learn and create with the power of the Tri Rod. At the beginning of the game, you get echoes such as a bed, a small rock, and common enemies like Zol and Guays.</p>
<p>With each new region that you explore, you'll get to find increasingly powerful enemies to take as your own. You might not be able to take on a Wolfos alone, but a small army of other creatures will be powerful enough to turn the tide of battle.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/loz-echoes-of-wisdom-east-of-castle-town.jpg?itok=1ZWXMyTJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/loz-echoes-of-wisdom-east-of-castle-town.jpg?itok=CPwCSZrQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Any of these enemies can be summoned to assist Zelda in her journey</figcaption></figure><p>This power allows Zelda to summon the creatures, and then be on the defensive. You can create some level of offence by directing or throwing these enemies but it's normally better to just let them do their job.</p>
<p>For when Zelda does want to go on the full offence the other ability that she picks up through her journey is a limited transformation into a Swordsman. Here she can swing a sword to create a more traditional <em>Zelda</em> experience. The energy to use this power though exclusively comes from creatures made of the Still World.</p>
<h2>Boss Battles Teach You Balance</h2>
<p>Boss battles in <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em> show you the best way to balance each of these abilities. A boss might need an Electric Keese to knock them to the ground, and then in that short moment of vulnerability by transforming into a Swordsman you can capitalize on damage.</p>
<p>The game even specifically rewards this type of play. Each time a boss gets up from being knocked down, it also dispenses some of the energy required to recharge your transformation gauge. It's the game telling you "The best time to use the Swordsman transformation is to take down the boss," which is why it makes no sense that for the final fight of the game, they rob you of this power.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/loz-echoes-of-wisdom-early-boss-fight.jpg?itok=mh9XtdVD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/loz-echoes-of-wisdom-early-boss-fight.jpg?itok=4iW4QXpx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Summon Echoes to stun the boss, then transform and use your sword to defeat them.</figcaption></figure><h2>Link Is the Hero of This Story</h2>
<p><em>Echoes of Wisdom</em> starts with Link freeing Zelda but falling into the Still World, and it does make sense that by the end of the adventure Zelda frees him. But after freeing him, Zelda returns all of Link's items to him. That power of transformation that has been integral to every single boss fight is now unavailable to you.</p>
<p>This leads to a final boss fight where Link is not only present, but is active in combat and has unlimited health, allowing him to constantly be damaging Null, while Zelda is limited to only the ability to summon Echoes.</p>
<p>This final boss fight isn't some small endeavor either. With three major phases each of which has smaller segments, you'll be forced to experience the end of <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em> not as a triumphant hero but instead a witness to Link's almighty power while you spam Echoes that disappear in a single hit and dodge oncoming attacks like you're playing a bullet hell.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/loz-echoes-of-wisdom-final-boss.jpg?itok=AOGFLUzl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/loz-echoes-of-wisdom-final-boss.jpg?itok=_JtihmBv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Summon your best and watch from the sideline as Link saves the day</figcaption></figure><h2>How Zelda Has Assisted Link in the Past</h2>
<p>The formula for what has transpired here is not new. It's quite common for the climactic fight of a <em>Legend of Zelda</em>&nbsp;title to be Link getting support from Zelda to defeat the final foe.</p>
<p>In <em>Windwaker</em>, Zelda would shoot a Light Arrow for you to reflect, in <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="911c8afd-39ed-4462-9fea-1481491f71c8" href="https://techraptor.net/games/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-kingdom"><em>Tears of the Kingdom</em></a> Zelda allowed Link to get above Ganondorf's draconic form to slay him, and even in <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="b1fc47e4-03e6-44e4-8c27-6f953edc5ee5" href="https://techraptor.net/games/legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time"><em>Ocarina of Time</em></a> Zelda threw the Master Sword back to Link for the final strike.</p>
<p>While I was hoping the formula would be "The main character gets support from the character they saved," instead the formula really is "Link saves the day with the help of Zelda."</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tears-of-the-kingdom-zelda-assistance.jpg?itok=IK-eCypy 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tears-of-the-kingdom-zelda-assistance.jpg?itok=Q1V-q4qj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Zelda always assists Link, but never takes the spotlight</figcaption></figure><h2>How <em>Echoes Of Wisdom</em> Should Have Ended</h2>
<p>There are two key ways that the final battle of <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em> could be altered to provide not only a more fitting finale, but one that Zelda deserves.</p>
<p>The first change would simply be to not rob Zelda of a major part of her move set for the final fight. Allow Zelda to keep the Sword, Bow, and Bombs and provide Link a variety of backup items to assist with. To keep Link in a truly support role this might be something as simple as having him outside the arena of combat, but able to throw in useful items that could put the final boss in a stunned state.</p>
<p>This would mean that Zelda is still the one driving the show, but in a similar way to how Zelda has supported in the past, it's now Link's turn to contribute without hogging the spotlight.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/loz-echoes-of-wisdom-skorchill-boss-fight.jpg?itok=6gU2w-lu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/loz-echoes-of-wisdom-skorchill-boss-fight.jpg?itok=WtkNFKbB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Skorchill boss fight is the perfect balance of alternating Echoes and implementing Zelda's transformation magic</figcaption></figure><p>The second change would be to have the final fight be more than who can hit the hardest. Ultimately this final battle is just "Can Link and the Echoes deal enough damage while Zelda dodges oncoming attacks."</p>
<p>When previous battles have you utilizing Electric Keese to shock enemies off walls and into reach or alternating fire and ice attacks as the arena changes, to have a battle that's just "summon Echoes and hope they hit before they die" is lackluster.</p>
<p>So much work and planning went into the start of <em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em> to gracefully sideline Link, create wholly unique and fun powers for Zelda, and carefully scale those abilities throughout the game. It was truly a shame to see it end with Zelda becoming a damsel in distress.</p>

<p>If you didn’t heed the pre-launch advice about starting Shattered Space, specifically stocking up on health kits and ammunition, then you’re in luck. Despite the calamity, Dazra does have various vendors that, while verbally hostile towards you, will still sell you goods and items. You namely require weapons and ammo to deal with wildlife and anomalies, so here’s where to buy both on Va’ruun’kai!</p>



<h2 id="h-where-to-find-the-weapons-trader-in-shattered-space">Where to Find the Weapons Trader in Shattered Space</h2>



<p>The best spot to buy weapons and ammunition in Shattered Space is visiting the Goods Exchange near the city center’s circle. There, you’ll meet Makola Jubav. He doesn’t trust outsiders, but he likes your credits all the same. He’ll sell you various weapons and ammunition, with a rather large selection of the latter. As for weapons, expect plenty of Va’ruun weaponry.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>You’ll wander directly past the Goods Exchange on your way to speak to Ekris for The Promised, Broken, which is part of the main quest in Shattered Space. Alternatively, it’s beside the squabbling siblings for the side quest, The Duel. You may need to head to the back of the store to find Makola, as he enjoys hiding in the back storeroom.</p>

<h2 id="h-what-goods-exchange-sells-on-va-ruun-kai">What Goods Exchange Sells on Va’ruun’kai</h2>



<p>So long as you have the credits, Makola will sell you a wide variety of goods, including:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Weapons</strong></li>



<li><strong>Ammo</strong></li>



<li><strong>Spacesuits</strong></li>



<li><strong>Jump Packs</strong></li>



<li><strong>Helmets</strong></li>



<li><strong>Misc</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>If you can spare the credits and don’t have the Starborn spacesuit, Makola sells the Mercenary Spacesuit for approximately 21,000 credits. It offers 112 Physical Resistance, 144 Energy Resistance, and 128 EM Resistance, making it a late-game, powerful armor set you’ll want to equip before delving deeper into the expansion!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/astro-bot-dev-says-we-really-respect-the-choice-of-each-publisher-amid-final-fantasy-cameo-absence<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>PS5-exclusive 3D platformer <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/astro-bot">Astro Bot</a> features 173 bot cameos from PlayStation games past and present (check out IGN’s feature, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/astro-bot-every-playstation-character-easter-eggs"><u>Astro Bot: Every PlayStation Character - Easter Eggs</u></a>, for more). Iconic Final Fantasy characters are conspicuous by their absence, however — an omission fans were quick to pick up on in the context of Final Fantasy's long-standing association with PlayStation. That means no Cloud from Final Fantasy 7, or any other character from the famous role-playing franchise.</p><p>So why did Final Fantasy characters fail to make it into Astro Bot? Neither Sony nor Square Enix has properly commented yet, and in a new interview, the chief developer of the game itself danced around the question.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>All 173 PlayStation Characters in Astro Bot - Easter Eggs</h3></div></output><p><a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/astro-bot-playstation-icons-shadow-of-the-colossus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Game File</a> asked Nicolas Doucet, the head of the game’s Tokyo-based studio, Team Asobi, about Cloud’s absence from Astro Bot. According to Doucet, Team Asobi had hoped to get Cloud in the game, but didn’t manage to for some reason.</p><p>“It's difficult to comment on that,” Doucet said, before adding: “We really respect the choice of each publisher.”</p><p>That comment suggests it was Square Enix’s call to keep Cloud from Astro Bot (IGN has asked Square Enix for comment), which fans are already calling an odd call, especially when you consider the PlayStation exclusivity Final Fantasy has signed on for in recent years. <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-remake">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a> launched as a PlayStation 4 exclusive in 2020 before hitting PS5 in 2021, then PC later that year.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/how-bioware-finally-got-dragon-age-to-the-finish-line-after-a-tumultuous-decade<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Anticipation was running high within BioWare when Andrew Wilson and Laura Miele, two of EA’s top executives, visited the studio in 2023. They were there to see the latest Dragon Age, which had been in development in one form or another for nearly a decade. It was a chance to show that after struggling through the releases of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/20/mass-effect-andromeda-review">Mass Effect: Andromeda</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/02/21/anthem-review">Anthem</a>, BioWare was finally back on the right track.</p><p>The story of their visit came up more than once in our visit to BioWare for September’s IGN First. Director Corinne Busche, who was conducting the demo, remembers rehearsing for “hours and hours” to make sure she got everything right.  </p><p>“I knew the content like the back of my hand and everything was going so well. But of course we get to the live demo with Andrew Wilson and Laura Miele in the room, and as soon as I fight a Pride Demon I get walloped right off the edge and down into a pit and die,” Busche laughs. “And he turns and looks at me and goes, ‘Well, at least your load times are great.’”</p><p>It was an embarrassing moment for Busche, but in its own way, a victory. At that time, the game that would become Dragon Age: The Veilguard was less than three years removed from a major reset, shifting from the skeleton of a multiplayer game with repeatable quests, a tech base, and the outline of a story, to a full-blown single-player RPG. In that time, BioWare had effectively torn Dragon Age down to the studs, implementing a brand-new battle system along with a host of new content. It was a striking turnaround for a game that at one point looked like it might never release at all. </p><p>To cap off our IGN First coverage for Dragon Age: The Veilguard, we’re going to take you inside BioWare on the eve of a major milestone in its history. In the course of reporting on this story, I spent two days at BioWare, played hours of Dragon Age, and had a lengthy sitdown interview with Studio General Manager Gary McKay. Here’s what I found.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/29/da-ign-first-bioware-prof-illo1-1727572709022.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>BioWare GM Gary McKay is unassuming when you first meet him. He’s older than the average game developer, favors plaid button-ups, and likes to talk about hockey. Hockey comes up a lot around BioWare, actually – it is based in Canada, after all. The studio resides in one of the handful of high-rises overlooking Edmonton’s downtown core, which is dominated by the arena that serves as the home of the Edmonton Oilers. It's appropriate — hockey fans can tell you all about how the Oilers, who enjoyed a dominating stretch in the 1980s, and are now haunted by ghosts of their own. </p><p>McKay is the one to give a tour around the current studio space, which opened in late 2019 – just in time for the COVID-19 pandemic to upend onsite work. Like so many other studios, BioWare is a clean, minimalist space identifiable as a game studio mainly by the various trinkets from its past – a Javelin suit from Anthem in the lobby, a Morrigan statue in the window looking down on the Oilers arena, replicas of weapons and helmets from Mass Effect and Dragon Age – with meeting rooms with names like “Jade Empire.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/29/bioware-statues-1727573690169.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>In the lobby at BioWare. Photo credit: Kat Bailey.</figcaption></figure></output><p>In a studio so steeped in history, McKay is a relative newcomer. He took over as BioWare General Manager in the wake of Casey Hudson’s second departure after stops at Disney, Marvel, and numerous other studios; in his 25 years career, he worked on <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/def-jam-vendetta">Def Jam Vendetta</a>, Turok, and an RPG that was apparently based on the metal group Iron Maiden. He preaches order and a commitment to quality in a studio that at times has been compared to a pirate ship and has experienced a worrying amount of crunch in its history.</p><p>“I certainly read a lot of the same stories you did,” McKay says. “I feel like we've brought a little order to the chaos without stifling any creativity.” </p><p>McKay inherited a studio that in many respects was not in great shape. In the span between 2017 and 2020, BioWare cycled between multiple GMs as several of its most prominent creators departed. Lead writer David Gaider exited in 2016. Mike Laidlaw, one of Dragon Age’s chief architects, left BioWare in 2017. Former GM Aaryn Flynn left to start his own studio and released Nightingale. Casey Hudson left, came back, and then left again.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I certainly read a lot of the same stories you did. I feel like we've brought a little order to the chaos without stifling any creativity</p></div><p>In 2020, Dragon Age had yet to enter alpha and was coming out of a period of experimenting with its implementation of multiplayer. Since the release of Inquisition in 2014, BioWare's Dragon Age team had been pulled away multiple times to try and save different projects that were in trouble, <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-past-and-present-of-dragon-age-4-1833913351" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">canceled at least one version of the sequel</a>, and pivoted to multiplayer. It was the type of development hell that has killed many other projects, or at least badly damaged their quality. In the meantime, the COVID-19 pandemic hit, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-the-coronavirus-pandemic-has-affected-game-developers">upending the entire games industry</a>.</p><p>It was in this period that BioWare began laying the foundation that would shape its course for the next several years. </p><p>“[Dragon Age] was really focused on some pretty clear decisions we needed to make, such as multiplayer, which we decided not to pursue for all the good reasons. And when I think about the state, I think about, ‘What is it that we wanted to do with this game?’ And it was really about going back to our roots and what we're great at, which is single-player hero fantasy games, obviously set in the world of Dragon Age around incredible storytelling. Characters that just jump out at you in the game,” McKay says. </p><p>“I mean, the characters in this game… you're filled with love and loss and complex choices, and so, we really wanted to make sure that we are coming back to the heart. So it's not a multiplayer game, it's not micro-transactions, it's an offline game. These are all the things that we really wanted to return to what we feel would be a successful game.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>To that end, BioWare revealed in early 2021 that it was <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/anthem-development-ceases-bioware-to-focus-on-dragon-age-mass-effect">abandoning the development of Anthem Next</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-4-will-reportedly-be-a-single-player-rpg-with-no-multiplayer">pivoting Dragon Age back to being a single-player RPG</a> and handing the reins to Busche, with former co-leads Mark Darrah and Matt Goldman both opting to leave the company (Darrah would later return as a consultant). Busche, a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-dragon-age-the-veilguard-the-sims-character-creator-ign">veteran designer with an eye for systems</a>, set about overhauling Dragon Age’s combat and progression.</p><p>“Of course, as a multiplayer concept, the battle system at that time was oriented around, ‘What is it like to play with other players?’ And as you can imagine, things like companions weren't nearly as at the forefront as they are now. Your coordination was around other players. So when we went back to our roots, we looked at what worked really well around teamwork, companions, the deep, rich RPG strategies,” she says.</p><p>Was it a complete reboot? McKay says no. “No, I don't see it as a reboot. No, I don't see it that way at all. I saw it more about making sure that we are laser-focused on leveraging and leaning into the things that we see as success, things we've had success in, and learning from those things that we saw some challenges in. And just making sure that we obviously learn from them, we grow from them, and then lean into our successes. So, I never personally saw it as a reboot, no.”</p><p>Busche largely agrees, " In game development, a large part of your initial efforts are your tech stack, the underlying foundations that drive the game. We'd also learned a lot about how to work within Frostbite, so the nice thing about doing a pivot like this is you're not coming in from square one, and our wonderful narrative writing team had an outline in place of what this story was going to be already. We'd done some of the voice casting already. So those bones still exist today, but from the structure of the game, going to an offline RPG, combat system complete rework, the progression systems are so rich now. That was all from the ground up."</p><p>So even if The Veilguard wasn’t a reboot, it was at least a reset – not just for Dragon Age, but for the studio itself. McKay acknowledges the challenge of pivoting from multiplayer to single-player, saying that this was the moment that the “rubber really hit the road” for the studio. It had spent years trying to make multiplayer games. Now it was getting back to what it was good at.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/29/da-ign-first-bioware-prof-illo2-1727572763370.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Reminders of BioWare’s early days are everywhere. Darrah, who returned to consult on The Veilguard in 2023, has been around in one capacity or another since the late 1990s. He remembers having to build his own desk after joining BioWare work on Baldur’s Gate as a programmer.</p><p>“It was definitely a time of a lot of people who didn't know any better making games,” Darrah says. “And I think there's a power in that because honestly at the time, RPGs, at least Western RPGs, were kind of considered to be a dead genre or a dying genre, and so a team that didn't know any better was able to make something that otherwise a more experienced team might've not even tried to make.”</p><p>Over the span of almost 20 years, BioWare went on a remarkable run in which it created a succession of RPGs that are now considered stone cold classics: <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2010/01/22/ign-presents-the-history-of-bioware">Baldur’s Gate, Neverwinter Nights, KOTOR, Mass Effect, and Dragon Age</a>. In that time, BioWare became known for its distinctive house style – a mix of romance and humor, deep world-building and memorable characters. It built BioWare a devoted fanbase that it retains to this day.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Every IGN BioWare Game Review</h3></div></output><p>“What BioWare does best is telling stories through characters,” Darrah says. ”That's always been a strength. But I don't think that we really said it out loud to ourselves and really focused on that kind of storytelling. And when we forgot about it, sometimes we got it anyway, but sometimes we didn't, and that's when our storytelling didn't live up to expectations."</p><p>Darrah is one of several longtime BioWare veterans who have had a say in The Veilguard’s development. Creative Director John Epler, meanwhile, got his start on Sonic Chronicles and the Dark Brotherhood and has worked on <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-in-order">every Dragon Age since Origins</a>. Working as a cinematic designer on Inquisition, Epler remembers Gaider telling him, “‘[Dragon Age] is a story about people. It's a series about people.’ And for us that's always kind of been the north star that we've kept to. It's about the characters more than anything else. That's the most interesting part of the games of the stories that we tell.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Even when we were still more multiplayer-focused, we did still want to tell a story about Solas</p></div><p>Storytelling comes up again and again at BioWare, which is home to some of gaming’s most beloved tales. But as BioWare started to shift toward multiplayer, it got away from this core strength. In 2023, Gaider went as far as to claim that writers had become “<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/former-dragon-age-narrative-lead-says-writers-became-quietly-resented-at-bioware"><u>quietly resented at BioWare” up until the point that he had left in 2016</u></a>. Hudson assured worried fans that the multiplayer version of Dragon Age would have a story in 2019, but behind the scenes, it wasn’t much more than an outline</p><p>“It definitely would have had its challenges,” Epler says. “One thing that always comes up is world state. How do I know if I'm playing with my friend? Do I need to wait for them to catch up? Are they making their own decisions? But even when we were still more multiplayer-focused, we did still want to tell a story about Solas. It just became a lot more challenging because, again, multiplayer games and single-player games have different pressures, have different needs as a project, as a story. And once you add other people's perspectives into it, it becomes even more challenging.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Dragon Age: The Veilguard - 15 Exclusive Screenshots Taken Using Photo Mode</h3></div></output><p>In the wake of the reset, BioWare set about fleshing out The Veilguard’s story, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-dragon-age-the-veilguard-grapples-with-the-series-wildly-expansive-lore-and-your-choices-in-it">layering in reams of lore</a> while building out each companion’s arc. As the keeper of the various reference docs containing Dragon Age’s dense history, Epler says he has no shortage of material. “If you told me to write spec for five more Dragon Age games, I could probably come up with that in a couple of weeks because I'm always thinking about Dragon Age,” he says.</p><p>The Veilguard has been compared against Dragon Age: Origins, which tends to be seen as the game that bridges <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2009/11/04/dragon-age-origins-review">BioWare’s CRPG past with its present</a>. Epler, who worked on Origins himself, acknowledges that its darkness and tragedy has “always been part of Dragon Age’s DNA” but also says that wasn’t all that it was. “Something that I think we occasionally lose sight of is Dragon Age: Origins also had moments of levity. You have Alistair kind of comes across as a goofball. There's a lot of funny moments with Dog. And I think it's that contrast that Origins did that we really lean into in the Veilguard. There are characters who are a little bit lighter. But even they have tragedy. They have moments of personal despair.</p><p>“Because I think if you just, again, lean super hard into everything being grim all the time, nothing good ever happens, it becomes fatiguing. You kind of lose the sense of impact. You need that contrast between the higher moments, the lighter moments, and dark moments. Because that’s life. Life is not just a series of unending tragedies or a series of unending triumphs. It's a contrast of both and that's how the despair, how the tragedies hit harder.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I think Baldur's Gate 3 silenced some of the naysayers</p></div><p>But while fans tend to focus on the ways they're different, there are some unexpected ways in which they are the same. Stylized as it is, The Veilguard is also plenty violent, even if its characters aren't constantly spattered in blood like Origins. That's at least partly down to McKay, who half-jokingly says that he wants that "visceral, emotional response when you see some blood."</p><p>Within BioWare, McKay has apparently become known as the "more blood guy," periodically leaning in and wondering why one scene or another isn't just a bit more violent. Busche laughs, "I'll never forget when we got the medical triage center stood up, Gary says, 'Wow, this looks really great, but could you zoom in on that cot there – shouldn't this guy be bleeding a lot more.'"</p><p>Gary nods, "When you play it and see the blood, you'll think, 'That's the thing Gary was all over.'"</p><p>In the meantime, there are also the comparisons that Dragon Age is drawing against Baldur’s Gate 3 – a defiantly old-school RPG that suddenly emerged to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-has-made-90-million-for-hasbro">become a massive hit</a> en route to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-review">winning multiple Game of the Year awards</a>. The histories of Baldur's Gate and Dragon Age are intertwined, with the latter originally starting as a modernized version of BioWare's formative hit. BioWare even tried to create Baldur’s Gate 3 itself back in the 2000s, only for it to be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kEV_YnDkXk&amp;t=121s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>canceled due to an accounting error</u></a> in one of gaming history’s stranger what-ifs.</p><p>BioWare’s reaction is to treat Baldur’s Gate 3’s emergence as a net positive. To The Veilguard’s team, it’s more proof that getting back to the studio’s original strengths was the right move. “Yeah, I didn't really feel that earthquake in terms of people being worried about it. I think what I really saw last year more than anything was a renaissance in the RPG genre,” Darrah says. “Last year was arguably the strongest year we've ever seen in terms of RPGs. Not only do we have [Baldur’s Gate 3], we also had Hogwarts, we also had Starfield, we had tons of RPGs come out last year that covered a really wide swath of what an RPG can be.”</p><p>He adds, optimistically, “I think it silenced some of the naysayers. It didn't cause a massive shift in the way The Veilguard was being developed, but I think it made some people who maybe were thinking, ‘Well, we should really be making action games because action games sell 10 million copies and RPGs sell 6 million copies,’ and silenced those voices.”</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/29/da-ign-first-bioware-prof-illo3-1727572829293.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>In Dragon Age lore, the Crossroads is a dimension between the Fade and Thedas that is filled with magical mirrors called Eluvians. Along its paths are reflections and glimpses into the past. It’s only appropriate that this shimmering world in-between should feature so heavily in The Veilguard, as BioWare is at its own version of a crossroads.</p><p>Everyone knew what was at stake when EA’s top executives flew up to Edmonton in 2023. Dragon Age was finally making progress, but BioWare had a lot to prove. The development team set up four televisions with demos featuring different areas of the game in a small room called Neverwinter Nights and collectively held its breath.</p><p>McKay’s frames the response to the demo this way: “Unbelievable excitement…We spent a full day with him and Laura. And the excitement in Andrew's eyes. The excitement that he was portraying in the meetings was infectious. I know this seems – maybe it doesn't seem so weird – but he inspired us in how he was excited about what he saw, what he thought this is going to unlock for BioWare…again, getting us back to the success that we've had in the past.”</p><p>One way or another, the sense of relief within the studio after the demo was palpable. But hard times were still to come. The same month that Baldur’s Gate 3 released, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioware-eliminates-50-jobs-to-match-studios-changing-needs"><u>BioWare laid off around 50 workers</u></a>, including longtime veterans like narrative designer Mary Kirby, who had been with BioWare since Dragon Age’s inception and was, in the words of Gaider, “Varric’s creator, Mistress of the Qunari, Writer of the Chant.” It was Kirby who wrote Lucanis, The Veilguard’s resident assassin. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>At a higher level, the layoffs came amid an internal shakeup at EA that effectively resulted in it being split into sports and everything else. That summer, rumors spread within BioWare that it was about to be acquired. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-the-old-republic-development-third-party-bioware"><u>Star Wars: The Old Republic was allowed to go third-party</u></a>, ostensibly so that BioWare could focus on Mass Effect and Dragon Age (McKay won’t comment on the status of Mass Effect, but most rumors suggest that it’s still early in development).</p><p>BioWare, it should be said, has long had an interesting relationship with parent company EA. Kotaku’s 2019 report about the state of Dragon Age mentions the sense within BioWare that they are the “weirdos” within a publisher known for its sports games and shooters. EA Sports FC and Madden are what fuel EA, adding billions of dollars to its bottomline. They bring in the kind of revenue that can make even very successful games look like rounding errors.</p><p>McKay, for his part, waves away suggestions that BioWare is a mismatch for EA’s portfolio, saying that it “couldn’t be further from the truth” and that EA has been supportive of the studio’s efforts. “I feel that we've had the full support and when you think about the support in terms of giving us the time to deliver on the creative promise of what we wanted to do, we've had 100% support from EA. And we don't even look at it as EA and BioWare necessarily. We've got that support, and there's other titles that are making interesting RPGs as well, and so I don't see it as something separate or something that we're carrying the torch. I just see it as having an incredible support group to allow us to deliver on the promise of what we want to do.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There's a lot at stake, at least, in meeting the expectations of fans</p></div><p>BioWare’s rollercoaster ride continued through Dragon Age’s reveal in 2024. Reactions to the initial reveal trailer were negative, sending the studio scrambling to release an early gameplay tease just days later to placate fans. The name change from Dreadwolf to The Veilguard wasn’t particularly well-received either. After that, though, impressions were generally very positive. My colleague Alex Stedman wrote in her first <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-exclusive-first-hands-on-preview"><u>hands-on preview</u></a>, “After hours of hands-on time spread across two days, I’m pleased to say I walked away with excitement and curiosity, but mostly, relief to wave many of my concerns goodbye.” These <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/dragon-age/the-veilguard-preview-hands-on/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>sentiments were echoed elsewhere</u></a>, with many critics praising its polish – a miracle given the state of Dragon Age in late 2020.</p><p>When I ask Ampere analyst Anna Kerr her expectations, she says she doesn’t have specific data for Dragon Age: The Veilguard, but that overall interest in the series has spiked since its reveal. She notes that June saw about 480K MAUs across Steam, Xbox, and PlayStation, which she rates as positive for a series that saw its last release in 2014. She also says RPGs have been the second most popular genre across PlayStation, Xbox, and Steam in 2024.</p><p>As for how important Dragon Age: The Veilguard is for BioWare, she says, “I can't really say without knowing other factors that are only internal, I assume, but obviously there's a lot of passion and love for the Dragon Age series and for BioWare. Fans have high expectations around really any product they deliver. And so it's a question of whether they deliver that with the length of development time and this being another major entry in a beloved franchise. There's a lot at stake, at least, in meeting the expectations of fans.”</p><p>No matter how it turns out, BioWare is lucky to be putting out a game at all. History is littered with games that get mired in conflicting visions, get rebooted, and sometimes never make it out at all. Now, McKay says hopefully, "I think we're on the doorstep of something pretty amazing."</p><p>When Dragon Age: The Veilguard releases on October 31, one quest will finally end. Another may be about to begin.</p><p><em>Kat Bailey is IGN's News Director as well as co-host of Nintendo Voice Chat. Have a tip?

Those who use Thrall's voice navigation will get to hear the Orc leader describe making a U-turn as "a clever strategy to fool any pursuers on our tail" or offer his wisdom that being stuck in heavy traffic is "not the end of the world."</p>

Sources told Bloomberg that Gary and Sanchez's clash stemmed from the former (and others) thinking the latter was "cozying up" to Ellison.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Two unnamed female staffers alleged that Sanchez made unwanted advances towards them at the time, which made them uncomfortable.

			<p>Many years after the original announcement of No More Room in Hell 2, the game is finally about to launch in early access, having recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-more-room-in-hell-2-early-access-starts-october-22/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> the October 22 date - just in time for Halloween. Chivalry studio Torn Banner acquired Lever Games and <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-more-room-in-hell-2-resurfaces-3-5-years-later-early-access-launch-slated-for-halloween/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is bringing the project to completion</a> at last.</p>
<p>At Gamescom 2024, I chatted with Kenneth Bourgon, Marketing Manager at Torn Banner Studio, about how the developer became interested in No More Room in Hell 2. Bourgon also outlined the current and future content plans.</p>
<p><iframe title="No More Room in Hell 2 | Early Access Date Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/F62dQidOOJM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Talk to me about No More Room in Hell 2. I know Torn Banner didn't make the first one, right? Why did you think of this game?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, the first one was created by Lever Games in 2009. It was the first ever Half-Life 2 Source mod, a pure passion project. It was like 10 to 20 developers that worked on it, and then 9 million players played the game. Later on, when they started working on the second one, their dynamics all changed for the most part, like the amount of time that they had to invest out of university on the first game just wasn't the same on the second.</p>
<p>At the same time, Matt 'Maxx' Khazan, who led the project, was working his day job at Torn Banner, so he started talking to our CEO, Steve Piggott. What happened was they started realizing that the original Chivalry also started as a Source mod, and they felt like there was a real shared heritage between the two. What ended up happening is that most of the people working on the Lever Games project for No More Room in Hell 2 came to Torn Banner. So a lot of the people that were working on the original are with us now, still working on the second game, and it just felt right. It felt right that it was a studio in Toronto, a bunch of developers who knew and loved the game, and a genre that we were really interested in going in.</p>
<p><strong>This sequel is a bit different from the first one, right? It's an open world, after all.</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, there's a few differences. First, we want the same feel as the first game, so it is a slower, methodical, strategic zombie game. But it is open world, and there are a couple of changes. In the first game, it was all linear levels, and you're always trying to escape the zombie apocalypse.</p>
<p>In No More Room in Hell 2, we kind of flip that around. It's an open world, and as a player, what you're doing is at the center of this map, there's a power plant that's going down. What you're trying to do is get to it and turn it back on. It's an 8-player co-op game. One of the really interesting parts is that you're going to start out by yourself on the exterior of the map, all by yourself in the dark, with a flashlight, a small weapon, and a dream. You're going to make your way towards the center of the map, and as you do, there's many of what we call places of interest around the map.</p>
<p>Each of these has a similar objective of turning the power back on. It's all done via puzzle-like objectives, so you have to decide who's doing the puzzles and who's defending against the zombies. As the power comes back on, you're going to create a beacon for players who haven't found anyone yet. They're going to see that this place has its lights on, there's people there, it's safety and they're going to make their way towards it.</p>
<p><strong>Will there be an in-game map?</strong></p>
<p>There is, I believe, going to be an in-game map, but we really wanted to keep the user interface as small and as little as possible. The first game was really well-known for its realism, and with this one, we're trying to keep the UI and us to an absolute minimum and have players use their tools around the map. We're going to have proximity chat, and then we'll have a buddy-up system, where if you do meet some players, you can buddy up with them.</p>
<p>We really want people playing the game with the headphones if possible, as the experience is meant to be scary and then slowly build up into something that's maybe a bit more fast-paced.</p>
<p><strong>No More Room in Hell 2 certainly sounds different from the usual zombie game. For instance, I recently played Killing Floor 3, which is round-based and highly fast-paced.</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, the idea behind this really is your slower burn zombie game. The first game was made purely as a love letter to video games, zombie games, and Romero movies. Our goal for this game is to really make the player feel like they can go into their very own zombie movie from the 80s, 90s, 2000s, and for us, the most important part was pacing.</p>
<p>As I mentioned, you start out slower and alone, maybe with more fear, and then as you make your way to the center of the map, the game should change, and by the end of it, when you're 8 players in the power plants, it should build up to be a lot more fast-paced, but we really do want pacing that makes this game always feel like you're moving on to the next thing. In the 30-minute session, you actually get quite a bit.</p>
<p><strong>I suppose that once you get to the power plant, you will fight off a horde of zombies while waiting to be extracted with a helicopter or something like that.</strong></p>
<p>Yeah. At the power plant especially, you're hoping you have as many players as possible because it has a similar kind of puzzle-like objective where you're trying to get that power plant back on, but the power plant is so large, you're going from kind of building to building doing these puzzles. You do have to wait for a helicopter to come and pick you guys up. I think that, again, it goes back to the pacing of the game and making sure that you get a little bit of everything as you play this game and you leave with that intensity that I think as Torn Banner we feel really good at.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'Our goal with this game is to create a sandbox-ish scenario. What I mean by that is that you should have multiple ways of solving the problems. For each of our main objectives, there should be multiple different ways of going in and doing what you want to do. So, we want to give our players as many tools as possible. Stealth is definitely going to be an aspect of that. Players should be able to decide how they want to move around, especially at the beginning, when you're alone alone with next to nothing, stealth is probably your best choice.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Is there an element of stealth in No More Room in Hell 2? Can you sneak behind zombies to take them out if you want?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. Our goal with this game is to create a sandbox-ish scenario. What I mean by that is that you should have multiple ways of solving the problems. For each of our main objectives, there should be multiple different ways of going in and doing what you want to do. So, we want to give our players as many tools as possible. Stealth is definitely going to be an aspect of that. Players should be able to decide how they want to move around, especially at the beginning, when you're alone alone with next to nothing, stealth is probably your best choice, and then things change throughout.</p>
<p><strong>Is noise a factor, too, in that you may risk attracting a lot of zombies?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, we also have a zombie type in our game that is there to cause a lot of noise, which is a lot of fun. That is something that is definitely going to throw a bit of a shake to people's plans. And yes, overall, we have cars with alarms we have. You're going to have to be very careful about how you go through the map.</p>
<p><strong>Can you use it to your own advantage sometimes with environmental traps?</strong></p>
<p>That's exactly what we're hoping for. These things have two sides of a coin, where if you're not planning it, it's probably a bad thing. But you do see how siphoning zombies in certain locations and driving them away from others could be useful. We really want players to have a lot of options in how they deal with the situation.</p>
<p><strong>Do you plan to also have a text chat in the game?</strong></p>
<p>Text chat, lobbies, friends. A lot of this stuff we've done in the past banner with Chivalry.</p>
<p><strong>Can you start a session of No More Room in Hell 2 with a full group of friends if you have enough of them?</strong></p>
<p>You start the game with 8 people, so it will always get filled to 8 people. The game is supposed to be quite difficult. The idea behind it is it's not easy to survive. Our game also has permadeath, which we're very excited about. We think a zombie apocalypse game and permadeath should go really hand in hand, so playing the game with anything less than 8 people to start would feel extremely tough, if not impossible, to finish.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have bots filling the group whenever there aren't enough players to start a match?</strong></p>
<p>No, no, no. We think with 8 players, we should be fairly good. We have a lot of excitement around the game, which is awesome. So, there will be no bots in the game; it should just be humans.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'You start the game with 8 people, so it will always get filled to 8 people. The game is supposed to be quite difficult. The idea behind it is it's not easy to survive. I think internally, we're looking for characters that last three to five rounds. We want to normalize the death of characters. This is an apocalyptic game. What's really going to be fun is you could go back to the start and pick a brand new direction or character and then build out that one.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>I'm guessing you pick your character before entering the game, correct? How do they differ from each other?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, it's very different, actually, from the first game. With permadeath, we also have a roguelike character system. When you get into the game for the first time, you're going to choose one of three characters, and those characters have special abilities. There are a ton of other characters; you're just going to see three options at first. As you go from round to round, if you level up after a game, you will have a roguelike mechanics where you can choose which direction you want to go with your character. As they grow, they're going to get better and stronger and faster, and then they're probably eventually going to die. I think internally, we're looking for characters that last three to five rounds.</p>
<p>We want to normalize the death of characters. This is an apocalyptic game. What's really going to be fun is you could go back to the start and pick a brand new direction or character and then build out that one. It's very unique for our game.</p>
<p><strong>With permadeath, players also want some kind of persistent progression to offset that constant loss of character progression.</strong></p>
<p>We have character progression and account progression. We're not talking a lot about account progression just yet, but yes, we don't want players to feel burned at the end of a character dying, right? You don't want them to feel like they've just lost everything. So we have the two. As your account progresses, you're going to get really interesting things from that. We're just not ready to talk about the specifics just yet.</p>
<p><strong>Did you announce the premium business model? Can you talk about the price point?</strong></p>
<p>We're looking at a roughly $30 price point for the game. It'll follow the business model of Chivalry, where we will be dropping more content throughout. It won't be dropped as DLC, it'll be dropped as just content to keep people coming back into the game. It's very important to us.</p>
<p>It's different from the first game, but we see a really strong value point in early access, around $30. The price would probably increase slightly from then to 1.0, but roughly $10 more.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have an estimate on how long it will take from early access to 1.0?</strong></p>
<p>We don't want to spend more than a year in early access, so that would be the maximum amount of time. We plan on dropping a fair bit of content in that year. Gameplay features, weapons, zombie types, and maybe a map. We really want that early access period to be a period of content.</p>
<p><strong>What about console plans for No More Room in Hell 2?</strong></p>
<p>Nothing to announce on consoles just yet, but we want the game to be in as many hands as possible. For early access, it's all streamlined towards PC, but thanks to Chivalry, we have a really great relationship with companies like Xbox. It's something that we're not announcing officially, we don't have a date for anything, we don't officially know if it's going to happen, but getting the game in as many hands as possible is extremely important to us.</p>
<p><strong>Are you using Unreal Engine 5?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah. We're really lucky, I think. In our group of developers, we have a lot of very, very technical people who go deep into what they can do with UE5, whether that's Nanite or the different lighting tools. There's just a lot of technical wizards who are making the most out of the engine.</p>
<p><strong>Unreal Engine 5 games tend to be very beautiful, but they can also be quite demanding in terms of performance.</strong></p>
<p>We're working a lot on that currently. Optimization is starting to be the team's main focus, so it's definitely at the forefront of our minds. We want this game to run as smoothly as possible for everybody.</p>

<p><strong>Are you going to do some kind of beta test before early access?</strong></p>
<p>We really wanted to. We wanted to do a demo here, but we thought about how much bandwidth and team cost it would take to invest in that. What we really want to do is make sure that our early access build is the best it can be, so the investment's going entirely to that.</p>
<p><strong>You mentioned post-launch updates. What kind of content additions can people expect?</strong></p>
<p>A little bit of everything. Gameplay features. We have a couple that we can't talk about, but we're very, very excited about, the kind of core gameplay features that should have a really strong effect on how people play the game. The maps, weapons, zombie types, a little bit of everything. Cosmetics, eventually. The early access build doesn't have a cosmetic system, but that will be a part of the game later. Of course, nothing that you can purchase will be attached to gameplay.</p>
<p><strong>How long has No More Room in Hell 2 been in development?</strong></p>
<p>Well, it's been in development for a very long time. The Lever Game studio technically started working on this game in 2014, so 10 years of development, but it's been at Torn Banner now for just about two years. The game took a huge growth spurt when Torn Banner purchased it. It went from a bunch of people working on the game on their side time to a studio of 150 developers, mostly currently working on No More Room in Hell 2. It's been two years of production at Torn Banner, during which the game had this huge growth.</p>
<p><strong>I guess that means Chivalry 2 is no longer getting new content in the future.</strong></p>
<p>We announced that the last update was our last content update. We want the game to last as long as possible, so we will have patch updates and bug fixes. But other than that, Chivalry 2 is currently in a sort of soft sunset.</p>
<p><strong>Chivalry 2 <a href="https://wccftech.com/chivalry-2-interview-game-of-thrones/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched as an Epic Games Store exclusive on PC</a>, but the same won't apply to No More Room in Hell 2. Can you talk about this difference?</strong></p>
<p>I think the Epic Games Store decision worked well for Chivalry 2, but with maybe the added context of the amount of players that play No More Room in Hell 1 and the amount of people that are waiting for this game, I think for us it was crucial to get this into as many hands as we can as possible from early access.</p>
<p><strong>Since the first game was basically a mod, will you support mods for this one?</strong></p>
<p>Not at the early access launch, as we're really focusing on the base game. It's not something that's in production currently. That is not to say that it would never happen, but nothing's on the plans just yet.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

<p>Nexon, the studio behind the popular indie title Dave The Diver — which was technically developed by subsidiary Mintrocket — has announced that it has made a “small number” of layoffs to staff in its American offices.</p>



<p>According to the company, in a statement sent to <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/nexon-america-is-making-layoffs-to-pursue-exciting-ip-growth-strategy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Game Developer</a> (GD), the layoffs are part of a company “reorganization plan that will enable the formation of a new Western Development Group”. It all comes as a part of their new “long-term IP growth strategy”.</p>







<p>“A key element of the initiative is hyperlocalization–a strategy for hiring teams to adapt our games to match the tastes of local players in large markets like Europe and North Americ,” the statement provided to GD reads. “A big step in this process is the establishment of the Western Development Group here in Los Angeles, led by Nexon veteran Hanbyeol Oh.”</p>



<p>They continued, “Unfortunately, the re-organization includes the elimination of a small number of roles, with severance offered to those leaving. However, Nexon America is now hiring to fill out the new development team, including engineers and designers. It’s an exciting time at Nexon America and we look forward to sharing more on our plan.”</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Nexon for clarification on the layoffs, including the number of employees being let go. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story.</p>



<p>There have been <a href="http://gaminglayoffs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nearly 13,000 known jobs</a> lost in 2024 within the gaming industry. That’s over 2,000 more so far than the roughly 10,500 jobs lost in 2023. </p>

                <p>Gaming companies haven't exactly been shy about putting ads in games before, but Sony is now changing how they work on the PS5 dashboard. What was once the home of beautiful game art now has ads directly integrated into the user interface on the dashboard, and there doesn't seem to be any way to disable the ads short of unplugging the PS5 from the internet.</p><p>The ads appear to be linked to the official news feed for the games in question. For example, when the latest Spider-Man game was pulled up at the GameSpot office, the ad that came up was for a roundtable video featuring the creative team of Spider-Man 2 and and Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse.

                <p dir="ltr">Bethesda has launched a substantial new update for Starfield today, coinciding with the release of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/starfield-shattered-space-official-launch-trailer/2300-6465253/">Shattered Space</a>, the game's first paid expansion. The expansion costs $30 (or $27 with a Game Pass subscription), and it arrives alongside a free patch that offers a variety of improvements and fixes for all players, regardless of whether they purchase the DLC. Bethesda provided a <a href="https://x.com/BethesdaStudios/status/1840775449514815736" rel="nofollow ">detailed list of changes included in the update</a>, as well as <a href="https://bethesda.net/en/game/starfield/article/7fHSb8gfxJEE9UZLBkfKWg/prepare-for-the-launch-of-shattered-space">the expansion content</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Shattered Space introduces new quests, weapons, and items, and allows players to explore Va'Ruun’kai, home to the followers of the Great Serpent. Major sections of this world have been handcrafted, and the expansion includes survival-horror elements, with new enemies described as "stalking abominations." Bethesda compares this expansion to previous add-ons for its Elder Scrolls and Fallout series, offering a contained story with distinct mechanics and new gameplay options.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1l54t9VcTM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/M1l54t9VcTM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The update also addresses multiple issues reported by players. Version 1.14.70 includes tweaks to several problematic quests, adjustments to the REV-8 land vehicle introduced in the previous update, and improvements to the ship-building system. Other fixes target the game's user interface and audio. Bethesda also released PC specifications for Shattered Space, outlining the minimum and recommended requirements to ensure the expansion runs smoothly.</p><p><span>For more, check out </span><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-start-starfield-dlc-shattered-space/1100-6526794/">our guide on how to start the Shattered Space DLC</a><span>.
