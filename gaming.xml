  <p id="tsuU1h">When <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22796464/expanse-leviathan-falls-final-book-excerpt"><em>Leviathan Falls</em></a><em> </em>hit bookstores in November 2021, James S.A. Corey — aka authors Daniel Abraham and Ty Franck — <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22816216/expanse-leviathan-falls-ending-james-sa-corey-interview">made it very clear to Polygon</a>: The Expanse series was over. Fans could be sad, but not really blame them; after 10 years, well over 5,000 pages, and a hit Syfy/Prime Video TV adaptation, a universe had been effectively spun. The duo had “told the story [they] wanted to tell.” There were new sagas to write, though — as evidenced by <a href="https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/james-s-a-corey/the-mercy-of-gods/9780316525572/"><em>The Mercy of Gods</em></a>.</p>
<p id="ryELvc">The first in a new series, the Captive’s War trilogy, Corey’s <em>The Mercy of Gods</em> tells the story of an alien invasion, the enslavement of a human population, and a scientist’s assistant, Dafyd Alkhor, who stumbles into a deeper mystery. During a recent virtual event, Franck cheekily described the book as “the disappointing love child of Frank Herbert and Ursula Le Guin,” while Abraham said it was a total departure from the types of stories they were able to tell in the Expanse series. “It’s the story of living as a slave in a totalitarian regime,” he said. “How you stay true to — and even discover — yourself, how you compromise, how you serve the regime and how you can undermine it.”</p>
<p id="3L9Yrx">Like <em>Dune</em>, Franck said, the timeline supporting the Captive’s War trilogy goes back thousands and thousands of years, and seismic events that reshaped the universe are mere notes in a textbook to the players involved in the core drama. And it starts here: Read on for the entire first chapter of <em>The Mercy of Gods</em>, which arrives this August.</p>
<hr id="4T9Yip">
<p id="gc8Wl0">Later, at the end of things, Dafyd would be amazed at how many of the critical choices in his life seemed small at the time. How many overwhelming problems had, with the distance of time, proved trivial. Even when he sensed the gravity of a situation, he often attributed it to the wrong things. He dreaded going to the end-of-year celebration at the Scholar’s Common that last time. But not, as it turned out, for any of the reasons that actually mattered.</p>
<p id="hsWjIu">“You biologists are always looking for the starting point, asking the origin question, sure. But if you want to see origins,” the tall, lanky man at Dafyd’s side said, pointing a skewer of grilled pork and apple at his chest. Then, for a moment, the man drunkenly lost his place. “If you want to see origins, you have to look away from your microscopes. You have to look up.”</p>
<p id="TQ4FCU">“That’s true,” Dafyd agreed. He had no idea what the man was talking about, but it felt like he was being reprimanded.</p>
<p id="Cr0HaC">“Deep sensor arrays. We can make a telescope with a lens as wide as the planet. Effectively as wide as the planet. Wider, even. Not that I do that anymore. Near-field. That’s where I work now.”</p>
<p id="ETskEu">Dafyd made a polite sound. The tall man pulled a cube of pork off the skewer, and for a moment it looked like he’d drop it down into the courtyard. Dafyd imagined it landing in someone’s drink in the Common below.</p>
<p id="vVEuPp">After a moment, the tall man regained control of his food and popped it into his mouth. His voice box bobbed as he swallowed.</p>
<p id="DU3kpJ">“I’m studying a fascinating anomalous zone just at the edge of the heliosphere that’s barely a light-second wide. Do you have any idea how small that is for conventional telescopy?”</p>
<p id="KbdO0g">“I don’t,” Dafyd said. “Isn’t a light-second actually kind of big?”</p>
<p id="Fy6fpE">The tall man deflated. “Compared with the heliosphere, it’s really, really small.” He ate the rest of the food, chewing disconsolately, and put the skewer down on the handrail. He wiped his hand with a napkin before he extended it. “Llaren Morse. Near-field astronomic visualization at Dyan Academy. Good to meet you.”</p>
<p id="4vH0R5">Taking it meant clutching the man’s greasy fingers in his own. But more than that, it meant committing to the conversation. Pretending to see someone and making his excuses meant finding another way to pass his time. It seemed like a small choice. It seemed trivial.</p>
<p id="PbXRHk">“Dafyd,” he said, accepting the handshake. When Llaren Morse kept nodding, he added, “Dafyd Alkhor.”</p>
<p id="gR3NKi">Llaren Morse’s expression shifted. A small bunching between his eyebrows, his smile uncertain. “I feel like I should know that name. What projects have you run?”</p>
<p id="SBzJJF">“None. You’re probably thinking of my aunt. She’s in the funding colloquy.”</p>
<p id="rgLoMJ">Llaren Morse’s expression went professional and formal so quickly, Dafyd almost heard the click. “Oh. Yes, that’s probably it.”</p>
<p id="Y421ly">“We’re not actually involved in any of the same projects,” Dafyd said, half a beat too quickly. “I’m just putting in my time as a research assistant. Doing what I’m told. Keeping my head down.”</p>
<p id="DGp5Kp">Llaren Morse nodded and made a soft, noncommittal grunt, then stood there, caught between wanting to get out of the conversation and also to keep whatever advantage the nephew of a woman who controlled the funding purse strings might give him. Dafyd hoped that the next question wouldn’t be which project he was working for.</p>
<p id="jmfAEo">“Where are you in from, then?” Llaren Morse asked.</p>
<p id="rEd9Uy">“Right here. Irvian,” Dafyd said. “I actually walked from my apartments. I’m not really even here for the—” He gestured at the crowd below them and in the galleries and halls.</p>
<p id="QubnQs">“No?”</p>
<p id="VRurlG">“There’s a local girl I’m hoping to run into.”</p>
<p id="LZOomV">“And she’ll be here?”</p>
<p id="r2LqKK">“I’m hoping so,” Dafyd said. “Her boyfriend will.” He smiled like it was a joke. Llaren Morse froze and then laughed. It was a trick Dafyd had, disarming the truth by telling it slant. “What about you? You have someone back at home?”</p>
<p id="bYoQ2n">“Fiancée,” the tall man said.</p>
<p id="BZZTez">“Fiancée?” Dafyd echoed, keeping his voice playful and curious. They were almost past the part where Dafyd would need to say anything more about himself.</p>
<p id="5VuNK1">“Three years,” Llaren Morse said. “We’re looking to make it formal once I get a long-term placement.”</p>
<p id="TPTw26">“Long-term?”</p>
<p id="70rlgu">“The position at Dyan Academy is just a two-year placement. There’s no promise it’ll fund after that. I’m hoping for at least a five-year before we start putting real roots down.”</p>
<p id="mXnKXq">Dafyd sank his hands in his jacket pockets and leaned against the railing. “Sounds like stability’s really important for you.”</p>
<p id="AkukcO">“Yeah, sure. I don’t want to throw myself into a placement and then have it assigned out to someone else, you know? We put a lot of effort into things, and then as soon as you start getting results, some bigger fish comes in and swallows you.”</p>
<p id="uwFqt7">And they were off. Dafyd spent the next half hour echoing back everything Llaren Morse said, either with exact words or near synonyms, or else pulling out what Dafyd thought the man meant and offering it back. The subject moved from the academic intrigue of Dyan Academy to Llaren Morse’s parents and how they’d encouraged him into research, to their divorce and how it had affected him and his sisters.</p>
<p id="gcdg9I">The other man never noticed that Dafyd wasn’t offering back any information about himself.</p>
<p id="rgJSEj">Dafyd listened because he was good at listening. He had a lot of practice. It kept the spotlight off him, people broadly seemed more hungry to be heard than they knew, and usually by the end of it, they found themselves liking him. Which was convenient, even on those occasions when he didn’t find himself liking them back.</p>
<p id="ir4L3C">As Morse finished telling him about how his elder sister had avoided romantic entanglements with partners she actually liked, there was a little commotion in the courtyard below. Applause and laughter, and then there, in the center of the disturbance, Tonner Freis.</p>
<p id="E5xGDG">A year ago, Tonner had been one of the more promising research leads. Young, brilliant, demanding, with a strong intuition for the patterns that living systems fell into and growing institutional support. When Dafyd’s aunt had casually nudged Dafyd toward Tonner Freis by mentioning that he had potential, she’d meant that ten years down the line when he’d paid his dues and worked his way to the top, Freis would be the kind of man who could help the junior researchers from his team start their careers. A person Dafyd could attach himself to.</p>
<p id="3CwMEc">She hadn’t known that Tonner’s proteome reconciliation project would be the top of the medrey council report, or that it would be singled out by the research colloquy, high parliament review, and the Bastian Group. It was the first single-term project ever to top all three lists in the same year. Tonner Freis—with his tight smile and his prematurely gray hair that rose like smoke from an overheated brain—was, for the moment, the most celebrated mind in the world.</p>
<p id="vhMhi3">From where Dafyd stood, the distance and the angle made it impossible to see Tonner’s face clearly. Or the woman in the emerald-green dress at his side. Else Annalise Yannin, who had given up her own research team to join Tonner’s project. Who had one dimple in her left cheek when she smiled and two on her right. Who tapped out complex rhythms with her feet when she was thinking, like she occupied her body by dancing in place while her mind wandered.</p>
<p id="crmiZo">Else Yannin, the research group’s second leader and acknowledged lover of Tonner Freis. Else, who Dafyd had come hoping to see even though he knew it was a mistake.</p>
<p id="UJ36mx">“Enjoy it now,” Llaren Morse said, staring down at Tonner and his applause. The small hairs at the back of Dafyd’s neck rose. Morse hadn’t meant that for him. The comment had been for Tonner, and there had been a sneer in it.</p>
<p id="2FOtiv">“Enjoy it now?” But he saw in the tall man’s expression that the trick wouldn’t work again. Llaren Morse’s eyes were guarded again, more than they had been when they’d started talking.</p>
<p id="Pf7lSw">“I should let you go. I’ve kept you here all night,” the tall man said. “It was good meeting you, Alkhor.”</p>
<p id="HoDiPP">“Same,” Dafyd said, and watched him drift into the galleries and rooms. The abandoned skewer was still on the guardrail. The sky had darkened to starlight. A woman just slightly older than Dafyd ghosted past, cleaning the skewer away and disappearing into the crowd.</p>
<p id="EADwvp">Dafyd tried to talk himself out of his little feeling of paranoia.</p>
<p id="tpF9ir">He was tired because it was the end of the year and everyone on the team had been working extra hours to finish the datasets. He was out of place at a gathering of intellectual grandees and political leaders. He was carrying the emotional weight of an inappropriate infatuation with an unavailable woman. He was embarrassed by the not-entirely-unfounded impression he’d given Llaren Morse that he was only there because someone in his family had influence over money.</p>
<p id="P674ug">Any one was a good argument for treating his emotions with a little skepticism tonight. Taken all together, they were a compelling case.</p>
<p id="EYAsa4">And on the other side of the balance, the shadow of contempt in Morse’s voice: <em>Enjoy it now</em>.</p>
<p id="nSZJtn">Dafyd muttered a little obscenity, scowled, and headed toward the ramp to the higher levels and private salons of the Common where the administrators and politicians held court.</p>
<p id="zuK1fT">The Common was grown from forest coral and rose five levels above the open sward to the east and the plaza to the west. Curvilinear by nature, nothing in it was square. Subtle lines of support and tension—foundation into bracing into wall into window into finial—gave the whole building a sense of motion and life like some climbing and twisting fusion of ivy and bone.</p>
<p id="vUbkNs">The interior had sweeping corridors that channeled the breeze, courtyards that opened to the sky, private rooms that could be adapted for small meetings or living quarters, wide chambers used for presentations or dances or banquets. The air smelled of cedar and akkeh trees. Harp swallows nested in the highest reaches and chimed their songs at the people below.</p>
<p id="sS6zbJ">For most of the year, the Common was a building of all uses for the Irvian Research Medrey, and it served all the branches of scholarship that the citywide institution embodied. Apart from one humiliating failure on an assessment in his first year, Dafyd had fond memories of the Common and the times he’d spent there. The end-of-year celebration was different. It was a nested series of lies. A minefield scattered with gold nuggets, opportunity and disaster invisibly mingled.</p>
<p id="0QeASh">First, it was presented as a chance for the most exalted scholars and researchers of Anjiin’s great medrey and research conservatories to come together to socialize casually. In practice, “casual” included intricate and opaque rules of behavior and a rigidly enforced though ill-defined hierarchy of status. And one of many ironclad rules of etiquette was that people were to pretend there were no rules of etiquette. Who spoke to whom, who could make a joke and who was required to laugh, who could flirt and who must remain unreachably distant, all were unspoken and any mistake was noted by the community.</p>
<p id="szXXUY">Second, it was a time to avoid politics and openly jockeying for the funding that came with the beginning of a new term. And so every conversation and comment was instead soaked in implication and nuance about which studies had ranked, which threads of the intellectual tapestry would be supported into the next year and which would be cut, who would lead the research teams and who would yoke their efforts to some more brilliant mind.</p>
<p id="JQSxAC">And finally, the celebration was open to the whole community. In theory, even the greenest scholar-prentice was welcome. In practice, Dafyd was not only one of the youngest people there, but also the only scholar-associate attending as a guest. The others of his rank on display that night were scraping up extra allowance by serving drinks and tapas to their betters.</p>
<p id="2sD420">Some people wore jackets with formal collars and vests in the colors of their home medrey and research conservatories. Others, the undyed summer linens that the newly appointed high magistrate had made fashionable. Dafyd was in his formal: a long charcoal jacket over an embroidered shirt and slim-fitting pants. A good outfit, but carefully not too good.</p>
<p id="iHSOap">Security personnel lurked in the higher-status areas, but Dafyd walked with the lazy confidence of someone accustomed to access and deference. It would have been trivial to query the local system for the location of Dorinda Alkhor, but his aunt might see the request and know he was looking for her. If she had warning… Well, better that she didn’t.</p>
<p id="YmZ8B9">The crowd around him grew almost imperceptibly older as the mix of humanity shifted from scholar-researchers to scholar-coordinators, from support faculty to lead administrators, from recorders and popular writers to politicians and military liaisons. The formal jackets became just slightly better tailored, the embroidered shirts more brightly colored. All the plumage of status on display. He moved up the concentration of power like a microbe heading toward sugar, his hands in his pockets and his smile polite and blank. If he’d been nervous it would have shown, so he chose to be preoccupied instead. He went slowly, admiring art and icons in the swooping niches of forest coral, taking drinks from the servers and abandoning them to the servers that followed, being sure he knew what the next room was before he stepped into it.</p>
<p id="wCQzQc">His aunt was on a balcony that looked down over the plaza, and he saw her before she saw him. Her hair was down in a style that should have softened her face, but the severity of her mouth and jaw overpowered it. Dafyd didn’t recognize the man she was speaking with, but he was older, with a trim white beard. He was speaking quickly, making small, emphatic gestures, and she was listening to him intently.</p>
<p id="iPTGdL">Dafyd made a curve around, getting close to the archway that opened onto the balcony before changing his stride, moving more directly toward her. She glanced up, saw him. There was only a flicker of frown before she smiled and waved him over.</p>
<p id="7TR2XA">“Mur, this is my nephew Dafyd,” she said. “He’s working with Tonner Freis.”</p>
<p id="xP87Gj">“Young Freis!” Trim Beard said, shaking Dafyd’s hand. “That’s a good team to be with. First-rate work.”</p>
<p id="5NOlc0">“I’m mostly preparing samples and keeping the laboratory clean,” Dafyd said.</p>
<p id="r3xtUL">“Still. You’ll have it on your record. It’ll open doors later on. Count on that.”</p>
<p id="mtb2Od">“Mur is with the research colloquy,” his aunt said.</p>
<p id="UkI6KW">“Oh,” Dafyd said, and grinned. “Well, then I’m very pleased to meet you indeed. I came to meet with people who could help my prospects. Now that we’ve met, I can go home.”</p>
<p id="EFWYxB">His aunt hid a grimace, but Mur laughed and clapped Dafyd on the shoulder. “Dory here says kind things about you. You’ll be fine. But I should—” He gestured toward the back and nodded to his aunt knowingly. She nodded back, and the older man stepped away. Below them, the plaza was alive. Food carts and a band playing guitar music that gently reached up to where they were standing. Threads of melody floating in the high, fragrant air. She put her arm in his.</p>
<p id="HJIcui">“Dory?” Dafyd asked.</p>
<p id="ucaxyV">“I hate it when you’re self-effacing,” she said, ignoring his attempt at gentle mockery. Dafyd noted the tension in her neck and shoulder muscles. Everyone at the party wanted her time and access to the money she controlled. She’d probably been playing defense all night and it had stolen her patience. “It’s not as charming as you think.”</p>
<p id="doStZj">“I put people at ease,” Dafyd said.</p>
<p id="wexbVf">“You’re at a point in your career that you should make people uneasy. You’re too fond of being underestimated. It’s a vice. You’re going to have to impress someone someday.”</p>
<p id="Xavf76">“I just wanted to put in an appearance so you’d know I really came.”</p>
<p id="5hf9oi">“I’m glad you did,” and her smile forgave him a little.</p>
<p id="WsfgyN">“You taught me well.”</p>
<p id="ooN9MI">“I told my sister I would look out for you, and I swear on her dear departed soul I will turn you into something worthy of her,” his aunt said. Dafyd flinched at the mention of his mother, and his aunt softened a little. “She warned me that raising children would require patience. It’s why I never had any of my own.”</p>
<p id="KMGhiR">“I’ve never been the fastest learner, but that’s my burden. Your teaching was always good. I’m going to owe you a lot when it’s all said and done.”</p>
<p id="zGQ3sQ">“No.”</p>
<p id="4veOtB">“Oh, I’m pretty sure I will.”</p>
<p id="v9PNC8">“I mean no, whatever you’re trying to soften out of me, don’t ask it. I’ve been watching you flatter and charm everyone all your life. I don’t think less of you for being manipulative. It’s a good skill. But I’m better at it than you, so whatever you’re about to try to dig out of me, no.”</p>
<p id="Mfl1Yw">“I met a man from Dyan Academy. I don’t think he likes Tonner.”</p>
<p id="gbsSjI">She looked at him, her eyes flat as a shark’s. Then, a moment later, the same tiny, mirthless smile she had when she lost a hand of cards.</p>
<p id="C06Sb5">“Don’t be smug. I really am glad you came,” she said, then squeezed his arm and let him go.</p>
<p id="jggMOn">Dafyd retraced his steps, through the halls and down the wide ramps. His face shot an empty smile at those he passed, his mind elsewhere.</p>
<p id="iTs0Wh">He found Tonner Freis and Else Yannin on the ground floor in a chamber wide enough to be a ballroom. Tonner had taken his jacket off, and he was leaning on a wide wooden table. Half a dozen scholars had formed a semicircle around him like a tiny theater with Tonner Freis as the only man on stage. <em>The thing we’d been doing wrong was trying to build reconciliation strategies at the informational level instead of the product. DNA and ribosomes on one hand, lattice quasicrystals and QRP on the other. It’s like we were trying to speak two different languages and force their grammars to mesh when all we really need are directions on how to build a chair. Stop trying to explain how and just start building the chair, and it’s much easier.</em> His voice carried better than a singer’s. His audience chuckled.</p>
<p id="DZycja">Dafyd looked around, and she was easy to find. Else Yannin in her emerald-green dress was two tables over. Long, aquiline nose, wide mouth, and thin lips. She was watching her lover with an expression of amused indulgence. Only for a second, Dafyd hated Tonner Freis.</p>
<p id="t0JloB">He didn’t need to do this. No one was asking him to. It would take no extra effort to turn to the right and amble out to the plaza. A plate of roasted corn and spiced beef, a glass of beer, and he could go back to his rooms and let the political intrigue play itself out without him. But Else tucked a lock of auburn hair back behind her ear, and he walked toward her table like he had business there.</p>
<p id="3ZHRB6">Small moments, unnoticed at the time, change the fate of empires.</p>
<p id="Yjwg6m">Her smile shifted when she saw him. Just as real, but meaning something different. Something more closed. “Dafyd? I didn’t expect to see you here.”</p>
<p id="Uht9wJ">“My other plans fell through,” he said, reaching out to a servant passing by with what turned out to be mint iced tea. He’d been hoping for something more alcoholic. “I thought I’d see what the best minds of the planet looked like when they let their hair down.”</p>
<p id="UfzJhg">Else gestured to the crowd with her own glass. “This, on into the small hours of the morning.”</p>
<p id="FuHRWk">“No dancing?”</p>
<p id="5eWC3E">“Maybe when people have had a chance to get a little more drunk.” There were threads of premature white in her hair. Against the youth of her face, they made her seem ageless.</p>
<p id="zRX3gu">“Can I ask you a question?”</p>
<p id="qp6DLQ">She settled into herself. “Of course.”</p>
<p id="3NjkNt">“Have you heard anything about another group taking over our research?”</p>
<p id="ccV6AU">She laughed once, loud enough that Tonner looked over and nodded to Dafyd before returning to his performance. “You don’t need to worry about that,” she said. “We’ve made so much progress and gotten so much acclaim in the last year, there’s no chance. Anyone who did would be setting themselves up as the disappointing second string. No one wants that.”</p>
<p id="h3QWOD">“All right,” Dafyd said, and took a drink of the tea he didn’t want. One member of Tonner’s little audience was saying something that made him scowl. Else shifted her weight. A single crease drew itself between her eyebrows.</p>
<p id="mAdv7S">“Just out of curiosity, what makes you ask?”</p>
<p id="7eMomK">“It’s just that, one hundred percent certainty, no error bars? Someone’s making a play to take over the research.”</p>
<p id="Ocb81I">Else put down her drink and put her hand on his arm. The crease between her eyebrows deepened. “What have you heard?”</p>
<p id="ZRBr1M">Dafyd let himself feel a little warmth at her attention, at the touch of her hand. It felt like an important moment, and it was. Later, when he stood in the eye of a storm that burned a thousand worlds, he’d remember how it all started with Else Yannin’s hand on his arm and his need to give her a reason to keep it there.</p>

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The Chicago Comic and Entertainment Expo (more commonly known as C2E2), has taken place every spring since 2010. This year’s convention, spread out over three days in April and held at McCormick Place, a huge, multi-level convention center, brought the kinds of high-quality cosplay we’ve come to expect from the con. </p><p>On display this year were everything from tongue-in-cheek versions of <em>Dune Part Two</em> characters to astonishingly detailed sets of armor from <em>Monster Hunter, Game of Thrones</em>, and <em>Dark Souls</em>. Of course, there were also some sexy scaries thrown in the mix.

It would also vindicate the legions of people like myself who have stuck with <em>Destiny</em> since the beginning, pouring hundreds of hours into killing aliens and collecting what they leave behind. </p><p>Bungie invited me to attend a recent remote hands-off demo of the game to experience a preview build of some of the expansion. I was able to catch a glimpse of a new story mission that takes players inside The Traveller, <em>Destiny</em>’s big iconic space ball, for the first time ever. I saw some of what could make the expansion’s new strike one of the most challenging yet. And I got to see the Prismatic subclass, which lets players mix-and-match specific light and dark powers like a Red Mage in <em>Final Fantasy</em>, in action against an enemy faction called the Dread which includes Strand-wielding foot-soldiers that pull Guardians toward them as well as winged threats that bring danger from new directions. </p><p>Unlike last year’s disappointing<em> Lightfall </em>campaign,  which didn’t unlock Strand until the end, players wont have to wait until the end of <em>The Final Shape</em> to begin using Prismatic builds. Game director Tyson Green confirmed during my session that the subclass will unlock early on with a default build that players will slowly open up over the course of the ensuing story missions. And while the team worked hard to make sure it felt like players’ old powers would still be viable, it certainly seems like the intent is for Prismatic to be the showcased tool box during the campaign, including its new Transcendence mode which makes abilities cool down even more quickly as players dish out damage. It remains to be seen how exactly this balance works in the rest of <em>Destiny 2</em>'s sandbox.</p><p><em>The Final Shape</em>, as its name suggests, will mark the end of players’ current journeys, and possibly the beginning of new ones. It promises a showdown with The Witness, <em>Destiny 2</em>'s version of  Sauron if you fused him with the ominous scheming of the Emperor from <em>Star Wars </em>and the confident nihilism of Marvel’s Thanos. He’s occasionally felt like a somewhat goofy addition to an otherwise complex, mysterious, and magisterial-looking sci-fi universe, but the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZrxWFrd1zQ&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZrxWFrd1zQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">launch trailer</a></span> teasing the emotional stakes and the potential corruption of Commander Zavala, <em>Destiny</em>’s walking moral compass, suggests a cutscene-filled confrontation that might be worth the years-long wait. </p><figure id="" data-id="ae2cfdcad4f51e01d3d98079fc167c84" data-recommend-id="image://ae2cfdcad4f51e01d3d98079fc167c84" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Pale Heart displays The Tower from Destiny 1." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Pale Heart displays The Tower from Destiny 1." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bungie</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ae2cfdcad4f51e01d3d98079fc167c84" data-recommend-id="image://ae2cfdcad4f51e01d3d98079fc167c84" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Pale Heart displays The Tower from Destiny 1." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Then there’s the Pale Heart, Bungie’s name for a zone inside The Traveler which functions like a nostalgia-fueled gauntlet. Hallucinations of things from characters’ pasts, large chunks of early<em> Destiny</em>, including the Tower from the original before it was demolished at the start of the sequel, appear throughout it. The parts I saw looked like a mix of the Old City and The Dreaming City, combining vaulted ruins with patches of bucolic regrowth. Nothing was as immediately striking as some of the scenes from past expansions, but it was as detailed and beautiful-looking as the game’s been in its modern era.<br></p><p>Unlike previous raids, the one for <em>The Final Shape </em>will happen the same week it launches, hinting that the conflict with The Witness will indeed be resolved then and there rather than being sneakily dragged out for several weeks or until newer episodic content arrives. As someone who is used to Bungie dragging things out and moving the goal posts from one big bad to another, it’s hard to fathom what it will feel like after players win and The Witness is defeated. It’s also hard to imagine where <em>Destiny 2 </em>goes after that. </p><p>I asked Green whether players will come away from the latest expansion with a sense of where the game they’ve been playing for 10 years goes next. “Yes,” he said. “Okay not to be flip, by the end of the raid, yes, players will have a better sense for where the future of <em>Destiny</em> goes. And we will be developing some of those threats and some of those those new story arcs as the year progresses. So yeah, that is all stuff we intend to do. As this thread winds down, we have more stories to tell.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>To date, the entire Assassin’s Creed franchise remain single-player experiences. It’s part of the charm, as you can jump in and out of the gameplay with little effort. But times are changing, and many players want online functionality to increase longevity. So, is Assassin’s Creed Shadows multiplayer?</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-assassin-s-creed-shadows-multiplayer">Can You Play Assassin’s Creed Shadows Multiplayer?</h2>



<p>One would think that considering there are <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/who-are-naoe-and-yasuke-the-first-assassins-creed-shadows-trailer-reveals-all/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">two main characters</a> in Assassin’s Creed Shadows, we’d have an opportunity to play cooperatively with a partner. Unfortunately, that’s not the case. Assassin’s Creed Shadows is a single-player game with no multiplayer or cooperative game mode to speak of thus far. </p>



<p>Could that change? There’s always room for Assassin’s Creed to grow and evolve, but to include a co-op game mode? That’s unlikely. </p>



<p>If you want a multiplayer Ubisoft title, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-does-the-new-rainbow-six-siege-season-start-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rainbow Six Siege</a> or Skull and Bones provide plenty of cooperative and competitive entertainment!</p>



<p>Related: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/was-assassins-creed-shadows-yasuke-a-real-samurai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Was Assassin’s Creed Shadows’ Yasuke a Real Samurai?</a></p>



<h2 id="h-is-assassin-s-creed-shadows-online-only">Is Assassin’s Creed Shadows Online Only?</h2>



<p>While Assassin’s Creed Shadows doesn’t feature multiplayer, players still want to know about its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-assassins-creed-shadows-always-online-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">online capabilities</a>. More importantly, is Assassin’s Creed Shadows online only? Thankfully, you do not require a constant internet connection to play the upcoming single-player experience. </p>



<p>Once you finish downloading and installing the game, you no longer require a constant internet connection to play. This is a welcome change, considering recent trends in gaming.</p>



<p>That said, Shadows will likely feature an in-game cosmetics shop, like previous titles in the series.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/until-then-wants-to-become-a-portal-to-filipino-culture-for-everyone<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><em>AAPI Month coverage continues with an interview with Polychroma Games about their Phillipines-set story game, Until Then, coming out on June 25.</em></p><p>Even in its demo, Until Then rang plenty of bells for me as a Filipino-American. It reminded me of summer breaks when I would visit Manila, but with a fondness that outdid any discomfort I would have from walking under the sweltering heat and dodging cockroaches on the sidewalk. From colored chicks to bits of Tagalog, Filipino culture deepened the immersiveness of the story between the playful characterization and mini games.</p><p>This is the setting that Mickole Klein Nulud, founder of Polychroma Games and game director of Until Then, and his team sought to capture. Mark Borja is seemingly just another Filipino high schooler going through shenanigans like cramming for class and keeping up with the local rumor mill. However, magical realism starts to seep into the slice of life setting, hinting at the emotionally compelling story to come.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2>A Setting By Any Other Name</h2><p>The Philippines isn’t a glamorous city with robot toilets and vending machines at every corner. Until Then doesn’t tout fantasy gimmicks or child soldiers, yet Polychroma still decided to base its setting on Manila, the capital of the Philippines. Nulud tells IGN that the Philippines was integral to the story they wanted to tell, and it was a non-negotiable from the start. They initially had concerns on whether or not a global audience would find the Philippines relatable. However, the developers quickly abandoned their doubts. </p><p>“We wanted to write a story where we could apply the experiences of growing up here,” Nulud says. “Right from the start, the idea behind this game was to represent the Philippines and share the experiences we went through living here growing up here. It's fundamental to the game, so there were no other settings on the table.”</p><p>The plan was to create a universally relatable story with the Philippines as a backdrop. That way, it could appeal to global audiences as well as fellow Filipinos. “If we wanted to write a story in a game where you could reach into people's hearts, of course it has to be universal,” Nulud says. “But the setting, the context, the mannerisms that the story integrates–some of them are uniquely Filipino. So, we sprinkle in some references here and there, but not too much that will make the story confusing for other audiences.”</p><p>“We learned how to strike a balance between sprinkling in some references that players here would appreciate, but still [making it so] everyone would appreciate the main story itself.”</p><p>Most of the Philippine references appear in the settings, like the trash-littered streets and roaming stray dogs. However, Nulud and fellow developers found a way to gamify their experiences through mini-games and interactive parts of the game, even if it isn’t exactly how you would experience it in real life. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/28/screenshot-4-1716912388902.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>For example, in the demo, Mark and Sofia take turns stabbing fish balls with skewers. However, they don’t just take the fish balls from the vendor and leave. You have to skewer the fish balls yourself by timing exactly where the stick stops above the frying balls, and then again for when exactly to stab it so that it actually sticks. That’s not actually how you buy or even eat fish balls in the Philippines, but it was a fun way for Nulud and his fellow developers to gamify a cultural experience. </p><p>Until Then also serves as one of the most recent and significant examples of Filipino representation. My Filipino friends and I have a hard time recalling Filipino representation in recent games. Josie Rizal from Tekken 7 is one of the most popular examples that still pops up, but that game came out nearly a decade ago. Nulud also recalled Rizal, but noted her inclusion in Tekken is only a small part of the game. In that sense, Until Then is a more fully fleshed out example.</p><p>“It's not just an element. It's not just like 10% Filipino representation. It's 100% Filipino representation,” says Nulud. “And I don't think there are–if there ever is–a game that has 100% representation. Maybe there's just one or two.”</p><p>“I think [in] that way, it is a strength. This is a game where you could really say that. That's really representative, first of its kind.”</p><h2>Filipino Time Capsule</h2><p>Cultural time capsules also exist, like the train station Mark uses early in the game to get to school where you need to buy the ticket from the machine. Nulud admits that it’s not that exciting because you’re just buying a train ticket. However, for him and others who used to commute using the Manila subway, it’s a fun reminder of their local transportation. </p><p>“It was really fun because I copied the interface almost 100% in the train station that we have here,” Nulud said. “That was just really fun for me because it's going to be a time capsule.” </p><p>“There have been changes to the train station that we have in the game from real life. Like, some of the design, some of the architecture of the train station…When you visit it now, it's slightly different from what it is in the game.”</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/28/screenshot-6-1716912404196.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Besides the train station that Nulud mentioned, it’s also a time capsule for technology and social media. Until Then takes place in 2014, even though the team started development in 2020. Facebook, which is still popular in the Philippines, is the main social media used in the story. You scroll through your timeline, liking and commenting on your friends’ posts, or even learn more about the world through the news stories and ads that pop up on your timeline. </p><p>“Back in something like 2010, we were only able to access it from a computer shop or internet cafe,” says Nulud. “But, starting in 2014, that's when Filipinos became more active or online. So that makes a lot of sense for the smartphone mechanics that we have where there's basically a Facebook clone in the game where you can like, share, and stuff.” </p><p>Even now, Facebook is the Philippines’ <a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/6759/social-media-usage-in-the-philippines/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>most popular social media platform</u></a>. According to <a href="https://datareportal.com/essential-facebook-stats" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>DataReportal</u></a>, the Philippines ranks in Facebook’s top 10 most active countries with 91.9 million active Facebook users. For context, the last Philippine census counted 115.56 million people. The United States, second in the rankings, has 186.4 million active Facebook users, but about 333.29 million people. The ratios are skewed.</p><p>“Facebook is not dead here at all. It's the main platform. I know it's not big in the US right now, but here, it's synonymous to social media,” says Nulud.</p><h2>Inspirations for Until Then</h2><p>Besides Filipino culture, Polychroma Games prioritized innovative storytelling to strengthen Until Then’s narrative. Nulud described it as closer to a “cinematic experience,” but one where it was more like a visual novel with interactive elements. Instead of just clicking through options of dialogue, I mashed buttons to wake up our main character, bought a train ticket, plugged in a USB, scrolled through Facebook messages, and more. In that sense, it felt a lot more interactive than a traditional relationship-based visual novel where you might select options that cater towards specific love interests and eventually form a relationship with them. </p><p>Nulud’s main inspirations includes Night in the Woods, Infinite Fall’s narrative adventure game based on western Pennsylvania. I used to live in Pittsburgh, a setting that heavily inspired Night in the Woods. In that story, the mining town history, hilly suburban setting, and other environmentally unique pieces about it really made it feel like Pittsburgh and, as an extension, other western Pennsylvania towns. Until Then works similarly, painting a picture of Manila through its setting, even without exposition.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/28/screenshot-1-1716912432244.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>“When you look at Night in the Woods and this game, there's a lot of similarity in how we present dialogue where you can see the world,” Nulud says. “When I played [NITW], I was really amazed that you can present a story like this. Like, you can present it in a way that you're just exploring the world because, in very conventional visual novels, you only have backgrounds for settings and then characters just fade in and fade out. And, since so far in my career, I have always been interested in narrative in games. I take a lot of inspiration from how Night in the Woods presents its story. It's just so immersive, having it presented this way.”</p><p>“I'm interested to push the boundaries and explore different ways we can tell stories in games. And one way of doing that, I thought, was presenting it in a cinematic experience.”</p><p>Nulud also highlighted a few other inspirations including <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/612400/The_Last_Night/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>The Last Night</u></a> and, for Mark’s interest in piano, the anime Your Lie in April.  When asked about The Last Night, Nulud said, “It's pixel art, but it's not fully two-dimensional. It's 2D sprites, but set in a 3D space. And they take it even further by using modern graphics, the type that you would see in AAA games like reflection shaders and stuff like that. I got really inspired by that as well.”</p><h2>Something That Can’t Be Said</h2><p>Until Then taps into high school nostalgia with its high school setting. However, Nulud highlights that Until Then isn’t just about that. His favorite theme was “understanding communication,” something that’s emphasized throughout the game and something he enjoyed examining the nuances of. Other words for it include human understanding or human condition in general.</p><p>“The theme here is human condition,” says Nulud, “but that's very general. We don't talk about that. That is obvious, but if there's anything specific about the human condition that we highlight here, it's understanding [that] and its complexity. We really wanted to opt for a story that's really emotional, something, as I said earlier, something that will reach into people's hearts and strike a chord with them.”</p><p>“Maybe, yeah, sure, high school days can strike a chord with the audience. But I think we were really aiming for something bigger than that. Something that's outside of school. Something that is truly universal in the human condition or experience. We were really just aiming for something bigger. But definitely, yeah, there are elements of high school days that would make you wanna relive it.”</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/28/screenshot-5-1716912446002.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Nulud recalls how he read a comment from one player about how the demo made them feel “nostalgic,” even though they didn’t come from the same background as he and his colleagues. Even though Until then is based in the Philippines, it seemed to succeed in relating to players overseas with its message.</p><p>“Even though they didn't really live through any of this, they're not from the Philippines, their schools do not look like that in the game…By aiming for something bigger than school life, something more general than that, we were able to achieve that. Like, just being universal, and even people getting nostalgia for things that they didn't personally go through.”</p><p>Ultimately, Nulud hopes that players connect with the emotional story that his team worked to convey in Until Then. If you learn about the Philippines, cool, but the most important part is the story.</p><p>“We just really hope that, whoever plays this, for all the players that will go through the entire game–like, especially for me–I really hope that this game strikes a chord the same way all my inspirations did to me,” he says. “That's what we're really hoping for once this comes out.”</p><p>To Filipino players, he says, “As I said before, this is universal, but we sprinkled in some references here and there. So we really hope that you point these out when you talk about the game, and we'd really appreciate mentions of it because we put our heart into those references and just overall had fun, you know, putting references here that our fellow countrymen will get.”</p><p>Until Then is coming to PC and PlayStation 5. You can play the demo now on Steam.</p><p><em>Jess Reyes is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p data-characters="137" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">After months of speculation, Microsoft finally provided an update on whether <em>Call of Duty Black Ops 6 </em>would be on Xbox Game Pass or not. </p> <p data-characters="485" data-current-count="485" data-injectable="true">When Microsoft <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/microsoft-activision-blizzard-purchase-acquisition-call-of-duty-warcraft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">purchased Activision Blizzard</a> for $68.7 billion in October 2023, it opened the door for new titles to be added to Xbox Game Pass. <em>Diablo 4</em> became the first Activision Blizzard title to join subscription service in March, and players started speculating which franchise would be next. As rumors intensified, Microsoft <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/xbox-reportedly-debating-call-of-duty-on-game-pass-and-a-price-hike/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reportedly</a> had internal debates about putting <em>Call of Duty</em> on Game Pass because there was a risk it would hurt the revenue generated by yearly releases. </p>
 <p data-characters="309" data-current-count="309" data-injectable="false">Playing games on day one requires an Ultimate Game Pass subscription, which costs $16.99 monthly.&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>games typically cost $69.99 or $99.99, depending on which version you purchase. The cost discrepancy forced Microsoft to weigh the benefits of each option, but a choice has now been made. </p> <h2 id="h-is-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-on-xbox-game-pass" data-injectable="false">Is Call of Duty Black Ops 6 on Xbox Game Pass?</h2> <figure data-current-count="609" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Activision</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="241" data-current-count="241" data-injectable="false">Microsoft <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/05/28/play-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-day-one-game-pass/?ocid=CallOfDuty_soc_omc_xbo_tw_Photo_lrn_5.28.1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that <em><strong>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</strong></em><strong> will be available on day one with an Xbox Game Pass subscription</strong>. As for the rumored price increase, Microsoft did not mention a new price for the subscription service in the press release. </p> <p data-characters="369" data-current-count="610" data-injectable="false">Activision plans on sharing a first look at <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em> gameplay during the upcoming direct event on June 9 at 10 AM PST. The series of teaser videos has already hinted at it. Still, the next&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty</em>&nbsp;will reportedly be set in the Gulf War,&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-gulf-war/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“with a strong focus on the CIA,”</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1791469865942835593" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumors</a>&nbsp;suggest that&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 6</em>&nbsp;will launch in late October.</p>

<p data-characters="256" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Personally, I prefer to play <em>Minecraft</em> by myself, but that’s not why you’re here. You’re looking for the best servers to play on, presumably with other people. If that’s not the case, it’s kind of strange that you clicked on the headline or link.</p> <p data-characters="380" data-current-count="380" data-injectable="false">This is more of a list of <em>popular</em> servers. The best server everyone else likes isn’t necessarily going to align with what you’re looking for. <em>Minecraft</em> is a very malleable game, it can be played in a lot of ways. Popularity is also not a great measuring stick for quality. However, if you don’t exclusively want to explore off the beaten path, here are some to consider.</p> <figure data-current-count="680" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Minewind.net</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-10-minewind" data-injectable="false">10. Minewind</h2> <p data-characters="26" data-current-count="26" data-injectable="false"><strong>Address: play.minewind.net</strong></p> <p data-characters="372" data-current-count="398" data-injectable="false">Minewind is essentially an expansion of survival mode to incorporate RPG concepts like classes and loot. However, further than that, it also bills itself as complete anarchy. There aren’t really any player rules, so griefing is completely fair game. You’re going to have to be careful, aggressive, or underhanded to actually survive in this cruel version of <em>Minecraft</em>.</p> <figure data-current-count="698" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Havoc Games</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-9-havoc-games" data-injectable="false">9. Havoc Games</h2> <p data-characters="24" data-current-count="24" data-injectable="false"><strong>Address: top.havoc.games</strong></p> <p data-characters="263" data-current-count="287" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://havoc.games/">Havoc Games</a> started out as a server based around the <em>Walking Dead</em> series called The Mining Dead. It’s since become so much more than that, but their zombie survival mode still tends to be the main draw, and part of the reason why it still remains popular today.</p> <figure data-current-count="587" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via WesterosCraft</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-8-westeroscraft" data-injectable="false">8. WesterosCraft</h2> <p data-characters="29" data-current-count="29" data-injectable="false"><strong>Address: mc.westeroscraft.com</strong></p> <p data-characters="266" data-current-count="295" data-injectable="false">Fantasy kingdoms are fertile ground for recreation in <em>Minecraft</em>, and WesterosCraft has taken on the mighty task of replication Westeros from <em>Game of Thrones</em>. The team has been at it since 2011 and have constructed a hearty slice of the fantasy world for exploration.</p> <p data-characters="210" data-current-count="505" data-injectable="true">Speaking of which, WesterosCraft is largely a sightseeing and… that’s about it. However, if you want another way of interacting with the world, you can apply to join the team and have a hand in building it.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via MC Middle Earth</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-7-minecraft-middle-earth" data-injectable="false">7. Minecraft Middle Earth</h2> <p data-characters="32" data-current-count="332" data-injectable="false"><strong>Address: build.mcmiddleearth.com</strong></p> <p data-characters="420" data-current-count="752" data-injectable="true">Minecraft Middle Earth (or MC Middle Earth) is similar to WesterosCraft but set in a <a href="https://www.mcmiddleearth.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">replica of Middle Earth</a> from <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>. Considering I just went over the concept of this sort of sightseeing server, I’m not sure it’s necessary to explain further. If you want to see a <em>Minecraft </em>representation of the walk that Frodo and Sam took to dump jewelry into a volcano, this is what you’re maybe looking for.</p>
 <p data-characters="121" data-current-count="121" data-injectable="false">It’s worth noting that there is a New Player Quiz for getting in. One does not simply walk into Minecraft Middle Earth.</p> <figure data-current-count="421" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Lord of the Craft</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-6-the-lord-of-the-craft" data-injectable="false">6. The Lord of the Craft</h2> <p data-characters="19" data-current-count="19" data-injectable="false"><strong>Address: mc.lotc.co</strong></p> <p data-characters="325" data-current-count="344" data-injectable="false">Something a little different. The Lord of the Craft is a huge medieval fantasy roleplay server. While its name sounds like a play on <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>, it’s actually not set in that Universe, but rather a more <a href="https://www.lordofthecraft.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">general fantasy setting</a>. Not like the above Middle Earth server that is <em>actually</em> about <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>.</p> <p data-characters="461" data-current-count="805" data-injectable="true">Roleplay can be quite imposing next to more structured servers, and that’s not really any different here. You actually need to apply to get access to the server. That may sound inconvenient, but it’s to ensure that those who inhabit the server are familiar with the concepts of roleplay and won’t be disruptive to others. Despite that perceived inconvenience, the server has a very healthy player base, ensuring that the world remains lively at all times.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Wynncraft</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-5-wynncraft" data-injectable="false">5. Wynncraft</h2> <p data-characters="26" data-current-count="326" data-injectable="false"><strong>Address play.wynncraft.com</strong></p> <p data-characters="364" data-current-count="690" data-injectable="true">There are a few servers out there now that turn <em>Minecraft</em> into a conventional MMO, but none have found the <a href="https://wynncraft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">success of Wynncraft</a>. There isn’t much in terms of actual building, but there’s are quests, loot, classes; everything you’d expect from a standard MMO experience. Heck, Wynncraft has an active player count that rivals some of the more mainstream ones.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Grand Theft Minecart</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-4-grand-theft-minecart" data-injectable="false">4. Grand Theft Minecart</h2> <p data-characters="25" data-current-count="325" data-injectable="false"><strong>Address: topms.mc-gtm.net</strong></p> <p data-characters="249" data-current-count="574" data-injectable="true"><em>Grand Theft Auto</em> but in <em>Minecraft</em> isn’t exactly the most novel of ideas, but one server does it better than the rest, and that’s <a href="https://grandtheftmc.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grand Theft Minecart</a>. There are guns, cars, a massive map, and more importantly: an active developer and playerbase.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via PirateCraft</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-3-piratecraft" data-injectable="false">3. Piratecraft</h2> <p data-characters="24" data-current-count="324" data-injectable="false"><strong>Address: mc.piratemc.com</strong></p> <p data-characters="309" data-current-count="633" data-injectable="true">Pirates are cool. I mean, not, like, real modern-day pirates, but the romanticized old-fashioned kind. Those are cool. If you’re interested in sailing the waves of <em>Minecraft</em>, Piratecraft has been <a href="https://piratemc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ruling the high seas</a> for over 10 years. You can build and pilot your own ship complete with functional cannons.</p>
 <p data-characters="245" data-current-count="245" data-injectable="false">One thing to note is that this is a “tight-knit” community and isn’t quite the sprawling networks that some of the bigger <em>Minecraft</em> servers tend to be. However, there is almost always an active number of players available to interact with.</p> <figure data-current-count="545" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Complex Gaming</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-2-complex-gaming" data-injectable="false">2. Complex Gaming</h2> <p data-characters="27" data-current-count="27" data-injectable="false"><strong>Address: hub.mc-complex.com</strong></p> <p data-characters="265" data-current-count="292" data-injectable="false">Complex Gaming has ruled the roost for quite some time now. Rather than being one simple server, it hosts all sorts of Minecraft offshoots. Prominently, it’s a hotspot for <em>Pixelmon Reforged</em> players, but other mods and even Vanilla <em>Minecraft</em> servers are available.</p> <p data-characters="157" data-current-count="449" data-injectable="true">For these mods (such as <em>Pixelmon</em>), you do require the associated modpacks, but <a href="https://www.mc-complex.com/">their website</a> can point you in the right direction to get everything you need.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Hypixel</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-1-hypixel" data-injectable="false">1. Hypixel</h2> <p data-characters="23" data-current-count="323" data-injectable="false"><strong>Address: mc.hypixel.net</strong></p> <p data-characters="230" data-current-count="553" data-injectable="true">While the server has seen its ups and downs, Hypixel is still near <a href="https://hypixel.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the absolute top</a> of the server heap in terms of active playerbase. Like Complex Gaming, it hosts a tonne of different modes like Skyblock, Megawalls, and Warlords.</p>
 <p data-characters="246" data-current-count="246" data-injectable="false">Again, sheer playercount isn’t necessarily a marker for quality, but there’s a good reason that Hypixel retains its massive population and has for years. But moreover, if you’re looking to hit up one of the most happening spots, this is it.</p>

			<p>Today, Tencent's <a href="https://wccftech.com/tencent-launches-level-infinite-publishing-brand-aiming-for-high-quality-global-releases/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Level Infinite publishing label</a> announced the global release date of Tarisland. The free-to-play fantasy MMORPG looks a lot like Blizzard's World of Warcraft and, indeed, was first unveiled right after that game went offline in China (though it will return shortly, <a href="https://wccftech.com/netease-brings-blizzard-games-back-to-china-in-summer-signs-deal-with-microsoft-to-bring-its-games-to-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">thanks to the new agreement between Microsoft, Activision, and NetEase</a>).</p>
<p>Powered by Unreal Engine 4 and developed by Locojoy, a team of MMORPG fans, Tarisland will launch on PC (<a href="https://tarisglobal.com/en/home.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via the game's website</a> - it is not listed on any store) and mobile platforms on June 21. Over three million users have pre-registered to download the game. Here's the game overview provided by Locojoy:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multiple Classes &amp; Specializations:</strong> Pick one out of 9 classes, such as Warriors, Mages, and Priests, each with unique abilities and two specialized paths to master. Following the feedback of Western players, gender-unlocked classes will slowly roll out starting with Mages and Paladins.</li>
<li><strong>Flexible Talent System:</strong> Craft your own unique play style using Tarisland's talent tree system, which allows for free customization to adapt to different combat scenarios.</li>
<li><strong>Challenging Raid Encounters:</strong> Team up with fellow adventurers to take on epic bosses and overcome unique game mechanics in intense cooperative raids. In Season 0, there will be five dungeons, eight 10-player raid bosses, and multiple PvE modes including the Arcane Realm, Universal Hall, and Dark Invasion. Each dungeon has three levels of difficulty.</li>
<li><strong>Vast Open World:</strong> Uncover the secrets of Tarisland's vast realm, filled with puzzles, adventures, and unique gameplay experiences that go beyond traditional questing.</li>
<li><strong>Cross-Platform Compatibility:</strong> Experience the thrill of raid progression seamlessly across mobile and PC devices with cross-platform compatibility.</li>
</ul>

<p>The launch trailer embedded above shows off the game's final boss at launch, the Blight Dragon Covered in impenetrable scales, with a wingspan nearing 200 meters, this beast is the first dragon hatched in the universe and an unstoppable force on the battlefield, according to the developers.</p>

<p data-characters="275" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">It’s dangerous to go alone! Take this. Grab your wallet because soon you’ll be able to build your own Great Deku Tree! <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/great-deku-tree-2-in-1-77092?cmp=OBS-TOUIGIUW0Y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LEGO revealed the build today</a>, which is essentially a 2-in-1 set allowing you to choose between two Great Deku Tree builds from <em>The Legend of Zelda</em>.</p> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via LEGO</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-hey-listen" data-injectable="false">Hey! Listen!</h2> <p data-characters="412" data-current-count="712" data-injectable="true">When did LEOG builds get so expensive? I will admit, looking at the build, I didn’t expect it to have 2,500 pieces as the listing says it does, so that may just be the going price for that many bricks these days. I haven’t had the opportunity to build out my LEGO dreams in way too long. *Pushes up non-existent bifocals* Back in my day a massive set of LEGO ran you $50 and featured a massive build.</p>
 <p data-characters="294" data-current-count="294" data-injectable="false">Even though the LEGO Great Deku Tree set doesn’t ship until September 2024, those interested <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/great-deku-tree-2-in-1-77092?cmp=OBS-TOUIGIUW0Y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">can pre-order today</a> if their willing to part with the price of a Nintendo Switch to get this set. It’s a bit too steep for me, even though it would look pretty nifty as a piece on my shelf.</p> <p data-characters="187" data-current-count="481" data-injectable="true">Those who pre-order by June 7 will also get a free Water Park gift, which absolutely does not fit with the theme of The Legend of Zelda or the Great Deku Tree, but hey, more LEGO I guess.</p>
 <p data-characters="282" data-current-count="282" data-injectable="false">The Great Deku Tree confirms long-withstanding rumors that LEGO was indeed working on a <em>Zelda</em> set. While the Great Deku Treet is cool and is a great first choice, I’m excited to see what kind of sets LEGO cooks up based around some more memorable moments from the game series.</p>

		<p>We'll keep this short, as the holiday week has me a little behind. But hey, did you know we're rapidly approaching the one-year anniversary of <em>Remap</em>? It's wild to think how much has happened in the past year. We'd intended to blow this out, but life moments got in the way—early June is an odd time on our personal <em>and</em> gaming—calendars. We'll be doing an all-day livestream playing a bunch of games, but we're already planning something even better for later in June. Consider June to be a month of celebrating this moment, a moment we could not have reached without you. Much more to say soon!</p><p>-pk, who highly recommends HBO's <em>The Sympathizer </em>show</p><hr><figure></figure><ul><li><strong>MONDAY: </strong>You get to hear one of the two panels I hosted as part of last month's LudoNarraCon. Working with them with a blast, I hope you've enjoyed the podcasts! There's one more coming.</li><li><strong>TUESDAY: </strong>We'll record an After Dark ahead of <em>Remap</em>'s first anniversary. In the past, we've recorded these before a big moment, as a way of capturing our thoughts in a little time capsule. Naturally, we're a ball of anxiety all over again.</li><li><strong>WEDNESDAY: </strong>You'll get to hear that After Dark.</li><li><strong>THURSDAY:</strong> Remap Radio will get in the can again. I've finished both <em>Hellblade II</em> and <em>Animal Well</em>, so there'll be a lot of talk about. The end of my time with <em>Animal Well </em>was, like Janet, a little bit of a bummer. We'll get into it.</li><li><strong>FRIDAY:</strong> Beyond hearing Remap Radio, we'll kick off our all-day livestream with a variety of different games and fun times. You get a small hint: crowbar.</li></ul><p><em>If you have any support issues, send details on the issue to&nbsp;</em><a href="https://remapradio.com/r/53613e2c?m=c2a53baa-518b-4385-90e8-62545232c3f6"><em>support@remapradio.com</em></a><em>.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24163823/pale-heart-destination-final-shape-interview-bungie<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="ShQ8ex">The Pale Heart — the new location in<em> </em><a href="https://www.polygon.com/23841367/destiny-2-showcase-2023-final-shape-announcement-trailer-summary"><em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em></a>, which is located inside The Traveler — is more like a Destiny-themed funhouse than a completely new destination. And while that might sound like a boring or even disappointing way to end the first Destiny saga, it’s actually one of the most striking and engaging destinations in the franchise’s 10-year history.</p>
<p id="kAXq03">On a visit to Bungie HQ, I was able to explore The Pale Heart of The Traveler and learn about how exactly the studio is using Destiny nostalgia to fuel the end of the Light and Darkness saga. It’s a risky move to lean so heavily on the past, a fact that Bungie’s Catarina Macedo, project lead for <em>Destiny 2</em> expansions, and Ben Wommack, <em>Destiny 2</em>’s combat area lead, are well aware of. </p>
<p id="PqPvZc">“The Pale Heart specifically is shaped by the memories of whoever is there,” said Macedo. This is why there is a very “Earthy” feel to the start of The Pale Heart, and why the original<em> Destiny</em>’s Tower plays such a big role in the safer half of the space, since it’s influenced by the player character’s memories. At the same time, the other half of the destination is controlled by The Witness, which inspires a darker, creepier, and more abstract environment.</p>

</p>
<p id="gU7MPA">After speaking to Macedo and Wommack, I spent several hours just roaming through The Pale Heart, soaking it in, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/e/23927863">playing with the new Prismatic subclass</a>. And while I was initially worried about it feeling too much like other places I’ve visited before in Destiny, Bungie appears to have stuck the landing here — at least in everything I’ve seen so far. The Pale Heart strikes a very promising balance between pulling on my heartstrings as a longtime Destiny player <em>and </em>giving me a regular dose of something new.</p>
<p id="iiQLWQ">Every time I walked through a space I recognized, the environment shifted to something slightly different or off before the familiar area had a chance to overstay its welcome. For example, there’s the Tree of Silver Wings from Season of Arrivals inside The Pale Heart, but this version has been smashed together with Hive architecture from <em>The Witch Queen</em>. When you pair that together with the entirely unique environment around the tree, the area feels both new and familiar. </p>
<p id="3ZHwLF">It’s an effective trick — giving the brain a dose of “I recognize that” dopamine with a chaser of surrealism — one that I was constantly impressed by during my time at the event. It’s a bit hard to grasp how effective this is when you just read it on the page or see it in a quick gameplay video; I know I was skeptical before experiencing it myself. But the way Bungie has twisted its world here ends up being very effective. </p>

</p>
<p id="POGVRO">The entire trip left me feeling quite positive about <em>The Final Shape </em>expansion as a whole, but The Pale Heart genuinely wowed me in several places. Looking up to see The Speaker’s weird, mysterious machine covered in foliage next to two building-sized Ghosts forced me to stop and just take in the scenery for a moment. And that’s not something I do much in games that I’ve already spent thousands of hours in. </p>
<p id="7MXjBA">For longtime players like myself, it made me feel a bit like a kid in a candy store, to use a very tired simile. I was constantly stopping to go, “Oh wow, that’s this old location, but upside down!” or “I recognize this building, but how?” which was always followed by delight when I finally placed the memory. But the more I explored, the more the nostalgia became less important to the overall experience, and I found myself appreciating the whole package even more.</p>
<p id="BKrTiQ">I’m certain there will be some Destiny players out there who will be furious that Bungie reused so much old art to create The Pale Heart. But having experienced it, I think that’s the wrong way to look at it. Sure, I’ve been to this junkyard in the Cosmodrome before — it’s where I was first resurrected — but I don’t recall all the trees being shaped like hands back in the first <em>Destiny</em>. And that sounds so small, I know, but when you walk onto the abandoned highway and you see the hand trees growing up around The Witness’ massive fortress, the comfort of nostalgia is just enough to keep you pushing further into the unknown. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24163822/prismatic-final-shape-interview-bungie<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="mWbo27">When I first saw the debut trailer for <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24124362/destiny-2-final-shape-subclass-reveal-prismatic">Prismatic</a> — the new, “advanced” subclass coming to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/destiny-2-witch-queen-guide/23392341/beginners-guide-starting-tips-lightfall-expansion"><em>Destiny 2</em></a> in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23841285/destiny-2-showcase-time-when-how-to-watch-bungie"><em>The Final Shape</em></a> — I told my friends, “This is the most significant change they’ve ever announced for Destiny.” And after a visit to Bungie HQ in Bellevue, Washington, to play part of the expansion early, I’m convinced I was right.</p>
<p id="Y62g1B">“Putting Prismatic in is probably going to change Destiny on a fundamental level,” Ben Wommack, <em>Destiny 2</em>’s combat area lead, told me at our on-site interview. “But that’s kind of the intention of releasing that kind of feature in the game.” </p>
<p id="WUsJ9U">If you’re unfamiliar, Prismatic doesn’t add any new abilities to the game, like the Stasis or Strand Darkness subclasses that Guardians have gotten in previous years (although each class is getting <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23841367/destiny-2-showcase-2023-final-shape-announcement-trailer-summary">a new Super and Aspect</a> in <em>The Final Shape</em>, which is separate from Prismatic). Instead, the idea is that Guardians can combine elements together from all of their subclasses to create far more elaborate and powerful builds than ever before.</p>
<p id="jYbJhC">For example, if I currently want to use the Thundercrash Super on my Titan, I have to be on my Arc subclass, because Thundercrash is an Arc ability. Prismatic lifts those restrictions — mostly — so when <em>The Final Shape</em> launches, I can use Thundercrash for boss damage while also running around with a Strand Shackle grenade and a Void-throwing Shield. </p>

<p id="F8Y19p">Then there’s Transcendence, which is a new Super-like ability that you can charge up by dealing Light and Darkness damage in equal measure. Damage with Light-based weapons or abilities fills up the Light bar, while the opposite fills up the Darkness bar. When you’ve filled both bars, you can “Transcend,” which refills all of your ability energy, temporarily increases your weapon damage and defense, and gives you a Transcendence-exclusive grenade.</p>
<p id="PD0W9u">It’s all very overwhelming, but like Wommack said, that’s kind of the point. </p>
<p id="sQ5bXi">“I think this is really us giving a big love letter to the master build crafters of the game,” said Wommack. “We’re gonna give you a lot to think about. And we do want you to think about it, because we think about it.”</p>
<p id="f0N8xq">Catarina Macedo, the expansion project lead for <em>Destiny 2</em>, went on to say that Prismatic works from two angles: rewarding players who already have a lot of game knowledge — the “master build crafters” Wommack mentioned — and encouraging players who have very little experience with crafting builds to get in on the fun. Prismatic gives you so many more options than you’ve ever had in Destiny that it’s nearly impossible to look at the Prismatic customization screen and not think, <em>OK, how am I going to make these things work together?</em></p>
<p id="4V0FtD">Now, I’ve put together quite a few builds in my decade with Destiny, but during my preview I repeatedly found myself jumping into my menu and making slight tweaks to my Prismatic setup. Finding a way to consistently charge up my Transcendence meter felt like a real dance, and it had me thinking about how well my loadout synergized with my class setup. I’d gotten a sweet Stasis and Strand Titan build together that let me freeze and suspend everything, but without any Light abilities, I was having a really tough time getting the Light side of my Transcendence buff bar going.</p>

<p id="3S8ZFH">To fix it, I started changing up my weapons, and I swapped a Strand melee for an Arc one. Now kills with my primary and heavy weapons were contributing to my Light bar, while most of my abilities gave me Darkness energy. Every time I tried out a new build, I’d have to go through this iteration process. And each time, the game would reward me for it, as if every piece of the puzzle I managed to slot in made me that much stronger. I wasn’t just build-crafting so I could take down a big raid boss or a difficult Grandmaster Nightfall, I was doing it because it was fun.</p>
<p id="ymrzFO">Fun as it was, I did leave Bungie HQ with a few concerns regarding Prismatic. </p>
<p id="omgDh8">First, I felt so powerful using Prismatic that I couldn’t help but wonder how Bungie ever plans to challenge me again. The Legendary campaign missions I played felt much easier than <em>Lightfall </em>and <em>The Witch Queen </em>once I figured out how to maximize my newfound powers. But Bungie has <a href="https://youtu.be/RqIvKN4gtto?t=6188">already promised</a> that the new <em>Final Shape</em> raid is going to be one of the franchise’s hardest, and after the uber-difficult <a href="https://www.polygon.com/destiny-2-guide-walkthrough/23859673/crotas-end-raid-walkthrough">Crota’s End reprise</a> last summer, I’m willing to give Bungie the benefit of the doubt here.</p>
<p id="5JfBrY">My more serious concern was over what abilities and Aspects the developers have decided to include with Prismatic, as you can currently only pair certain abilities from each element together.</p>
<p id="2pIu4G">The team at Bungie decided to use some of the least popular Aspects from each class when making Prismatic. This meant I only had access to Aspects I don’t spend a lot of time using. On one hand, that was pretty exciting, as it helped the whole package feel fresh. On the other hand, I couldn’t help but wonder what kinds of builds I’d be able to make if Bungie removed the restrictions even more. </p>

<p id="L0sZX8">What if I could pair the Solar Titan’s Sol Invictus Sunspots Aspect with the Void Titan’s Controlled Demolition Aspect so I could spread explosive, healing puddles of fire around the entire arena? Surely that would be even stronger and harder to balance than the Prismatic I played during my preview — which is probably why both of those Aspects are unavailable for Prismatic. But the new subclass is so fun that it’s a bit of a bummer that I can’t just play out whatever bizarre Titan fever dream my brain can come up with.</p>
<p id="g8Qij5">That might sound like whining because you can only have cake <em>or </em>ice cream — and it kind of is — but that’s OK with the folks I spoke to at Bungie.</p>
<p id="qEthZJ">“We have a lot of future plans that we’re hoping to, you know, change and react to, depending on how players react to Prismatic in the first day, first weekend, through the raid race, through the first week,” said Wommack. He told me that the developers want and expect players to think about how non-Prismatic Aspects would impact their Prismatic build. But the hope is that those same players would also ask themselves questions like, “Well, how would Bungie balance that?”</p>
<p id="MaHWJa">There are a few ways to look at Wommack’s statement there, but to me it’s clear that Prismatic is an experiment, like Stasis was for the subclass 3.0 system back in 2020. Ahead of <em>The Final Shape</em>’s launch, that experiment is already the most interesting thing that’s come to Destiny in years. But what will this experiment look like in a few months, or even next year? That’s the question that all Destiny fans should really be asking once <em>The Final Shape</em> arrives on June 4. </p>

Upon buying into the membership, players will be given instant access to the ongoing season’s battle pass, be granted ten level skips to get ahead of the grind, and receive a Bravo pack, which is <em>Siege</em>’s equivalent to loot boxes. Every month, players will also be given ten more level skips and another Bravo pack on their renewal date. Finally, folks who subscribe to the sub will also get a cosmetic drop with one legendary item and whatever an Epic bundle might be on the 28th of each month.</p><p>There’s a decent amount of stuff there for the diehard fans of <em>Siege</em>, and the rest of the battle pass rewards also give out unique weapon and operator skins—as well as in-game currency to add value—but the timing of the sub couldn’t be worse. <em>Siege </em>is in the middle of its ninth year, which would be impressive if the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/rainbow-six/siege/game-info/roadmap&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/rainbow-six/siege/game-info/roadmap" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">current roadmap for the year</a></span> hadn’t already let down players with its gaping lack of new content.</p><p>The roadmap for the next half year includes a lot of reworks to existing characters and systems, and while part of <em>Siege</em>’s plans for a long while, it’s not met with a wealth of new additions to keep fans happy. Such reworkings are, at this point, a staple of maintaining a live-service title. These games can’t always just throw in new maps, characters and abilities <em>every</em> season, and at some point that constant growth slows to account for the imbalances it all creates. Eventually <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/apex-legends-season-20-evo-armor-legend-abilities-1851218153&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/apex-legends-season-20-evo-armor-legend-abilities-1851218153">whole systems and locations need to be reworked</a></span> or completely overhauled. </p><p>The same has happened to games as big as <em>League of Legends </em>and <em>Apex Legends</em>, however most games don’t go most of the year with as few additions as <em>Siege </em>is making in 2024. It has added one new character, and <em>Siege </em>will add at least two more over the next few seasons, but the absolute bulk of “additions” coming for the rest of the year are changes to things that already exist in the game, which is beginning to become a sore spot for the community at the moment. And then here comes a bunch of new cosmetics, but they’re locked behind a new paywall.</p><p>To throw further fuel on the fire, subscriptions like this are commonplace in games that are otherwise free-to-play, like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/fortnite&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/fortnite"><em>Fortnite</em></a></span><em>,</em> but <em>Siege </em>has remained a premium title over the years.

                <p dir="ltr">Ten years ago, the story of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny/" data-ref-id="5000-38799">Destiny</a> started with the Traveler, a god-like entity the size of a small moon, hovering over Earth and dispensing superpowers to humans to use against encroaching alien hordes. In <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-the-final-shape-release-date-new-exotics-and-everything-we-know/1100-6517377/" data-ref-id="1100-6517377">The Final Shape</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/" data-ref-id="5000-463450">Destiny 2</a>'s next expansion, we're finally primed to find out what's inside that massive robotic orb.</p><p dir="ltr">It's apparently pretty weird in there.</p><p dir="ltr">We've gotten a few brief glimpses into the Pale Heart of the Traveler, the new location where the final showdown between the heroes of humanity and the Witness, Destiny 2's primary antagonist, will take place. In a recent hands-off preview event, however, Bungie gave something of an extended look into the Pale Heart, a pocket of the universe where memories and emotions combine with the Traveler's near-magical paracausal power to redefine reality.</p><p dir="ltr">The Pale Heart is a place that, according to Bungie, draws on the experiences of whoever's inside it to create the world they see around them. In the early missions of The Final Shape's campaign, you'll see nostalgic elements from the last 10 years of Destiny folded into the landscape--things like giant Ghost shells and overgrown segments of old locations, levels, and social spaces.</p><p dir="ltr">But the Traveler's power, the Light, is clashing with the Darkness power wielded by the Witness, and that's also causing the landscape to twist and contort, especially as you delve deeper.</p><p dir="ltr">"You can kind of think of it like traversing a world in the process of being defragmented," said campaign lead Andrew Hopps during the preview.</p><p dir="ltr">While the preview didn't give an extensive overview of the expansion, it did provide some impressions of what players can expect, showing off portions of the first mission of its campaign and a later Strike that's also part of the story. The mission begins with the Guardian, the player's character, heading into the big pink portal into the Traveler that has been staring players in the face for the last year. It's not just a matter of stepping into the portal and popping out the other side, though. Instead, you'll make your way over a disjointed collection of chunks of architecture, spaceships, and terrestrial locations, all haphazardly thrown together. If the Pale Heart is combining different elements from memory to create a new reality, the portal feels like the place where all those bits are stored until they're needed; like the memories are manifesting into new objects, but without any guidance putting them together in a meaningful way.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4308416-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_campaign_m1_compressed_003.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4308416" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4308416-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_campaign_m1_compressed_003.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4308416"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4308416-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_campaign_m1_compressed_003.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">As is probably expected, the path through the portal is home to enemies who try to stop you. These include the Taken, which now sport a spooky yellow eye--an indicator of the Witness's control over them. This is also the place where you'll first start to encounter Destiny 2's new enemy faction, the Dread. Bungie previously detailed the different threats that make up the Witness's new army, but you'll start by running into Weavers, small enemies that use the Strand abilities introduced in the Lightfall expansion to nab you with ethereal ropes. Weavers can grab and yank you toward themselves and out of cover, exposing you to attack or, sometimes, just tossing you off a cliff.</p><p dir="ltr">Hopps noted that Bungie has spent time rebalancing the campaign's difficulty, particularly at the Legendary level. The idea is to make sure missions feel tough but fair, whether you're playing alone or with a team of one or two other people, although Hopps didn't go into specifics about what adjustments developers have made. Bungie is also putting a greater emphasis on adding raid- and dungeon-like mechanics to more missions, and in the preview, we saw elements like the Light and Darkness "seeds" that appear in Lightfall's Root of Nightmares raid. These don't work quite the same way as in the raid, and you'll be able to use all these mechanics as a solo player, Hopps said. But in both the campaign mission and the Strike shown during the presentation, there were additional mechanics that should make progressing through the Pale Heart a little more complex than just shooting a lot of monsters.</p><p dir="ltr">Bungie soon cut away from the portal portion of the mission, skipping ahead to after the player had finally fully entered the Traveler. Here, we got our first glimpses of the Pale Heart, where the early portions are lush and green. In some moments, plants and rocks are popping into being directly ahead of you as you walk, and soon you're finding strange sights, like chunks of the Last City and those huge Ghost shells, overgrown and almost ancient-looking as they poke out of the landscape.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4308418-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_campaign_m1_compressed_009.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4308418" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4308418-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_campaign_m1_compressed_009.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4308418"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4308418-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_campaign_m1_compressed_009.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4308446-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_campaign_m1_compressed_001.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4308447-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_campaign_m1_compressed_002.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4308448-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_campaign_m1_compressed_004.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4308449-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_campaign_m1_compressed_005.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4308450-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_campaign_m1_compressed_000.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4308446,1300-4308447,1300-4308448,1300-4308449,1300-4308450" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1581/15811374/4308446-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_campaign_m1_compressed_001.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1581/15811374/4308447-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_campaign_m1_compressed_002.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1581/15811374/4308448-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_campaign_m1_compressed_004.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1581/15811374/4308449-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_campaign_m1_compressed_005.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1581/15811374/4308450-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_campaign_m1_compressed_000.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4308446-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_campaign_m1_compressed_001.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4308447-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_campaign_m1_compressed_002.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4308448-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_campaign_m1_compressed_004.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4308449-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_campaign_m1_compressed_005.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4308450-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_campaign_m1_compressed_000.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"This was something that we did from the beginning in concept for The Final Shape, that we really wanted this big moment after the 10 years of the Light and Darkness Saga to invoke a lot of nostalgia from the players," said expansions project lead Catarina Macedo. "And one of the ways we wanted to do that was by the environment that you go through. So we had this idea that as you go into the Traveler, everything around you is shaped by these memories of you being a Guardian, places that you've been to, things that you've seen, scenes that you've lived."</p><p dir="ltr">The level sends the player passing through these overgrown chunks of the City, where they encounter more Dread enemies. These include the "bats with guns," the Grim, which sport a stunning shriek ability that can be particularly dangerous if it nails you while you're trying something harrowing like jumping over a gap. The Grim are also the first flying enemies in Destiny 2 that have wings, which means they bob up and down as you fight them, adding a slightly different wrinkle to combat. Even farther in, players run into a Harbinger--a new Dread enemy that occupies the same place as the Tormentor in terms of danger presented to opponents. Where Tormentors feel like smaller versions of the Root of Nightmare boss Nezarec, Harbingers are more similar to Rhulk, the boss of the Vow of the Disciple raid.</p><p dir="ltr">The Harbinger also wields Strand abilities, turning some player powers back against them. The Harbinger can suspend you with Strand the exact same way opponents can in player-vs.-player battles, locking you in place and opening you up to serious damage. Harbingers generally are less mobile than Tormentors but rely on ranged fighting rather than melee attacks.</p><p dir="ltr">The landscape of the Pale Heart is reacting to the presence of Guardians, filling the world with elements from their memories and experiences. But the Witness is also having the same effect, and things will get more corrupted and darker as you draw closer to it.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4308423-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_campaign_m5_compressed_000.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4308423" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4308423-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_campaign_m5_compressed_000.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4308423"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4308423-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_campaign_m5_compressed_000.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4308451-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_campaign_m1_compressed_007.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4308452-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_campaign_m1_compressed_008.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4308453-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_campaign_m1_compressed_010.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4308454-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_campaign_m1_compressed_006.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4308451,1300-4308452,1300-4308453,1300-4308454" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1581/15811374/4308451-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_campaign_m1_compressed_007.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1581/15811374/4308452-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_campaign_m1_compressed_008.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1581/15811374/4308453-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_campaign_m1_compressed_010.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1581/15811374/4308454-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_campaign_m1_compressed_006.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4308451-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_campaign_m1_compressed_007.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4308452-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_campaign_m1_compressed_008.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4308453-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_campaign_m1_compressed_010.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4308454-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_campaign_m1_compressed_006.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"We're doing this thing, kind of for the first time, where we do a lot of storytelling through the environment," said game director Tyson Green. "You travel from a place where you know where you are and what's going on, and it feels relatively safe, into a place of increasing danger and proximity to the Witness. It's really a very striking environmental journey that we haven't really done with any of our previous expansions."</p><p dir="ltr">After the first mission, Bungie showed off a new Strike that takes place about halfway through the campaign. Here, we've ventured deeper into the Pale Heart in pursuit of the Witness, and the landscape has changed drastically, becoming more rocky, desolate, and barren. This one is themed after Destiny's "wish dragons," the Ahamkara, with players facing a huge Tormentor boss known as "Tormentor of the Ahamkara."</p><p dir="ltr">"One of the things that we've seen even in previous releases, especially when we started getting into the pyramids and seeing what their architecture looks like, we saw a lot of reshaping of normal objects. I'm sure everyone remembers the horse with many butts and all that," Macedo said. "Because the Witness is trying to enact the Final Shape [and] reshape everything to perfect stillness, one of the big things that we wanted to do as the Guardian gets closer to the spire where the Witness is at the center of the Pale Heart, we wanted to bring more of that distortion and reshaping, and more unease, and that feeling that this isn't quite right."</p><p dir="ltr">"So that was the big inspiration behind that: Take that language and basically turn the knob all the way to 100, and see how twisted can we get," Macedo continued.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4308445-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_strike_compressed_007.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4308445" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4308445-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_strike_compressed_007.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4308445"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4308445-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_strike_compressed_007.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4308455-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_campaign_m5_compressed_001.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4308456-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_campaign_m5_compressed_002.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4308457-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_campaign_m5_compressed_003.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4308458-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_campaign_m5_compressed_004.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4308459-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_campaign_m5_compressed_005.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4308460-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_campaign_m5_compressed_006.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4308455,1300-4308456,1300-4308457,1300-4308458,1300-4308459,1300-4308460" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1581/15811374/4308455-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_campaign_m5_compressed_001.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1581/15811374/4308456-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_campaign_m5_compressed_002.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1581/15811374/4308457-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_campaign_m5_compressed_003.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1581/15811374/4308458-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_campaign_m5_compressed_004.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1581/15811374/4308459-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_campaign_m5_compressed_005.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1581/15811374/4308460-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_campaign_m5_compressed_006.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4308455-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_campaign_m5_compressed_001.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4308456-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_campaign_m5_compressed_002.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4308457-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_campaign_m5_compressed_003.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4308458-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_campaign_m5_compressed_004.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4308459-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_campaign_m5_compressed_005.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4308460-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_campaign_m5_compressed_006.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The Strike includes Dread enemies and Taken, while also introducing another foe players will face: the Lucent Brood, the Hive under the control of Savathun, the Witch Queen. Savathun and her forces are also trying to oppose the Witness, Green noted, but that doesn't necessarily mean they're on your side. In the Strike, you'll fight Lucent Hive on a few different occasions.</p><p dir="ltr">Like the campaign, the Strike also works in new mechanics that are a little more comparable to dungeons or raids than we've seen in previous strikes. You chase the Tormentor through the Strike, working through gaping caves and barren valleys. As you fight the Strike's major battles against enemies like Harbingers, you'll find weird Darkness goo flooding into the area, as well as major opponents with unbreakable shields. To clear them, you'll need to seek out nearby Ahamkara skulls. Finding an item called Taken Essence allows you to empower the skulls, breaking the shields. It's <em>getting</em> the Taken Essence, however, that's the tough part.</p><p dir="ltr">Usually, you'll venture into a side room in search of what you need to empower the Ahamkara skulls. In the sections we saw, the rooms are full of walls and platforms, and when you grab the Taken Essence at the far end, you have to run back as Darkness sludge fills in around you. In one room, the walls close in toward you like a trap in an Indiana Jones movie, forcing you to leap over and duck under obstacles as you hustle out. In another, the sludge fills the room from the floor up, so you need to climb up platforms to avoid it on your way out.</p><p dir="ltr">In a later area, you leap through a hole in the wall to find yourself in an environment similar to the inside of Riven, the Ahamkara that serves as the final boss of the Last Wish raid, further solidifying the strange architecture and the reshaping of reality within the Pale Heart. In another section, you'll cross through a hallway filled with giant arms made of stone. The statues serve as platforms, and take the shapes of human and Hive hands, as well as Ahamkara tentacles.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large"

dir="ltr">Also among the locations in the Strike was a town made of the same architecture we've seen inside the pyramid ships of the Black Fleet--suggesting that this location might have manifested from the Witness's memories.</p><p dir="ltr">"We don't want to get into spoilers, but a lot of what you'll see are not just your memories, but memories of other things that are in the Pale Heart--so the Witness, even the Dread," Green said. "So there'll be a couple deep lore callouts in there that I can't wait for people to tease out and bring to light."</p><p dir="ltr">Bungie ended the preview shortly before the end of the Strike, leaving us guessing where else the campaign of The Final Shape will take players, or what else the world will offer. But we do know that, like Neomuna and Savathun's Throne World, the Pale Heart of the Traveler is a new location you'll be able to freely explore. The story will also stretch beyond the first week, according to Hopps.</p><p dir="ltr">"I would argue this is our biggest campaign to date," Hopps said.

                <p dir="ltr">When players jump into the story campaign for Destiny 2's next expansion, The Final Shape, they'll pretty quickly unlock one of the biggest new parts of the game: Prismatic. The new subclass is necessary to complete The Final Shape's story, just like Strand was when it was introduced in Destiny 2's last expansion, Lightfall.</p><p dir="ltr">But unlike how Lightfall handled its new player abilities, Bungie says you'll get Prismatic early in The Final Shape, and you'll have access to it for the duration--it won't be parceled out in short bursts and only fully unlocked many hours later, once you finish the campaign.</p><p dir="ltr">Bungie gave a pretty close look at Prismatic in action, and The Final Shape's campaign generally, in a recent hands-off preview event attended by GameSpot. The preview showed a big chunk of the campaign's first mission, as well as a later Strike mission that becomes available about halfway through the story. As in Lightfall, the new subclass is an essential part of the story of The Final Shape, and you'll make use of it as you go, but with a lot fewer restrictions this time around.</p><p dir="ltr">Prismatic is less a totally new subclass than a new combination of old elements. It pieces together different parts of existing subclasses, like supers, melee and grenade abilities, and passive buffs, allowing you to access several different kinds of powers--specifically both Light and Dark abilities--that you previously couldn't utilize at the same time.</p><p dir="ltr">The subclass also comes with a new ability called Transcendence, which Bungie described as being like a "mini-super." While using the Prismatic subclass, dealing damage with your abilities and weapons charges up two meters, one for Light and one for Darkness. (Kinetic weapons increase both meters but at a lower rate than weapons with specific elemental damage types.) When both are full, you can activate Transcendence, which gives you increased damage reduction, speeds the recharging of your abilities, and gives you a new grenade ability that combines Light and Darkness damage types.</p><p dir="ltr">Prismatic as a concept starts to show up as you make your way through the first campaign mission. You'll first traverse the big pink portal into the Traveler that's been staring at players for the last year. Inside, you'll encounter the Taken, who Destiny 2's major antagonist, the Witness, is controlling more directly than ever before. You'll also soon encounter enemies who are "bound" by the Witness, receiving power from the Witness directly, which provides them with shields that can't be broken with your normal abilities or weapons. When you first run into them in the starting mission while traversing the portal, you'll have to flee.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4308476-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_campaign_m1_compressed_003.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4308476" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4308476-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_campaign_m1_compressed_003.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4308476"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4308476-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_campaign_m1_compressed_003.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">A major element of The Final Shape is the fact that the Traveler's Light power and the Witness's Darkness are commingling within the expansion's new destination, the Pale Heart of the Traveler. After running into the bound enemies, the preview skipped ahead to a later part of that same first campaign mission, when players find themselves inside the Traveler for the first time.</p><p dir="ltr">Alongside encountering more enemies, including the new Dread faction, you'll start to find places where the Light and the Darkness have collided to create strange wellsprings of power. Standing in those springs allows you to briefly access Transcendence, much like players could activate Strand briefly at certain points in Lightfall. Transcendence gives you a chance to try out Prismatic in short bursts and to break those bound enemies' shields. However, unlike Strand, you can run back to these wellsprings again and again during a battle if you want (and can survive), allowing you to regain Transcendence as needed.</p><p dir="ltr">Transcendence is especially useful against some of the new enemies The Final Shape is introducing to the game. At the end of the first campaign mission, we saw a boss fight against a Harbinger, one of the tougher new baddies, which wields Strand abilities against the player. Harbingers take after Rhulk, the boss of The Witch Queen expansion's Vow of the Disciple raid; they're tough to kill and use ranged weapons against you. They also have the ability to suspend you, much like players can do to each other in Destiny 2's player-vs.-player mode, the Crucible, rendering you immobile and vulnerable for a few seconds. Using Transcendence isn't essential to winning the fight once you've killed any bound enemies, but its new abilities and perks can definitely be helpful.</p><p dir="ltr">While you'll be able to use Transcendence during missions by finding its wellsprings, The Final Shape doesn't just lock Prismatic up behind these environmental activation points. By the end of the first mission, you'll have entered a strange, overgrown version of the Tower from the original Destiny and ventured into the room where the Vanguard leaders used to hang out. In that place of power, you'll find a well of energy so powerful, it permanently unlocks Prismatic, allowing you to use the subclass for the rest of the campaign.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4308477-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_combat_compressed_008.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4308477" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4308477-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_combat_compressed_008.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4308477"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4308477-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_combat_compressed_008.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The thing is, while you'll get Prismatic right away, Bungie doesn't want you to feel like you're either forced to use it, or forced not to. If you've got other character builds you're comfortable with and want to use throughout The Final Shape's campaign, combat area lead Ben Wommack said, you'll be able to do that. The wellsprings give you a shorter-duration version of Transcendence so you can try it out and get through fights that require it, but you can still stick with your favorite subclass if you'd prefer.</p><p dir="ltr">"One of the things about Prismatic that we wanted to be very careful of is, we didn't want to make Prismatic at the top of every other build, supplanting every other build you can do it with," Wommack said. "That's not good gameplay; it's not fun. We want Prismatic to be this amazing new tool, not the thing that supplants everything else."</p><p dir="ltr">During the preview presentation, Bungie showed off the Hunter take on Prismatic. This one combined elements like the Stasis melee ability Withering Blade, the Void buff Stylish Executioner, the Solar grenade ability Gunpowder Gamble, and the new Arc super ability, Storm's Edge. It also detailed how Bungie has adjusted these abilities to make them work better with Prismatic. For example, in a Void build, Stylish Executioner will turn you invisible when you kill an enemy suffering from a Void-based debuff. With the Prismatic version, <em>any</em> debuff can trigger Stylish Executioner, including the Stasis slowing effect enemies get when you hit them with Withering Blade.</p><p dir="ltr">When you first unlock the new subclass, Wommack said, you'll start with a "curated" version that combines specific abilities. Bungie went through a lot of iterations to make sure that each class's starting version of Prismatic would be a compelling combination of elements that make the subclass worth playing with, but without making other builds obsolete.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4308478-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_combat_compressed_003.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4308478" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4308478-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_combat_compressed_003.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4308478"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4308478-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_combat_compressed_003.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">However, Prismatic is built on customization. You won't be able to mix and match every perk, ability, and super from your other subclasses together, but you will have access to a lot of them. Adding more options requires unlocking Aspects and Fragments that give you different abilities and benefits, like with past subclasses.</p><p dir="ltr">But where Lightfall had you killing enemies to earn "Strand Meditations" in order to unlock different elements of the subclass, a system many players didn't really like, The Final Shape will award you with Aspects and Fragments as you work through the story campaign, or from exploring the Pale Heart. There should also be less grind in getting everything you need for effective builds on all three of your characters. While the preview showed off a Prismatic build for Hunters, all three classes will have plenty to work with.</p><p dir="ltr">"We wanted to give every class an equivalent amount of build options," Wommack said. "We're doing something with the Fragments where there's a shared pool they all have, so if you have Fragments you unlocked on your Hunter, then you can use those Fragments on your Warlock or Titan. So we're trying really hard not to play favorites."</p><p dir="ltr">The focus on making sure players can gain Prismatic and all its customization elements through the campaign also helps guarantee it'll be available for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-the-final-shape-raid-launch-time-and-everything-we-know/1100-6522790/">The Final Shape's raid</a>, which launches just three days after the expansion's release.</p><p dir="ltr">"You will be able to fully unlock Prismatic by playing through the campaign and the journey in the Pale Heart before the raid launches," Wommack confirmed. "That is something that everyone is going to have access to and be able to accomplish."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4308479-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_combat_compressed_006.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4308479" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4308479-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_combat_compressed_006.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4308479"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4308479-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_combat_compressed_006.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">At the launch of The Final Shape, only certain abilities and elements will be available as part of Prismatic--you won't be able to mix and match every single melee ability or super into a new subclass of your choosing. In addition to keeping Prismatic from replacing all the other, more specific subclasses, Bungie limited the options to make sure the subclass would be balanced, especially in the Crucible, Destiny 2's player.-vs.-player mode.</p><p dir="ltr">Wommack said Bungie wants to see how players handle Prismatic, and how it impacts the game, before thinking too much about what other elements and abilities it might add to the subclass later.</p><p dir="ltr">"We're kind of reserving any future decision about what we add to Prismatic until we actually get it out there into people's hands and see how it's doing," he said. "We're going to pay a lot of attention to what the balance is and what the impact is, and in PvP, of course. We're paying a lot of attention to what Transcendence up time is in PvP, just like with super up-time, that economy is super important and we put a lot of thought into it."</p><p dir="ltr">As game director Tyson Green noted, despite the fact Bungie has done a lot of testing on Prismatic, it's still impossible to say what will happen once it's in the hands of the Destiny 2 community.</p><p dir="ltr">"On the first day when players get their hands on Prismatic, they'll get about 1,000 times more playtest time than we've ever been able to put into it during development," Green said. "We're going to learn a lot during the first 24 or 48 hours,and we're going to react to that, because that's what we do."</p><p dir="ltr">For more from the preview event, check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2s-final-shape-brings-new-depth-to-its-missions-and-defragmented-world/1100-6523728/" data-ref-id="1100-6523728">what we learned about the new destination, the Pale Heart of the Traveler</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">The Final Shape is set to release on June 4.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/here-are-your-june-playstation-plus-monthly-games/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=here-are-your-june-playstation-plus-monthly-games<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="285" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">As part of its annual Days of Play 2024 event, PlayStation today revealed its lineup of monthly games for those subscribed to PlayStation Plus in the month of June. If you feel like the monthly games lineup has been weak as of late, I doubt the games for June will change that feeling.</p> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <h2 id="h-the-monthly-games-for-june-on-ps" data-injectable="false">The Monthly Games for June on PS+</h2> <p data-characters="116" data-current-count="416" data-injectable="true">The three monthly games for June on PlayStation Plus became available for members on June 4, and here are the games:</p>
 <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="120" data-injectable="false"> <li><em>AEW Fight Forever</em></li> <li><em>SpongeBob Squarepants: The Cosmic Shake</em></li> <li><em>Streets of Rage 4</em></li> </ul> <p data-characters="579" data-current-count="699" data-injectable="true">Hopefully a dream lineup for you included two fighting games and a SpongeBob game, because that’s what we got. <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-streets-of-rage-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Streets of Rage 4</em> is actually a pretty solid game</a>, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/cosmic-shake-review-spongebob-squarepants/">as is <em>SpongeBob Squarepants: The Cosmic Shake</em></a>, but neither are exactly major releases by any means. <em>AEW Fight Forever</em> isn’t my cup of tea, and <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/aew-fight-forever/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">based on Metacritic scores</a> it’s rather average anyway. Overall this just feels like yet another lackluster “What can we grab from the bargain bin” type month for PlayStation Plus, which unfortunately has been pretty part for the course lately.</p>
 <p data-characters="171" data-current-count="171" data-injectable="false">If you haven’t grabbed it yet, one of the May Monthly Games, <em>EA Sports FC 24</em> will remain available for PS+ members until June 18, so make sure you redeem it by then.</p> <p data-characters="133" data-current-count="304" data-injectable="false">Here are the rest of the new additions coming to the PS+ Game Catalog, Classic Catalog, PS VR2 and Game Trials for the month of June:</p> <p data-characters="12" data-current-count="316" data-injectable="false"><strong>PS VR2 Games</strong></p> <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="516" data-injectable="true"> <li><em>Before Your Eyes</em></li> <li><em>Ghostbusters; Rise of the Ghost Lord</em></li> <li><em>Synth Riders</em></li> <li><em>Walkabout Mini Golf</em></li> <li><em>The Walking Dead: Saints &amp; Sinners – Chapters 1 &amp; 2</em></li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="12" data-current-count="12" data-injectable="false"><strong>PS2 Classics</strong></p> <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="132" data-injectable="false"> <li><em>Sly Cooper and the Thievius Racoonus</em></li> <li><em>Star Wars: The Clone Wars</em></li> <li><em>Tomb Raider Legend</em></li> </ul> <p data-characters="22" data-current-count="154" data-injectable="false"><strong>Game Catalog Additions</strong></p> <ul data-found-items="4" data-current-count="314" data-injectable="false"> <li><em>Cricket 24</em> (PS4 and PS5 on June 5)</li> <li><em>Dredge</em> (PS4 and PS5 on May 29)</li> <li><em>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas – The Definitive Edition</em> (PS4 and PS5 on June 7)</li> <li><em>Lego Marvel Super Heroes 2</em> (PS4 on May 31)</li> </ul> <p data-characters="251" data-current-count="565" data-injectable="false">Also, on May 29 a Game Trial for <em>WWE 2K24</em> will become available for Premium members on PS4 and PS5. Even though the actual monthly games are a bit of a let down, <em>Dredge </em>is a lot of fun, and I’ll never turn down a reason to play <em>Sly Cooper</em> again.</p>

<p>For long-time fans of the survival horror genre, we’re living in something of a renaissance. We routinely receive high-quality remakes and remasters of our favorite old-school horror games. Then, you have upcoming AA and AAA horror titles and the indie horror gaming scene. It’s an excellent time to be a horror gaming fan. But what about the Silent Hill 2 Remake release date? That’s what we want to know more about!</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-the-silent-hill-2-remake-release-date">Do We Know the Silent Hill 2 Remake Release Date?</h2>



<p>Unfortunately, there is no word yet as to an official release date for Silent Hill 2 Remake. That said, Konami recently announced <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/silent-hill-transmission-event/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Silent Hill Transmission</a>, an upcoming showcase in which they’ll reveal more about their survival horror remake. We might even see a few other projects from within the series.</p>



<p>While unconfirmed, we may see additional gameplay from Silent Hill 2 Remake and a potential release date or window during the upcoming showcase. The publisher announced the survival horror remake in October 2022; by then, development had been ongoing for an unknown period. By now, the remake should be nearly finished, so we’re hoping for a fall release window, perhaps around Halloween.</p>



<p>Once we have an official release date, you’ll be the first to know right here on Insider Gaming!</p>







<h2 id="h-is-silent-hill-2-a-remake-or-remaster">Is Silent Hill 2 a Remake or Remaster?</h2>



<p>There’s a difference between “remake” and “remaster,” despite some developers and fans confusing the two terms. A remaster is simply an update to an existing game that enhances the graphics and sound while retaining much of its original gameplay elements. It’s a way to ensure you can still enjoy your favorite classics on modern hardware.</p>



<p>A remake, however, completely redoes the entire experience from the ground up in—often—a brand-new engine for modern times. It features enhanced gameplay elements for the contemporary player, better graphics, occasionally new content, and plenty of quality-of-life tweaks to the core experience. It’s the best way to play an old-school classic!</p>



<p>Well, you’ll be excited to know that the upcoming Silent Hill 2 is a genuine remake, built for the modern audience!</p>



<hr>



<p>While it’s fantastic that we’ll see more of the Silent Hill franchise soon, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-9-isnt-coming-anytime-soon-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil 9 isn’t so lucky and may not launch anytime soon</a>. For more about your favorite games, we recommend signing up for the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/visit/newsletter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Newsletter</a>!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/best-mortefi-build-wuthering-waves-weapons-echoes-and-team-comp/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=best-mortefi-build-wuthering-waves-weapons-echoes-and-team-comp<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="271" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Considered the best offensive support in <em>Wuthering Waves</em>, Mortefi is capable of massively buffing the Heavy Attacks of his companions with his Outro Skill. He also shines through his ability to deal a fair amount of coordinated damage after triggering Burning Rhapsody. </p> <p data-characters="200" data-current-count="200" data-injectable="false">True to that, building him is a must for all looking to both awaken his true potential and that of some of the game’s best damage dealers. Here’s the best Mortefi build in <em>Wuthering Waves</em>.</p> <h2 id="h-best-weapons-for-mortefi" data-injectable="false">Best Weapons for Mortefi </h2> <p data-characters="397" data-current-count="597" data-injectable="true">The best weapon for Mortefi in <em>Wuthering Waves</em> is the 5-star Static Mist. The weapon fits him like a glove by providing a total of 24.3% Crit Rate when at level 90. Static Mist will also boost his Energy Regen value by 12.8% and will allow Mortefi to provide even more buffs by increasing the ATK of the resonator taking the field after him by 10%. The values are referent to the weapon at Rank 1.</p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">Best 4-star Alternatives</h3> <p data-characters="379" data-current-count="379" data-injectable="false">As a support/sub-DPS whose kit revolves around using his Resonance Liberation, the best 4-star weapon for Mortefi is Cadenza. The pistol is my main pick, given its 51.8% Energy Regen stat at level 90. To help make rotations easier, Cadenza will also provide Mortefi with Concerto Energy after he performs his Skill. The effect can only be triggered once per 20-second intervals. </p> <p data-characters="358" data-current-count="737" data-injectable="true">If you are looking for damage over utility, Novaburst will be my main pick. Keep in mind that although the weapon offers a massive increase in ATK, the lack of vital secondary stats like Crit and ER will be felt. To add to the above, here’s an overview of our main 5 and 4-star picks, as well as a 3-star weapon sure to excel in Mortefi’s hands. </p>
 <figure data-found-rows="4" data-current-count="460" data-injectable="true"><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Best Weapons for Mortefi / Main Stat</th><th data-align="center">Reasons Why</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Static Mist (Best in Slot by a large margin) / Crit Rate</td><td data-align="center">Provides a massive amount of Crit Rate, while also buffing his ER value and allowing him to buff your DPS with an extra 10% ATK. </td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Cadenza (main 4-star pick) / ER</td><td data-align="center">Offers a great Energy Regen sum and allows him to gain Concerto Energy by performing his Skill.</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Novabuirst (Best 4-star for those looking for damage above utility) / ATK</td><td data-align="center">Boasts a high overall ATK value and will allow him to further enhance his Attack by up to 12% by dashing and dodging. </td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Pistols of Night (Best 3-star) / ATK</td><td data-align="center">Provides a high amount of ATK when at R5. Capable of rivaling that of our 4-star picks.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Best Sonata and Echoes for Mortefi in WuWa</h2> <p data-characters="281" data-current-count="281" data-injectable="false">The best Sonata for Mortefi is a 5-piece Moonlit Clouds. Once active, the Sonata will buff his ER by 10% and allow his Outro Skill to also boost the ATK of the character taking the field by 22.5%. The ATK boost will last for 15 seconds or until the affected unit leaves the field. </p> <p data-characters="300" data-current-count="581" data-injectable="true">For the Echoes, I recommend that you go with Impermanence Heron as your main in a one Overlord, two Common, and two Elites composition. Impermanence Heron is vital in the main slot given its ability to enhance the buff provided by Mortefi’s Outro Skill with a 15-second 12% Damage Bonus effect.</p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">Best Echo stats and substats for building Mortefi</h3> <figure data-wp-context="{ &quot;core&quot;: 				{ &quot;image&quot;: 					{   &quot;imageLoaded&quot;: false, 						&quot;initialized&quot;: false, 						&quot;lightboxEnabled&quot;: false, 						&quot;hideAnimationEnabled&quot;: false, 						&quot;preloadInitialized&quot;: false, 						&quot;lightboxAnimation&quot;: &quot;zoom&quot;, 						&quot;imageUploadedSrc&quot;: &quot;https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Best-Mortefi-Build-in-Wuthering-Waves-Best-Echoes.jpg&quot;, 						&quot;imageCurrentSrc&quot;: &quot;&quot;, 						&quot;targetWidth&quot;: &quot;1200&quot;, 						&quot;targetHeight&quot;: &quot;675&quot;, 						&quot;scaleAttr&quot;: &quot;&quot;, 						&quot;dialogLabel&quot;: &quot;Enlarged image&quot; 					} 				} 			}" data-wp-interactive="" data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption> <div data-wp-body="" data-wp-bind--role="selectors.core.image.roleAttribute" data-wp-bind--aria-label="selectors.core.image.dialogLabel" data-wp-class--initialized="context.core.image.initialized" data-wp-class--active="context.core.image.lightboxEnabled" data-wp-class--hideanimationenabled="context.core.image.hideAnimationEnabled" data-wp-bind--aria-modal="selectors.core.image.ariaModal" data-wp-effect="effects.core.image.initLightbox" data-wp-on--keydown="actions.core.image.handleKeydown" data-wp-on--touchstart="actions.core.image.handleTouchStart" data-wp-on--touchmove="actions.core.image.handleTouchMove" data-wp-on--touchend="actions.core.image.handleTouchEnd" data-wp-on--click="actions.core.image.hideLightbox" tabindex="-1"> <p> <figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> </p> <p> <figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> </p>  </div></figure> <p data-characters="314" data-current-count="614" data-injectable="true">Go with Crit Rate as the main stat for the Impermanence Heron. This is a must, as Mortefi needs to be able to perform frequent criticals to excel as a sub-DPS. For the other echoes, I recommend going with a Fusion DMG pair, followed by Energy Regen and ATK. If using an ER weapon, change the latter to double ATK. </p>
 <p data-characters="163" data-current-count="163" data-injectable="false">Focus on Crit Rate, Energy Regen, Crit DMG, and ATK when talking substats. Lastly, try to get his Rate and ER values to at least 60 and 130% for optimal results. </p> <h3 data-injectable="false">Are Mortefi’s Resonance Chain Nodes a must?</h3> <figure data-current-count="463" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="234" data-current-count="234" data-injectable="false">Although not a must, unlocking Cathartic Waltz (his fourth Resonance Chain Node) will massively boost Mortefi’s potential. When unlocked, the node will increase the uptime of Burning Rhapsody by seven seconds for a total of 17. </p> <h2 data-injectable="false">Best teams for Mortefi in Wuthering Waves</h2> <p data-characters="390" data-current-count="624" data-injectable="true">As Mortefi’s flames burn the brightest when paired with DPSs reliant on Heavy Attacks, the best team for him will feature <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-jiyan-build-in-wuthering-waves-weapons-echoes-and-team-compositions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jiyan</a> as its main DPS and Verina as its healer/sub-DPS. This composition will rely on using Mortefi to massively buff Jiyan’s Qingloong Mode damage. Apart from her healing, we will also have in Verina a secondary source of off-the-field damage and buffs. </p>
 <p data-characters="212" data-current-count="212" data-injectable="false">Thanks to their ability to perform enhanced Heavy Attacks within low intervals, Rover (Havoc) and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-danjin-build-in-wuthering-waves-weapons-echoes-and-team-compositions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Danjin</a> can also work well in the main DPS role. For the healer spot, Baizhi can fill in extremely well for Verina.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/you-can-get-a-4-star-weapon-of-your-choice-for-lampylumen-in-wuthering-waves/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=you-can-get-a-4-star-weapon-of-your-choice-for-lampylumen-in-wuthering-waves<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="307" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">If you’re looking for a strong weapon in <em>Wuthering Waves</em>, there’s a couple of places to find them without entering into the gacha system. One, the Dauntless Evernight (a Broadsword), can be found at the top of the skyscraper where you battle Inferno Rider, and another can be purchased using Lampylumen.</p> <p data-characters="428" data-current-count="428" data-injectable="true">Lampylumen is an ore resource which can be found in various places around Jinzhou, but it’s most heavily concentrated in the area where you battle Lampylumen Myriad in the tunnels beneath Tiger’s Maw Mine, accessed through the core of the tower in the middle of the mine itself. However, getting your hands on this 4-star weapon isn’t straightforward, and comes with a couple prerequisites to unlock the vendor you need.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="104" data-current-count="104" data-injectable="false">Namely, you’ll need to complete the first two acts of the Tiger’s Maw Exploration quests, which are:</p> <ul data-found-items="2" data-current-count="184" data-injectable="false"> <li>Tiger’s Maw Act I: Hidden Dangers in Peaceful Life</li> <li>Tiger’s Maw Act II: Shadows of the Past</li> </ul> <p data-characters="245" data-current-count="429" data-injectable="true">It’s worth noting that, <strong>between these two quests, you will need to wait for 24 hours of real time to pass</strong>. Xiaoyu will not contact you before at least 24 hours have passed, so it’s a good time to get some side quests and some sleep in.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="237" data-current-count="237" data-injectable="false">Once you’ve completed these two quests, you’ll unlock a brand new vendor within Tiger’s Maw named Shilang, who will show up as a padlock shaped marker on the map.&nbsp;To access his wares, speak to him and select Tiger’s Maw Ore.</p> <h2 id="h-items-available-from-shilang-in-wuthering-waves" data-injectable="false"><strong>Items available from Shilang in </strong><strong><em>Wuthering Waves</em></strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="537" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="310" data-current-count="310" data-injectable="false">There’s a number of items available from Shilang in exchange for Lampylumen, but the biggest star here is the ability to purchase a 4 star weapon of your choice. The Originite Weapon Supply Chest costs 80 Lampylumen and contains one of the following weapons, depending on the choice you make when purchasing:</p> <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="510" data-injectable="true"> <li>Broadblade</li> <li>Sword</li> <li>Pistols</li> <li>Gauntlets</li> <li>Rectifier</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="42" data-current-count="42" data-injectable="false">The other items available to purchase are:</p> <figure data-found-rows="10" data-current-count="742" data-injectable="false"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Item</strong></td><td><strong>Cost in Lampylumen</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Medium Energy Core</td><td>2 each</td></tr><tr><td>Advance Energy Core</td><td>5 each</td></tr><tr><td>Premium Energy Core</td><td>10 each</td></tr><tr><td>Shell Credit (2,000)&nbsp;</td><td>1 each</td></tr><tr><td>Reactive Metallic Drip</td><td>3 each</td></tr><tr><td>Waveworn Residue 226</td><td>3 each</td></tr><tr><td>Extracted Phlogiston</td><td>3 each</td></tr><tr><td>Cadence Bud</td><td>3 each</td></tr><tr><td>Adagio Helix</td><td>3 each</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<p data-characters="368" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Wuthering Waves</em> has turned out to be a pretty solid addition to the gacha game lineup, sporting an intense combat system and a solid amount of power systems and collection mechanics that have kept me playing over its first few days. Still, like many game releases, not everything has gone smoothly, and the first few days since release have&nbsp;been plagued&nbsp;with issues.</p> <p data-characters="298" data-current-count="298" data-injectable="false">Kuro Games has <a href="https://wutheringwaves.kurogames.com/en/main/news/detail/790" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">been working hard to correct</a> many of these issues, and some patches have already started to roll out.&nbsp;To further apologize for the rough start, Kuro Games has also been&nbsp;handing out some goodies to players.&nbsp;The most anticipated&nbsp;of these&nbsp;is a voucher for a free basic 5-star unit.</p> <figure data-current-count="598" data-injectable="true"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Dear Rovers,<br>After yesterday's post, we have some new updates to share with you regarding our future plans for game improvements.<br>– We plan to make every type of story content skippable in future updates, giving you more control over your gameplay.

 <h2 id="h-how-do-you-get-the-free-5-star-voucher" data-injectable="false">How Do You Get the Free 5-star Voucher?</h2> <p data-characters="59" data-current-count="59" data-injectable="false">Getting the voucher is as simple as opening the mail.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="310" data-current-count="369" data-injectable="false">A letter will be sent to your&nbsp;mailbox,&nbsp;containing an item called the Voucher of Reciprocal Tides. Once you have acquired your item,&nbsp;simply&nbsp;go to the banners page&nbsp;and&nbsp;there will be an option to exchange the voucher for a basic 5-star unit. The units available are as follows:&nbsp;</p> <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="569" data-injectable="true"> <li>Verina</li> <li>Encore</li> <li>Lingyang</li> <li>Jianxin</li> <li>Calcharo</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="112" data-current-count="112" data-injectable="false">Players can also choose a 5-star they already own to get a node unlock on the character’s Resonance Chain.</p> <p data-characters="417" data-current-count="529" data-injectable="true">Players don’t have to&nbsp;make the decision&nbsp;immediately, as the voucher is good through May 22, 2025. That said, for new or free-to-play players&nbsp;the&nbsp;free pull is more than worth using ASAP. I suggest pulling Verina to get the best-in-class support in the&nbsp;game,&nbsp;or Calcharo for&nbsp;very solid&nbsp;DPS, but each player is free to make a decision that best fits their party needs.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="352" data-current-count="352" data-injectable="false">Players will also receive&nbsp;10&nbsp;free Radiant Tides if they have reached Union Level 2 or higher, allowing them to roll for more chances at Jiyan. Between the free 5-star, these rolls, and the rest of the Lustrous Tides players receive throughout the game, no&nbsp;one should have trouble getting a solid team together for their journey in <em>Wuthering Waves</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<p data-characters="156" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">A guaranteed pull in <em>Wuthering Waves</em>, Baizhi shines as a support capable of providing massive amounts of continuous healing when both on and off the field. </p> <p data-characters="295" data-current-count="295" data-injectable="false">But there’s more, as her title as the only 4-star (and second overall) true-to-form healer in the game makes knowing how to build her just as vital as mastering your main DPS. To help you do that and awaken her full potential, here’s the best Baizhi healer build in <em>Wuthering Waves</em>. </p> <h2 data-injectable="false">Best Weapons for Baizhi</h2> <p data-characters="314" data-current-count="609" data-injectable="true">Thanks to her high Resonance Liberation energy cost, the best weapon for Baizhi is Variation. The 4-star rectifier is my main pick, given its ability to offer a 51.8% increase in Energy Regen (at lv.90). While at R1, Variation will also provide her with an extra 8 Concerto Energy following her Resonance Skill. <br></p>

Although its other passives won’t help Baizhi a lot, the weapon will provide the same amount of ER as Variation. To recap, here’s an overview of the best weapons for Baizhi in <em>WuWa</em>, as well as the best overall 3-star pick as an extra.</p>
 <figure data-found-rows="3" data-current-count="420" data-injectable="true"><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Best Weapons for Baizhi</th><th data-align="center">Biggest Reasons Why</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Variation (Best in Slot)</td><td data-align="center">Will offer a 51% increase in Energy Regen and provide her with a handy amount of Concerto energy. </td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Rectifier#25</td><td data-align="center">Offers a 51% increase in Energy Regen.</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Rectifier of Voyager</td><td data-align="center">Will provide a 32% increase in Energy Regen and allow her to restore an extra amount of Resonance Energy after performing her Skill.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
 <h2 id="h-best-sonata-and-echoes-for-baizhi" data-injectable="false">Best Sonata and Echoes for Baizhi </h2> <p data-characters="352" data-current-count="352" data-injectable="false">The best Sonata for Baizhi in <em>Wuthering Waves</em> is a full 5-echo Rejuvenating Glow. The Sonata will provide her with a 10% increase in healing and allow her to provide the team with a 15% boost in ATK after each heal (cannot stack). I don’t recommend using any damage-oriented Sonata on Baizhi, as her set’s nature will cause you to waste it.</p> <p data-characters="425" data-current-count="777" data-injectable="true">For the echos, go with Bell-Borne Geochelone as your main and pair it with two Elites and two Common class ones. Bell-Borne Geochelone is a must here and will allow you to grant the team both DMG and DMG Reduction buffs. When talking about the main stats for each echo, we will be prioritizing Healing Bonus, ER, and HP —the latter thanks to her set’s universal scaling. Here are the recommended stats for each pick. </p>
 <figure data-found-rows="5" data-current-count="500" data-injectable="true"><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Echo Name</th><th data-align="center">Desired Main Stat</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Bell-Borne Geochelone</td><td data-align="center">Healing Bonus</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Any Elite-class</td><td data-align="center">Energy Regen</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Any Elite-class</td><td data-align="center">HP or Energy Regen</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Any Common-class</td><td data-align="center">HP</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Any Common-class</td><td data-align="center">HP</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
 <p data-characters="140" data-current-count="140" data-injectable="false">For substats, prioritize Energy Regen and HP so that you can further enhance her healing and maximize her Resonance Liberation availability.</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">Are Baizhi’s Resonance Chain Nodes a Must?</h2> <figure data-current-count="440" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="319" data-current-count="319" data-injectable="false">No, Baizhi can excel in her role in all stages of the game at R0. On another note, her fourth and fifth nodes are game-changers. The fourth node will increase her Remnant Entity number by two and boost their healing by 10%, while the fifth will allow her to revive one fallen teammate with full health per ten minutes. </p> <h2 data-injectable="false">Best Baizhi Teams in Wuthering Waves</h2> <p data-characters="222" data-current-count="541" data-injectable="true">As a healer, Baizhi can fit all teams in the game without exception. Her ability to offer a 15% increase in Resonance DMG Deepen will also allow you to keep your damage up even when forced to change your premier rotation. </p>
 <p data-characters="293" data-current-count="293" data-injectable="false">Given her Resonance, however, she shines the most when paired with a Glacio DPS. That is even more true if on R6, as she will be able to provide them with a 12% increase in Glacio DMG. Her ability to heal your on-field character per Heavy Attack dealt also makes her a premier pick for <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-jiyan-build-in-wuthering-waves-weapons-echoes-and-team-compositions/">Jiyan</a>. </p> <p data-characters="117" data-current-count="410" data-injectable="false">Now that you know how to build Baizhi, don’t forget to also check out <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-calcharo-build-in-wuthering-waves-weapons-echoes-and-team-compositions/">how to build Calcharo in Wuthering Waves</a>.</p>

If you ever wondered what they are, this is the whole list of current Ubers in the game so far.</p> <h2 id="h-all-uber-uniques-in-diablo-4" data-injectable="false">All Uber Uniques in <em>Diablo 4</em></h2> <p data-characters="105" data-current-count="105" data-injectable="false">The following are all the Uber Uniques in<em> Diablo 4</em>.

 <p data-characters="175" data-current-count="175" data-injectable="false">If you wish to fight the Tormented version of these bosses, you will need to triple the resource count and use two Stygian Stones to summon them at their respective locations.</p> <p data-characters="179" data-current-count="354" data-injectable="false">In the case that you get an Uber Unique, but not the one you are looking for, you can <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-get-resplendent-sparks-in-diablo-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">break this down to get Resplendent Sparks</a>.

They tend to have stats that are versatile among many builds for certain classes in <em>Diablo 4</em>. For example, if you are a Sorcerer, The Ring of Starless Skies can work with any kind of elemental or ability-specific build you’re going for. The same also goes with the Harlequin Crest.</p>
 <p data-characters="176" data-current-count="176" data-injectable="false">Drop chances are abysmal for these items and it will take you several runs to finally see one, so don’t give up. Group up with others in public lobbies to do a key share run.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24166235/legend-of-zelda-lego-great-deku-tree-link-minifig<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="704a0a"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/24094572/lego-super-mario-kart-king-boo-bowser-peachs-castle-sets-pre-order-buy-details">Nintendo</a> and Lego’s Great Deku Tree set is a two-in-one homage to two incredible Zelda games: <em>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</em> and <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em>. The $300 kit includes 2,500 pieces that allow you to build a Great Deku Tree scene from either of the iconic games.</p>
<p id="AcOxhB">“In addition to the Great Deku Tree, the set comprises iconic sceneries from the video games including the Master Sword pedestal from<em> Breath of the Wild</em>, as well as Link’s House from <em>Ocarina of Time</em>, allowing enthusiasts freedom to customise their display,” Lego said in a news release. “The build is elegantly mounted on stands, providing an effortless showcase of the set.”</p>
<p id="WXnI0O">Zelda producer Eiji Aonuma said Nintendo wanted the Deku Tree as the first Zelda set represented in Lego. Here’s how Lego and Nintendo describe the duality of the set:</p>
<blockquote>
<p id="L0xaFt">Notably, both builds offer interactive features. In the <em>Breath of the Wild</em> rendition, the Great Deku Tree’s face can be animated with the simple press of a lever, while the <em>Ocarina of Time</em> Great Deku Tree version boasts a captivating mechanism: when activated, its mouth opens, revealing a cleverly designed Skulltula (a spider-like enemy from the games) that descends into its depths.</p>
<p id="Ojwk9U">In the <em>Breath of the Wild</em> version, enthusiasts will marvel at the Great Deku Tree adorned in vibrant pink blossoms, accompanied by the iconic Master Sword pedestal. Notably, this rendition boasts an engaging feature: the ability to animate the tree’s expressive eyebrows and mouth, adding depth to the build.</p>
<p id="8QFHE6">Meanwhile, in the <em>Ocarina of Time</em> version, builders will encounter a lush green foliage-adorned Great Deku Tree. This version includes Link’s House, a pivotal element tied to the <em>Ocarina of Time</em> narrative, adding an extra layer of nostalgia and authenticity to the set. It’s worth mentioning that regardless of which version you choose to build, you will have the ability to construct both the Master Sword pedestal and Link’s House as smaller models.</p>

  <p id="c1wQae">Making a Hollywood prequel is often seen as a studio grasping for profits or audience recognition, years after an initially successful project. There have been plenty of maligned examples over the years, like the three<em> </em>Star Wars prequel films — which are now being reconsidered as <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/2019/5/18/18629598/phantom-menace-star-wars-prequels-expanded-universe-best-books-tv-series-comics">enjoyable parts of a larger-than-ever galaxy</a> — or Ridley Scott’s return to the Alien universe in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2017/4/26/15442036/alien-covenant-prometheus-dr-shaw-david"><em>Prometheus</em></a> and<em> </em><a href="https://www.polygon.com/2017/5/6/15569458/review-alien-covenant"><em>Alien: Covenant</em></a>.</p>
<p id="x79w4H">The newest player in the ever-ongoing prequel IP landscape is <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24157385/furiosa-review-no-spoilers-george-miller-anya-taylor-joy"><em>Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga</em></a>, which transports viewers back to George Miller’s Wasteland for <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24163561/furiosa-mad-max-original-1979-george-miller-movie">the origin story of the titular young warrior</a>, and her journey to becoming the fierce, fearsome Imperator we saw in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2015/5/14/8607723/mad-max-fury-road-review"><em>Mad Max: Fury Road</em></a>. The movie is a strange, successful journey through the Wasteland that earns its place as a necessary addition to the series — and to the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23969917/best-movie-prequels-indiana-jones-alien-planet-of-the-apes">small canon of Hollywood prequels that are worth your while</a>. Let’s talk about why this prequel is valuable to fans, among so many that add little to nothing to a franchise. </p>

<p id="Le8Zty">Something that immediately marks <em>Furiosa</em> out from its fellow prequels is the fact that the story and screenplay were written before <em>Fury Road</em> even came out. “This movie was written when we were preparing <em>Fury Road</em>,” Miller explained at <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24152155/furiosa-anime-vs-movie-george-miller-explains">an early screening of the film in Los Angeles</a>. “We realized that because that’s a story that basically happens over three days and two nights, all the content, all the subtext, all the exposition has to be done on the run. So in order to tell it cohesively, we had to know everything that happened before, so we wrote the story of Furiosa.” </p>
<p id="f2UMt3">The screenplay that became the final film was shared with all the creative team who worked on <em>Fury Road</em>, setting up a continuity that most prequels lack, as well as an origin story that was decisively connected to the film that came before it. That’s a far cry from most modern prequels, which are usually late-stage cash grabs. <em>Furiosa</em> was always part of the <em>Fury Road</em> world, and we see that in the way the world seamlessly continues from one film to the next, and the way <em>Furiosa </em>is filled with characters and locations from <em>Fury Road</em>, like the Citadel and Immortan Joe (Lachy Hulme). </p>

<p id="abTh90">Furiosa’s origin didn’t move directly from behind the scenes of <em>Fury Road</em> to the new film we’re receiving this year. It was developed as a potential anime series, and the live-action movie <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24152155/furiosa-anime-vs-movie-george-miller-explains">still carries some detail from that version</a>. It’s a great example of how the film has grown and shifted over the years, and how Miller is willing to <a href="https://dc.fandom.com/wiki/Mad_Max:_Fury_Road_(Collected)">envision his stories in different mediums</a>.</p>
<p id="oaFZmC">It’s worth noting that alongside that original <em>Furiosa</em> screenplay, Miller also wrote one about Max’s life leading into the film. While that story might seem like the obvious one to turn into a prequel, at the LA screening he revealed it instead became a novella called <em>The Wasteland</em>, whereas his origin about Furiosa became a full screenplay with concept art. That creative journey’s current final result is highly efficient about what Miller and co-writer Nico Lathouris choose to show us, focusing on major emotional turning points in Furiosa’s life without dwelling too long on any one moment. </p>

<p id="aQoAQE">Charlize Theron’s performance as Furiosa was so game-changing that it reframed a decades-old franchise, revitalizing it and putting a story about a heroic woman and her quest for vengeance and justice at its center. Because we only got to spend three days with her rampaging across the Wasteland in <em>Fury Road</em>, plenty of viewers wanted more. While we’d already met Max in his three previous films, there were no other tales of Furiosa to revisit, which singles out the film as something different from, say, <em>Solo: A Star Wars Story</em>, a prequel where we already knew a lot about the main character when he was young, thanks to the original<em> </em>Star Wars trilogy. </p>
<p id="TO53in"><em>Furiosa</em> also doesn’t sweeten the character or soften her edges — unlike, for instance, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23998867/wonka-movie-review-timothee-chalamet">Paul King’s prequel <em>Wonka</em></a>, which erases all the danger and strangeness that are part and parcel with a character who’s willing to torture children to teach them moral lessons. That film recast <em>Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory</em>’s infinitely creepy chocolatier as a sweet, charming, whimsical fellow who would be lost in the original text of Roald Dahl’s often horrifying kids’ books.</p>
<p id="8in5CP"><em>Furiosa</em>, on the other hand, isn’t aimed at kids. Its R rating and its brutal approach puts its lead through the paces, allowing her to be full of rage, fury, and violence in a way women in action cinema often aren’t afforded. </p>

<p id="AinSoC">With Hollywood’s increased reliance on VFX to alter actors’ appearances, it’s surprisingly refreshing to see Miller rely on great casting to depict Furiosa’s early years. Like River Phoenix in <em>Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade</em>, Alyla Browne remakes an iconic role in a convincing, memorable way, delivering fantastic scenes full of emotion.</p>
<p id="vrF63r">It’s even more impressive considering Furiosa’s notoriously sparse dialogue, with growls, grunts, and expressions telling more of Furiosa’s story than her words do. Miller pays strong attention to continuity here, with Browne as child Furiosa and Anya Taylor-Joy as young adult Furiosa clearly on the same page when it comes to how to depict the title character. The result is a seamless transition for the character from stage to stage of life, keeping the suspension of disbelief fully intact as Miller immerses us in Mad Max’s wild world.</p>
<p id="gcWIZQ">Miller has <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/furiosa-director-why-he-decided-against-de-aging-charlize-theron-mad-max-prequel?utm_source=facebook%2Cthreads%2Ctwitter">referenced films</a> like <em>The Irishman and</em> <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2019/10/2/20893933/gemini-man-review-will-smith"><em>Gemini Man</em></a> as the reasons he chose not to cast Theron in the role and use VFX on her face. Both of those films’ use of de-aging arguably distract from the story at hand, and the choice to cast Taylor-Joy keeps Furiosa from falling into the same trap. There are no surface distractions from the central story, which is lucky, as it’s stuffed with action set-pieces, unusual characters, and an emotional engine it’s not afraid to rev. </p>

<p id="HaEQCZ">Lackluster prequels often leave fans wondering, <em>Did these new details really add anything worthwhile to this world?</em> — cough, midi-chlorians, cough. But Furiosa’s brutal backstory doesn’t suffer from this predicament. Instead of defanging or overexploring Mad Max’s Wasteland, <em>Furiosa</em> expands on the long-running lore that provides intriguing new insights into different corners of the world.</p>
<p id="2SHrkO">Miller’s 1979 series launcher <em>Mad Max</em> was a tight slice of the lore and world he was introducing, and each film that came after it slightly widened that slice of the post-apocalyptic pie. In <em>Fury Road</em>,<em> </em>he expanded the world with a new set of characters and a new villain, Immortan Joe, but still kept the efficient scope of just a single wild journey over three days. With <em>Furiosa</em>,<em> </em>Miller widens the lens on the entire world over multiple years, showcasing the fragmented origins of the Wasteland and teasing just how the world ended up like this. We’re also introduced to multiple new characters and factions without any overexplanation, and they all feel like they could be ripe to explore further. </p>
<p id="CBXRIm">There’s an added contextual weight here, too, with future viewings of<em> Fury Road</em> permanently changed by the events of <em>Furiosa</em>. Glimpsing the idyllic utopia of Furiosa’s youth provides a bright spot of hope in an otherwise bleak landscape. And better understanding the Citadel’s high-stakes “guzzolene” runs gives us a unique look at both the culture and business of the terrifying desert community. <em>Furiosa</em> leaves us with a more holistic impression of life in the Wasteland and of Mad Max’s reality. </p>
<p id="zGa7b8">As Hollywood battles to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24144727/2024-movie-release-schedule-blockbusters-2025-box-office">understand and predict</a> what its audience wants in 2024, perhaps it can learn something from <em>Furiosa</em>. While it could be hard for some IP-based adaptations to go as wildly off-road as Miller does with the fifth entry in his Road Warrior franchise, they’d benefit from at least adopting some of his courage. If other prequel-makers dared to step out of the boxes they’re often squashed into — maybe introduce new characters, new eras, even a new tone to their movies, anything to make those movies matter — then “prequel” would stop being such a dispiriting word for fans of unique, innovative movies. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24166198/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-xbox-game-pass<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="UnnzfD"><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em>, the next major entry in Activision’s enduring military shooter franchise, will be available as part of Microsoft’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/best-games/22372750/best-game-pass-games-xbox">Game Pass subscription service</a> from <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/23911151/call-of-duty-game-pass-release">day one</a>, a new trailer for the game confirms. While said trailer does not appear to include any actual gameplay from this year’s Call of Duty, it does offer the promise of much more info, which is coming on June 9.</p>
<p id="uiYlfY">That’s the Sunday when <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23915545/microsoft-activision-blizzard-deal-close">Activision’s new owner Microsoft</a> will hold its 2024 Xbox Games Showcase — which will be followed by another presentation, the <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em> Direct. Activision promises an “in-depth look at gameplay in this dark new chapter of the Black Ops series” as part of that Call of Duty livestream.</p>
<p id="GDhleA">For now, Call of Duty fans will have to settle for uncanny lookalikes and soundalikes of former U.S. Presidents Bill Clinton and George Bush, former secretary of state Colin Powell,  former U.K. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, and former president of Iraq Saddam Hussein. Those political figures will play an important role in the setting of <em>Black Ops 6</em>, which takes place during the Gulf War.</p>
<p id="U79V8v">Previous Black Ops games have featured real-world U.S. presidents, including <a href="https://www.polygon.com/videos/23769879/jfk-assassination-video-games">John F. Kennedy</a> and Richard Nixon in the original <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops</em>, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/call-of-duty/2020/8/27/21404151/call-of-duty-black-ops-cold-war-footage-ronald-reagan-trailer">Ronald Reagan</a> in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2020/11/17/21570340/call-of-duty-black-ops-cold-war-campaign-review"><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War</em></a>. How players will interact with those early ’90s politicians remains to be seen, but we’ll find out more about the next Call of Duty soon enough.</p>
<p id="hk3vF4">Activision and Black Ops developer Treyarch have been teasing their new Call of Duty in recent days, primarily with ’90s nostalgia-laden videos that set the stage for the Gulf War-era setting of <em>Black Ops 6</em>. </p>

The 2000 title, which was originally released on the Sega Dreamcast, follows <em>RE2</em> protagonist Claire Redfield in what many believe is the true sequel to the second game in the series. It’s become something of a cult classic but hasn’t seen a release since the remastered version in 2011 for PS3 and Xbox 360. <em>Resident Evil Zero, </em>a prequel to the original <em>Resident Evil</em>, follows STARS member Rebecca Chambers; its story beats lead directly into the events that take place in the Spencer Mansion during <em>RE1</em>. It’s a more uneven game that is fairly divisive amongst <em>RE</em> fans, many of whom see it as the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/a-great-port-cant-save-the-most-boring-resident-evil-ga-1753765747&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/a-great-port-cant-save-the-most-boring-resident-evil-ga-1753765747">most boring</a></span> game in the series.</p><p>It might be confusing that both of these games are just being remade now. A <em>CODE: Veronica </em>remake would have especially felt apt after either the <em>RE2</em> or <em>RE3</em> remakes were released. But perhaps Capcom is finally getting around to these two titles because the other option isn’t a very good one: The next mainline entry that hasn’t yet received the remake treatment is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-5-review-a-mutation-of-fun-5168661&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-5-review-a-mutation-of-fun-5168661"><em>Resident Evil 5</em></a></span>, a game whose most lasting legacy is its <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.thegamer.com/resident-evil-5-remake-racism-africa-capcom/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.thegamer.com/resident-evil-5-remake-racism-africa-capcom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rampant racism</a></span> and also that one scene where Chris Redfield punches a boulder. While the uneven <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-6-isn-t-that-bad-1840018079&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-6-isn-t-that-bad-1840018079"><em>RE6</em></a></span> could use a remake to smooth out the mechanical issues, <em>RE5</em>’s flaws are so deeply rooted in the characters, story, and world that a remake feels like courting controversy. So let’s be happy that we are getting <em>CODE: Veronica </em>and <em>Zero</em> instead.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
