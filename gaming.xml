              <p><span>I’m a Japanese RPG fan first, and a Soulslike fan second. Maybe third? Anyway, despite thoroughly enjoying games like </span><i><span>Dark Souls</span></i><span> and the countless other similar games inspired by it, the Souslike genre isn’t one I’ve always gravitated toward. Imagine my surprise when Bandai Namco decided to combine the anime aesthetics of a JRPG with the demanding gameplay of </span><i><span>Dark Souls</span></i><span>. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/code-vein-is-the-chillest-dark-souls-clone-1838481190"><i><span>Code Vein</span></i></a><span> was born. Finally something for </span><i><span>me</span></i><span> specifically.</span></p> <p><span>There aren’t many hybrids like this. Most games in the genre still go for a more realistic art style, like that seen in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/nioh-2-the-kotaku-review-1842270420"><i><span>Nioh</span></i></a><span>, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-surge-2-is-a-bit-of-a-mess-but-i-cant-stop-playing-1838376079"><i><span>The Surge</span></i></a><span>, and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/lies-of-p-review-pinocchio-soulslike-bloodborne-sekiro-1850857903"><i><span>Lies of P</span></i></a><span>. Last year’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ai-limit-soulslike-how-long-to-beat-short-hard-1851772663"><i><span>AI Limit</span></i></a><span> and, to a lesser extent, the cel-shaded </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/first-berserker-khazan-review-anime-soulslike-rpg-1851771917"><i><span>Khazan: the Last Berserker</span></i></a><span>, remain isolated examples of the hybrid approach. In this context, </span><i><span>Code Vein</span></i><span> stands out.</span></p>

 <p><span>Its sequel, </span><i><span>Code Vein II</span></i><span>, expands on its predecessor by offering more flexible combat options, as well as a new open world to explore. It also oozes classic JRPG tropes about heroes forging bonds and the strength of friendship. Its enticing time-traveling story takes a bit to get going, but its characters are a highlight. Less brutal than its genre contemporaries, </span><i><span>Code Vein II </span></i><span>emerges as a comfy mix between a Soulslike and a JRPG that makes for a satisfying entry point for folks who want to dip their toes into both genres.</span></p> <p><i><span>Code Vein II </span></i><span>is set in a post-apocalyptic future caused by the Resurgence a century before the events of the game. In order to stop the Resurgence, five heroes gave up their lives to seal away this mysterious force. But in the present, those seals are weakening, leading to the sudden emergence of the Luna Rapacis, a moon-like entity hovering in the middle of the city. This has turned human-like vampiric beings called Revenants into monsters called Horrors. And it’s up to you to travel back in time to change the fates of those original five heroes.</span></p>

 <p><span>The here story isn’t cryptic as one might expect from a game in the Soulslike genre. It’s standalone too, so you don’t have to play the first game to understand this one. With your time-traveling partner, Lou, you travel through the open world to search for each of the heroes’ cocoons, where they’ve been slumbering away for the past century. Lou sends you back in time to fight alongside each hero and at the end of their respective arcs, they hand you a sentimental item that you take back to the present to break the cocoon. This then culminates in a big boss fight against the hero themself, which weaves in a satisfying narrative finish to each hero’s storyline. Unlike with games like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-fromsoftware-review-hidetaka-miyazaki-dark-s-1848694257"><i><span>Elden Ring</span></i></a><span>, I didn’t need to consult an hour-long YouTube lore essay to figure out what the hell was going on.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>I also really enjoyed spending time with </span><i><span>Code Vein II</span></i><span>’s characters. Lou starts off as little more than a tool used for her time travel powers. However, as you and she begin changing the heroes’ fates step by step, she begins to wonder if meddling more in the past might ultimately lead to a better future. Tension arises as the towering and voluptuous Lady Dimetescu-like mother figure and group leader Lavinia Voda warns her not to do so, as it could lead to unintended consequences. But by the end of the story, Lou begins to stand up for herself, and it’s exciting to see her come into her own. Many of the heroes and supporting characters go through similar redemption arcs, adding real emotional weight to the story.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000663846" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000663846"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000663846">©Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure> <p><span>My favorite character has to be Zenon Gryfgote. At first, he’s depicted as some sort of immoral mad scientist. However, when you meet him, you quickly realize he’s just a goofball wife guy. You can even see it in his elaborate gold-plated costume, which is adorned with representations of his deceased wife. His helmet also looks like something you’d wear to an EDM concert, and his cape is layered with lights that help convey his emotions. Despite his hulking frame, his flashy design makes him relatable, funny, and down to earth. </span><i><span>Code Vein II</span></i><span>’s larger-than-life cast brings vibrancy to a post-apocalyptic world.</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Code Vein II </span></i><span>is noticeably easier than most Soulslike games I’ve played. A large part of that is due to its NPC companion system. Basically, you can bring one character to fight alongside you at all times. Other Soulslike games usually require some sort of consumable to summon an ally, but there’s absolutely no cost here. They’re impervious to all damage, can draw aggro from bosses, and can even deal the killing blow on enemies. When you die, you even get a sort of </span><i><span>Sekiro</span></i><span>-like second wind. </span><i><span>Code Vein II </span></i><span>is practically a Fisher-Price toy compared to a game like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/nioh-2-the-kotaku-review-1842270420"><i><span>Nioh 2</span></i></a><span>, but that’s what makes it an entry-level and more approachable Soulslike.</span></p> <h2>Easy mode</h2> <p><span>Don’t get too comfortable, though, as you can’t just run away and let your ally handle bosses all by themselves. Bosses usually have an attack or two that easily closes the distance, so you’ll end up having to confront them directly anyway.</span></p> <p><span>Another way the game forces you to engage with bosses is through its Weapon Formae system. In order to use these flashy special attacks, you expend Ichor, which functions like MP in a JRPG. To recover Ichor, you’ll need to execute Drain Attacks via your equipped Jail. These come in the form of a giant claw, bat wings, and even a scorpion tail. They’re slow to start up, but vital if you want to continue inflicting huge damage. So you also have to strategically pick when to restore Ichor, like when a boss is recovering from finishing a powerful attack. You’re in this rhythmic cycle of attacking, draining, and attacking again, and you need to be up in the enemy’s face in order to do so, making </span><i><span>Code Vein 2</span></i><span> a surprisingly aggressive Soulslike.</span></p>

 <p><span>Unfortunately, sometimes the camera is a pain to deal with in the midst of the game’s bigger boss fights. There were many instances in which my back would be against the wall, and the camera would zoom in so close that I couldn’t decipher the boss’s next attack, leading to a death.</span></p> <p><span>During my playthrough, I switched between my one-handed sword and hammer weapons. For the former, my go-to Forma was Phantom Ambush, which was super helpful for boss fights since I would disappear in a puff of smoke for a second, then slash the enemy twice. When timed right, I could avoid incoming attacks completely while being able to immediately strike back. My favorite hammer Forma was Gaia Impact, which activated a huge AOE shockwave when I slammed my weapon to the ground, perfect for crowd control. The Formae system makes the game feel a lot more like a typical action RPG, something like an </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ys-x-nordics-arpg-review-guide-1851684251"><i><span>Ys</span></i></a><span> game but with Soulslike core mechanics. These attacks added a degree of cinematic flair that’s often missing from Soulslike games.</span></p> <div>           <ul>                           <li>                 <p>Back-of-the-box quote:</p>                 <p>"Dark Souls for weebs."</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Developer:</p>                 <p>Bandai Namco</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Type of game: </p>                 <p>Soulslike</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Liked:</p>                 <p>Charming cast of characters, plenty of customization, fun combat, great boss design.</p>               </li>                               </ul><ul>                                         <li>                 <p>Disliked:</p>                 <p> Performance issues, funky camera, boring normal enemies, repetitive dungeons.</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Platforms:</p>                 <p>PC, PS5 (played), Xbox Series X|S.</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Release date: </p>                 <p>January 29, 2026</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>played:</p>                 <p>45 hours. All characters arcs and most sidequests completed. Unlocked all three endings: normal, good, and true. Still have to find all hot springs and healing upgrades in the open world.</p>               </li>                                     </ul>         </div>  <p><span>Central to the game’s customization systems are Blood Codes, which act kind of like character classes that you can equip to fit your playstyle. For example, if you like parrying, Lyle’s Blood Code is ideal since its traits include powering up its parry staggering capabilities. If you’re a more careful player, Holly’s Blood Code might suit you, as it restores some HP upon defeating an enemy. What makes Blood Codes flexible is that even though they have specific traits and boost certain stats, you’re free to use whatever weapons you like the most regardless of which one you have equipped.</span></p>

 <p><span>After mastering a Blood Code, you can extract a Booster from it, which are passive skills that you can equip. For example, mastering Zenon’s Blood Code rewards you with Halberd Mastery, which of course increases your attack strength when wielding Halberds. Between Blood Codes, Formae, and Boosters, there’s a large variety of customization options that make fights feel both extravagant and exhilarating.</span></p> <h2>The open road</h2> <p><span>Like many sequels before it, </span><i><span>Code Vein II</span></i><span> takes the predictable route in becoming an open-world game. The freedom this shift allows reminded me of </span><i><span>Elden Ring</span></i><span> in which, if I was stuck on a boss, I’d explore more, get stronger, and come back to tackle the boss again. This allowed me to still make progress somewhere else even if my attempts to advance in one direction had hit a wall. And that’s pretty much what I did throughout. Interestingly, this freedom meant that I accidentally skipped over what was intended to be the game’s first hero story, Josee’s, in the Sunken City area. Instead, I veered off a little too far into the northeast towards the Corroded Scar region and started Lyle’s first.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000663847" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000663847"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000663847">©</figcaption></figure> <p><span>After breaking Lyle’s cocoon, I couldn’t beat his corrupted form to continue the story. So instead, I went back to Josee’s location and finished her story arc. Since I was almost done with Lyle’s arc anyway, I was overpowered for Josee’s, defeating her corrupted form handily. This looser approach of story progression works in the open world’s favor. With side dungeons and mini-bosses to boot, exploration never felt like a waste of time. Every little thing I did made me stronger, which would eventually help me beat the bosses I’d initially had trouble with. Unfortunately, the dungeons grow a bit repetitive, and enemy variety is lacking compared to the extravagantly designed bosses.</span></p>

 <p><span>That said, you get a cool bike to speed exploration up, along with a generous amount of fast-travel points. On the downside, the joys of exploration are marred a bit by performance issues as you speed around the world with foliage constantly popping in and out, at least on PS5 Pro where I played the game.&nbsp; There was also one point at which I made the classic Soulslike runback from a save point to the boss and I skipped so many enemies that when they all started chasing me on the screen, the framerate slowed to a crawl.</span></p> <p><i><span>Code Vein II</span></i><span> doesn’t just take a superficial anime aesthetic and use it as window dressing on a popular genre. Its story and charming cast elevate it to create a unique middle ground that will appeal to JRPG and Soulslike fans alike. It’s got its fair share of issues, such as the performance woes and boring enemy fodder design. Still, if you’re looking to ease into the Soulslike genre before hitting the big leagues, </span><i><span>Code Vein II</span></i><span> is worth spilling blood over.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Sony has confirmed the line up for the February 2026 PS Plus monthly games, with subscribers getting four games as part of the subscription. These games will be available from February 3rd and there is a decent mix of titles on offer. The games are Undisputed, Subnautica Below Zero, Ultros, and Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown.</p>
<p><iframe title="Undisputed Launch Trailer (ESRB)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s4g44lARkFU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Undisputed is going to be available for PS5. In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/07/undisputed-review/">Undisputed review</a>, I said, “Undisputed is a valiant attempt by Steel City Interactive, bringing back boxing to the fore in video games after a long absence. The in-ring action is generally very good and the roster is well stacked. What is missing is good commentary and there are gameplay issues that need to be addressed, including lag and stuttering. Undisputed is not ready to be a title challenger yet, but updates may see it get there eventually.”</p>
<p><iframe title="Subnautica: Below Zero Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rdix1XxaZyU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Subnautica is going to be available for both PS5 and PS4. In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/05/11/subnautica-below-zero-review/">Subnautica: Below Zero review</a>, Jason said, “Subnautica: Below Zero is a masterfully horrific experience that encourages you to push on despite your fears. It’s a fine balancing act of the horrors you’ll face underwater and the rewards you can get for evading them. It’s really very hard, but it’s also really very good.”</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Ultros – Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iloiRk1k3_U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Ultros will be available for PS5 and PS4. In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/26/ultros-review/">Ultros review</a>, Steve said, “Ultros is a true labour of love that has a lot to say about the balance between violence and peace, and exploitation and environmentalism, themes which are incredibly important and too often ignored in games, but this theme sometimes feels at odds with the basic game mechanics and can lead to early frustration. The game is quite clear that the first ending is a bad one due to the violence required to reach it, but I couldn’t justify the investment of time and energy to continue past this to complete the more acceptable approach. In a way, this feels appropriate to me as it demonstrates why true change is so difficult to achieve in wider environmental terms. I guess the gap between the message and the mechanics here is not as wide as I initially thought.”</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown - PS4/XB1/PC - Open Fire (Launch Trailer)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HnU9v1IE1nw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Ace Combat 7 will be available for PS4. In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/01/18/ace-combat-7-review/">Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown review</a>, Dom said, “In Ace Combat 7 dogfighting games have a new Top Gun. The VR sadly turned my stomach, but the series’ trademark action is bigger and better than ever, with the spectacular weather effects introducing a level of realism and drama that will win over any wannabe Mavericks.”</p>
<h4>What are the PS Plus January 2026 Monthly Games?</h4>
<p>There were three games made available as the January monthly games and those are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Need For Speed Unbound (PS5)</li>
<li>Disney Epic Mickey Rebrushed (PS5/PS4)</li>
<li>Core Keeper (PS5/PS4)</li>
</ul>

            <title><![CDATA[Forget the $100M Bet: Jack Emmert Explains Why the ‘Warframe Model’ is the Future of Western MMOs]]></title>

            <guid>1418917</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Warframe</strong>, the free-to-play online action game developed by <strong>Digital Extremes</strong>, came up twice as I asked <strong>MMO</strong> industry veterans what the future of Western MMOs looked like. </p>



<p>Just yesterday, I <a href="https://wccftech.com/jack-emmert-returns-to-cryptic-studios-exclusive-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published an interview with <strong>Jack Emmert</strong></a>, who's returning as CEO of <strong>Cryptic Studios</strong> (he previously held the role from 2011 to 2015, when he left after 15 years at the company). As part of our conversation, I picked up his mind on the difficulties faced by Western developers looking to make a new game in the genre, and Emmert pointed out an example to follow: Warframe.  </p>



<p><em>It would be difficult for anybody to go to a Western publisher and ask for money to develop an MMORPG. The track record with Western publishers and MMORPGs is not very good for a lot of reasons. However, I think there's a lot of opportunity to launch a game that isn't necessarily an MMO at the start, but grows into something. A model like Warframe is a really good one; it is vastly bigger than it ever was when it first launched. That is a direction many games could go. A multiplayer story-based RPG could add an open-world component through an update or expansion. Instead of a hundred-million-dollar investment all upfront, you're making a series of $20 million bets so that at the end of five to seven years you have that big MMO, having paid for it and grown the community along the way.</em></p>



<p><em>I would not be surprised to see someone bootstrap a very small product, get some initial success, and continue to invest in it. Subnautica was like that, too. I think that's where you're going to see the new MMOs. To MMO fans, I'd say be patient; if you support a product and love it, just keep supporting it. It'll get there.</em></p>



<p>Anyone familiar with Warframe knows that the game that launched in March 2013 on PC was <strong>quite barebones</strong>. However, over time and with an ear constantly tuned to the community's feedback, Digital Extremes expertly introduced new content and features on a regular basis, <strong>making it one of the best examples of a live service game in the whole industry</strong> and securing an extremely loyal fanbase.</p>



<p>In 2026, Warframe <strong>is a whole different beast</strong>. It has a ton of content and activities to satisfy different playstyles, and it has also successfully expanded across all available platforms (the final one, Android, will get the game on February 18 <a href="https://wccftech.com/warframe-the-old-peace-gets-december-10-launch-date-android-cbt-live-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">after a couple of months of Closed Beta testing</a>). Of course, someone could argue that Warframe is not quite an MMO in the traditional sense. Even so, the larger point holds: <strong>start with a solid 'minimum viable product' and build on it over time</strong>. The example is doubly fitting because Digital Extremes did everything on its own, developing and self-publishing the game, which is what a developer would have to do in the current absence of investments for MMO games.</p>



<p>Anyway, Emmert was not the only MMO veteran to point out Warframe to me when I inquired about the state of the genre in Western countries. <a href="https://wccftech.com/is-the-mmo-genre-dead-for-western-aaa-developers-we-asked-three-industry-veterans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In an interview I published last month</a>, <strong>Greg Street</strong> (former World of Warcraft and League of Legends designer) told me:</p>



<p><em>The basic problem is that it's hard to start small with an MMO. You have to commit to a lot of systems and content to make it work. There are some notable exceptions, like Warframe, which started small and grew into an MMO.</em></p>



<p>Street and Emmert know each other quite well, so it's possible they spoke about this before and found they shared the same viewpoint. Their insight is particularly interesting because they both bashed their heads against the problems faced when making a new MMO game in the West: their companies, <strong>Jackalyptic</strong> and <strong>Fantastic Pixel Castle</strong>, were working on two new MMO games, one based on Warhammer and another on a new fantasy IP. </p>



<p>In both cases, they were funded by NetEase, which, however, changed its mind a couple of years later and <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-warhammer-mmo-is-also-canceled-netease-shuts-down-jackalyptic-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">closed both studios down</a>. This experience likely contributed to their conviction that <strong>a small game, like Warframe when it launched, can eventually become much larger</strong> and should serve as a model for future titles that do not have the budget to start big.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-remaster-release-date-february-2026/">After a second rumour</a> pointed to a current-gen <strong>PS5 version</strong> of <strong>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</strong> coming from developer <strong>Warhorse Studios</strong> last month, the new version has been all but officially confirmed, with a <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/EP4062-CUSA07180_00-KCDGAME010000000"><strong>UK</strong> <strong>PlayStation Store </strong>listing</a> (spotted by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gematsu.com/post/3mdiqkxbtl225">Gematsu</a>) describing the features this unofficially announced PS5 version would include, like the game getting a resolution boost to <strong>4K</strong>, an <strong>improved framerate</strong>, and more.</p>



<p>This new version of the game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-remaster-early-2026/">first rumoured to be in the works back in October 2025</a>, before the aforementioned December 2025 rumour pointed to its imminent arrival, once again pointing to an early 2026 release, though last time the rumour went a step further to add that it would release sometime in <strong>February 2026</strong>.</p>



<p>The updated store page description doesn't include a hint as to when the new version will be available, or if this new version will be made available through a free update or if it'll be a paid upgrade. What it does include is confirmation that Warhorse has given the original release a good once-over, with updates to the graphics, framerate, and textures.</p>



<p>"<em>The PS5 version of Kingdom Come: Deliverance now features graphical updates including 4K resolution, improved framerate, high-resolution textures and many more. Medieval Bohemia has never been so beautiful</em>," the updated description reads.</p>







<p>Hopefully, this means we can expect a reveal from Warhorse Studios soon, and while there's no guarantee that this will be a free update, the fact that we're seeing this reveal come in the form of an updated PS Store listing is probably an indication that it's just a major update, and not a full remaster or a separate release. </p>

            <p>
Last week, Ubisoft announced a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-and-more-cancelled-by-ubisoft-with-layoffs-potentially-on-the-horizon">major restructure</a> that saw multiple games cancelled, including the Prince of Persia: The Sand of Time Remake, and more concerningly prospectively put <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-propose-cutting-up-to-200-jobs-at-paris-headquarters-as-unions-reportedly-agree-three-day-strike">layoffs on the horizon</a>. Now, following an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-propose-cutting-up-to-200-jobs-at-paris-headquarters-as-unions-reportedly-agree-three-day-strike">agreement made by a group of organised Ubisoft workers</a> across multiple French unions, a call for an international strike across all studios at the company has been put out.
</p>
<p>
The five unions in question consist of STJV, CGT, Printemps Ecologique, Solidaires Informatique, and CFE-CGC, who through the firstmost put out a statement regarding Ubisoft's recent actions. Namely, the five unions are calling for a "massive international strike by all Ubisoft employees" across the 10th, 11th, and 12th of February next month.
</p>
<blockquote data-bluesky-cid="bafyreid3d2fbcx6pbmwso26wm7nmajt5hrrib2bbu3dmdac42ufefytl7q" data-bluesky-embed-color-mode="system" data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:drkl6rkntt57jub7gghhfjmb/app.bsky.feed.post/3mdiakqixmj2m"><div lang="en"><p>🇬🇧✊🌀 Ubisoft : enough is enough! Faced with the arbitrary decision of the CEO who doesn’t even dare talking to employees anymore, unions are calling for a strike on February 10th, 11th and 12th.</p><p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:drkl6rkntt57jub7gghhfjmb/post/3mdiakqixmj2m?ref_src=embed">[image or embed]</a></p></div>— Syndicat des Travailleureuses du Jeu Vidéo (<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:drkl6rkntt57jub7gghhfjmb?ref_src=embed">@stjv.fr</a>) <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:drkl6rkntt57jub7gghhfjmb/post/3mdiakqixmj2m?ref_src=embed">January 28, 2026 at 12:10 PM</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">

</span></p><p>
This call to action comes in response not just to the recent structuring and prospective layoffs, but because of the return to mandatory in-office work. "These decisions are forcing us to act in order to protect those who keep this company alive," reads the statement. It goes on to note, "We are promised autonomy for Creative Houses, but what about the autonomy for employees? Five days of mandatory in-office work: we are treated like children who need to be supervised, while our management gets away with lies and breaking the law."
</p><p>
It's also worth noting that according to the statement, Ubisoft employees learned about the major restructure not through a private announcement, but at the same time as the public announcement, noting that "none of these changes had been discussed during the mandatory consultations with the works councils a few days earlier."
</p>
<p>
A half-day strike <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/it-is-out-of-the-question-to-let-a-boss-run-rampant-ubisoft-workers-strike-against-disastrous-cutbacks">was held last week</a>, but this was only through Solidaires Informatique in France. According to Ubisoft's <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/company/about-us">about section on their website</a>, the studio currently has roughly 17,000 employees, meaning if international workers take part in the strike, it could feature thousands of staff members across the world. Solidarity to all those involved.

    <p>When people talk glowingly about the heyday of social media being good, what they’re really talking about is riffing. Before Donald Trump became the president and screwed up all posting that isn’t about him, people would iterate on the most absurd joke possible. For the last few days, a handful of people have been riffing on the idea of YouTube thumbnails but from the point of view of babies, and it’s mostly been good. For posterity, it is worth remembering this riff.&nbsp;</p><p>The bit is a riff on something we have all seen a million times: horribly condescending YouTube thumbnails with bait text. The original post comes from an artist called </p><p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/lmaonadestand.bsky.social?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Jamie</u></a>. The first meme, “why I’m switching..…” shows a contemplative baby examining a bead maze next to a “greater than” sign and some toy blocks. From there, the rest was history.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Credit: </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/lmaonadestand.bsky.social/post/3md7egs5bus2l?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer"><span>@lmaonadestand.bsky.social</span></a></figcaption></figure><p>“At the end of the day it’s been fun to see people enjoying it, especially in a time where [every] headline online has been miserable,” Jamie told me. “If this silly thing was able to brighten people’s day at all then I’m happy.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Scott Pilgrim is taking on the world, again, in March. Capcom leans into Leon’s “hot uncle” makeover. And an old Kickstarter for a tabletop game reveals the worst outcome possible. It’s another edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news, rumors, and culture. Speaking of fan speculation and rumors, it’s never a good sign when the official franchise account <a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/2016531108486095252">responds to you with a GIF from <em>Grand Theft Auto</em></a>. The <em>Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag</em> remake was reportedly delayed, but hopefully the <a href="https://x.com/yosp/status/2016446516236562657">next game from indie standout Red Candle Games</a> is coming along smoothly.</p> <h2><em>Scott Pilgrim EX</em> has a release date and a new trailer</h2>  <p>It’s out March 3 and will include League of Evil Exes’ Matthew Patel and Robot-01 as playable characters. This spiritual successor to the 2010 brawler is a bit more RPG-lite with non-linear quests and exploration, according to the devs at Tribute Games. They recently helped launch <em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em>, another excellent retro throwback with some neat tricks. Hopefully the team has put some cool surprises in <em>Scott Pilgrim EX</em> which, with today’s news, is now handily my most anticipated release of the winter.</p>

 <h2><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> fixes a bizarre DLC bug recently <a href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-performance-framerate-dlc-2000660149">unearthed by a modder</a></h2> <p><a href="https://info.monsterhunter.com/wilds/update/en-au/Ver.1.040.03.01.html">The new PC performance patch is out</a> and the notes include the following: “Fixed an issue where system load could increase around the Support Desk at Base Camp or the Grand Hub due to claimed content status checks.” Hopefully it brings the Steam version of the game more in line with the console version and turns things around in a meaningful way heading into the game’s one-year anniversary.</p> <h2><em>RuneScape</em> maker promises no genAI that players can “feel”</h2> <p>“We’ve got a pretty hard line stance with the team, which is a commitment that no generative AI will ever be present in any asset that a player can touch, hear or feel. There will be no generative AI in the game that they experience,” Jagex SVP of product James Dobrowski <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/runescape-maker-jagex-says-it-will-never-use-generative-ai-to-make-in-game-content">told <em>GamesIndustry.biz</em></a>. Tooling efficiency, which seemingly means coding, QA checks, and other process-oriented stuff, is another story.</p>

 <p>“Where we are open to the use of AI is in things like tooling efficiency; how do we make the way we work more efficient in order to make our staff’s lives easier and allow us to produce better content. But we do not want to be using AI to drive creativity,” he said.</p>

 <h2>Capcom talks about Leon’s “hot uncle” makeover</h2> <p>“We’ve spent quite a lot of time polishing Leon’s visuals,” <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em> director Koshi Nakanishi <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/resident-evil-requiems-leon-kennedy-became-a-hot-uncle-thanks-to-hawk-eyed-female-capcom-staff-who-reviewed-even-the-finest-wrinkles-on-his-neck-director/">told <em>Automaton</em></a>. “Leon has many fans among Capcom employees, and women in particular were pretty strict when reviewing his design. They would point out and comment on even the finest details like the wrinkles on his neck.

              <p>Digital PC gaming storefront <a href="https://kotaku.com/gog-anti-drm-cd-projekt-witcher-3-cyberpunk-2000659280">Good Old Games</a> is the latest video game-related company to be caught using AI-generated artwork. As you might expect, a lot of people aren’t pleased about this, including an artist who works at GOG.</p> <p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2026/01/gog-now-using-ai-generated-images-on-their-store/">As first reported by <em>GamingOnLinux</em></a>, someone on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gog/comments/1qoigy5/ai_in_the_storefront/">Reddit spotted</a> what looks like AI-generated artwork being used to advertise an ongoing 2026 sale on GOG. The biggest giveaway that this art was generated using an AI tool or site is that a SNES-like console in the image seems to be melting. <a href="https://www.gog.com/forum/general/5000_gog_patrons_and_an_ai_banner/page1">GOG users actually spotted this AI artwork last week</a> and began posting about it. For many, it was disappointing to see a company that <a href="https://kotaku.com/gog-games-preservation-program-drm-1851696363">claims to care about preservation</a> and creators using AI to create a simple store banner.</p> <p>Likely in response to the hubbub surrounding the AI-generated banner, KosmicznaPluskwa, a GOG forums user who appears to be a graphic artist working at the company, <a href="https://www.gog.com/forum/general/5000_gog_patrons_and_an_ai_banner?staff=yes">posted a lengthy response on the store’s forums on January 26.</a> And while KosmicznaPluskwa made it clear they aren’t a spokesperson for GOG, the artist confirmed that the image people were speculating was machine-created was indeed generated completely using AI tools, something that upset the artist.</p>

 <p>“OK, so to clear the air – current sale banner is fully AI. Not my work,” posted KosmicznaPluskwa. “This is all I can say on this. My team is much smaller now than it used to be, and the requirements for the role are completely different than it used to be.”</p> <p><em>Kotaku</em> contacted GOG about the art, but didn’t hear back before publication.</p> <p>KosmicznaPluskwa continued in their lengthy forum post and discussed how AI art is everywhere now and how it makes them sad to see.</p>

 <p>“It’s just miserable to think about how surrounded and how ever-present it all is now,” said KosmicznaPluskwa.</p> <p>“How will it affect us as the humanity. And no, I don’t think it will destroy art altogether but the omnipresence of it will not not go without its effect on us as a whole. Maybe it doesn’t matter some store put out sloppy work on promo banner – in the end everyone is just there to buy the product – but I know I enjoy seeing cool new artworks out there, when I’m out to buy new products as well. When I buy a new cool figure I like to keep the box around if it’s pretty – this is kind of the same, but on digital level. More cool art to see on top of buying art (video games in our case here) is always more cool art in the world and this is what I’m happy to have. So with everyone also feeling strongly in this thread – I’m with you. And continue speaking up – in the face of future we don’t like to see, complacency is not the way.”</p>

But after <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/an-overlooked-disney-collection-from-digital-eclipse-has-been-rated-for-switch">an ESRB rating was spotted</a> recently, a listing has now appeared on <a href="https://store-jp.nintendo.com/item/software/D70010000107124">the Japanese eShop</a> for both Switch 1 and Switch 2.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/disney-afternoon-collection-appears-on-switch-eshop-confirming-its-release-with-two-extra-snes-games/">VGC</a> spotted the listing earlier today and is listed for 2,300 yen (about 11 GBP, or 14 USD, so expect pricing to be a little higher in the West) on Switch 2, with a 10% pre-order discount and a release date of <strong>26th February 2026</strong>.

<p>Looking at the key art and the game description (via Google Translate), 1993's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/goof_troop">Goof Troop</a> and 1994's <strong>Bonkers</strong> will also be part of the package. Neither of these games have been rereleased before, so that's pretty exciting!</p>
<p>Here's the full line-up of games in their NES or SNES versions for the Switch 1 &amp; 2 versions:</p>

			<p><strong>PlayStation</strong> has revealed the <strong>four games</strong> that will be offered to <strong>PS Plus Essential</strong> and higher-tier subscribers for the month of February 2026. The games will be made available on <strong>February 3, 2026,</strong> with the boxing game <strong>Undisputed</strong> and survival game <strong>Subnautica: Below Zero</strong> headlining the monthly offerings after PlayStation kicked off the year with <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps-plus-essential-january-2026-need-for-speed-unbound-epic-mickey-core-keeper/"><strong>Need for Speed Unbound</strong>, <strong>Epic Mickey Rebrushed,</strong> and <strong>Core Keeper</strong></a>. </p>



<p>The official announcement was shared <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2026/01/28/playstation-plus-monthly-games-for-february-undisputed-subnautica-below-zero-ultros-ace-combat-7-skies-unknown/">on the PlayStation Blog</a>, as it usually is, and also, as usual, at least one of the coming games <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/ps-plus-essential-voici-le-titre-phare-de-la-selection-de-fevrier-2026-60911">had already leaked on Dealabs</a>, with Undisputed being the game to leak early this time. </p>



<p>Beyond Undisputed and Subnautica: Below Zero, the monthly offerings for February include two other standout titles: <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ace-combat-7-skies-unknown/"><strong>Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown</strong>,</a> which is arriving just in time for anyone who hasn't yet played it to prepare themselves for the arrival of <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ace-combat-8-wings-of-theve-announced-2026-launch-multiplayer-modes/">Ace Combat 8: Wings of Theve</a></strong>, and <strong>Ultros</strong>, the indie metroidvania from developer <strong>Hadoque</strong>, which sees players explore a twisting Sarcophagus.</p>

<p>With the above four titles set to arrive on February 3, that means you have until <strong>February 2, 2026,</strong> to add January's monthly PS Plus Essential games to your library, if you haven't already. If you're a PS Plus Extra or even Premium tier subscriber, then this is unfortunately another month where you're getting games that were already available to you in the Games Catalog, as Ultros entered the PS Plus Extra catalog when it launched back in February 2024.</p>



<p>At least PlayStation players at every tier of a PS Plus subscription and even those not subscribed to the service can <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-state-of-play-february-2026/">reportedly look forward to a new <strong>State of Play</strong> event, currently said to be happening sometime during the week of <strong>February 12, 2026</strong></a>, if it's not on the 12th itself.</p>

I like playing a game where I get to defend myself from/ take down the likes of ghouls, ghosts, demons and other such and much paranormal, supernatural beasties, but how about a game where you're the one doing the haunting? Ghost Keeper! Is a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a>, puzzley game where you "lead your fearsome minions against the living" by attempting to scare them off, and just launched in early access today.
</p>
<p>
On the offset, Ghost Keeper almost looks like a Sims expansion, or perhaps incredibly dedicated mod, what with its top down view, exaggerated character animations, and semi-real but still kind of goofy in a fun way vibe. Taking place in a Victorian setting, with six locations to choose from as part of this early access launch, you control the likes of ghosts and various monsters, with the express goal of scaring off a group of humans called the Brotherhood who appear to be legally distinct Ghostbusters.

This might include some spectral floating plates, luring people in with a cute demonic kitty, or just giving them a tap on the shoulder to freak 'em out. Interestingly, the game is actually a story-driven one, though the early access release only offers a part of that right now. Upon beating what's currently available you do get access to a sandbox mode to play around with, though!
</p><p>
According to the game's Steam page, the plan is for it to be in early access for about a year, but right now a majority of the mechanics are already available. There are also plans for more creatures, abilities, areas and more in future updates. Also worth noting that as more updates roll out, the price will be gradually increased, so perhaps it's worth getting on the ground floor now if you're interested. You can check out, or wishlist, the game on Steam right <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2708880/Ghost_Keeper/">here</a>.

              <p><span>A long-rumoured PlayStation 5 upgrade for Warhorse Studios’ 2018 game </span><i><span>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</span></i><span> has seemingly been confirmed by mistake, as the PlayStation Store description listing now includes details for a “The PS5 version” version.</span></p> <p><span>Although this leak was </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1qpgd10/kingdom_come_deliverance_ps5_information/"><span>initially spotted</span></a><span> on the PlayStation Store Italia page for the title, the same PS5-specific information has since appeared on the </span><a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/227410"><span>British PlayStation Store listing</span></a><span> for </span><i><span>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</span></i><span>.</span></p> <p><span>It now states that the game will be “Updated for PlayStation 5” and that the “PS5 version of Kingdom Come: Deliverance now features graphical updates including 4K resolution, improved framerate, high-resolution textures and many more. Medieval Bohemia has never been so beautiful.”</span></p>

 <p><span>The background of the key art on the PlayStation Store has also changed, removing the militia seen in the original artwork and replacing the scene with a darker orange background. The opening paragraph has also been updated: “(Re)discover Henry’s saga, from the start!”</span></p> <p><span>Neither the PlayStation Store Italia nor the British pages for </span><i><span>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</span></i><span> have been updated to specify a new release date, and still display the game’s original 13 February 2018 PlayStation 4 release date.</span></p>

 <p><span>However, the “2017 Warhorse Studios” trademark information, which is still present on the US PlayStation Store Page, has since disappeared from both the Italian and British store pages.</span></p> <p><span>No word from any of the </span><i><span>Kingdom Come: Deliverance </span></i><span>social accounts or any sort of announcement from publisher Deep Silver on its legitimacy yet, but rumours of a PlayStation 5 version of the game can be traced all the way back to </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1mdsewq/kingdom_come_deliverance_1_may_be_getting_a/"><span>July 2025</span></a><span>.</span></p>

 <p><span>Those rumours have only ever mentioned a PS5 version of the game, and as of yet, none of the Xbox store pages for </span><i><span>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</span></i><span> have been updated with similar information.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/dispatch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dispatch</a> is set to release soon on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/platforms/nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, and with that comes some concessions…and censorship.</p>



<p>Releasing on the console on January 29, Dispatch features moments of vulgarity and nudity during the story. While there is an option to self-censor the game should you not want to hear or see those moments, it appears that Nintendo has made the decision for players.</p>







<p>In a statement provided to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dispatch-switch-switch-2-censored-adhoc-comment" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>, Adhoc Studios confirmed the censorship, but says that the overall narrative and experience will remain the same.</p>



<p><strong>“Different platforms have different content criteria, and submissions are evaluated individually,”</strong> AdHoc said in a statement. <strong>“We worked with Nintendo to ensure the content within the title met the criteria to release on their platforms, but the core narrative and gameplay experience remains identical to the original release.”</strong></p>

</p></figure>



<p>First released with weekly episodes in October, Dispatch quickly became one of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dispatch-insider-gaming-community-biggest-surprise-hit-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">biggest surprise hits</a> of 2025. The game sold two million copies in its first month, and has since surpassed 3 million copies on PlayStation and PC combined. With the game now coming to Nintendo Switch 2, and possibly more in the future, that number is likely to rise even more. </p>



<p>As far as the future of the franchise is concerned, the team at AdHoc have said repeatedly that they’d like to do and see more from the Z-Team. Whether that ultimately happens, obviously, remains to be seen.</p>

            <guid>1418830</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>There are plenty of Trinkets to find in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/arc-raiders/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/games/arc-raiders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a>, and looting them can be a great source of money, but there’s always been one that’s held dear amongst the community—the Rubber Duck.</p>



<p>These little guys are only Common loot and don’t sell for much at all, but some fans have enjoyed collecting them. Well, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/embark-studios/" id="96820">Embark Studios</a> has upped the ante with the Headwinds update, as a host of new Rubber Ducks have been added to the game, and they vary in rarity.</p>







<p>If you’re looking to start a brand new Rubber Duck collection in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/solo-vs-squads-matchmaking-arc-raiders-explained/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/solo-vs-squads-matchmaking-arc-raiders-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a>, then you’re in the right place. This guide will show you all of the new Rubber Duck variants, as well as how you can get your hands on them all.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-new-rubber-ducks-are-there-in-arc-raiders">How Many New Rubber Ducks Are There In ARC Raiders?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>All from one raid. Image by Insider Gaming.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-headwinds-update-release-date-times-confirmed-content/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-headwinds-update-release-date-times-confirmed-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Headwinds update</a> has added six new Rubber Ducks to ARC Raiders, bringing the grand total to seven, including the original yellow one.</strong></p>



<p>You’ll know if you’ve found a new Rubber Duck variant not just by its rarity, but by its skin, too. Each new Duck has a unique aesthetic, ranging from a duck with cow markings to a green alien duck! The full list of new Rubber Ducks is listed below:</p>



<ul>
<li>Tropical Duck</li>



<li>Gentle Duck</li>



<li>Alien Duck</li>



<li>Doodly Duck</li>



<li>Flashy Duck</li>



<li>Familiar Duck</li>
</ul>



<p>As fun as they are, they’re not just for show. Depending on the rarity, these Ducks can fetch a pretty penny, with the Familiar Duck selling for 7,000 Coins a pop! They can stack up to 15 times, meaning a full stack of Familiar Ducks is the most valuable group of items in ARC Raiders. If you’re looking to get rich, you’ll need to know where to find them first. </p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-find-the-new-rubber-ducks-in-arc-raiders">How To Find The New Rubber Ducks In ARC Raiders</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Check the chimneys! Image by Insider Gaming.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The six new Rubber Ducks can be found on the Buried City map, during the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-bird-city-new-headwinds-map-condition-explained/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-bird-city-new-headwinds-map-condition-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bird City</a> Minor Map Condition.</strong></p>



<p>They can’t be found just anywhere on the map, though, as you’ll need to take to the rooftops. Once you’re up high, search every chimney you come across; birds have made nests inside of them, and they’re prone to storing some valuable Trinkets inside.</p>







<p>As luck would have it, these birds have been stealing a whole variety of Rubber Ducks and stashing them in their nests. Who knows where they migrated from to bring these treasures to the Rust Belt, but your Coin collection should thank them. </p>

"Leon has many fans among Capcom employees, and women in particular were pretty strict when reviewing his design. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/28/tgas-2025-resident-evil-leon-1769613081364.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Leon S. Kennedy.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"They would point out and comment on even the finest details like the wrinkles on his neck," Nakanishi continued. "When I mentioned that story in the past, a female fan told me, 'The women developers at Capcom did a really good job' (laughs). Throughout the development process, Leon was thoroughly refined, and I think we managed to come through with a design that would make anyone's heart throb."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Leon was finally revealed for Resident Evil Requiem late last year, following months of teases, rumors and speculation over his appearance. The returning hero of Resident Evil 2 and 4 (and a bit of 6), Leon will feature in action-heavy gameplay that will contrast with the quieter, horror-led sequences that feature series newbie Grace Ashcroft.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">How have the years treated Leon? Is he still pining for Ada? Will he be given a happy ending, after nearly three decades fighting zombies? And what is going on with that ominous-looking mark on his neck? All of these are questions that Requiem will hopefully answer, as well as just providing us all with more eye candy.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Every staff member had their own interpretation of Leon's 30-year-long history, so they would tell me things like, Leon would definitely not act like that in this kind of situation," Nakanishi continued. "So, there were more opinions about what he's like on the inside compared to his looks, and after many discussions, we were able to settle on something that clicked for us. When players see this Leon in the game, hopefully they will be able to find their own interpretation of him as well."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Resident Evil Requiem launches on February 27, and we just got a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-the-final-preview">final hands-on look at Leon in action</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Do you like tense survival horror? It’s here," IGN wrote. "Wanna go all guns blazing with intense action and a quip-obsessed hero? You get that too. Do you prefer playing RE games in first or third person? Doesn’t matter; you can do either. All these choices, along with my fears of a jarring play experience being mostly squashed, make it easy to believe that Capcom’s bold move to have its cake and eat it is going to pay off in a big way."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

But we do not want to be using AI to drive creativity." Jagex is even speaking with its external partners to make sure no genAI is being used in “inappropriate ways in any of their work that might filter through to the end game."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The use of generative AI in game development is one of the hottest topics in the industry, and it has sparked a number of controversies. Following the reveal of Divinity at the 2025 The Game Awards, Swen Vincke, boss of developer Larian, met with a backlash after he said the studio was using genAI in various capacities. Larian ended up having to address AI concerns in a reddit AMA in which the studio confirmed a U-turn on some aspects of its use.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Jagex's "hard line stance" is in contrast to the approach of some video game companies that have gone all-in on the tech. The CEO of Genvid — the company behind choose-your-own-adventure interactive series Silent Hill Ascension — has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gen-z-loves-ai-slop-former-square-enix-exec-claims-a-lot-of-ai-sentiment-is-driven-by-emotion-rather-than-logic"><u>claimed "consumers generally do not care" about generative AI, and stated that: "Gen Z loves AI slop."</u></a> EA CEO Andrew Wilson, meanwhile, has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-says-ai-is-the-very-core-of-its-business-what-does-that-mean"><u>said AI is "the very core of our business,"</u></a> and Square Enix recently implemented mass layoffs and reorganized, saying it needed to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/square-enix-undergoes-mass-layoffs-as-it-reorganizes-to-consolidate-development-in-japan"><u>be "aggressive in applying AI."</u></a> Dead Space creator Glen Schofield also recently detailed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dead-space-creator-glen-schofield-thinks-the-games-industry-is-broken-beaten-and-battered"><u>his plans to “fix” the industry in part via the use of generative AI in game development</u></a>, and former God of War dev Meghan Morgan Juinio said: "... if we don’t embrace [AI], <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/former-god-of-war-dev-on-the-use-of-ai-in-games-development-if-we-dont-embrace-it-were-selling-ourselves-short"><u>I think we’re selling ourselves short</u></a>.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Outside of video games, some entertainment companies are banning the use of genAI altogether. For example, Games Workshop recently <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-maker-games-workshop-bans-its-staff-from-using-ai-in-its-content-or-designs-says-none-of-its-senior-managers-are-currently-excited-about-the-tech"><u>banned the use of generative AI for the production of its designs and content</u></a>, a decision many Warhammer fans welcomed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for RuneScape, it was in the news recently after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/uk-court-rules-stealing-runescape-gold-is-criminal-theft-in-case-that-could-have-wider-repercussions-for-the-video-game-industry">a UK court ruled stealing RuneScape Gold was criminal theft in a case that could have wider repercussions for the video game industry</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <p>
Another month means another batch of games for PlayStation Plus and, as we ready for the hopefully marginally warmer embrace of February, Sony has revealed what's coming next for all subscribers.
</p>
<p>
In total, PlayStation Plus Essential, Extra, and Premium tier members get four games as part the service's usual monthly additions in February, and they'll all be available from Tuesday 3rd February until Monday 2nd March:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Subnautica: Below Zero (PS5)</li>
<li>Undisputed (PS5)</li>
<li>Ultros (PS5, PS4)</li>
<li>Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown (PS4)</li>
</ul>

<p>
It's a pretty good selection, then! Survival fans can brave the chilly depths and frozen wastes of planet 4546B in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/subnautica-below-zero">Subnautica: Below Zero</a>, and there's boxing to be done in Undisputed. Ultros, meanwhile, is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ultros-review">wonderfully trippy, time-looping sci-fi Metroidvania</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ace-combat-7-skies-unknown">Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown</a> should tickle the aeronautical fancy of wannabe pilots.
</p><p>
Of course, new PlayStation Plus monthly additions also means departures, and subscribers have until Monday 2nd February to add <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/here-are-our-ps-plus-monthly-games-for-january">January's titles</a> to their libraries. These, if you don't already know, are Need For Speed Unbound, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/disney-epic-mickey-rebrushed">Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed</a>, and Core Keeper.

			<p>On top of <strong>Ubisoft</strong> being under fire from all sides after its <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-major-reset-cancels-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake/">recent "<em><strong>major reset</strong></em>" announcement</a>, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/enough-is-enough-ubisoft-worker-unions-call-for-strike-in-response-to-layoffs-and-mandatory-rto/">its <strong>workers planning to strike</strong></a>, its <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-lost-nearly-95-of-value-in-eight-years-34-share-price-drop-after-major-reset/">share price dropping to historic lows</a>, and upsetting its fans by cancelling projects like the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/breathtaking-leaked-pre-alpha-images-of-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-are-salt-in-the-wound-for-fans-in-mourning/">Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake</a></strong>, the studio's social media team has seemingly gone out of its way to cause more confusion and unrest in players with a bit of an odd response to a new leak regarding the heavily-rumored <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag-remake-targeting-march-2026-launch/">Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag Remake</a></strong>.</p>



<p>There have been several leaks regarding the Black Flag remake, the most recent of which (prior to today's leak) revealed the remake's supposed title: <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag-remake-assassins-creed-black-flag-resynced-pegi-rating-ubisoft/">Assassin's Creed Black Flag Resynced</a><em>.</em></strong> That was a result of a PEGI rating, which, compared to the new leak, is arguably a bigger deal than what we have now.</p>



<p>Today's leak came in the form of a new statue figurine for <strong>Edward Kenway</strong>, the protagonist of Assassin's Creed IV. The statue was shared online by <a href="https://x.com/TheRealZephryss/status/2016172983551984100">a user on X (formerly Twitter)</a> after being spotted on resale platform <strong>Vinted</strong>, where a seller identified it as a new figure that would be out later this year.</p>



<p>Ultimately, this leak doesn't do much beyond <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-assassins-creed-iv-black-flag-remake-major-changes-rumor/">adding to the pile of leaks</a> we've already seen, which have really only proven <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-edward-kenway-actor-threatened-with-lawsuit-by-ubisoft/">that we can expect the remake to arrive eventually</a>. The current buzz is that the statue is that it's actually what'll be included in the Collector's Edition of the remake. However, for some reason, the leaked statue has prompted a direct response from the <a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/2016531108486095252">official Assassin's Creed account on X (formerly Twitter)</a>.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Ubisoft's social media team employed the classic Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas "<em>Ah s***, here we go again</em>" meme as its way of responding to the leak. Now, this can of course be taken positively, as if it's Ubisoft providing a soft confirmation that the remake is happening and that we're about to "<em>go again</em>" with Edward Kenway's journey.</p>



<p>But instead of Assassin's Creed fans replying with excitement to a soft unofficial confirmation, the reply has brought more ire towards Ubisoft, with multiple replies from users immediately taking the negative approach, with one saying, "<em>What? You gonna cancel it like you canceled Sands of Time?</em>"</p>



<p>As to the actual status of the remake, since the project has never been directly confirmed, we can't actually say where it stands. Following the announcement of Ubisoft's restructuring, it was reported that the Black Flag remake was one of the seven projects to get delayed, but that it was not one of the unannounced projects to get cancelled. The only cancelled project we knew about was the Sands of Time Remake, while the others were unannounced. None of the games that got delayed have been officially identified by Ubisoft.</p>



<p>If Ubisoft was even on the verge of thinking about cancelling the Black Flag Remake, then it's likely this reply never gets posted. This is much more likely a soft tease, potentially indicating that we'll get a reveal for the remake sometime soon, even if it has been delayed.</p>



<p>Still, it feels like if there was ever a time to pull back on memes and soft teases, this would be it for Ubisoft,<a href="https://wccftech.com/french-union-claims-ubisoft-ceo-has-no-knowledge-or-understanding-of-his-company-after-major-reset/"> as it is currently under heavy amounts of scrutiny over its restructuring</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Does Half Sword Have Multiplayer? Co-op & PvP Release Details, Explained]]></title>

<p>Your life is on the line in Half Sword: Two combatants, two weapons, one winner, and a lot of blood spilled. Half Sword is a combat game designed to unleash the sadistic and barbaric medieval animal in you, and multiplayer or co-op would make it even more of a blood-filled blast.</p>



<p>It may seem hard to believe, but civilization is <em>slightly </em>more civilized than it was a few hundred years ago—even if that is hard to believe. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/half-sword/" id="3509" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Half Sword</a> takes us back in time to a more open age where duels-to-the-death were as common as bread. It requires two people, but does Half Sword require human or AI opponents?</p>







<h2 id="h-can-you-play-half-sword-in-multiplayer-or-co-op">Can You Play Half Sword In Multiplayer or Co-op?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A crushing defeat in more ways than one. Credit to Half Sword Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The white flag needs to be waved on Half Sword co-op or multiplayer for now, with developer Half Sword Games confirming that there is no multiplayer present at the game’s launch.</strong></p>



<p>Insider Gaming will hand it over to the official Half Sword Discord <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1043854763189600337/1272470349245579396" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">FAQ</a> to clear this one up:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“We fully understand the appeal of multiplayer and especially PvP. However, we also wish to draw your attention to the fact that physics-based multiplayer on Unreal Engine 5 is as hardcore as it gets as far as development: it is no easy task &amp; Half Sword is our first game. We are focusing on single-player physics right now to build a strong experience aimed at offering hundreds if not thousands of hours of fun.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Developer <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/half-sword-games/" id="3510" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Half Sword Games</a> is clearly putting a lot of time and effort into this project, with a view to this being a long-term goal. So, while there’s no multiplayer at launch, it’s not being ruled out.</p>







<h2 id="h-half-sword-multiplayer-release-date">Half Sword Multiplayer Release Date</h2>



<p><strong>According to the developer, a “polished multiplayer experience” is the long-term goal for Half Sword.</strong></p>



<p>The core focus is on single-player. Despite this being a game tailor-made for two real people, the physics and enormity of the gameplay mean a lot more work is needed to ensure a stable base.</p>



<p>The FAQ says: “Are we able to offer multiplayer at release: highly unlikely. Will we do our utmost to provide multiplayer after release: more likely.”</p>



<p>It does seem like Half Sword is destined for multiplayer, doesn’t it? There’s still plenty to enjoy, even if it is only a single-player game for now. Is a lack of multiplayer a dealbreaker?
