<p>Of course, being something of a master builder ourselves <em>*shines counterfeit master builder badge*</em>, we already got our hands on one, and have been busy building away at a set that, for the price of $59.99/£54.99, has provided a whole lot of very nice nostalgia.</p>
<p>Indeed, given that this particular writer is fond of the odd adult Lego set or two, this dinky little gaming delight really has stood out as one of the more fun builds that the company has put out in a while. What grabs you most at first, obviously, is the incredible attention to detail. Everything you remember is here, looking way closer to the original console than we'd thought it possible to get with bricks of plastic.</p><div><figure data-videoid="JEHFv10kUS0" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JEHFv10kUS0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JEHFv10kUS0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JEHFv10kUS0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38eeb6uypzxn&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>836k</span></a></p>

<p>The real joy, though, comes in piecing together the layers of history; the Game Boy's little circuit board, those iconic 'A' and 'B' buttons and so on, with each significant part being put together and set to feel just like the real thing in lots of creative ways: a little rubber Lego piece under the D-Pad so it moves around and reacts as it should; the on/off switch is <em>just</em> stiff enough; the volume and contrast wheels move just like we remember, and on and on.</p>

<p>Oh, and you've got to see these little lenticular screens actually moving. There are different qualities when it comes to these things, and these ones are top-notch; the Nintendo Logo, along with the Kirby and Mario Bros. scenes that come with the set, are a lot of fun to lay into the 'screen' inset for display. They've even managed to make loading the carts feel perfect (they click into place very satisfyingly), and the interchangeable screens are easy to remove and replace, meaning we'll actually switch them out from time to time.</p>
<p>There are a few other surprises hidden throughout the build — little attentions to detail all around — but we won't ruin <em>everything!</em> Here are some more shots of our own build:</p>

Next stop, circuit-board-building school!</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-loses-out-to-modded-nintendo-switch-%E2%80%9Cpro%E2%80%9D-in-some-backward-compatible-games-comparison-shows.1315585/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is considerably more powerful than its predecessor, but a recent online comparison shows the original Switch could have held its own better against the new console with a few key hardware tweaks.</p>



<p>The video comparison shared on YouTube by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@nag3030">naga</a> compares loading speed, handheld and docked performance in multiple games, and battery life between the current generation Nintendo system and <a href="https://wccftech.com/overclocked-nintendo-switch-playstation-3-games-rpcs3/">an overclocked modded "pro" version of a Nintendo Switch OLED</a>. The modded system's hardware includes an overclocked CPU (1707 MHz) and GPU (1724 MHz), 8 GB of RAM, an upgraded 8600 mAh battery, and modded cooling to prevent damage to the system.</p>



<p>While loading speed in games such as The Witcher 3, Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is much faster on Nintendo Switch 2, the difference isn't massive in other games, such as Hogwarts Legacy. Even in terms of handheld and docked performance in backward-compatible games, the differences aren't huge. </p>



<p>In GRID Autosport in handheld mode, for example, the two systems are an almost complete match, with the Nintendo Switch 2 sporting better frametimes thanks to its more powerful CPU. Docked performance is also impressive on the modded Nintendo Switch, as Zelda: Breath of the Wild runs at close to 60 FPS most of the time, although at a clearly lower resolution than the Nintendo Switch 2 edition.</p>



<p>In some unpatched games, however, the performance comparison between the two systems becomes more interesting. In Pokémon Legends: Arceus, the modded Nintendo Switch runs the game at smooth 60 FPS, as opposed to the locked 30 FPS on Nintendo Switch 2. The modded system can run Metroid Prime Remastered at 1440p resolution while maintaining a solid 60 FPS framerate. With Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy, the modded Nintendo Switch also has no trouble pushing the framerate to a steady 60 FPS, while the unpatched game on Nintendo Switch 2 continues to be locked at 30 FPS.</p>

<iframe title="Switch OLED Pro vs Switch 2 - Performance Comparaison" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NEBjt8Gt0M4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>While comparing how unpatched backward compatible games run on the two systems may be a little unfair, the comparison shows how some design decisions, such as the limited amount of RAM, held back the original Nintendo Switch. The Nintendo Switch 2 doesn't have similar constraints, and it shows, as it runs some PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S ports surprisingly well, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-pc-settings-excellent-port/">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-star-wars-outlaws-well-docked/">Star Wars Outlaws</a>, and the upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-better-anticipated-switch-2-footage/">Resident Evil Requiem</a>. The new entry in the CAPCOM series, in particular, is setting out to be another benchmark release for the system, so much so that <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-devs-surprised-how-well-it-runs-switch-2/">even the development team was surprised at how well the game runs on the system.</a></p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/megabonk-sales-1m</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/3d-survivors-like-megabonk-sells-a-million-copies-in-two-weeks.1315582/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher vedinad has announced that their 3D&nbsp;<em>Vampire Survivors</em>-esque roguelite game&nbsp;<em>Megabonk</em>&nbsp;has managed to hit a major sales milestone within its first two weeks on sale.</p>

<p>As <a href="https://x.com/MegabonkGame/status/1973773917040111965" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">revealed</a> on social media,&nbsp;<em>Megabonk&nbsp;</em>has crossed a million sales since it was released on September 18th. Humorously, vedinad says they'll be "eating spaghetti with EXTRA sauce tonight" as a result of the sales milestone.</p>

<p>The developer also says they "really appreciate" the feedback fans have provided for&nbsp;<em>Megabonk&nbsp;</em>since its launch, and that there are "definitely a lot of things [they] wanna fix and change". A roadmap could be on the way, but vedinad says they're taking a few days off due to being "a bit overwhelmed and tired", so don't expect it imminently.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/megabonk-sales-1m-running.jpg?itok=CqtAF_0H 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/megabonk-sales-1m-running.jpg?itok=QJ9wTizz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Megabonk&nbsp;</em>has racked up a million sales since being released around two weeks ago.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Megabonk</em>'s million-sale milestone puts it in the same league as games like Konami's&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-f-sales-1m" rel="nofollow">Silent Hill f</a>&nbsp;</em>and<i>&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-1m-sales" rel="nofollow">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a></i>, both of which had hit a million sales at last count, although they got there a little quicker (as you'd expect from established franchises).</p>

<p>In indie terms,&nbsp;<em>Megabonk</em>&nbsp;is now on the same page as hits like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sultans-game-sales-1m" rel="nofollow">card-based RPG&nbsp;<em>Sultan's Game</em></a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pacific-drive-sales-1m" rel="nofollow">driving roguelite&nbsp;<em>Pacific Drive</em></a>, so however you slice it, vedinad's game is in some pretty good company.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Megabonk</em>, it's an action roguelite that combines the wave-based combat of games like&nbsp;<em>Vampire Survivors&nbsp;</em>with full 3D movement and traversal, adding another layer to the formula's strategy element.</p>

<p>Just like in&nbsp;<em>Survivors</em>-esque games, you'll have to survive against infinite waves of enemies in procedurally-generated maps, but you'll now have to worry about things like verticality and positioning yourself in a 3D space.</p>




<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Megabonk&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3405340/Megabonk/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>, where it'll set you back $10 or your regional equivalent. Stay tuned for more on this one.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Few games have given us as many iconic one-liners as NetherRealm's fighting franchise, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mortal-kombat"><u>Mortal Kombat</u></a>, but this week we've learned that the voice behind one of the most famous — "Toasty!" — is leaving the studio.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Audio director Dan Forden worked at Midway and its successor NetherRealm Studios since 1989, most famously on the Mortal Kombat franchise. It's his voice we hear cry "Toasty!" in falsetto when we pull off an impressive uppercut. First appearing in 1993's Mortal Kombat II, Toasty went on to become one of the most recognizable lines of dialogue in all video games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, however, Forden is leaving NetherRealm, writing in a heartfelt message on social media that he was "really proud of what [the studio] accomplished."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Wednesday was my last day at NetherRealm. We made a lot of fun stuff over the years. I’m really proud of what we accomplished as well as how much fun we had making that stuff," Forden wrote on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DPTnVKxE6Ch/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Instagram</u></a>. "There are so many smart, talented people there — look for more great things to emerge over the next several years. I love the little touches that people left around the studio like this little Toasty homage on the bathroom mirror.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I wouldn’t have lasted 37 years in the industry if fans weren’t out there playing the games we made. Thanks to all of you for supporting what we’ve done. Live long and… Toasty!"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Asked in the comments why he was leaving now, Forden explained: "I figured I’d been around long enough. Want to reclaim that time for my own interests."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Forden's exit comes at an uncertain time for NetherRealm, which is owned by Warner Bros. In May, the studio confirmed what Mortal Kombat 1 fans feared after the launch of the Definitive Edition: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/confirmed-mortal-kombat-1-wont-get-any-more-dlc-characters-or-story-chapters-as-netherrealm-needs-to-shift-focus-to-the-next-project">no new DLC characters or story chapters would be released for the game</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In August, development chief Ed Boon said Mortal Kombat 1 had sold over 6.2 million copies. Its predecessor, Mortal Kombat 11, became the best-selling game in the franchise by passing Mortal Kombat X's nearly 11 million units sold worldwide soon after launch. By 2022, Mortal Kombat 11 had sold more than 15 million copies worldwide. Clearly, Mortal Kombat 1 has underperformed compared to previous games in the series.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">NetherRealm has said it shifted to "focus to the next project in order to make it as great as we possibly can," but it has yet to say what it is. Current speculation points to Injustice 3, a continuation of NetherRealm’s DC fighting game series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for what else is happening in the Mortal Kombat world? Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection, developed by Digital Eclipse and published by Atari, launches at the end of October. Movie sequel <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/mortal-kombat-ii"><u>Mortal Kombat II</u></a>  <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mortal-kombat-ii-movie-delayed-will-release-next-summer"><u>has been delayed from October 24, 2025, to May 15, 2026</u></a>. It's thought Warner Bros. and New Line Cinema believe the movie — which stars Karl Urban alongside Adeline Rudolph, Jessica McNamee, Josh Lawson, Ludi Lin, Mehcad Brooks, Tati Gabrielle, Lewis Tan, and more — will perform better at the summer box office given the wild fan response to the trailer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Image credit: </em><a href="https://youtu.be/1GWh4H4Xc18?si=SMYBdBX3RhXa_Mlr" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Atari / YouTube</em></a><em>.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.

Any account permanently banned for cheating during the Beta will be banned across all Call of Duty titles, from Call of Duty: Modern Warfare to future releases.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Activision had highlighted its new aimbot detection, which it said is “one of the strongest detection systems we have ever built,” and its new wall hacking detections, “making it harder for cheaters who manipulate the game to see enemies through surfaces harder to escape detection.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But a cursory glance at social media shows a number of clips revealing cheaters enjoying themselves in the Black Ops 7 beta.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">There are already cheaters in the first hours of the Black Ops 7 beta 🤦‍♂️ <a href="https://t.co/oK6hp6C4ki" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/oK6hp6C4ki</a></p>— ModernWarzone (@ModernWarzone) <a href="https://twitter.com/ModernWarzone/status/1973854357541290347?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 2, 2025</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">CHEATER ON DAY 1 OF BLACK OPS 7 BETA LMFAO!!! <a href="https://t.co/KkkW55vZaO" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/KkkW55vZaO</a></p>— Nicari 🤍 (@Nicari) <a href="https://twitter.com/Nicari/status/1973848298223194383?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 2, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The hope is, of course, that data gathered during this beta period will help reduce cheating when Black Ops 7 comes out in November. But publishers like Activision face an uphill battle when it comes to hacks. Indeed EA faces the same problem with rival shooter Battlefield 6, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cheaters-already-spotted-in-battlefield-6-open-beta-despite-secure-boot-requirement">whose open beta also saw cheaters</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As part of the war on cheaters, publishers are starting to force PC gamers to enable TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot in order to play. EA’s done it with Battlefield 6, and Activision has done it for Call of Duty. More will surely follow.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These features block modified hardware and unauthorized software, with the goal of creating a fair, secure environment for all players even as cheaters ramp up their efforts. But it remains to be seen just how effective they will be, with both Battlefield 6 and Black Ops 7 waiting in the wings.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For now, though, some Call of Duty console players are doing what they always do when a new game in the series comes out: turn crossplay off in a bid to avoid PC players. Cheating is more prevalent on PC (Activision recently confirmed as much, to the point where it said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-console-players-unlikely-to-be-cheating-theyre-just-killing-you-with-an-intel-advantage-activision-says"><u>if you believe you’ve died unfairly to a console player, it’s much more likely that they’ve used ‘intel advantage’ than cheats</u></a>). So, some console players head straight into Call of Duty’s settings to turn off crossplay across the board, just to take the potential for PC cheaters ruining their day out of the equation. Earlier this year, Activision added new console-only crossplay options for regular multiplayer, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-pc-players-who-do-not-cheat-are-being-penalized-by-new-console-only-crossplay-option-for-regular-multiplayer"><u>although PC players who do not cheat said they were being unfairly punished</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you want to get in on the action, check out our guide to the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-early-access-beta-and-open-beta-global-release-times-confirmed">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 beta global release times</a> to find out when it's playable.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

		<p>Playtonic Games has announced that Yooka-Replaylee is Steam Deck verified, so there is now another option to take the game while you are on the move. There is a demo available on Steam for Yooka-Replayee so you can test it out before the game’s full release on October 9th. In a statement on Steam, Playtonic said, <em>“Howdy folks! With only a week to go until Yooka-Replaylee launches, today we’ve gotten the shiny green checkmark from Valve to tell us and you that the game is Steam Deck Verified!<wbr>You can officially enjoy this 3D platforming epic at home or on the go! See you next week”</em><wbr><wbr><wbr></p>
<p><iframe title="Yooka-Replaylee | Official Release Date Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T1As5O96S4Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Playtonic’s desire to return to this game instead of making a sequel is to take on various things they’ve learned in the time since and reapply them to the original. Yooka-Replaylee, then, will feature improved graphics, more dynamic worlds, new and improved challenges, new collectibles, new characters, and a bunch of quality of life improvements too – of course, the original game had a major&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/08/10/the-yooka-laylee-spit-n-polish-update-has-landed-on-consoles/">Spit ‘n’ Polish update</a>&nbsp;to make early improvements of its own.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/04/04/yooka-laylee-review/">Looking back at the original review</a>, Jim said,&nbsp;“Of all the potential hurdles to snag on in creating a 3D platformers in the style of the late nineties classics, Playtonic deftly avoids the most egregious ones by far. At its very core, Yooka-Laylee succeeds in reviving a format long forgotten and does so with such vigor and passion. However, players shouldn’t expect it to reinvent the genre.”</p>

<p>Yooka-Replayee launches on October 9th for PC, PS5, Xbox Series XS, and Switch 2. A physical edition will launch on December 18th, and include a collectible game map poster, and an exclusive character sticker pack. The Switch 2 version will have a physical cartridge.</p>

            <p>Ok, so if you're one of those high-vis types who can be driven up the wall by health and safety code violations, you might want to look away. Crashout Crew, a co-op chaos-generator all about forklifts, has been revealed by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/peak">Peak</a> co-developers Aggro Crab, with sights set on a 2026 release preceded by a Steam demo this month.</p>
<p>I told you to look away, high-vis types! Why are you already running to management with a written demand that all heavy machinery can't be drifted around at top speed and slammed into boxes?</p>

<p>Anyway, forget about them, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3583210/Crashout_Crew/">Crashout Crew</a> looks like a great laugh. You can up to four mates are strapped into forklifts that can boost and drift, with the mission of grabbing various good strewn around a warehouse, and pushing a big red button to jet them off on the right conveyor belts. Failure to do so results in quotas not being hit, and presumably a telling off. As you progress, you can add extra quirks or wrinkles to the action via safety violations, much like in real life.</p><p>"After the recent cancellation of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/going-under">Going Under</a> 2, the studio decided to explore the whimsy multiplayer side of game development," Aggro Crab wrote of how it came to be. "While some of Aggro Crab developed PEAK with Landfall, the rest of the studio locked in to produce Crashout Crew!"</p>
<p>A full release in 2026 is being aimed for, but ahead of that Crashout Crew'll be getting a demo on October 13th, as part of the upcoming Steam Next Fest. You'll be able to give the first three levels a go and see if the chaos offered is up to snuff.</p>
<p>Aggro Crab have also made clear that Peak, the co-opper based around going for hikes up big hills developed by themselves and Landfall Games, will still be <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/peak-wants-you-to-waste-your-time-on-silly-things-like-basketball-and-chess-in-its-latest-climbing-averse-update">getting updates</a>. The studio plan to dual wield goofy creations in their quest to ensure that every being on Earth must have at least one chuckle with their colleagues while playing a video game.</p>
<p>It's a noble cause, and also a formula that's yielded Peak a considerable amount of success so far. So, let's see if doubling down will rocket Aggro Crab's forklift to even greater heights.</p>

            <p>The forthcoming remake of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/persona-4">Persona 4</a> will be "enjoyable in a new and different way", according to P Studio director Kazuhisa Wada.</p>
<p>Speaking to Japanese outlet <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/933/G093322/20250926041/">4Gamer</a> at this year's Tokyo Game Show (translated by <a href="https://personacentral.com/p3r-tgs-2025-interview/">Persona Central</a>), Wada discussed the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> release of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/persona-3-reload">Persona 3 Reload</a> alongside its director Shigeo Komori, but also touched on the highly-anticipated Persona 4 Revival.</p>
<p>"Persona 4 already packed a ton of content in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/persona-4-golden">Persona 4 Golden</a>, so when it comes to creating the next 'R', it's not just about adding more - we have to create an experience that's enjoyable in a new and different way," said Wada. "And this includes the sheer volume of content, so to be honest, it's a tough challenge. But it's shaping up nicely!"</p>

<p>As with every mainline Persona game, Atlus released a revised Golden version of Persona 4 a couple of years after the original, which added new social links, new scenes, new difficulty levels, and other bonus content.</p>
<p>It's unclear if this version will form the basis of the remake, or if Atlus has gone back to the original release. And just how different will it be?</p>
<p>Indeed, Atlus had a job on its hands with Persona 3 Reload. The original version of P3 was later revised as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/persona-3">Persona 3</a> FES that added a new epilogue, while Persona 3 Portable added a female protagonist option.</p>
<p>When Persona 3 Reload was released last year, it took inspiration from the more modern Persona 5 Royal, but as it lacked all options from previous versions, for some fans it still didn't offer the complete experience.</p>
<p>Still, in an interview with Denfaminicogamer (thanks <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/persona-3-reload-devs-havent-changed-their-minds-about-adding-portables-female-protagonist-we-have-a-mission-to-tackle-new-things/">Automaton</a>), Wada stood by the decision not to add the female protagonist to Persona 3 Reload, stating the cost and time needed would've been several times the resources that went into the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/persona-3-reload-gets-the-answer-after-all">Episode Aigis DLC</a>.</p>
<p>Persona 4 Golden is thoroughly beloved by series fans, so with the remake Atlus must be careful to offer something new while still appeasing its harshest critics.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rumoured-persona-4-remake-officially-revealed">Persona 4 Revival was finally officially revealed at this year's Xbox Games Showcase</a> in June, following multiple leaks and teases.</p>
<p>"We are currently working on this project with all our passion and love," said Wada at the time. "We are confident that this will be a fresh and surprising product for both newcomers and long-time fans and we look forward to sharing it with you all."</p>

		<p>There’s tons of big games arriving a moment to appeal to all sorts of gamers, whether it’s Ghost of Yotei’s launch for PlayStation fans this week, picking up on the excellent Hades 2 from last week, celebrating Mario’s 40th with the Galaxy and Galaxy 2 remaster, or hopping into shooty bang bang stuff with the Black Ops 7 beta, just ahead of next week’s Battlefield 6 launch.</p>
<p>It’s quite the time, and I’ve been playing some of these headline-grabbing games this past week!</p>

<p><strong>Aran</strong> jumped between two strikingly different games, with his review of the sportball-filled EA Sports FC 26 and the toon-filled action RPG Nicktoons &amp; The Dice of Destiny. Another huge shift comes with Jim’s gaming, who wrapped up a review of UBOAT, which put him in command of a German submarine during WW2 –&nbsp;“It’s a fascinating sim though one that comes with a steep learning curve, requiring patience and attention to detail.” He’s now moving on to Ghost of Yotei and the Black Ops 7 beta for this weekend’s gaming action.</p>
<p><strong>Laura</strong> has been hoovering up slime poops otherwise known as “plorts”, and then selling them for cold hard cash and upgrades in Slime Rancher 2. She’s also been “finding every opportunity to launch myself across the screen”, while playing Absolum for review alongside <strong>Ade</strong>. Her other half has added Marvel Rivals and Hades 2 alongside that, the latter of which he reckons is both bigger and better than the original.</p>


<p><strong>Jason</strong> thoroughly enjoyed his time reviewing Digimon Story Time Stranger –&nbsp;why did they ditch the colon for the middle of that game name? I don’t know –&nbsp;and has also falledn back into Vampire Survivors to go along with more lootering and shootering in Borderlands 4.</p>
<p>It was a big bunch of Final Fantasy Tactics this past week for <strong>Nic</strong>, but he has also been jumping into a different tactical game for review, and is looking forward to telling everyone a bit more. Soon.</p>
<p><strong>Tuffcub</strong> got a few hours in with Robocop: Rogue City Unfinished Business and finds it still to be both very enjoyable and old fashioned. “You don’t need to think too much,” he said, “it’s just reactions and exploding heads, and sometimes that’s all you need.”</p>

<p>While he continues his recovery, <strong>Steve</strong> has been building up his gaming stamina with a little bit of Silent Hill f, “which is brilliantly atmospheric”. He also finished Breath of Fire II and made a start on III, which is tickling the nostalgia bits of his brain.</p>
<p>And finally, <strong>Dom</strong> returned to the UK and has been playing a bunch of Final Fantasy Tactics for himself, mixing in some NBA 2K26 and Madden 26, and making a start on Hades 2!</p>
<p><em>Now then, what have you been playing?</em></p>

			<p>Final Fantasy VII Remake will finally launch on Xbox Series S and X and Nintendo Switch 2 <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-trilogy-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-xbox-square-enix/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on January 22, 2026</a>. These versions of the game will include, from day one, a new feature called Streamlined Progression that essentially lets players enjoy the narrative without having to worry about difficulty, thanks to the ability to keep health and/or mana constantly full, to max out damage dealt, etc. </p>



<p>Streamlined Progression (which will also be added to the existing PC and PlayStation 5 versions of Final Fantasy VII Remake with an update) was recently discussed once again by Game Director Naoki Hamaguchi <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/interviews/final-fantasy-7-remakes-progression-boosts-and-sped-up-cutscenes-can-reduce-playtime-to-under-10-hours-director-hamaguchi-tells-us-why/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in an interview with AUTOMATON Japan</a>. Hamaguchi claimed that players should have the choice in how they wish to interact with game content.</p>



<p><em>The biggest reason was that we were finally able to announce the FFVII Remake trilogy’s multiplatform expansion. That timing was what really led to the decision to include Streamlined Progression. Personally, I like to try many different games just to keep myself up to date, but I don’t really have the time, so I only get so far. Sometimes it makes me wish I had access to debug functions so I could cover more.</em></p>



<p><em>Naturally, when we announce features like these, we get responses like ‘This is sacrilegious!’ Even within the dev team, there are people who feel that way. But unless someone takes the initiative, it doesn’t happen. I personally believe that, with digital entertainment today, the player should have the choice in how they interact with content. That’s why I pushed for it.</em></p>



<p>Hamaguchi added that Square Enix wouldn't add such a feature at launch for the third installment of the Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy. In this context, though, with the game out for more than five years, they felt like it was an option they could provide. With Streamlined Progression, the game should be much quicker to complete: the developers estimate around 10 hours or even less for a playthrough, whereas a standard Final Fantasy VII Remake playthrough lasts between 40 and 50 hours.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/payday-3-offline-mode-canceled</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/payday-3-offline-mode-officially-canceled-starbreeze-announces.1315528/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Payday 3&nbsp;</em>developer Starbreeze has announced it's canceling one of the heist shooter's most-requested features, namely the ability to play the game without an online connection.</p>

<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/payday-3-celebrates-2nd-anniversary-by-canceling-promised-offline-mode.1314967/#post-145945057" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ResetEra user Santar</a>, Starbreeze revealed the cancellation of&nbsp;<em>Payday 3</em>'s offline mode during a second-anniversary livestream yesterday. The studio claims that the offline mode is "not feasible" for the "direction" in which it's heading with&nbsp;<em>Payday 3</em>.</p>

<p>The announcement that you won't be able to play&nbsp;<em>Payday 3&nbsp;</em>offline comes after Starbreeze <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/starbreeze-project-baxter-canceled-layoffs" rel="nofollow">announced a major company policy shift</a> yesterday, resulting in the cancellation of its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/starbreeze-dnd-game-2026" rel="nofollow">live-service&nbsp;<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons&nbsp;</em>game</a> and a pivot towards the&nbsp;<em>Payday&nbsp;</em>franchise as the studio's primary focus.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/payday-3-offline-mode-canceled-lasers.jpg?itok=sr0k3jYw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/payday-3-offline-mode-canceled-lasers.jpg?itok=yTqIpvvI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Payday 3</em>'s offline mode has officially been canceled.</figcaption></figure><p>That shift will also seemingly mean more games in the&nbsp;<em>Payday&nbsp;</em>franchise, as well as a sharper focus on the heist genre in general, so we may be about to see a slew of new&nbsp;<em>Payday&nbsp;</em>spinoffs and sequels in the future.</p>

<p>Of course, that's assuming that Starbreeze can turn&nbsp;<em>Payday 3</em>'s fortunes around. The game has had a pretty hard time of things since launching back in 2023; just a few months after its launch, Starbreeze <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/starbreeze-payday-3-performance" rel="nofollow">admitted it was operating at "significantly lower levels"</a> than the studio was hoping for.</p>

<p>Following that, in March 2024, then-CEO&nbsp;Tobias Sjögren <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/starbreeze-studios-ceo-steps-down" rel="nofollow">stepped down from the company</a>, and in September last year, game director&nbsp;Miodrag Kovačević followed suit, although he's still working on&nbsp;<em>Payday 3</em> as a designer.</p>

<p>Starbreeze's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/starbreeze-financials-2024-payday-3" rel="nofollow">financial results in February this year</a> showed that sales dropped significantly when compared to the same period a year prior, but the studio still called the year as a whole "successful".</p>




<p>The dropping of&nbsp;<em>Payday 3</em>'s offline mode also comes just a few days after Starbreeze <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fps/payday-2-dev-adds-dlc-subscription-to-its-12-year-old-game-as-a-cost-effective-alternative-after-price-hike-admits-we-messed-up-as-players-torch-its-steam-reviews/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ran into controversy</a> following the introduction of a subscription model for predecessor&nbsp;<em>Payday 2</em>'s DLC, which itself followed on from a price hike for the premium one-off purchase for said DLC.</p>

<p>Starbreeze has insisted that the timing of the subscription service's introduction was coincidental, but whether that's the case or not, I'd imagine that what the studio needs now is quick and easy wins, not to upset its fanbase further. We'll see whether it can achieve that in the coming months, I suppose.</p>

The warning has come with just days to act, and arrives on the eve of the game's 10th anniversary.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"On Sunday, October 5, 2025, Rock Band 4 turns 10," reads the team's statement. "What a ride it's been."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"With this milestone comes one big change: the original licenses for the core soundtrack are expiring. Because of that, Rock Band 4 will be removed from the PlayStation and Xbox digital stores. If you already own the game, nothing changes — you'll keep full access and still be able to download the game and songs to any new, compatible devices. The same applies to Downloadable Content (DLC): songs will come down as they hit the 10-year mark, but anything you've purchased will remain in your library.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We're so grateful for the passion this community has shown. From the team, it's been a special experience to serve you with Rivals challenges, a super deep DLC library and a best in class band sim. If you've been meaning to grab a few last songs, now's the time."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As of Sunday, Rock Band 4 and the Rock Band 4 DLC songs that were specifically released on its launch day will no longer be available to purchase. It has been clarified on Discord that DLC tracks from <em>prior </em>Rock Band games (released before Rock Band 4) are not being delisted "yet", but the team "will be figuring those out over the coming months."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Rock Band's unique approach to DLC has resulted in the ability for owners to carry their libraries of songs (plus exports of the tracklists of past Rock Band games) across three generations of console hardware. The approach has seen thousands of pieces of bespoke DLC released for the series since 2007, almost all of which can be played within Rock Band 4. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The last DLC of the Rock Band 4 era was released in January 2024, after eight years of weekly content. The news that the axe is now looming for all Rock Band content, however, marks a sad moment in the history of the 18-year-old series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Luke is a Senior Editor on the IGN reviews team.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/street-fighter-6">Street Fighter 6</a> director Takayuki Nakayama has shared his surprise at Capcom's decision to charge for the game's upcoming esports tournament finals and has apologised "for any concern this may have caused".</p>
<p>At last week's Tokyo Game Show, Capcom revealed the finals for its Tokyo-based Capcom Cup and Street Fighter League 2025 World Championship would be viewable globally online only via a pay-per-view model, when usually fans can watch for free across YouTube and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a>.</p>
<p>The finals for both the Capcom Cup 12 Finals and SFL World Championship will cost ¥4,000 each (around £20), or a bundle of both is available for ¥6,000 (around £30). The earlier qualifying rounds remain free.</p>

<p>The prices are comparable to being in the venue in-person, though prices range from ¥2,000 (£10) to ¥20,000 (£100) for SSS box seats.</p>
<p>The decision has been met by considerable backlash, but now the game's director has responded on social media.</p>
<p>A fan asked Nakayama if it was strange that Capcom's esports division and the Street Fighter 6 development team seem so disconnected.</p>
<p>"It may sound strange, but it's true," he said. "Revenue targets and assigned tasks differ fundamentally by department."</p>
<p>He continued: "Even the development team was surprised by this announcement (At least Matsumoto and I were shocked at the venue). That said, since this matter occurred within the same company, we are currently discussing it. We apologise for any concern this may have caused."</p> <div>

<p>In a later response, Nakayama joked: "If I get scolded at work, I will delete the above comment." Fans certainly appreciated his transparency, at least.</p>
<p>In response to Capcom's announcement, one user asked: "Isn't the whole point of Capcom Cup, CPT, and the prize pool supposed to be, y'know... marketing for the game? Why would you PPV gate that?"</p> <div>

<p>Another noted the Street Fighter League Japanese Finals last year were also pay-per-view, adding "Unfortunately the rest of the world does not have japans culture. This will be the biggest pr nightmare for your brand. Good luck with that."</p>
<p>The combined event will take place next year, collectively from 11th - 15th March.</p>

            <p>Even the most fervent Super Earth bootlicker wouldn’t deny that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> has been suffering some technical problems, especially after the performance-sapping <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arrowhead-will-target-helldivers-2s-crippling-tech-issues-now-xbox-release-is-sorted-but-would-rather-not-do-a-performance-only-update">Into the Unjust update</a>. Developers Arrowhead say a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-update-targeting-key-performance-issues-arrives-next-month-arrowhead-reckon-itll-be-a-noticeable-improvement">patch is coming,</a> and in the meantime, have <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/543369627969783286">shared the first</a> in a series of techy blog posts burrowing into the engineering side of how the co-op bugshooter comes together. Entry number one doesn’t deal with framerates, though: instead it explains the game’s longer-running issue with its increasingly gargantuan, 150GB-ish install size.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Earlier this year, players had <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1mw3qcx/why_the_game_is_130_gb_install/">already discovered</a> the most immediate cause of Helldivers 2’s swelling: its installation is stuffed with duplicate files, spanning weapon models to tree and rock textures. This had not only ballooned the install size over time, as successive updates added more and more assets, but left PC players with the unanswered question of <em>why</em> their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-ssd-for-gaming">SSDs</a> were filled with photocopied rocket launchers. Especially as the PS5 and Xbox versions, weighing in around a third of the size, exhibited no such duplication.</p>
<p>As the post (credited to deputy technical director Brendan Armstrong) now explains, including multiple file copies was Arrowhead’s solution to the slow loading times of creaking old hard drives. A lingering inconvenience to some PCs, but not the exclusively SSD-equipped consoles.</p>
<p>"The main issue with a mechanical HDD is seek time," Armstrong writes. "An HDD stores data on a spinning platter, and a physical arm with a read head has to move across the platter to find and retrieve data. The time it takes for this arm to "seek" or move to the correct location is a significant performance bottleneck.</p><p>"Imagine a large game level with various objects – trees, rocks, buildings, props. If the data for these objects is scattered all over the hard drive, the read head has to physically jump around the disk, which adds a lot of time to the loading process."</p>
<p>I know the feeling – I recently flooded my flat with spare scissors, having tired of never remembering where I put our sole original pair. Hard drives might have more reliable memories than me but when it comes to Helldivers 2, Arrowhead evidently don’t consider the time they would spend searching for individual, non-duplicate files to constitute an acceptable loading speed.</p>
<p>The post also considers alternate solutions, including removing or repacking certain duplicates – which would make HDD loading slower, but potentially cut the file size – or split off 4K textures as an optional download, something Armstrong says is not "natively" supported by the game’s engine but could still be made possible.</p>
<p>It’s tempting to mutter "Or everyone could just be sensible and get an SSD." I’d probably be muttering it myself, had almost every facet of gaming PC building and ownership not become so miserably expensive in the past few years, in turn making cheap mech drives genuinely harder to upgrade from on tight budgets. Hopefully Arrowhead can find a fix that works for everyone.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/halo-combat-evolved-remake-development-virtuos/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/halo-combat-evolved-remake-is-rumored-to-be-in-co-development-by-a-virtuos-studio.1315480/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The long-rumored Halo Combat Evolved remake is supposedly in co-development with a Virtuos game development studio, according to new rumors circulating online.</p>



<p>In a new video shared on YouTube, Rebs Gaming, a source who has been consistently reliable with past Halo series rumors, revealed that <a href="https://abstraction.games/">Abstraction</a>, a Virtuos game development studio, is the team that's working on the remake together with Halo Studios.<a href="https://xboxera.com/2025/10/02/rumor-halo-ce-remake-co-devleoped-by-a-virtuous-studio/"> XboxEra</a> later corroborated the news, adding that the series' developer is the lead development studio of the project, so this isn't an external project.</p>



<p>In addition, Rebs Gaming also reiterated that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-combat-evolved-remake-ue5-blam-engine-gameplay-tweaks/">Halo Combat Evolved remake will use both Unreal Engine 5 for rendering and a modified version of Halo Reach's Blam engine for gameplay</a>, highlighting again how the remake will combine a faithful gameplay recreation with some gameplay additions and modern visuals.</p>

(Exclusive Report)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fd2XFc7zKcw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Although Rebs Gaming proved to be extremely reliable in the past, we have to take everything they have revealed about the Halo Combat Evolved remake with a massive grain of salt. However, considering Virtuos proved to be specializing in this hybrid-engine development this year with <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-back-in-cyrodiil-19-years-later/">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-ps5-review-based-on-a-hideo-kojima-game/">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a>, it wouldn't be surprising for the developer to be attached to this project as well.</p>



<p>Thankfully, it won't take long to learn if the Halo Combat Evolved remake will be part of the series' future.

                <p>Nintendo has earned its reputation for being fiercely protective of its IP, including the Mario characters and the Pokémon universe. However, OpenAI's newly released Sora 2 has included so many Nintendo characters that it almost seems like it's inviting a legal response from the Japanese gaming publisher. Sora 2 is an AI-powered video and audio production tool, meaning that you can feed a prompt in, much like similar image generators, to create a video from your description.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/openais-new-sora-video-generator-to-require-copyright-holders-to-opt-out-071d8b2a" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The New York Times</a>, OpenAI has reached out to major copyright holders and Hollywood stars about being retroactively removed from Sora 2. It's not clear if a similar effort was made to reach out to Nintendo, but the sheer volume of Pokémon and Mario-inspired Sora 2 content suggests that the AI model was heavily trained on Nintendo's IP.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/GeorgeCrudo/status/1973531769535340950?" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">i got into sora 2 and the only conclusion I can draw is openai is trying to get sued. this is like 99% of what it shows you immediately upon entering the app <a href="https://t.co/BkAXqchK2T" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/BkAXqchK2T</a></p>  — George Crudo (@GeorgeCrudo) <a href="https://twitter.com/GeorgeCrudo/status/1973531769535340950?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 1, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Nintendo's properties aren't the only ones that appear to have been fed into Sora 2. Others like Tony Hawk's Pro Skater and Portal <a href="https://x.com/1ketaminepatch/status/1973278431275262230" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">have been mashed together</a> as well.</p><p>How will Nintendo respond? It was only a year ago that Nintendo went after <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/09/nintendo-is-reportedly-targeting-ai-generated-mario-pictures" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AI-generated Mario pictures</a>. It seems unlikely that Nintendo will let Sora 2 pass without taking action, especially since the company is famously litigious.</p><p>A report earlier this year suggested that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-in-talks-with-openai-amid-lawsuit-against-midjourney-report/1100-6532702/" data-ref-id="1100-6532702">Disney is in talks with OpenAI</a>, but the house of mouse decided to sue Midjourney over allegedly misappropriated movies and images. George R.R. Martin and a handful of other authors have previously launched <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-of-thrones-author-part-of-group-suing-openai-claiming-systemic-theft/1100-6517884/" data-ref-id="1100-6517884">their own lawsuit against OpenAI</a>.</p><p>While more Japanese gaming publishers are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/more-japanese-game-developers-are-embracing-ai-than-ever-before/1100-6535072/" data-ref-id="1100-6535072">embracing AI in game creation</a>, OpenAI, Midjourney, and other AI-related startups aren't acting in partnership with the affected companies. Nintendo has taken a cautious approach to AI, and Shigeru Miyamoto has said that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-creator-shigeru-miyamoto-talks-ai-says-nintendo-wants-to-go-in-a-different-direction/1100-6526727/" data-ref-id="1100-6526727">the company won't rush into AI</a> like other developers. Outgoing Nintendo of America president <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bowser-retires-from-nintendo/1100-6535034/" data-ref-id="1100-6535034">Doug Bowser</a> has stated that he believes AI will play a role in the creation of games, but he has also stressed the importance of maintaining a "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-boss-talks-ai-amid-concerns-of-job-cuts-there-will-always-be-a-human-touch/1100-6530667/" data-ref-id="1100-6530667">human touch</a>" in game development.</p>

            <p>Yesterday, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-open-beta-starts-2nd-october">the Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 beta began in earnest</a>, welcoming in untold thousands of eager players to try the game out before its proper launch on the 14th November. However, a number of cheaters also seemed to let themselves in and get up to no good.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-black-ops">Call of Duty: Black Ops</a> 7 beta requires both TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot enabled on your PC to play, <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/09/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-ricochet-anti-cheat-update#TPM">which Treyarch stated</a> was needed to "create a more secure environment that catches more cheating."</p>
<p>Within hours of the beta starting, however, clips started appearing on social media showing off wall hacks and aim bots working in the beta. Take the below video posted to X, which shows the same old cheats in action.</p> <div>

<p>Now, this account was later banned manually <a href="https://x.com/CODUpdates/status/1973874240253489434">as confirmed by Treyarch on X</a>, but why are old cheats working on a new game so soon after it was in the player's hands? Well, while the Black Ops 7 Beta requires additional kernel-level access to your computer, the updated version of Activision's proprietary Ricochet Anti-Cheat has not yet come to the game. Instead, players will have to wait until the full launch to get additional cheat protection.</p><p>This is but the latest blow in the ongoing fight between FPS game developers and cheat manufacturers. A continuous back-and-forth where cheats run amok until <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-bans-another-136000-cheaters">an updated anti-cheat solution bans a vast selection of these cheaters</a>. Then, after a little while, the cheaters learn how the anti-cheat works and it circles round and round. This particular cycle has been a fixture of the Call of Duty series for years.</p>
<p>There are other options available to players who want to curb cheating. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-will-allow-players-to-turn-off-crossplay-in-an-effort-to-limit-cheating">Activision announced earlier this year that it'll allow console players to turn off crossplay to avoid cheating</a>, admitting the majority of cheaters are playing on PC.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that this year's current Call of Duty competitor <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> has also suffered at the hands of cheaters during its open beta, with<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6s-anti-cheat-system-has-already-prevented-330000-attempts-to-cheat-or-tamper-with-anti-cheat-controls"> EA's anti-cheat shutting down over 300,000 cheaters during its run</a>.</p>
