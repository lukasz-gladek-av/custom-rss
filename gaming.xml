<p>Nintendo has this week surprised <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Xenoblade</a> fans with a Switch 2 Edition of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition</a>. There is also a paid upgrade for existing owners.</p>
<p>To celebrate the Switch 2 version, Nintendo is bringing back the game's icons for Switch Online members. Yes, in case you missed them the first time, there are four waves over four weeks, and the first wave is now officially live. As usual, they'll cost 10 Platinum Points each, and background and borders are priced at 5 Platinum Points each.</p><div><figure data-videoid="h10LJgMQyAc" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h10LJgMQyAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yth10LJgMQyAc" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/h10LJgMQyAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h10LJgMQyAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed562d82rzmkgi&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>If you haven't already pulled the trigger on the Switch 2 upgrade for Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition, it will cost you <strong>£4.19 / $4.99</strong>. Or you can get the Switch 2 Edition for <strong><em>£</em>54.99 / $64.99</strong>. Whatever you choose, expect 4K and up to 60fps in docked, and 1080p and up to 60fps in handheld. A physical release has also been confirmed and is launching in April.</p>
<p>Here's what we had to say about the Switch 2 Edition of Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition in our hands on:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"This is the smallest paid Switch 2 Edition yet from Nintendo, providing <em>only</em> a resolution bump (1080p handheld, 4K docked) and performance boost (a steady 60fps both handheld and docked). But it's hard not to be impressed when you see Monolith Soft's vision be fully realised on-screen. It's amazing we've never had a <strong>Xenoblade</strong> game at 60fps before this, and it's a real showcase of just how much more beautiful and smooth these worlds can look."</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/tom-cruise-brad-pitt-ai-fight-scene-video-debunked-2000671486</link>
            <guid>1441297</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>On February 10, filmmaker Ruairí Robinson made a <a href="https://x.com/RuairiRobinson/status/2021394940757209134">bold claim on X</a>. “This was a 2 line prompt in seedance 2. If the hollywood is cooked guys are right maybe the hollywood is cooked guys are cooked too idk,” he wrote. The post was accompanied by a video of Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt performing a fight scene together. The clip gained attention for its apparent sophistication; it appeared well-choreographed, competently shot, and appropriately lit, which are all elements that other AI video tools have struggled to convincingly replicate. If Robinson’s claim was true, this was a significant leap forward in AI video technology. The kind of thing AI hype-men have been shilling for years and which has—until, if Robinson is to be believed, right now—turned out to be nothing more than <a href="https://www.shokunin.studio/blog/2024/2/15/openai-releases-text-to-video-tool-sora-and-instantly-generates-a-wave-of-social-media-spam">snake oil</a>. There’s just one problem: It’s probably still snake oil.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">This was a 2 line prompt in seedance 2. If the hollywood is cooked guys are right maybe the hollywood is cooked guys are cooked too idk. <a href="https://t.co/dNTyLUIwAV">pic.twitter.com/dNTyLUIwAV</a></p> <p>— Ruairi Robinson (@RuairiRobinson) <a href="https://twitter.com/RuairiRobinson/status/2021394940757209134?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 11, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Aron Peterson, a writer and software developer who has also worked in film production, post-production, and visual effects, posted a blog on his website, <a href="https://www.shokunin.studio/blog/2026/2/18/is-it-all-over-for-filmmakers">Shokunin Studio</a>, questioning Robinson’s story. “The claims being made immediately rubbed me up the wrong way,” Peterson wrote. “Other demos of the Seedance model had the usual errors we have come to expect from AI video generators [but this one didn’t].” In particular, Peterson explained, “AI video generators are really bad at simulating realistic camera moves, especially handheld shaky cam,” but in the Cruise/Pitt video, “we can see the camera movement.”</p>

 <p>So Peterson started researching <a href="https://kotaku.com/arcane-league-of-legends-ai-trailer-vi-jinx-ekko-warwick-2000666921">Seedance 2.0</a>, the new AI tool from TikTok developer ByteDance that’s <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg1dl410q9o">already doing large-scale copyright infringement</a>, which Robinson used to create the video. Peterson “hopped over to Seedance’s website and it only took 10 seconds to find green screen footage of two stuntmen performing the same fight choreography we see in the Cruise vs Pitt scene,” he said. He also posted a comparison of the two videos on YouTube.</p>   <p>“Was the input really just a 2 line prompt or was it actually 2 lines, green screen video footage, and face references too?” Peterson asked. “The evidence appears to show that stuntmen were filmed from several angles, that a clip had to be generated for every angle, and then finally all clips were stitched together for marketing.” Peterson’s evidence implies that the Cruise/Pitt fight scene wasn’t entirely AI generated; instead, it was probably just face replacement and background creation laid on top of footage that already existed. As TV writer David Slack put it on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/slack2thefuture.bsky.social">Bluesky</a>, “In other words, like most AI hype — it was a con.”</p>

In the shadows, Takechiyo’s younger brother, Tokugawa Kunimatsu, is consumed by jealousy towards his sibling. Empowered by a sinister force, he plots to overthrow Takechiyo and leads a horde of yokai, abruptly ending the era of peace and plunging Japan into hell. Guided by the mysterious power of their Guardian Spirit Kusanagi, Takechiyo transcends time to rescue a land in dire straits and become shogun.</p><p>The story of <em>Nioh 3</em> unfolds on a larger scale than ever before in series history. Covering various eras and regions, including Edo Castle, the Totomi region during the Warring States period, the Heian period’s capital city of Kyoto, and, for the first time in the franchise’s history, the Bakumatsu period. Players will be able to freely explore each era as a vast open field featuring beautiful and distinct environments.</p><p><em>Nioh 3</em> introduces two distinct combat styles, Samurai and Ninja, that players can freely switch between during the heat of battle. The Samurai Style captures <em>Nioh</em>‘s foundational, grounded combat experience, while introducing the new Arts Proficiency system to enhance Martial Arts abilities. In addition, the new Deflect mechanic allows players to block enemy attacks at the last moment to turn the tide of battle against deadly adversaries.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>In contrast to Samurai Style, Ninja Style excels in agility, enabling players to swiftly dodge and perform aerial attacks while employing various Ninjutsu techniques to attack outside of enemy range. Ninja Style also features the Mist technique, which leaves an afterimage following an attack to momentarily distract enemies, as well as the Evade technique to narrowly avoid enemy strikes. Both techniques will help players outmaneuver foes while delivering devastating swift attacks from behind.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Accolades Trailer</span></h2><p><strong>English</strong></p><p><iframe title="Nioh 3 - Accolades Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Xr6MIWX29jA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><strong>Japanese</strong></p><p><iframe title="『仁王３』アコレードトレーラー" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HrdLtgaQnA4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2026/02/nioh-3-sales-top-one-million]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/skate-4-grom-paywall-location-new-map-island-2000671466</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Next month, season three goes live in EA’s free-to-play reboot of <em>Skate</em>. The big new addition in the upcoming season is Grom, an island that players can visit and skate around on. However, the island, which is a slightly updated version of the tutorial island, is essentially locked behind a paywall, which goes against a promise EA made before launch.</p> <p>On February 19, <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/skate/skate/news/dev-update-s3-skatepass-grom-and-the-future">EA and Full Circle posted a blog</a> talking about some of the changes coming in <em>Skate’s</em> third season, which goes live on March 10. In the post, EA revealed that a new island will be available to skaters in the next season. But accessing this island won’t be as simple or free as fast traveling to it once the update is live.</p>

 <p>During the first month of season three, skate.Pass Premium holders will be able to visit Grom as much as they want, whenever they want. For those who haven’t paid for <em>Skate’s</em> battle pass, they’ll be locked out until April. That’s when a “very special multi-week event” will happen, and all players will be invited to Grom’s “grand opening.” After that wraps up, free access to Grom will be restricted once more to Premium pass owners. Non-paying players will be able to spend 500 rip chips, an in-game currency you earn by playing, to buy a day pass to the island.</p> <figure><figcaption>An overhead comparison of Grom during the game’s tutorial and Grom during the event provided by EA.&nbsp; (EA/Kotaku)</figcaption></figure> <p>Did you get all that? A bit confusing, but somewhat understandable for a free-to-play game. However, there’s a problem. Before the launch of <em>Skate</em> in September last year, EA made some promises about the game. <a href="https://youtu.be/FAMgtFyrQLk?t=453">In a video posted in July 2022</a>, the devs said that when they started exploring the free-to-play model, they had to set some “hard ground rules to follow.” One of those rules included “No map areas locked behind paywalls.” Whoops! It also doesn’t help that the new island is just a slightly expanded version of the game’s tutorial island, something that is very clear to see in EA’s own comparison image in the blog.</p>

 <h2>The backlash to <em>Skate</em> paywalling an island</h2> <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SkateEA/comments/1r9a7oh/so_devs/">As you might expect</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SkateEA/comments/1r98r3g/ea_did_it_again/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><em>Skate</em> players weren’t happy</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SkateEA/comments/1r98r3g/ea_did_it_again/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">about all of this</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SkateEA/comments/1r9akiw/what_is_this_full_circle/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">and started flooding social media</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SkateEA/comments/1r997il/isle_of_grom/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">and Reddit</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SkateEA/comments/1r98un6/huh_whats_that/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">with posts</a> <a href="https://x.com/nkocharm/status/2024534025692430345">pointing out the promise EA had broken</a>. This eventually led to the official <em>Skate</em> account on <a href="https://x.com/skate/status/2024539083259654345">X posting a statement about Grom</a>.</p>

 <p>“We launched <em>Skate</em> in Early Access so we could build it with players, not behind closed doors,” EA wrote. “Since September, we’ve been updating the world, tweaking characters, and adding features our players have been asking for, and there is lots more coming. Yes, sometimes plans have to change. That’s part of the deal when you’re building in public. We’re here, we’re listening, and we’re going to keep shaping <em>Skate</em> together.”</p> <p><em>Kotaku</em> has reached out to EA for more information.</p> <p>While it is true that game development is messy, going back on this promise has opened up a can of worms. EA also promised that <em>Skate</em> would not contain paid loot boxes or pay-to-win elements. Why should players trust EA to stick to those promises if it is willing to deviate on this issue and toss an island behind a paywall, even one that can be avoided by grinding for currency?</p>

 <p>Regardless, I’m not shocked EA has decided to renege. The company is likely under pressure to make more money across all of its games after announcing its upcoming deal to sell itself to <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-saudi-bioware-ai-lgbtq-debt-junk-bond-2000630647">Saudi Arabia and private equity goons for $55 billion</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>WWE has filed three new video game trademarks.</p>



<p>On February 18, WWE filed to trademark the terms “WWE Domination,” “WWE Generations,” and “WWE Eras Collide.” All three trademarks have the same description, noting that they’re used for video games.</p>



<p>“Trademark registration is intended to cover the categories of video and computer game software; video games software for use with wireless devices; downloadable video games software for use via a global computer network and wireless devices; interactive video game programs and computer game cartridges; interactive multimedia computer games on all platforms comprised of computer hardware and computer game software; electronic games software that involves interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a video device,” the official trademark description reads.</p>



<h2 id="h-wwe-games-in-the-past-have-focused-on-the-clash-of-eras">WWE Games in the Past Have Focused on the Clash of Eras</h2>



<p>In 2011, WWE released WWE All Stars. Published by THQ, the game focused on pairing the stars of yesteryear against the then-modern stars of WWE. The game was an arcade-style break from the usual simulation releases the sports entertainment juggernaut puts out annually.</p>



<p>No game has since been directly focused on the collision of different eras in WWE history. However, every year, several generations are represented in the WWE 2K video game series. </p>







<p>It is not certain whether these trademarks will lead to a new video game release, and if that game will be released on mobile or console devices. Still, it’s been several years since WWE has tried something new in the gaming realm, and any sign of a fresh idea could be fun for that fan base.</p>

Raiders can also expect everything from gas grenades to trailblazers and other throwables to behave differently when winds pick up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One look at the trailer makes it clear visibility will be low during a hurricane, but Embark says Arc Raiders players will want to be wary of debris, too. However, like with most other map conditions, the increased threat level means more opportunities to find better loot, with today’s post teasing Raider Caches and relics of the First Wave for those who brave the storm.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Shrouded Sky is Embark’s major update for February and follows the January <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-first-big-arc-raiders-update-of-2026-adds-solo-vs-squads-matchmaking-bird-city-and-more-tomorrow"><u>Headwinds update</u></a>. While that relatively small content drop added a solo vs. squads queue option and the Bird City map condition, Shrouded Sky is said to come packed with a Raider Deck and map update, as well as a new Arc threat, which we may have gotten a small glimpse of toward the end of today's trailer. Players can also expect to reset their ranks once again with the launch of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-dev-outlines-expedition-changes-after-players-criticized-steep-reward-requirements"><u>the next Expedition</u></a> the following day.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-roadmap-promises-a-new-map-more-arcs-and-even-a-little-love-for-scrappy-by-april-2026"><u>Arc Raiders roadmap</u></a> also promised the Flashpoint update for March and Riven Tides for April.

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/how-a-rabid-xcom-fan-became-the-designer-of-enemy-unkno-5890749">Jake Solomon</a>, who previously served as creative director on <a href="https://kotaku.com/xcom-2-the-kotaku-review-1757343867"><em>XCOM 2</em></a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-midnight-suns-impressions-xcom-firaxis-pc-rpg-1849793171"><em>Marvel’s Midnight Suns</em></a>, announced today that the studio he founded, Midsummer Studios, is closing down. Solomon created Midsummer Studios in 2024 with the goal of “reinvent[ing] the life sim genre,” according to a <a href="https://www.midsummerstudios.com/news/studio-announcement">press release</a> from the time. <a href="https://x.com/SolomonJake/status/2024510423190430181">In a post on X</a> announcing the closure, Solomon wrote, “We built a studio, we made a game, and I’m really proud of both. Before we close the doors at Midsummer Studios I’d like to share a glimpse of <em>Burbank</em>, the game we poured our hearts into. It’s like “Life Sims + <em>The Truman Show</em>,” but it’s more than that. I believe people are storytellers, and I want them to share whatever stories and characters they can dream up. Burbank let’s you do that.”</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">We built a studio, we made a game, and I'm really proud of both.

In order to do that, <a href="https://x.com/SolomonJake/status/2024511003917009256">Solomon disclosed in a follow-up post</a>, “Our characters use AI for memory, reasoning and speech. That’s what let’s you create anyone you want and drop them in any story you write. But all of our art is created by our talented artists. We had no interest in replacing *any* developers with AI.” Solomon did not provide a reason for the studio’s closure.</p>

 <p>Studio closures and layoffs are arguably the games industry’s biggest crisis right now. Earlier today, <a href="https://kotaku.com/bluepoint-sony-playstation-ps5-god-war-2000671390">Sony announced it would close Bluepoint Games</a>, the studio behind the very well-received <em>Demon’s Souls</em> and <em>Shadow of the Colossus</em> remakes.&nbsp;In a 2024 interview with <em><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/life-sim/xcom-designer-jake-solomon-is-done-with-turn-based-strategy-and-is-now-making-a-life-sim-inspired-by-the-small-town-drama-of-gilmore-girls/">PC Gamer</a></em>, Solomon said that Midsummer Studios had 11 employees, with plans to add two more. At the time of the studio’s creation, those included co-founder and <a href="https://kotaku.com/civilization-beyond-earth-the-kotaku-review-1649058397"><em>Sid Meier’s Civilization: Beyond Earth</em></a> designer Will Miller, and Grant Rodiek, a longtime designer on the<em>&nbsp;Sims</em> franchise. It seems likely that, with Midsummer’s closure and <em>Burbank</em>‘s cancelation, all of those employees will be out of a job.</p> <p>Still, Solomon tried to end the announcement on a positive note. “We have moments playing this game where characters come alive in a way we’ve never experienced. And for an old game developer like me that’s special. What you’re about to see is definitely pre-alpha. But this game was a dream of mine, our team made it come true, so watch and dream with us,” he wrote.</p>

      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > ManaVoid Entertainment [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/manavoid-entertainment">ManaVoid Entertainment</a> has announced <em>Rainbow Billy: The Curse of the Leviathan</em> sequel <em><a title="Games > Rainbow Billy: The Book of Fears [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/rainbow-billy-the-book-of-fears">Rainbow Billy: The Book of Fears</a></em> for <a title="Platforms > PC [25,570 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4157340/Rainbow_Billy_The_Book_of_Fears" target="_blank">Steam</a>). It will launch in 2026. <span id="more-1027364"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via ManaVoid Entertainment:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>Billy is a little older now. And the world feels different.</p><p>In <em>Rainbow Billy: The Book of Fears</em>, you step into a more introspective chapter of Billy’s journey, one shaped by adolescence, doubts, and the fears that quietly grow with us.</p><p>Rather than jumping and running through obstacles, Billy now observes, questions, and listens. The game unfolds as a narrative investigation, where understanding others and making sense of emotions takes precedence over <a title="Genres > Action [3,425 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>As Billy explores the world, he encounters strange creatures known as Fearlings—manifestations of fears, anxieties, and unresolved feelings. These encounters are not about defeating enemies, but about understanding what troubles them, and, through them, understanding yourself.</p><p>Each situation invites you to investigate environments, gather clues, engage in dialogue, and piece together emotional puzzles. Choices matter, not because they lead to victory or failure, but because they shape Billy’s outlook on fear, empathy, and growth.</p><p><em>Rainbow Billy: The Book of Fears</em> is a melancholic, thoughtful journey about growing up, learning to name your fears, and realizing that understanding them is often the bravest thing you can do.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_1027370"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>Key Themes</strong></p><ul><li>Growing up and emotional change.</li><li>Fear, anxiety, and self-discovery.</li><li>Empathy over confrontation.</li><li>Understanding others as a way to understand yourself.</li><li>Nostalgia for childhood / adolescence.</li></ul><p><strong>Gameplay Overview</strong></p><ul><li>Narrative-driven investigation gameplay.</li><li>Exploration and environmental observation.</li><li>Dialogue-based progression.</li><li>Emotional and symbolic confrontations with Fearlings.</li><li>A slower, reflective pace focused on mood and introspection.</li></ul><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Narrative Investigation</strong> – Explore environments, observe details, and piece together emotional clues to progress.</li><li><strong>Empathy-Based Encounters</strong> – Face Fearlings not as enemies, but as manifestations of inner struggles to be understood.</li><li><strong>Introspective Storytelling</strong> – A more mature and melancholic tone, reflecting adolescence and emotional growth.</li><li><strong>Same Universe, New <a title="Companies > Experience [215 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/experience">Experience</a></strong> – Set in the Rainbow Billy world, but offering a fresh gameplay approach distinct from the first game.</li><li><strong>Stylized Art Direction</strong> – A colorful yet subdued visual style that mirrors the contrast between childhood wonder and growing emotional complexity.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.

      <p>Bluepoint Games, an American studio specialising in remakes like the<em> God Of War Collection</em>, the <em>Ico &amp; Shadow Of The Colossus</em> bundle, <em>Uncharted Collection</em> and <em>Demon's Souls</em>,<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-19/sony-is-shutting-down-the-playstation-studio-bluepoint?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>has been shut down by Sony after five years of ownership, during which time the company did not release a single remake</u></a>, with Bloomberg reporting that "roughly 70 employees will lose their jobs" as a result.</p><p>Having worked closely with PlayStation for over a <em>decade </em>(the <em>God of War Collection</em> was released in 2009), Sony decided to buy Bluepoint in 2021 and bring them in-house, after which they were promptly...set to work as a support studio on <em>God of War Ragnarok</em>, before then being assigned a live-service <em>God of War</em> game, before <em>that </em>project was cancelled in January 2025.</p><figure></figure><p>And today they're done. The studio, first founded in 2006, will be shut down next month. In an internal email sent to PlayStation staff (shared on<a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/bloomberg-playstation-is-shutting-down-bluepoint-games-demons-souls-shadow-of-the-colossus-remakes.1440826/?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>resetera</u></a>), Sony Interactive Entertainment Studio Business Group CEO Hermen Hulst says:</p><blockquote>...we're operating in an increasingly challenging industry environment. Rising development costs, slowed industry growth, changing player behavior, and broader economic headwinds are making it harder to build games sustainably.<p>To navigate this reality, we need to continue adapting and evolving. We've taken a close look at our business to ensure we're delivering today while still well-positioned for the future. As a result, we will be closing Bluepoint Games in March.</p><p>This decision was not made lightly. Bluepoint is an incredibly talented team and their technical expertise has delivered exceptional experiences for the PlayStation community. I want to thank everyone at Bluepoint for their creativity, craftsmanship, and commitment to quality. Where possible, we will work to find opportunities for some impacted employees within our global network of studios.</p></blockquote><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/embracer-layoffs-executive-saudi/"><u>I have seen some gross acts of mismanagement in my time covering this industry</u></a>--it feels like the last three to four years have been nothing but--yet this one somehow feels like the worst. Bluepoint was a studio with a very clear speciality and a very successful track record: they took old PlayStation hits, gave them an update and sold them to new generations of fans.</p><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/embracer-layoffs-executive-saudi/"><div><p>Executives Should Be Facing The Music, Not Laying Off Workers - Aftermath</p><p>Bosses need to be held accountable for their failures</p><p><span>Luke Plunkett</span></p></div></a></figure><p>For PlayStation themselves to buy Bluepoint, not use them for the one thing they would have bought them for and now close them down is just the most colossal waste. It's industry vandalism, at scale. Former PlayStation boss Jim Ryan, who had live-service game brainworms (see below), deserves some of the scorn here, but the current regime--who have made the decision to close Bluepoint instead of finding something, <em>anything </em>from PlayStation's vast back catalogue for them to work on instead--are equally to blame.</p><figure><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:lb5dnroqbk4ikw4zmgdd77dd/app.bsky.feed.post/3mfaeubpavk2g" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreihch3tsrer7mjtdjifeafldxutaiktgmffrnx5mee6h3vgjotb2am"><p lang="en">Not pulling this outta my ass either, here's something from Sony's 2022 investor/press thing, where they promised 12 Live Services by 2025. Aside from Helldivers, none of that is paying off, and that was under Jim Ryan who left before shit predictably hit the fan.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Rainbow Billy: The Curse of the Leviathan </em>was, I'd argue, one of those games with potential that fell a little flat, so the fact it's getting a followup in the form of <em>Rainbow Billy: The Book of Fears </em>is an exciting prospect for me.</p><p>Developer Manavoid Entertainment announced the game today, describing it as a "new story-driven investigative adventure" that takes place in a "colorful summer camp where something feels...off".</p><p>It sounds as though Manavoid may have ditched <em>Rainbow Billy</em>'s shape-based combat system; in a press release, the developer says you'll "explore the camp, follow subtle clues, talk with campers, and slowly piece together what's happening", but there's no mention of any fisticuffs.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption><em>Rainbow Billy: The Book of Fears </em>was an unexpected followup, but not an unwelcome one.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>According to Manavoid, you can expect an investigative experience in which "clever puzzles" will "guide the story forward and reward curiosity", so hopefully, this won't be your typical "press A on the thing to win" adventure game.</p><p>The story revolves around the appearance of "curious creatures known as Fearlings" that were "never supposed to exist". They're a manifestation of the worries of the campers at an otherwise-cheerful summer camp, and it'll be your job to deal with them.</p><p>Manavoid says the Fearlings will be central to your journey, and that each "has a reason for being there", making learning the proper way to deal with them "essential" for achieving success in <em>Rainbow Billy: The Book of Fears</em>.</p><p>Since Manavoid is still all about inclusivity and emotional intelligence, however, <em>The Book of Fears </em>will remain "warm and inviting" throughout its runtime from a tonal perspective, offering a "thoughtful and quietly meaningful experience".</p>
<p><em>Rainbow Billy: The Book of Fears </em>is set to arrive on PC via Steam sometime this year.

              <p>In 2021, Facebook became Meta and the company claimed its <span data-start="12.945" data-end="13.235">focus</span>&nbsp;<span data-start="13.270" data-end="13.398">would</span>&nbsp;<span data-start="13.433" data-end="13.503">be</span>&nbsp;<span data-start="13.537" data-end="13.584">to</span> “<a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/10/facebook-company-is-now-meta/"><span data-start="13.653" data-end="13.874">bring</span>&nbsp;<span data-start="13.932" data-end="14.002">the</span>&nbsp;<span data-start="14.037" data-end="14.443">metaverse</span>&nbsp;<span data-start="14.478" data-end="14.547">to</span>&nbsp;</a><span data-start="14.629" data-end="15.012"><a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/10/facebook-company-is-now-meta/">life.</a>” It launched <em>Horizon Worlds,</em> a VR metaverse that people could explore and create worlds in. It looked bad and wasn’t great, but it was supposedly the future. Five years later, Meta’s metaverse is ditching VR and spinning <em>Worlds</em> into a Roblox clone after burning <a href="https://medium.com/analysts-corner/the-100-billion-metaverse-hallucination-6f036155a869">$70+ billion</a> on virtual and augmented reality.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><a href="https://developers.meta.com/horizon/blog/2026-vr-state-of-the-union-horizon-mobile-focus/">On February 19</a>, in a blog post on Meta’s official website, the company announced its plans to split its VR and Reality Labs sector from <a href="https://kotaku.com/facebook-metaverse-horizon-worlds-vr-oculus-quest-2-cha-1848436740"><em>Horizon Worlds</em>, its free-to-play 3D metaverse</a> that supports user-created worlds and games. The company claims that doing this will “create more space for both products to grow.” The plan now is to fully pivot <em>Worlds</em> into a mobile, non-VR software experience that will resemble a Roblox clone more than the virtual metaverse depicted in <em>Ready Player One.&nbsp;</em></p>

 <p>“We started <em>Worlds</em> for VR with a small crew of dedicated creators who set out to build immersive experiences on their own,” said Meta. “Last year, we began to experiment with <em>Worlds</em> as a mobile platform, and we saw positive momentum. Now, to truly change the game and tap into a much larger market, we’re going all-in on mobile.”</p>  <p>And when I say <em>Horizon Worlds</em> is becoming a Roblox clone, I mean that quite literally. In the blog post announcing this big shake-up, Meta name-drops three experiences that have landed on <em>Worlds</em> in recent months and become hugely popular:<em><a href="https://kotaku.com/grow-a-garden-roblox-5-million-active-users-record-pc-1851781824"> Grow A Garden</a>, Steal A Brainrot, </em>and <em>Yeet Yourself</em>. (Though oddly, after posting the blog, Meta removed the last two games. Hmm.)</p>

 <p>These are popular Roblox experiences, and it makes it clear what Meta is really doing with this pivot. Not many people wanted to strap a VR headset to their face to play bad games. But plenty of folks, including kids, are far more likely to hop into <em>Horizon Worlds</em> if it’s just a phone game they can hop into on a device they already own. Early testing proved that. When you consider that <a href="https://kotaku.com/why-the-video-game-industry-is-dying-2000671338">Roblox is one of the few parts of the game industry that is growing rapidly</a> and making tons of money, it makes sense that Meta would decide to take its bad VR Roblox clone, rip out the VR part, and hope to find success as a slop generator for kids.</p>

 <p>As for what this means for the future of virtual reality at Meta, the company claims it isn’t going anywhere. It says it has more VR hardware in development and plans to invest more in third-party VR devs. <a href="https://kotaku.com/meta-game-quest-vr-facebook-deadpool-sanzaru-twisted-pixel-layoffs-2000659376">But after the company sliced up its VR game studios last month</a>, well, it’s clear that if VR sticks around, it won’t be a main focus anymore at Meta. <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/meta/2025/meta-to-invest-600-billion-to-build-ai-data-centers-in-us/">Instead, the company is focused on AI. For now</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/slay-the-spire-2/" id="3528">Slay the Spire 2</a> will feature co-op play for up to 4 players.</p>



<p>Slay the Spire 2, the follow-up to the game that built the modern roguelike deckbuilder genre, is slated to enter Early Access in March 2026 on Steam. The new <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2868840/Slay_the_Spire_2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">game description</a> not only teases expanded lore and new characters but also confirms that the game will allow four players to play together with new multiplayer-specific cards, team synergies, and more.</p>



<p>“Brave the ascent on your own, or play with up to 4 players and face the Spire together in the all-new co-op mode. Discover multiplayer-specific cards, powerful team synergies, and carry your friends (or get carried) to victory!”</p>







<h2 id="h-slay-the-spire-2-was-prevously-delayed">Slay the Spire 2 Was Prevously Delayed</h2>



<p>Slay the Spire 2 was initially set to release in Early Access in late 2025. However, in September of last year, Mega Crit Studios announced they would delay the start of Early Access. The delay was attributed to adding more content and to the importance of emphasizing quality in development.</p>



<p>“Compared to Slay the Spire 1’s early access launch (and for that matter, its final 2.0 form), this new sequel has a lot more content that we can’t wait to share with you. In addition, we want to make sure we’re upholding the quality bar that both we and the gaming community have come to expect for Early Access titles,” the studio stated.</p>







<p>They also joked that the delay had nothing to do with the release of Hollow Knight: Silksong. While that may be true, the delayed release of Slay the Spire 2 caused brief concerns for the development team behind Omelet You Cook. </p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/omelet-you-cook-devs-fear-slay-the-spire-2-will-steal-spotlight/" id="172827">The team previously joked</a> that they were nervous about competing against the game that defined the genre, but that game currently has overwhelmingly positive reviews on Steam.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/sony-email-bluepoint-hermen-hulst-studio-closing-why-2000671437</link>
            <guid>1441153</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Sony is shutting Bluepoint Games down <a href="https://kotaku.com/bluepoint-sony-playstation-ps5-god-war-2000671390">just five years after buying it</a>. Hermen Hulst said the decision was the result of an “increasingly challenging industry environment” in a note to staff on Thursday. It’s a shocking end for a studio that Hulst himself admits “delivered exceptional experiences for the PlayStation community” and comes despite a recent jump in profits for Sony’s gaming division.</p> <p>“I wanted to share an update from the Studio Business,” the message, a copy of which was viewed by<em> Kotaku</em>, began. “As I mentioned in the December Town Hall, 2025 had some strong highlights within PlayStation Studios. <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> launched to critical and commercial success, <em>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</em> further showcased our commitment to narrative excellence, and <em>Helldivers 2</em> and <em>MLB The Show</em> continue to drive on-going player engagement and revenue.”</p>

 <p>It continued:</p> <blockquote><p>At the same time, we’re operating in an increasingly challenging industry environment. Rising development costs, slowed industry growth, changing player behavior, and broader economic headwinds are making it harder to build games sustainably.</p> <p>To navigate this reality, we need to continue adapting and evolving. We’ve taken a close look at our business to ensure we’re delivering today while still well-positioned for the future. As a result, we will be closing Bluepoint Games in March.</p> <p>This decision was not made lightly. Bluepoint is an incredibly talented team and their technical expertise has delivered exceptional experiences for the PlayStation community. I want to thank everyone at Bluepoint for their creativity, craftmanship, and commitment to quality. Where possible, we will work to find opportunities for some impacted employees within our global network of studios.</p> <p>While I know this is hard news to hear, I’m confident in the direction we’re headed. Creativity, innovation, and building unforgettable experiences for players remain at the heart of PlayStation Studios. We have a robust roadmap for FY26, with much to look forward to in the months ahead. Thank you for your hard work and continued support.</p></blockquote> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">None of you saw this acquisition coming! 😊</p> <p>— Hermen Hulst (@hermenhulst) <a href="https://twitter.com/hermenhulst/status/1443594280250093569?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 30, 2021</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The message will likely <a href="https://kotaku.com/sonys-ps5-era-studio-acquisition-spree-has-been-a-disaster-2000671404">give some fans a feeling of whiplash</a>. It mentions the need for tough cost-cutting before immediately praising Bluepoint’s work. Its most recent games, a PS5 remake of <em>Demon’s Souls</em> and a PS4 remake of <em>Shadow of the Colossus</em>, were both critically acclaimed. Sony reported in 2021 that <em>Demon’s Souls</em> sold 1.4 million copies in the hardware’s launch year.</p> <p>Instead of continuing to have Bluepoint remaster or remake popular classics, a strategy which has proven very lucrative for Capcom with <em>Resident Evil</em> and Bethesda with <em>The Elder Scrolls: Oblivion</em>, the Texas-based studio was put on a live-service spin-off of <em>God of War</em> which ended up being canned in early 2025. The great irony now is that Sony is finally remaking the original <em>God of War</em> trilogy but is about to close the most obvious candidate for the job. Bluepoint was one of the co-development partners on 2022’s <em>God of War Ragnarök</em>.</p>

 <p>And despite larger industry headwinds, Sony recently posted impressive profits. While overall sales across the gaming division were down year-over-year, profits for PlayStation last quarter <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ghost-of-yotei-outperforms-ghost-of-tsushima-to-bolster-sony-financials">rose 19 percent</a>. It even revised its forecast for the current quarter upwards. Bluepoint is the third recently acquired game studio Sony has shuttered in less than two years.</p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/visual-concepts/" id="1887">Visual Concepts</a> is spotlighting some of the major changes coming to MyRise in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/wwe-2k26-2/" id="174969">WWE 2K26.</a></p>



<p>The latest <a href="https://wwe.2k.com/2k26/ringside-report/myrise/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ringside Report</a> feature on WWE 2K26 showcased the storyline and changes coming to the MyRise campaign mode. This year’s theme is “The Comeback.” In the story, you take your created wrestler, male or female, on a journey that begins with them returning to WWE, only to lose to Paul Heyman’s current client and top champion, either Bron Breakker or Jordynne Grace.</p>



<p>Then it becomes a story about a real comeback, and players get to choose between a righteous path and a villainous one.</p>







<h2 id="h-paul-heyman-pulls-the-strings-in-myrise-in-wwe-2k26">Paul Heyman Pulls the Strings in MyRise in WWE 2K26</h2>



<p>Paul Heyman narrated a brief video spotlighting MyRise, while the written feature discusses the important changes coming to the mode.</p>



<p>For starters, this year’s game expands on the Live Event Match system with a new structure called RISE Matches. Rather than functioning as bonus content, RISE Matches are now fully integrated into the main progression path. Completing these matches advances your wrestler’s journey and provides rewards.</p>



<p>Also, the story does not end after you capture the main title; there is a new-game-plus mode where you can continue defending the gold.</p>

</p></figure>







<h2 id="h-a-rewarding-journey-with-replay-value">A Rewarding Journey with Replay Value</h2>



<p>As for the aforementioned rewards, there are specific rewards for completing both journeys, including playable characters, MyFACTION content, new weapons, arenas, and more. Some of the rewards shown off include a special golden Bron Breakker, a new attire for “The Fiend” Bray Wyatt, a playable Dusty Rhodes, and 2003 CM Punk.</p>



<p>It was previously reported that the 2003 CM Punk would feature his independent wrestling theme song, AFI’s “Miseria Cantare: The Beginning.” Learn more about that at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-includes-classic-afi-song-for-roh-era-cm-punk/" id="177687">this link.</a></p>

			<p id="h-">Wccftech recently attended a remote press presentation in which French developer <strong>DON'T NOD</strong> (Life is Strange, Vampyr, Banishers: Ghost of New Eden, Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage) unveiled an extended preview of <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/cesar-winning-composer-amine-bouhafa-used-an-alien-instrument-to-help-capture-the-frozen-world-of-dont-nods-aphelion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aphelion</a></strong>, their upcoming sci-fi narrative-driven adventure game, showcasing two early chapters that introduced the game's hostile alien world and the mechanics that will define the experience. The presentation was led by <strong>Dimitri Weideli</strong>, executive producer, and <strong>Florent Guillaume</strong>, creative director, who walked us through gameplay and then answered some questions.</p>

<h2 id="desperate-mission-wrong">A Desperate Mission Gone Wrong</h2>



<p>Set in <strong>2062</strong>, Aphelion tells the story of astronauts <strong>Ariane Montclair</strong> and <strong>Thomas Cross</strong>, who crash-land on <strong>Persephone</strong>, a newly discovered icy planet at the edge of the Solar System. With <strong>Earth in a catastrophic crisis</strong> due to global warming, humanity had hoped this world could offer salvation, but <strong>the exploratory mission goes wrong from the start</strong>. The game opens right after the crash, with Ariane alone in the wreckage of her upside-down spacecraft, desperately trying to contact her missing companion, Thomas. Right away, let us clear up that <strong>this will be a linear narrative</strong>, not a branching story like Life is Strange.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Aphelion-Parkour.jpg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="active-climbing-partnership-esa">Active Climbing and the Partnership with the ESA</h2>



<p>DON'T NOD revealed that Aphelion's gameplay centers on three pillars: <strong>exploration</strong>, <strong>traversal</strong>, and <strong>stealth</strong>. The climbing system <strong>requires active player input</strong>. Unlike in most other action/adventure games, <strong>ledges don't automatically grab</strong>, forcing players to time their button presses or risk falling. The development team, which shares some members with the folks behind the climbing game <strong>Jusant</strong>, deliberately chose a more accessible yet time-focused approach rather than Jusant's more systemic mechanics.</p>



<p>Ariane is equipped with essential tools for navigating the planet's highly vertical terrain, <strong>including a grappling hook</strong> that allows her to rappel up and down surfaces and even gain momentum to reach distant ledges. The Navigator, a tracking device, helps mark objectives and navigate the environment without cluttering the screen with UI elements. <strong>Persephone itself was described by the developers as the other character in the game</strong>. Its melting ice creates both dangers and new areas to explore.</p>



<p>The developers <strong>worked closely with the ESA (the European Space Agency) to create a believable near-future setting</strong>, basing Persephone on the hypothetical <strong>Planet Nine</strong> scientists are currently searching for in our solar system after noticing unusual patterns in the Kuiper Belt, the region beyond Neptune filled with icy bodies and dwarf planets.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/APHELION-NemesisEncounter.jpg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="nemesis-relentless-hunter">The Nemesis: A Relentless Hunter</h2>



<p>The presentation then moved to the game's second chapter, introducing players to the <strong>one and only living threat: the so-called Nemesis</strong>, a hostile life form native to the planet. This creature, composed of water in its various states (liquid, ice, gas), is <strong>blind but extremely sensitive to vibrations and sound</strong>.</p>



<p>Unlike traditional videogame foes, the Nemesis <strong>cannot be killed</strong> and was designed to be a persistent threat chasing players throughout the entirety of Aphelion. The developers cited Creative Assembly's <strong>Alien: Isolation</strong> as an obvious inspiration while noting their unique twist: while Amanda Ripley had to avoid being seen, the astronauts in this game must avoid being heard.</p>



<p>The creature's presence causes technology to malfunction, and Ariane's flashlight flickers as a warning that danger is near. Early encounters with the Nemesis take place in claustrophobic cave systems designed to feel like a maze, heightening tension as players navigate them in near-darkness.</p>



<p>The game also features stealth sections that require very careful movement, because <strong>sprinting and climbing create noise that attracts the Nemesis to your location</strong>. Players can use the Navigator to track the creature's patrol patterns, though these patterns change dynamically based on player actions. As the game progresses, <strong>the Nemesis gains new abilities, while the players acquire tools such as decoys</strong> to manage subsequent encounters with the life form.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Aphelion-Ice-Cave.jpg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="two-perspectives-linear-story">Two Perspectives, One (Linear) Story</h2>



<p>Aphelion <strong>is composed of 11 chapters</strong>, <strong>each roughly an hour long</strong>, alternating between Ariane and Thomas. While Ariane's gameplay focuses on traversal and stealth encounters with the Nemesis, <strong>Thomas offers a more traditional DON'T NOD narrative experience</strong> (although we had to take the developer's word for it, since it wasn't part of the presentation). Thomas <strong>was injured in the crash</strong>, limiting his physical abilities and making his gameplay more investigation-focused. He also faces unique survival challenges, such as managing oxygen levels. </p>



<p>A key narrative device has the astronauts recording audio logs of their discoveries and feelings. While initially unable to communicate, <strong>the characters will eventually find a "supernatural way" to access each other's logs</strong>, creating an emotional connection despite their physical separation. </p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Aphelion-Pathfinder-Tool.jpg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="accessibility-over-difficulty">Accessibility Over Difficulty</h2>



<p>Rather than traditional difficulty settings, <strong>Aphelion offers extensive accessibility options</strong>. Players can disable manual ledge-grabbing, remove balancing challenges on thin ice, add persistent overlays to highlight climbable surfaces, and adjust measurement-based timing challenges related to the Nemesis encounters.</p>



<p>The developers <strong>emphasized their intention for the game to be challenging yet accessible</strong>, believing that difficulty creates a sense of reward when players learn from mistakes. However, they want to ensure everyone can experience the story regardless of skill level.</p>



<p>Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/banishers-and-jusant-underperformed-dont-nod-admits/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>underwhelming commercial performance of Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden and Jusant</strong></a> (despite the fact that they're good games, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/banishers-ghosts-of-new-eden-dont-nods-finest-action-game-yet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">especially Banishers</a>), DON'T NOD is hoping to bounce back. The game certainly looks interesting enough, although we'll have to play it first before we can assess its true value. Aphelion is scheduled to launch this year on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X; <strong>it will be available on Game Pass from day one</strong>.</p>

<hr>



<h2 id="developer-qa">Developer Q&amp;A</h2>



<p><strong>Would you mind telling us more about ESA's work and their inspirations for the game?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Florent Guillaume:</strong> Yes. As you know, we worked with ESA on this project because doing a sci-fi work, especially this type... We're not doing sci-fi fantasy, we're trying to do science fiction in a near future that is a projection of our current world. This planet we're exploring, Persephone, is actually based on what we call a "what if" scenario, because there is currently a search in our solar system for a new planet, a ninth planet. ESA really helped us through our understanding of space and the solar system, how to make this planet believable in our world, and also about our characters. We developed the characters and the technology thanks to them because we're not so far in the future, only about 40 years. They were with us to define this planet, the characters, their gear, and their tools, and to inform the narrative as we crafted the story to really understand the lives of these people and their thoughts and concerns.</p>



<p><b>Are both Ariane and Thomas playable characters in the game?</b></p>



<p><strong>Florent Guillaume:</strong> Yes. The main character is Ariane, the Erin of the game, and Thomas is the psychic of the mission. They have totally different experiences. Ariane's experience is based on exploration, traversal, and stealth-based confrontation with the Nemesis. Thomas is much more narrative-focused, so he has fewer scenes and less game time. His gameplay is more traditional to what we do at DON'T NOD with narrative exploration and development. I can't give too many spoilers about what Thomas finds on the planet, but he'll be investigating the things he discovers to make the plot progress.</p>



<p><strong>Was the crash caused by an accident?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Florent Guillaume:</strong> We skipped the intro cinematic for spoiler reasons, but I can provide some context. Yes, it was an accident, but not a technical one. It was something more mysterious. That's part of the plot you'll understand and discover. In a way, the planet is somewhat responsible for what happens in the crash.</p>



<p><strong>Do Ariane and Thomas have different skills?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Florent Guillaume:</strong> Yes. Ariane is much more engaged in traversal and action. Thomas is much more engaged in understanding and investigating the phenomena and discoveries I cannot discuss today.</p>



<p><strong>Do certain interactions you do in one chapter with one character affect the other?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Florent Guillaume:</strong> That's an interesting question. The game is linear, which means the story moves forward as you go. There's no branching scenes or narrative. The characters are separated, which means you play them at different times. But there are relationships between the scenes and characters, as I said, with the logs they're doing and other stuff linked to the lore of the game. So yes, there are interactions between chapters. Something you do with one character in one chapter will affect the character in another scene, but I can't go deeper into the explanation here.</p>



<p><strong>Dimitri Weideli:</strong> I saw a related question asking if it was like a Life is Strange type game with branching, and no, there is no branching and no multiple endings. There's one story.</p>



<p><strong>Florent Guillaume:</strong> No branching narrative. It's a proper linear adventure story that moves forward.</p>



<p><strong>Is the name of the protagonist inspired by the Ariane space program?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Florent Guillaume:</strong> Yes. Ariane's name comes from the spaceship program. Ariane is a French astronaut coming from Guiana, so her name comes from the rocket family indeed.</p>



<p><strong>Q: How was ESA involved in the development of Aphelion?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Dimitri Weideli:</strong> It's really a partnership. We had discussions with them about all the questions we had about technology and space. They were very open. Their goal was not to make a scientifically accurate video game. It was more like, "If you have questions about space or technology, let's go for it." That was the kind of relationship we had with them.</p>



<p><strong>Will there be more enemies besides the Nemesis?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Florent Guillaume:</strong> As I said, there are no other enemies than the Nemesis, but the way it attacks you and behaves will trigger different gameplay. It's a single enemy always coming back, always chasing you, but the way you play will evolve according to the situation, your behavior, and how it triggers reactions from the Nemesis.</p>



<p><strong>Would you mind giving us more details regarding the inspirations behind the Nemesis?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Florent Guillaume:</strong> That's a good question. The inspiration is pretty broad in terms of science fiction. It ranges from very contemporary modern sci-fi like Interstellar and Arrival to traditional SF like Alien. We can say that Alien is obviously an inspiration, both in terms of lore and games, because we've all played different Alien games, especially the one I think you all have in mind. That was obviously a source of inspiration, though the fact that the Nemesis doesn't see triggers a different way to interact with this kind of alien encounter. It was really interesting for us to play on a different level: not trying not to be seen, but trying not to be heard. That tension was really interesting for us to develop different ways of playing from what we see in traditional games.</p>



<p><strong>Dimitri Weideli:</strong> Regarding the artistic direction: Persephone is an icy planet, so there's a strong connection with water. We wanted an organic enemy made from the planet itself, which is why it has an organic shape.</p>



<p><strong>Florent Guillaume:</strong> The Nemesis is made of ice, basically water in its different forms: water, ice, gas. It can blend into the environment, return to the ice, and pop up anywhere in the world. That's something we're playing with, because you never know where it can come out. There's ice everywhere, after all, and it's made of ice, so it can basically emerge from anywhere.</p>



<p><strong>Are there difficulty levels and accessibility options available for players? in Aphelion</strong></p>



<p><strong>Florent Guillaume:</strong> There are no difficulty levels because we didn't want to categorize players into easy, medium, or hard, making them feel they're not good enough to play this way. We prefer to propose different accessibility options. We try to give accessibility to the different types of gameplay in the game. For example, traversal and the fact that you have to grab the ledge to avoid falling. For players less at ease with timing challenges, they can remove that and make the game more accessible. </p>



<p>With the Nemesis, there are different options to ease the measurement aspects, because the gameplay is very based on measurement. If it's difficult for you to gauge an input, you can remove that and turn some parts of the gameplay more binary. There are different accessibility options, and our goal is for everyone to be able to enjoy the same game and story, with options that allow anyone with any kind of difficulty to still play and access the game. You can also activate or deactivate the balancing. When you saw me walking on a thin layer of ice, you can switch that off, and for all the ledges in the game, you can put an overlay on them that stays on all the time to be sure to see your path.</p>



<p>Regarding the yellow ledges question: our goal was to avoid that as much as possible. In the scene we showed, it's part of the ship, so we tried to make it clear for the player to see the ledges while making it relevant to the situation. In the game's second part, most of the ledges are organic, made of rock, and blend with the environment. No yellow things everywhere: most of the game has more natural elements. If you don't see it, though, we have an accessibility option for you.</p>



<p><strong>What's the balance between cinematics, narrative, and gameplay?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Florent Guillaume:</strong> What we've shown today is pretty early in the game, and some moments are key moments that require more cinematics and narration. The rest of the game has a different ratio. For example, it's about 2 minutes of cinematics per 30 minutes of gameplay. The beginning of the game is more narrative heavy than as you progress. There are more challenges and longer gameplay sessions with action and less narration. The game is pretty balanced—the beginning is more narrative-heavy, but that's pretty classical.</p>



<p><strong>What time span will the story cover?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Florent Guillaume:</strong> Aphelion is pretty tightly packaged. It basically takes place in 24 hours. It's not fully seamless; there are a few ellipses, but it's pretty tight. It doesn't span across weeks or months. Everything in this game is oriented toward the characters and their journey. The time span is very focused on the characters.</p>



<p><strong>Is the character voiced by the same actress as Returnal?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Florent Guillaume:</strong> No, it's not the same actress. We're working with a French actress. Since Arian is French, we cast someone who really fits the role.</p>



<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

With the discovery of a 9th planet known as Persephone, both Ariane and Thomas have been tasked with venturing on a scientific mission to survey the planet for future habitability.&nbsp;</p><picture>

  </picture><p><br>However, their mission goes awry not long after entering the atmosphere, with their ship crash-landing onto the icy planet and the pair finding themselves separated from each other from the jump. There’s a sense of desperation right out of the gate as the urgency for survival sets in.</p><p>The demo puts us squarely into chapter one, which is a good starting point to get to know one of the dual protagonists. We start with Ariane, whose goal is to make it clear of the ship’s wreckage after waking up and ultimately find what happened to Thomas.</p><p>This is the bulk of the opening chapter, and there’s a level of cinematic feel with the way everything is framed, and also through things like interacting with the environment. Once Ariane opens that initial door, all hell breaks loose, and she’s sliding down the side of the ship, explosions raging, and there’s a struggle to not get caught in the debris.&nbsp;</p><picture>

  </picture><p><br>From there, it’s all about climbing, and it’s here Aphelion feels like it’s taking a page out of the <em>Uncharted</em> playbook a bit. Going vertical is the key, as is jumping across chasms and up ladders. Ariane can scope out the area to determine a possible way out.</p><p>Once that’s settled, Ariane has to keep holding tight as she ascends, taking care with specific button prompts if things get too shaky. There’s a level of tension here because it’s hard to know if anything could go wrong at any moment, especially when some grips can fail.</p><p><em>Aphelion</em> offers up more than climbing on ledges as well. Ariane can make use of a winch (grappling hook) to get up to specific places quickly as she looks for Thomas. It’s a tool that seems like it’s going to get a lot of use as she makes her way through the wreck of the ship.</p><p>As she finally gets through, just as the ship breaks away, the demo takes us to the surface of Persephone, which is a vast, frozen wasteland at first glance. After making some calls, Ariane has to find a viewpoint, and from there, further wreckage awaits.</p><picture>

  </picture><p><br>The second chapter in <em>Aphelion</em>, which we were able to play, took place further along in the story. Ariane is still on her own, but she’s investigating anomalies called singularities and will eventually confront an antagonistic force called the Nemesis.</p><p>This part of the preview still had many of the climbing and traversal elements from the opening, but with further exploration of the landscape in an area known as the Onyx Forest. Ariane makes her way through an icy cave-like system, and a lot of the gameplay revolves around finding the right path using a Pathfinder tool and avoiding treacherous elements like falling ice and collapsing ledges.</p><p>Deeper into the cave, Ariane can use a light to peer through the darkness, and it’s here where things start to get more closed in and claustrophobic – there’s this sense of being trapped and not knowing how to get out.</p><picture>

  </picture><p><br>It doesn’t take long before this all coalesces into a hidden force – a creature with a red glow of sort begins to launch an attack on Ariane, and it’s going to take a lot of stealthy silence to escape.&nbsp;</p><p>The creature reacts to movement, so the key is to tread slowly and quietly. If she moves too quickly or loudly, the creature will attack, and then it’s game over. There’s a lot of patience involved here, but eventually she can get to the right crevice in the wall and get out.</p><p>Even with just those two sections of gameplay, <em>Aphelion</em> is already shaping up to be something beyond the typical space sci-fi outing. The grounded realism feels more akin to movies like Gravity or Interstellar, so it'll be interesting how far those elements extend - especially with the noted involvement of the real-life European Space Agency.&nbsp;</p><p>While we didn't get to explore the other protagonist, Thomas, the state of his condition, and how that will factor into gameplay, leaves plenty to look forward to when <em>Aphelion</em> launches later this Spring.</p><hr><p><em>TechRaptor was invited to preview <strong>Aphelion</strong> on PC with a code provided by the publisher.

            <guid>1441111</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>With DON’T NOD’s latest outing, <em>Aphelion</em>, well on its way to release, we had a chance to sit and chat with the game’s developers <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/aphelion-preview-close-encounters" rel="nofollow">following a brief hands-on play session</a>. Speaking with us today is creative director Florent Guillaume, who gives us some insight on what <em>Aphelion</em> is about and how it uses the sci-fi genre to the strengths of its dual protagonists.</p><p>When approaching a game like <em>Aphelion</em>, which features a science-fiction space setting, we can’t help but be curious as to the why. What sort of design philosophy did the team subscribe to while making the game? And what sparked that particular interest in space and action?</p><p>“After working on <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/tell-me-why-episode-1-impressions" rel="nofollow"><em>Tell Me Why</em></a>, which was grounded in a very contemporary setting, we felt the desire to explore new horizons, both narratively and in terms of gameplay,” said Guillaume.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/aphelion-previews-broll.mp4_snapshot_03.03-2026.02.18_22.29.27.jpg?itok=7oO0BJ0v 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/aphelion-previews-broll.mp4_snapshot_03.03-2026.02.18_22.29.27.jpg?itok=6G1p32hT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="675">
                  

  </picture><p>“As science fiction fans, our team was eager to craft an epic sci-fi adventure while staying true to DON’T NOD’s core identity: character-driven storytelling centered around intimate human relationships.</p><p>“With <em>Aphelion</em>, our philosophy was to merge large-scale, spectacular science fiction with deeply personal drama. We wanted to place players in a near-future anticipation setting, something believable and grounded, and explore broader gameplay possibilities than our previous titles. Moving into a more action-adventure framework allowed us to explore new forms of tension, traversal, and environmental interaction, while still keeping the emotional journey of our two protagonists at the heart of the experience.”</p><p>Scale seems to be the core theme of <em>Aphelion</em>, and that includes things like the vastness of space, the hostility of the unknown, and the fragile nature of human connection. There's a specific balance between epic and intimate woven into the design philosophy. Building on that philosophy, the team digs into some specific pieces of media such as movies, TV shows, or music that influenced the development of <em>Aphelion</em>.</p><p>“We drew inspiration from a wide range of sources across film, television, and games,” explained Guillaume.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/aphelion-previews-broll.mp4_snapshot_06.26-2026.02.18_22.29.48.jpg?itok=oqteucbe 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">

  </picture><p>“Films like <em>Interstellar</em> and <em>Arrival</em>, and series such as <em>The Expanse</em>, were important references for their grounded approach to science fiction and their focus on human stakes within vast cosmic settings. On the game side, titles like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/last-of-us-review" rel="nofollow"><em>The Last of Us</em></a> and <em>Alien: Isolation</em> influenced us in different ways — particularly in how tension, survival, and character-driven storytelling can coexist within gameplay.”</p><p>However, that doesn’t mean the team is set on replicating what they’d call “hard science fiction." There’s an effort to create an original universe that’s rooted in a near-future that is very believable.</p><p>“The sci-fi genre is highly competitive and filled with iconic worlds, so for us, singularity came from grounding the story in realism and emotional authenticity. By anchoring the fiction in something plausible and contemporary, we could focus on dramaturgy, character arcs, and the human consequences of extraordinary events."</p><picture>

  </picture><p>In creating this universe for <em>Aphelion</em>, DON’T NOD reached out to the European Space Agency to collaborate on the project for the dream of a lifetime.</p><p>“Their involvement helped us establish a strong scientific foundation for the project,” Guillaume explained. n“We began with real science, research, hypotheses, and existing theories, and then extrapolated from there to build a compelling work of fiction.</p><p>“For example, Planet Nine, the planet that we explore in the game, is based on a real scientific hypothesis currently being studied. Working with ESA allowed us to approach the setting with credibility and respect for actual space research, even as we shaped it into a dramatic adventure. The goal was not to create a hard sci-fi setting, but rather to build a grounded world that would make the fiction feel plausible in order to enhance immersion and make the epic dimension of the story feel more tangible and emotionally impactful."</p><p><em>Aphelion</em> is a unique case because it features not one, but two protagonists. They won’t play the same, however, as DON’T NOD aims for unique experiences tailored to their unique circumstances. These characters are Ariane and Thomas, the latter of which has been injured in the crash that kicks off the main story.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/aphelion-previews-broll.mp4_snapshot_17.14-2026.02.18_22.30.27.jpg?itok=bg2vfuHW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">

  </picture><p>“The two characters are placed in very different circumstances following the crash, and that distinction naturally shaped their gameplay,” said Guillaume. “Ariane is physically capable and in control of her faculties, so her gameplay leans more toward action, traversal, and forward momentum. Thomas, on the other hand, is severely injured. His sequences focus more on survival, investigation, and vulnerability.</p><p>“This alternation serves both gameplay and narrative. Mechanically, it creates rhythm and variety—shifting from intensity to tension, from agency to fragility. Narratively, it reinforces their separation and the emotional stakes of their situation. Experiencing the world through both perspectives deepens the player’s understanding of their bond and the obstacles that divide them.”</p><p>With two different characters we were curious how the gameplay split would go. Does Thomas get more screen time than Ariane? Or vice versa?</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/aphelion-previews-broll.mp4_snapshot_19.29-2026.02.18_22.30.40_0.jpg?itok=DI-03MzW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">

  </picture><p>“Roughly 70% of the experience is played as Ariane, who is the primary protagonist of the game. Thomas represents about 30% of the playable time,” said Guillaume.</p><p>“Ariane represents the main story arc, while Thomas’ sequences enrich the narrative structure. The alternation between them is a deliberate storytelling device: They are separated and unable to communicate, the player becoming the invisible link between the two. By controlling both characters, the player holds knowledge that neither of them fully possesses, which strengthens emotional engagement and dramatic tension.”</p><p>That dramatic tension is further emphasized through the fact that <em>Aphelion</em> is a linear action game, but linear does not mean restrictive in the traditional sense. Guillaume said, “The level design alternates between confined, more tightly directed spaces and larger environments that offer multiple paths leading to the same destination.”</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/aphelion-previews-broll.mp4_snapshot_04.30-2026.02.18_22.29.41.jpg?itok=QfANNBfu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/aphelion-previews-broll.mp4_snapshot_04.30-2026.02.18_22.29.41.jpg?itok=MYgHho9r 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="675">
                  

  </picture><p>“While the overall progression is fixed, players will encounter larger areas that encourage exploration, environmental storytelling, and optional discoveries.&nbsp;</p><p>“One of the main intentions behind the game was the relationship between the characters and the scale of the planet, the immense distances that separate them. So even if we’re not making an open world, we are offering large vistas and explorable spaces that emphasize this sense of isolation and discovery. It reinforces both gameplay and narrative themes, reminding players that they are navigating something far bigger than themselves.”</p><p>So there you have it. <em>Aphelion</em> looks to be leaning big on story, its characters, and the sense of discovery in its own way. There's surely more to discover when it launches later this spring.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

              <p><span>Artur Ganszyniec’s 26-episode, 40-hour-long <a href="https://youtu.be/fwRtKBkq0N8?si=7_ARugH5g6fJwuER">playthrough of the first game</a> in </span><i><span>The Witcher</span></i><span> trilogy has finally come to an end, but the game developer, who served as lead story designer on the 2007 game, waited until the final five minutes of his trip down memory lane to drop the juiciest piece of info regarding its development. According to Ganszyniec, the writers at CD Projekt Red were “not really” involved in the creation of its final cutscene, and this “mistake” ultimately forced the team to take </span><i><span>The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings’</span></i><span> story in a completely different direction.</span></p> <p><span>As spotted by </span><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/the-witcher/original-witcher-story-lead-says-the-surprise-twist-at-the-end-was-a-mistake-because-instead-of-focusing-on-geralt-the-sequel-was-forced-into-a-story-about-witchers-who-are-killing-kings-for-some-reason/"><i><span>PC Gamer</span></i></a><span>, Ganszyniec decided to </span><a href="https://youtu.be/fwRtKBkq0N8?si=sMosOYVsDO_lHmR_&amp;t=5417"><span>reveal this information</span></a><span> as the final cutscene in </span><i><span>The Witcher</span></i><span> began to play. Those of you with good memories might remember that the game ends with the attempted assassination of King Foltest. After killing the would-be assassin, Geralt discovers that the culprit was a fellow witcher. This leads directly into the start of the second game, where we find Geralt locked up for his suspected part in the assassination.</span></p>

  <p><span>Turns out, Ganszyniec had no hand in writing the final cutscene. “The script for this…it was created not really involving the story team. So it was sort of, we weren’t really paying attention. And that was a mistake, I think.” As he explains, this is why the “open question” surrounding Geralt’s future that’s presented in the narrated section, which precedes the animated cutscene doesn’t match up with the conclusion. “Someone decided, like the board decided, or [CD Projekt co-founder] Michał Kiciński decided, that we needed an animated outro of the game.”</span></p> <p><span>This does explain why Geralt has suddenly teleported back to Vizima at the end of the game. The disconnect between Dandelion posing the open-ended question, “What then happened to the witcher?” in the closing narration and an ending cutscene that immediately answers said question also now makes sense, as the writers clearly intended for this to provide setup for something else entirely. On the plus side, Ganszyniec doesn’t seem bitter about the change, as he rounded off his playthrough by voicing his excitement for Fool’s Theory’s upcoming remake of </span><i><span>The Witcher</span></i><span>. “Let’s hope that the remake will be a really good game.”</span></p>

              <p><span>I guess </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-grand-theft-auto-vi-delayed-november-rockstar-games-2000641787"><span>in the year </span><i><span>Grand Theft Auto 6 </span></i><span>is coming out</span></a><span>, there are worse days for </span><i><span>Slay the Spire 2</span></i><span>, the long-awaited sequel to the 2019 deckbuilding roguelike, to enter Early Access. But dang, Mega Crit sure picked a packed day to release this early build. The studio announced that </span><i><span>Slay the Spire 2 </span></i><span>will come to Steam on March 5, the same day </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-free-demo-beta-weekend-server-slam-2000668383"><i><span>Marathon</span></i></a> <span>and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-pokopia-ghost-pikachu-peakychu-cloud-island-2000669710"><i><span>Pokémon Pokopia</span></i></a> <span>are launching. For a lot of folks, those games might not overlap, but if you’re interested in more than one of them, you’ll have to make some choices about how you spend your day.</span></p> <p><span>The announcement comes with a pretty slick animated trailer showing its various class characters kicking ass, but there’s also a bit of gross fantasy violence in there, so viewer discretion is advised if you’re squeamish.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Check out the trailer below:</span></p>   <p><i><span>Slay the Spire 2</span></i><span> was originally supposed to come to Early Access last year before being </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/slay-the-spire-2-is-now-a-2026-release-but-dont-blame-hornet-2000625257"><span>delayed into March late last year</span></a><span>. The team at Mega Crit said this was due to a combination of personal life disruptions and just a desire to add more to the sequel before it got into player’s hands., though they were also clear that it was not part of the spree of delays that came about as a result of </span><i><span>Hollow Knight: Silksong</span></i><span> finally getting a release date.</span></p>

 <p><span>“There’s no single dramatic reason,” the announcement read. “Some personal life stuff hit the team (everyone’s okay!), we kept saying ‘wouldn’t it be cool if…’ one too many times, and honestly, the game just needs more polish to meet our standards.” Thus another six months development before the game reaches players.”</span></p> <p><span>But the wait is nearly over now. The original </span><i><span>Slay the Spire </span></i><span>launched in 2019 </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/slay-the-spire-is-a-roguelike-card-game-and-im-hooked-1822608254"><span>after its own Early Access period</span></a><span>, and is considered one of the progenitors of the deckbuilding roguelike genre and a major player in its popularity in the years that followed. </span></p>
