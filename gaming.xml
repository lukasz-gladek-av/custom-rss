<p>Available on <strong>27th November 2025</strong>, the update will add new weapons, a brand new Sync Strike for Zelda and fan-favourite Korok Calamo, and other goodies. Being typically coy there, Nintendo! The game already has a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/admin/campaigns/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-walkthrough-guide"><em>ton</em> to unlock</a>, including maxing out characters and finding all of those pesky Koroks, even if it's a little brisker than <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hyrule_warriors_age_of_calamity">Age of Calamity</a>.</p><div><figure data-videoid="hKPW8QbGdv8" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hKPW8QbGdv8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ythKPW8QbGdv8" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hKPW8QbGdv8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hKPW8QbGdv8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed6474b2gunlry&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>

<p>Well, head over to <a href="https://www.gamecity.ne.jp/zelda-fuuin/jp/update/">the Japanese website</a> and you'll see exactly what else we'll be getting — along with some extra challenges, new enemies, and more powerful materials, you'll also be able to team up with the Block Golem for <em>another</em> new Sync Strike.</p>
<p>A handful of new battles are also getting added on Thursday, including one which is apparently titled "A serious battle with Rauru". <em>Hmmm</em>.</p>

<p>There are also some <a href="https://www.gamecity.ne.jp/zelda-fuuin/jp/update/">additional patch notes</a>, which aim to fix functionality and a few bug fixes. We'll post the official translation when they're out there, but a couple of tweaks include adding tutorials that appear on the map are added to the list, previews of areas you can reclaim will show up, and a preview of the amount of health you can recover is now shown.</p>
<p>The previous Hyrule Warriors game also got a handful of updates <em>and</em> an Expansion Pass which brought with it an "expanded roster". So don't expect anything of that scale here.</p>
<p>Nintendo promised that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-already-has-free-updates-planned">it had free updates planned</a> for the game after launch. And free stuff, whatever it is, we'll take. Especially as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">we really enjoyed</a> this canon prequel to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Tears of the Kingdom</a>.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/demonschool-credits-something-different</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/demonschool-credits-try-something-different-list-full-staff-duties.1364143/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Demonschool&nbsp;</em>developer Necrosoft says that it tried "something different" for the credits sequence in the game, opting to list the full duties carried out by staff rather than a brief description of each person's role.</p>

<p>Over on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/brandon.insertcredit.com/post/3m6fuipkh4k2u" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a>, Necrosoft director Brandon Sheffield says the team used a format of "name, title, lengthy description of what they did" for each staff member's credit on&nbsp;<em>Demonschool</em>.</p>

<p>This means that, rather than simply reading "art lead", a credit might outline that a staff member "did most of the 3D modeling and rigging as well as creating most backgrounds", or that they "created most avatars and poses, all overlays and menu art, [and] the game logo".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/necrosoft-demonschool-credits.jpg?itok=cqBDsfge 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/necrosoft-demonschool-credits.jpg?itok=WQKF_MDr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Demonschool</em>'s credits are serious about giving staff members their due.</figcaption></figure><p>Sheffield says he wants to make sure that those who choose to watch&nbsp;<em>Demonschool</em>'s credits (which, he acknowledges, won't be everybody) will "come to understand how each person participated", and that doing things this way might help staff members to elucidate their roles during job interviews in future.</p>

<p>He also says that, in addition to&nbsp;<em>Demonschool</em>'s core team, Necrosoft credited "everyone who ever touched the game in any way". Sheffield acknowledges this means the credits for&nbsp;<em>Demonschool&nbsp;</em>are long for a small team, but to that, he says "why be stingy?".</p>

<p>It's refreshing to see an indie team being so upfront about its credits, especially in an era where specific studios and staff members often <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gaming-business-roundup-july-12th" rel="nofollow">aren't credited</a> in major <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/original-metroid-prime-developers-omitted-from-remastered-credits" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">releases</a> on which they worked. Whether or not this style gets adopted across the world of indie gaming remains to be seen, but I sure hope it does.</p>

<p>As for&nbsp;<em>Demonschool</em>, if you're unfamiliar with it, the game is a tactical RPG that combines the minutiae of school life with a strategic puzzle-style combat system in which you must battle demons between your own world and theirs.</p>




<p>The game was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/demonschool-persona-inspired-tactics-rpg-announced" rel="nofollow">revealed back in 2022</a>, but was subsequently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/demonschool-release-date-september-2025" rel="nofollow">delayed numerous times</a>, most recently due to Necrosoft wanting to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hollow-knight-silksong-indie-delays" rel="nofollow">avoid a clash</a> with then-hotly-anticipated Metroidvania&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>.</p>

<p>Happily, however,&nbsp;<em>Demonschool&nbsp;</em>is finally out, and you can take a look at it right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1900250/Demonschool/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10007754" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/demonschool/9p7d4xfj2xwf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/demonschool-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/light-your-outdoors-up-with-the-govee-christmas-lights-2-for-just-130-today-2000647131</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/govee-christmas-led-lights-go-for-peanuts-holiday-decor-basically-comes-free-thanks-to-exceptionally-low-black-friday-pricing.1364137/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Holiday shopping is on the rise, and if you haven’t grabbed a fun string of Christmas lights to brighten up your outdoor and indoor space, today is a good time to make the move.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5918/">Govee, a brand that offers some of our favorite smart lighting solutions out there, is now offering its outdoor-friendly, 164-foot Christmas Lights 2 for $130 on Amazon</a>. That’s after a sweet, straightforward 35% discount on the retail price of $200, thanks to an early Black Friday deal.</p>
<p>These are already high in demand on regular days, and the current discount makes them an even more popular pick. It’s best to grab yours before the stock disappears for good, which could be any moment now.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5918/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>AI-Generated Light Show</h2>
<p>These aren’t your average, golden string lights. The string comes with 500 LEDs, each of which has a built-in IC chip to realize single control. Govee adds white LED beads to the color mix for a brighter setting with high color accuracy. There are 16 million color options to choose from (you read that right), meaning you can have a different one every single day of the year and still have plenty left to explore. Go with neon green in the morning, red in the evening, and wind down with a subtle golden at night; the possibilities are endless.</p>
<p>If plain, solid colors start to feel boring, especially during festivities, there are over 130 animated lighting effects for every possible occasion. For instance, the Thanksgiving option features warmer colors for cozy gatherings and hearty meals, while the Christmas one brings brighter colors to lift the energy of the whole house instantly. You can switch colors and patterns, plus create your own effects when feeling a bit creative. Not sure what to go for? Share your vision with the Govee AI Lighting Bot, and it’s going to create one based on your preferences. You can even upload some images to give it an idea of the vibe you’re hoping to achieve. Say something like “Give me a dancing Christmas effect”, and wait for the ultimate showdown.</p>



<p>As for the installation, setting the lights up is fairly straightforward. The 164-foot length is enough to line the roof, wrap around your Christmas tree, or frame the main door. It’s ideal for most homes, but if you need another size, these lights also come in 66ft, 99ft, and 328ft size options. The prices vary, but almost all the options are going for less right now. Once you have the lights up, you can manage them using the dedicated smartphone app or through your voice with Alexa and Google Assistant. You can ask the voice assistants to turn the lights on/off, change the patterns, adjust the brightness, and more, without even getting up from your couch.</p>
<p>Finally, Govee has designed the lights to be both waterproof and dustproof. They can handle extreme weather conditions (rain, harsh sunlight, snow) like a champ, so nothing is going to dim that spark, pun intended.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5918/">The current Black Friday deal brings the price down to just $130, which is quite affordable considering all the features you’re getting.</a> Even though these are labelled as “Christmas lights”, you can use them all year round for every occasion, whether it’s birthdays, anniversaries, or even just casually at home. The brand is also offering plenty of its other top-rated lighting solutions for less, so now is a great time to stock up on both indoor and outdoor smart lights. Just be sure to act fast, as early deals tend to wrap up quickly.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Dan Houser has been on a media cycle to promote his new book. Obviously, gaming questions and quandaries are being thrown his way, and the Rockstar Games co-founder has opened up on AI usage in gaming, how he’s using it for his new game, and how it’s not all that.</p>



<p>AI is everywhere. You can’t get away from it. We’ve gone from harmless ChatGPT prompts to full-blown AI use across all media. AI’s use in gaming is causing a constant stir, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dan-houser-left-rockstar-games-due-to-disagreement-with-brother-over-companys-direction-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dan Houser</a> has discussed how his new game with Absurd Ventures is using it, and why it’s not as useful as it seems.</p>

<figure><figcaption>GTA 6 likely features AI. Credit to Rockstar Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>In an interview on the Sunday Brunch talk show, Houser was asked about his new book, called ‘A Better Paradise,’ aptly all about AI and an aspiring developer creating the perfect computer game:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“We are making a game, set in the same world, but not exactly the same story. We’ve begun work on that about 18 months ago, and that’ll be another few years in development.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The Rockstar co-founder was asked about the use of AI in his upcoming game. He’s very candid about using it, but offers some pushback on the technology:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“We are dabbling in using AI, but the truth is it’s not as useful as some of the companies would have you believe yet. It’s not going to solve all of the problems.”</p>
</blockquote>







<p>The progression of AI and whether he thinks it’s moving faster than it ever has before also came up:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“In specific areas, yes, and in other areas when we have a whole field of areas we need technology for, and AI is great at some of the tasks and can’t do the other tasks yet. So people will claim that is [AI] can solve every problem, but it really can’t yet. As far as I understand it, it’s a hold all term for future computing, and it’s not really doing a lot of the stuff yet. But if we all give it all of our money, it might do it in the future.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What do you think about the use of AI in gaming? Is it going too far? Or is this merely the beginning of a gradual transition to an era fueled mostly by AI tools and development?

<p>The developers of Splitgate 2 have announced that the beta season will end on December 4, 2025, and the game will relaunch later that month. </p>



<p>For those unaware, the developers of Splitgate 2 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/splitgate-2-developers-say-its-going-back-to-beta/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed earlier this year</a> that they will be “going back to beta” to rebuild significant parts of the game. It seems the developers have now spent enough time retesting the title and are confident enough to bring it back to the market. </p>



<h2 id="h-splitgate-2-beta-ends-on-december-4">Splitgate 2 Beta Ends on December 4</h2>



<p>The beta end date for Splitgate 2 was revealed through a new update on their <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2918300/view/590662508143970096" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam page</a>. The announcement shows that the Beta Season &amp; active Battle Passes will be ending, alongside seasonal “rank” progress on December 4. Moreover, the beta servers will be taken down on the same day to prepare for the relaunch later that month. Details for Splitgate 2’s final beta playlist are live, and it kicked off on November 22. </p>



<p>The final Beta playtest for Splitgate 2 features Karman Station, a new power weapon, and some party modes. Karman Station was the first map ever made at 1047 games and features thoughtful adjustments to fit the modern sandbox. The final beta will also bring back the Rail Gun and will focus on a Party Mix playlist featuring updated versions of Team SWAT, Team Fiesta &amp; Shotty Snipers with more to come.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-has-going-back-to-beta-changed-splitgate-2">How Has Going Back to Beta Changed Splitgate 2?</h2>



<p>The developers also spoke about how the beta has helped the title, revealing that they have “rebuilt the entire foundation around what makes Splitgate special: portals, movement, and pure gunplay.” Factions have been removed entirely, and abilities have been reimagined as power-ups. Classic roundless modes like King of the Hill, Domination, and Team Deathmatch are back and added Classic Arena. </p>



<p>Moreover, the developers have introduced new maps, new weapons, reworked the menus, and refined systems based on Player feedback. They have also added portal overloading and EMPs, which change how map control works. Equipment has been streamlined for combat clarity, controller feel has been tuned, critical bugs have been fixed, and countless optimizations have been made. </p>



<p>In other news, the Splitgate 2 devs have <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/splitgate-2-devs-beg-fans-give-us-one-more-chance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">begged fans for one more chance</a> at their relaunch. Additionally, 1047 Games held <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/splitgate-2-developer-holds-another-round-of-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">another round of layoffs</a> to go back to beta.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">I ain't got time to bleed.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/helldivers-ii">Helldivers 2</a> is finally getting a minigun and other weapons fans have long-called for as part of the jungle-themed Python Commandos Warbond.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Due out December 2, the Python Commandos Premium Warbond adds new armor and weapons to Arrowhead’s explosive third-person action game. As well as the new minigun, which Helldivers 2 has been crying out for since launch, the warbond includes a chainsword and a flame dog.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But it’s the minigun that’s the star here, and this, coupled with the jungle theme rekindles memories of the original Predator movie, in which Jesse Ventura fired a minigun called ‘Old Painless’ at hapless enemy soldiers as well as a Yautja, while uttering the iconic line: “I ain't got time to bleed.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, if you’re fighting back against the Automatons, perhaps Helldivers 2’s new minigun will give off Terminator 2 vibes. After all, Arnold Schwarzenegger was partial to the occasional minigun, wasn’t he? At least he kept those cops alive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a post on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/25/helldivers-2-python-commandos-premium-warbond-airdrops-dec-2/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PlayStation Blog</a>, Katherine Baskin, Social Media and Community Manager at Arrowhead, leaned into the long overdue arrival of the minigun with a fun, in-universe message to players:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The Ministry of Defense received thousands of requests from squad commanders for a minigun and we’re excited to finally give our Helldivers access to the M-1000 Maxigun! Belt-fed with ultra-high ammo capacity, this one is sure to make those bugs bleed."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The AX/FLAM-75 “Guard Dog” Hot Dog, meanwhile, is a drone equipped with a flamethrower “to coat your foes in the fires of freedom before returning to your backpack to refuel.” And then there’s the CQC-9 Defoliation Tool, which very much looks like a chainsword that the Emperor of the grimdark 41st millennium would approve of.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The new primary weapon is a combination assault rifle and grenade launcher called the AR/GL-21 One-Two. “Heavy to wield, but the damage dealt is heavy too, making your primary slot more versatile than ever with two guns in one,” Arrowhead explained. check out images of all the new weapons in the slideshow of screenshots, below.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Helldivers 2: Python Commandos Premium Warbond Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The armor, too, leans into the Predator vibes. The RS-20 Constrictor light armor set is the official uniform for the League of Patriotic Arm Wrestlers, “so it’s guaranteed to give your squad bigger and more rippling biceps to intimidate the enemy.” Arrowhead! You son of a bitch!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And here’s a fun Rambo reference: “but if you’re carrying the team, maybe you need the RS-40 Best of Prey: a heavy armor set patterned after legendary Helldiver, Ronald Mambo and his famously powerful and burly physique.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Both of these armors are equipped with the Rock Solid passive, which makes your Helldiver more steadfast against staggering and ragdolling attacks.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/25/a690f335c0e8fdde0e351c3824da84fbcc85f82a-1764080654886.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">You’ll also have two capes and coordinating player cards available: Foe Rent Asunder, which is pre-tattered to give a battle-worn appearance, and Mark of the Constrictor, for Helldivers "who strangle out any anti-democratic behavior they encounter."

The p**s filter, if you will.</p><div><figure data-videoid="PA87rC9nG4k" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PA87rC9nG4k?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytPA87rC9nG4k" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/PA87rC9nG4k?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PA87rC9nG4k?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38f11flvrpqw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>Now, don't worry, there's a poll at the bottom where you can vote against me for <em>your</em> favourite from a selection of NFS titles <em>[You're 100% right, it's definitely got '<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/need_for_speed_most_wanted_u">Most Wanted</a>' in the title. - Ed.]</em>, and I'd love to hear all arguments for and against in the comments.</p>
<p>But, for now, I'd like to celebrate 20 years of Most Wanted — it launched in Europe on 25th November 2005, and 10 days earlier in North America — by talking about why it's so damn good, and that comes down to the simple fact that it focuses intensely on street racing and pursuit skills at a <em>driving level</em>, rather than utilising pursuit tech or special powers (à la Hot Pursuit) to bring cop chases and illegal racing activities to life in a thoroughly exciting and organic-feeling way.</p>

<p>Of course, Hot Pursuit came later, and in practice, its focus on gadgets worked really well, within the confines of what it was doing. However, in the street racing world of Most Wanted, on the streets of Rockport, and facing off against its 15 rival racers (all of whom you're charged with taking down, whilst also developing a troublesome relationship with the local fuzz), pure racing skills, timing, slick handbrakes, and last-minute misdirections are where it's at. And it's deliciously entertaining all the way for it.</p>
<p>In the races here, you get to indulge in street-set circuit and point-to-point efforts that like to hammer home that you aren't just racing, you're breaking the law. You cheeky sod. So you've got these awesome movie-like vibes straight out of the gate framing the action — something that racers don't often bring to the table outside this franchise — before the cops then show up like clockwork to make everything feel x100 cooler than it already did.</p>
<p>There's so much opportunity within this racing triangle of you versus your rivals versus the cops that no two races ever come off the same when the law gets involved. I mean, why win anything straight-up and boring style, when you can mess with some po-po at the same time?</p>
<p>Video games, and especially these days with battle passes and all that jazz, come with so much baggage, so many distractions. Most Wanted, though, has you locked and loaded, aware of your objective and on the streets racing without any of that nonsense in double quick time. This is a game where the thrill of a close thing, speed multiplied by danger, and driving super-boosted and turbo-charged with style is the order of the day, but it's also a game that gives you racing that works competitively when it has to. Indeed, the one fly in the ointment of the Gamecube version was that it had no online play, which was a shame given how well this one plays with other folk.</p>

<p>It's the sort of upper-echelons type of arcade racer that nails the <em>feel</em> of things deliciously. It strikes a sexy balance in the handling of its roster of 37 vehicles that sits exactly where it should do, in a magical spot between sim and all-out arcade silliness.</p>
<p>It's a feeling that Need for Speed games get right more than most. Hot Pursuit nailed it, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/need_for_speed_underground_2">Underground 2</a> nailed it, and Most Wanted gets it bang on, too, and it gives these games a timeless quality that's rare in the genre, meaning that even now, booting up your GameCube to have an anniversary race or two, it's not lost any of its ability to draw you in. <em>Just one more race, and then I'll write that goddamn anniversary post.</em> That sort of thing.</p>
<p>It helps, too, that the GameCube got such a good port, besides the omission of online. I was very impressed in 2005, and actually preferred the look of this one to my Xbox copy, as it didn't have that awful yellow filter that I mentioned. The less said about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/need_for_speed_most_wanted">the awful DS port</a> the better (I could have not said anything at all but where's the fun it that?), as some things are just a bridge too far, but the GameCube version got it spot on, and continues to do so, in its fluidity, wonderfully slick controls and in graphics that, while aged for sure, still bring it home and get the job done in 2025.</p>
<p>Now. With that being said, I would love to know, on this 20th anniversary of my favourite NFS, what your favourite NFS game is from the abridged selection below. So, make sure to give the poll a vote and sound off down below if you feel...well...if you feel the need. Innit.</p>

<hr>
<p><em>Got a favourite that's not in the list here, or just straight-up disagree with anything about Most Wanted, be sure to let us know in the comments!</em><em><br></em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Developer Straight4 Studios and publisher GIANTS Software have released Project Motor Racing today on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S. Players can jump in today and get a feel for the 70 cars across 13 classes and 28 tracks available at launch.</p>



<p>More tracks, cars, brands, and more will be added in post-launch updates, but right off the top, Project Motor Racing has a lot for players to dig their tires into, especially as it's <a href="https://wccftech.com/project-motor-racing-arrives-this-november-with-full-modding-support-on-day-one-new-trailer-showcases-career-mode/">arriving with full modding support,</a> which was announced this past June. And that's not just modding support for PC players, it's for console players too, thanks to the official GIANTS Editor and the UGC Portal allowing for mods to be easily integrated for all players.</p>



<p>Straight4 Studios and GIANTS Software also released a new launch trailer, which you can check out for yourself below.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Project Motor Racing | Release Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3bdKDsJcNUw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The single-player "<em>survival-style career</em>" mode lets players experience the intensity and the real-life consequences that come with professional racing, and how quickly a star-studded dream career can turn into a nightmare.</p>



<p>"<em>Project Motor Racing was created by people who love this sport and shaped by a community that cares just as much</em>," said Ian Bell, chief executive officer at Straight4 Studio, in a press release. "<em>We hope it gives racers the same sense of connection and excitement it gave us - something true to the sport we all love</em>."</p>



<p>On top of Project Motor Racing arriving with a bunch of cars and tracks to dig into, players will also be able to play it with <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-in-project-motor-racing-prologue-go-wayback/">full DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation support</a>, as it is one of this week's titles added to the list of games supporting NVIDIA's upscaling tech.</p>



<p>"<em>By combining Straight4’s racing expertise with our proven modding ecosystem, we’re creating a platform that can grow, evolve, and stay authentic through its community</em>," added head of publishing at GIANTS Software, Boris Stefan. "<em>This launch is just the starting grid for our ambitions</em>. <em>We’re committed to growing Project&nbsp; Motor Racing into a defining name in the genre</em>."</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/best-new-tabletop-games-at-pax-unplugged-2025</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-best-new-tabletop-games-at-pax-unplugged-2025.1364101/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Every year I make the short (relatively speaking) jaunt from Brooklyn down to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania for what I consider to be just about&nbsp;<em>the</em>&nbsp;best gaming convention of the year: PAX Unplugged. Last year, I put together a <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/best-new-games-at-pax-unplugged-2024" rel="nofollow">roundup of my fave games</a> I tried, and yes, you guessed it, I'm doing it again! From sneak peeks to new releases that shot right to the top of my "must-play" list, these were my favorite new Tabletop games (and one bit of accessory) I saw at PAX Unplugged 2025.</p>

<h2>Dice Words - Kosmos</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pax-unplugged-dice-words.jpg?itok=d7mrNiN5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pax-unplugged-dice-words.jpg?itok=0chqZXRi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>If there's one thing I love more than just about any other type of party game, it's word games! I'm a regular word puzzle freak (go ahead and quote me on that one), and so it shouldn't come as a surprise that I was seriously take in by&nbsp;<em>Dice Words</em>.</p>

<p>This mechanically-simple game puts your word-smithing to the test, and I think it's fair to elevator pitch it as: Yahtzee meets Scrabble. What?! That's right, in this game you're trying to make the best word you can out of seven dice you roll, and if you don't have the letters you need, you can re-roll them! Fun, visually appealing with its throwback ice machine lettering -&nbsp;<em>Dice Words</em>&nbsp;is the real deal.</p>

<h2>Frosted Blooms - Synapses Games</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pax-unplugged-frosted-blooms-board-game.jpg?itok=Ct4BtzLg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pax-unplugged-frosted-blooms-board-game.jpg?itok=7tUC7F_I 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Designed by absolute legends&nbsp;Bruno Cathala and Ludovic Maublanc,&nbsp;<em>Frosted Blooms&nbsp;</em>puts you in the shoes of a Dutch master gardener, trying to create the most beautiful field of tulips possible. Can I just say - as an aside - how nice it is to see such a strong, rich tradition of "very gentle themes" still going strong in the gaming industry? It's just so nice.</p>

<p>Anyway, I got the chance to try out a sneak peek of&nbsp;<em>Frosted Blooms</em>, and I have to say the gameplay loop is so rewarding. You draft tiles of different shapes, and play a card as you place your tile which immediately scores based on flowers you connect. It's clean, simple design that somehow skirts the line between think-y and vibe-y -- in other words: there's plenty of strategy here, but not enough to burn your brain. I loved it!</p>

<h2>Botany - Dux Somnium Games</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pax-unplugged-botany.jpg?itok=ASulAnOI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pax-unplugged-botany.jpg?itok=EAXn-40Z 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><em>Botany</em>&nbsp;is a game where you take on the role of an expert flower hunter out to find the rarest and most beautiful flora in the world. Set during Victorian times, this game immediately caught my eye with its gorgeous visual presentation and elegant, heightened theme.</p>

<p>In an expo hall full of neon colors (which, don't get me wrong, we love... and of which we'll see plenty in this list), this tonally beautiful game with its subdued presentation probably made me stop in my tracks harder than anything else on the floor.</p>

<h2>Gretchen's Garden - Lookout Games</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pax-unplugged-gretchens-garden.jpeg?itok=vmDbYITz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pax-unplugged-gretchens-garden.jpeg?itok=LCm4-gPd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Everyone's talking about succulents - those easy-to-grow, hard-to-kill plants that are super trendy right now. Well, now that I'm back from frantically over-watering my succulents that I've let wither on the windowsill, let's chat about&nbsp;<em>Gretchen's Garden</em>, a brand new tableau-building game coming out next year from Lookout Games!</p>

<p>In&nbsp;<em>Gretchen's Garden</em>, you're building up a tableau of pots and plants, watering them each round, and converting that water (in the form of water tokens) into leaf tokens to score points! You can even snip clippings from your opponents' plants, giving a bit of player interaction that we don't always see in this type of game! Keep an eye out for this one, I got to playtest a few rounds of it and I was left wanting more!</p>

<h2>The Massive-Verse Fighting Card Game - Solis Studios</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pax-unplugged-massive-verse.jpg?itok=s7ZOv2PA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pax-unplugged-massive-verse.jpg?itok=2pk7xEcK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Looking for a fun, quick, hard-hitting 1v1 card game where you throw everything you've got at your opponent? Of course you are! And that's why you should check out&nbsp;<em>The Massive-Verse Fighting Card Game</em>. Featuring eight characters from the&nbsp;<em>Massive-Verse</em>&nbsp;world, this game plays like an analog fighting game, where you'll try to outwit your opponent as you each lay down a card at the same time.</p>

<p>Some cards strike hard, others defend, and some help you power up to unleash special abilities! It's a think-y little fighting game, where you can really get in the weeds (in a good way) trying to figure out what your opponent will do next. I got a chance to playtest this one with Chris Solis of Solis Studios and, believe it or not, he whooped me! So fun, and the Starter Pack has everything two players need to jump into the action while fitting in your back pocket!</p>

<h2>Mountain Goats Legacy - Allplay</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pax-unplugged-mountain-goats-legacy.jpg?itok=_NxBILbT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pax-unplugged-mountain-goats-legacy.jpg?itok=ezHtpblF 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Now we're talking some&nbsp;<em>serious</em>&nbsp;sneak peeks, as I got the chance to playtest the absolutely incredible&nbsp;<em>Mountain Goats Legacy</em>. A new legacy version of the beginner-friendly classic&nbsp;<em>Mountain Goats</em>, this is a game about getting your cute little goats up a mountain by rolling dice and using said dice to advance your goat meeples (geeples?). Get to the top of the mountain and you score some points, but as soon as another goat makes it up there - they boot you back down to the bottom!</p>

<p>That was all present in the original game, but what makes&nbsp;<em>Mountain Goats Legacy&nbsp;</em>so special is the way each session slowly adds twists to the gameplay. In our first session (I got to try out four different scenarios), we had a simple rule that let us change how we use one of our dice. In the next scenario, a new "courage" mechanic gave us something to do with un-spent dice. And in the following scenario... an earthquake rumbled and completely switched up the numbers on the board, totally transforming how you play the game!</p>

<p>This one's not launching for a bit, but I'll be keeping an extremely close eye on it - as it was hands down one of the most fun gaming experiences I had in all of PAX Unplugged 2025!</p>

<h2>Re;MATCH - Brother Ming Games</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pax-unplugged-re-match.jpg?itok=ZE2gAKnF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pax-unplugged-re-match.jpg?itok=HGtALXYA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Wow... just... wow! This is one of those games you play that, even when playtesting in the middle of a crowded convention floor, makes time kind of stand still for a moment.&nbsp;<em>Re;MATCH</em>&nbsp;by Brother Ming games is a fast-paced fighting game using a truly unique mechanic I've never seen in this kind of fighting game: marbles!</p>

<p>Combining marble puzzle mechanics like you'd find in&nbsp;<em>Potion Explosion</em>&nbsp;with card-based fighting, you play as one of six vibrant characters out to claim victory over your opponent. In the game, you'll pull clusters of marbles on your side of the drop tower to activate special abilities, gain the support of cheering fans, and pull off powerful attacks.</p>

<p>I played against Ming himself, and aside from being one of the most genuine, cool dudes at PAX, you can tell he's also got a ton of pride of this expertly crafted, ingenious game. <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/brotherminggames/rematch" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">It launches soon on Kickstarter</a>, and I can't wait to get back to the marble tower.</p>

<h2>Song of the Wildkin -&nbsp;Bōken Games</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pax-unplugged-song-of-the-wildkin.jpg?itok=_JFoZjpp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pax-unplugged-song-of-the-wildkin.jpg?itok=B0yXF5no 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>It's hard for any game to make a big impression while still in early prototype form -- the medium is truly a tactile one, where you want to be able to see, touch, and experience the game in its most final state. So you can understand my surprise when I was truly blown away by&nbsp;<em>Song of the Wildkin</em>, which as you can see from the images above is still very much in its early stages of production! But blown away I was, as I dove into this fantasy world full of anthropomorphic animals battling strange creatures on map tiles.</p>

<p>With an absolute powerhouse of designers and artists behind it (Andrew Bosley, the illustrator of<em> Everdell </em>and Paul DeStefano,&nbsp;<em>Oathsworn</em>'s writer, to name a few), this game sparkles with energy and evocative illustrations (even in these early days stages). Coming in 2026, and boasting over 30 hours of cooperative campaign gameplay,&nbsp;<em>Song of the Wildkin</em>&nbsp;is one to watch.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Tabletop Things RPG Tiles</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pax-unplugged-tabletop-things.jpg?itok=Lm_rxE6d 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pax-unplugged-tabletop-things.jpg?itok=JOFMgjyO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Breaking the tide of board games in this list for a second, I had to drop a shout out to Tabletop Things. These locally produced (in their own small shop in New Jersey) RPG tiles set the standard for affordable, 3D RPG terrain. I was immediately taken by the sculpts on these, and love the bright, evocative colors used.</p>

<p>As you can see from the images above, Tabletop Things really leans into the modularity of dungeon tiles while still ensuring that all the pieces they produce have a lot of character to them. These aren't bland, gray corridors -- each piece pops in one way or another. In my opinion, they add a sort of dream-like quality to the table, with a bit of whimsy in their design and color choices.</p>

<h2>Wispwood - CGE</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pax-unplugged-wispwood.jpg?itok=PH0rxxYE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pax-unplugged-wispwood.jpg?itok=UIdSUU47 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Finally, let's dive into an upcoming game from&nbsp;CGE,&nbsp;<em>Wispwood</em>! This tile-laying game gives the genre a unique spin with a sort of tile rondel that forces you to place a wisp tile in a specific shape/formation. If you can't, you have to fill it a space with a tree card. But at the end of each round, your trees go away, and your wisps remain.</p>

<p>This creates a fun interplay and balance of getting the right wisps on your board when you can, while setting yourself up for success next round, too! I only tried a bit of a walk-through of this game, but I knew it was one my gaming group would love - so this is shooting right to the top of my list to try out as soon as it comes out.</p>

<h2>PAX Unplugged 2025 Wrap Up</h2>

<p>That wraps things up for this year's PAX Unplugged 2025 -- thanks so much to PAX Unplugged for having me, and thanks to all the incredible game creators, publishers, developers, artists, and more who showed off their new games with so much passion and excitement. If PAX Unplugged 2025 is any indication, next year's going to be a BIG one for tabletop gaming!</p>

              <p>This Anker charging bundle has become the <strong>#1 bestselling charger on Amazon over Black Friday</strong> and the pricing explains the overwhelming popularity immediately. Apple asks for $20 for a single 20W charger that doesn’t even include a cable and forces separate purchases that drive total costs upward quickly.</p>
<p>At <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3718/">$11, down from $18, you’re getting here two complete 20W Anker chargers + two USB-C to USB-C cables</a> in a single package that costs less than one official Apple charger alone. Anker’s good reputation as an <strong>Apple-approved accessory manufacturer</strong> sold in the Apple Stores instills confidence that these chargers meet quality and safety standards without paying Apple Tax premiums.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3718/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>20W Fast Charging That Meets Apple’s Official Specs</h2>
<p>This 20W power output provides the <strong>fastest charging speed supported by the USB-C ports</strong> of the iPhone 15, 16, and 17 models-just like Apple’s own charger specifications. Compared to the old 5W adapters that came packaged with earlier iPhones, this wattage offers noticeably quicker charging: by up to 50% for most devices.</p>
<p>You will be able to charge your iPhone 17 to about 50% in roughly 30 minutes when paired with a 20W charging system. For phones supporting fast, seamless top-ups during daily routines or during stopovers at home between activities, the charging speed works just as well with iPads, Samsung phones, and other USB-C devices equipped with Power Delivery fast-charging protocols.</p>



<p>The compact<strong> dual-port design includes both USB-C and USB-A outputs</strong> to charge two devices at once with no compromise in speed and without occupying multiple wall outlets. A configuration like this proves to be a real asset in homes where wall outlets remain scarce and several family members fight for a chance to charge their devices.</p>
<p>Charge your iPhone through USB-C while powering AirPods, Apple Watch, or older Lightning devices via the USB-A port with the appropriate cables. The intelligent power distribution ensures that both ports deliver optimal charging speeds rather than splitting power inefficiently, which would slow both devices down.</p>



<p>Anker has several safety features including <strong>overvoltage protection</strong> to prevent excessive voltage from damaging connected devices, temperature control that reduces power output if overheating occurs, and short circuit protection to shut off power during fault conditions. Such protections count because many no-name low-cost chargers have inadequate safety implementations and poses the risk of fire or even device damage through poorly regulated power delivery.</p>
<p>The <strong>included 5-foot USB-C-to-USB-C cables</strong> are long enough to support comfortable device use while charging, from floor outlets to desks or bedside tables, without tight stretching. The length of the cable balances portability for travel and practicality for daily use at home, where often 3-foot cables can be frustratingly short.</p>
<p>At $11, the Anker 2-pack includes four pieces in total: two 20W dual-port chargers and two 5-foot USB-C cables, all at 41% below retail this Black Friday. Apple sells its single 20W charger sans cables for nearly double which makes Anker’s value proposition for buyers needing more than one charging point absurdly favorable.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsung-tab-s10-fe-drops-to-record-low-for-pennies-might-be-time-to-offload-that-ipad-now-2000647199</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/samsung-tab-s10-fe-drops-to-record-low-for-pennies-might-be-time-to-offload-that-ipad-now.1364089/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Samsung and Apple battle relentlessly across every product category from smartphones to laptops to tablets, with each company trying to outdo the other on features, performance, and ecosystem integration. The <strong>Galaxy Tab S10 FE launched just months ago</strong> as Samsung’s direct challenge to standard iPads and offers comparable performance and features at more aggressive pricing.</p>
<p>The <em>Fan Edition</em> designation indicates this model <strong>prioritizes value over bleeding-edge specs</strong>, and positions it as the sweet spot in Samsung’s tablet lineup where you get flagship features without paying flagship premiums. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5676/">At $359, down from $499, this 128GB/WiFi model has hit a record-low price</a> on Amazon for Black Friday that undercuts not just the standard iPad but also Samsung’s own higher-tier Tab S10 models.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5676/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Display Quality That Rivals iPads</h2>
<p>The <strong>10.9-inch LCD display at 2304 x 1440 resolution</strong> contributes to sharp visuals above the standard iPad resolution while matching the pixel density of more expensive tablets. You get an <strong>on-screen refresh rate of 90Hz</strong> that results in notably smoother scrolling, animations, and gaming compared to the 60Hz screens still common on tablets from rivals in this price range. This higher refresh rate makes daily interactions feel more responsive and fluid and reduces the subtle lag that plagues lower-refresh screens when you scroll rapidly through long documents or social media feeds.</p>



<p>The<strong> included S Pen stylus is a significant added value</strong> and allows handwriting, drawing, and precise input sans separate purchases like the Apple Pencil, which adds $129 to iPad prices. The pressure-sensitive tip and low latency make writing experiences that truly feel like pen on paper, rather than plastic on glass and encourages actual note-taking and sketching rather than awkward finger drawing</p>
<p><strong>Powered by the Exynos 1580 processor</strong>, it delivers ample performance for all multitasking, gaming and media consumption needs without thermal throttling and battery draining, issues that plagued mid-range tablet chips from yesteryear. It’s <strong>optimized by Samsung for smooth performance</strong> across productivity apps such as Microsoft Office, creative tools such as Adobe apps, and entertainment platforms such as Netflix, YouTube, and mobile games.</p>



<p>The<strong> IP68 rating for water resistance speaks to the exceptional durability</strong> for tablets that are normally kept away from water exposure. It certifies submersion up to 1.5 meters in water for up to 30 minutes, covers everything from kitchen spills to poolside use to bathroom entertainment without anxiety. Protection extends the tablet’s life by surviving accidents that would destroy unprotected devices.</p>
<p>It features a large-capacity cell and efficient power management<strong> for a battery life of up to 20 hours of mixed-use</strong>&nbsp;and covers several days of normal use between charges. Super Fast Charging reduces downtime when recharging becomes necessary, providing hours of use from brief charging sessions. The starting storage configuration is 128GB, <strong>with microSD expansion supporting up to 1TB additional capacity</strong> to ensure ample room for apps and documents.</p>
<p>At $359, the Galaxy Tab S10 FE gives you a 10.9-inch 90Hz display, Exynos 1580 processor, included S Pen with AI features, IP68 water resistance, a 20-hour battery, and expandable storage at 28% below retail this Black Friday. Fan Edition positioning delivers the optimal balance of features and pricing that makes premium tablet capabilities accessible without iPad premiums or flagship Galaxy pricing.</p>

        <p>Long ago, in the golden era of Talea, the Emperor kept the lands peaceful, and the people prospered. After passing away without naming a successor between his twin sons, a civil war raged between the North, Logos and the South, Mythos – fighting for who would take control of the throne. The townsfolk lived in fear from the atrocities being carried out in the conflict. In a bid to stop the destruction, a part of the empire’s military became Talea’s dedicated protectors.</p><p>From the everlasting darkness of war, these people were the beacon of light that brought people hope. The Lumen were born, and as guardians in their provinces, they ensure the safety of the residents of Talea, both the people and the Animon.</p><p>Since ancient times, people have long studied the Animon. Not much is known of their nature to this day. They’re made of Anivis, an energy that flows through the whole world, and they possess the ability to affect emotions and interact with the very soul of every living being. Catch the Animon and become inseparable partners as you harness their elemental powers and battle alongside each other with your Holoken.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Catching Animon</strong> – Test your skills with the Holoken and catch Animon in the field to recruit them to your party or initiate an incredible and exciting battle against them to prove your mettle! Every Animon can perform their own abilities and skills, and victory is achieved through using the best strategy with your team.

Connect to the Animon Trade Station to seek the Animon you need, trade directly with friends, or the community.</li><li><strong>Cook and Craft</strong> – While on your adventure, be sure to take a rest at the Fountain, where you’ll be able to craft useful items and cook delicious food! If you’re feeling adventurous, you’ll be able to experiment with ingredients to help nurture your Animon.</li><li><strong>The Anispace</strong> – The Anispace is a place that exists and doesn’t exist at the same time. A space detached from the world as we know it. Here is where you’ll find your Animon after you capture them and where you’ll be able to train your Animon for battle.

            <p>Microsoft has teamed up with rubber footwear brand Crocs to give us some of the most, errm, eyecatching shoes on the market.</p>
<p>You see, these officially licensed Crocs have been designed to look like an Xbox controller, meaning they have been adorned with the controller's X, Y, B, A buttons and D-pad, as well as left and right analog sticks, and a white Xbox button. On the strap, meanwhile, is a green Xbox logo (which has replaced Crocs' own crocodile emblem).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The latest PC games to support NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation are Prologue: Go Wayback!, which launched last Thursday <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2943740/Prologue_Go_Wayback/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Steam Early Access</a>, and Project Motor Racing, due to launch <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/299970/Project_Motor_Racing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Steam</a> today.</p>



<p>The former is a single-player, open world, emergent, survival roguelike game created by PUBG creator Brendan Greene and his team at PLAYERUNKNOWN Productions. In Prologue: Go Wayback!, players can traverse a new wilderness space of around 64 square kilometers that is generated every time they play. They can chart a path across rugged terrain, overcome the elements and write their own exploration story as they attempt to reach the distant Weather Tower. The game has a year of content updates already planned, after which it will launch its 1.0 version. Players with a GeForce RTX 50 Series GPU can activate DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation to get the highest possible frame rates. GeForce RTX 40 Series users can boost their FPS with DLSS Frame Generation, and all other users can enhance performance with DLSS Super Resolution, which leverages NVIDIA's latest transformer AI model. </p>



<p>Prologue: Go Wayback! is the second of a series of game projects planned by PLAYERUNKNOWN Productions, the ultimate goal being Artemis, a massive multiplayer sandbox game that is still many years out. You can read our exclusive interview with Brendan Greene <a href="https://wccftech.com/playerunknown-qa-fortnite-and-others-just-look-like-ip-bubbles-to-me-the-metaverse-has-to-be-different/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>



<p>As for <a href="https://wccftech.com/project-motor-racing-arrives-this-november-with-full-modding-support-on-day-one-new-trailer-showcases-career-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Project Motor Racing</a>, it's the new racing simulation game developed by Straight4 Studios and published by GIANTS Software. The game offers racing fans 28 tracks spanning multiple eras and over 70 faithfully replicated cars across 13 racing classes. Project Motor Racing includes a single-player career mode, a multiplayer mode where you can compete against others and navigate races packed with four classes, all of which are attempting to win their respective categories simultaneously. GeForce RTX 50 Series players can use DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation to get maximum performance. GeForce RTX 40 Series players can increase their frame rates with DLSS Frame Generation, while all other users can activate DLSS Super Resolution to enhance image quality using NVIDIA's most recent transformer AI model.</p>



<p>Earlier this month, the city builder game Whiskerwood <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2489330/Whiskerwood/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was launched on Steam Early Access</a> by Minakata Dynamics and Hooded Horse. Its twist is that you do not manage humans, but mice who toil under cat overlords. A free demo is available, and both the demo and the full game support NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution and DLAA.</p>



<p>Lastly, NVIDIA reminded its users that the highly anticipated action/adventure game Tides of Annihilation, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/tides-of-annihilation-stunning-boss-fight-gameplay-showing-off-mirror-realm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was showcased once again last week</a> during the Xbox Partner Preview event, will support NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation on day one.</p>



<p>As a side note, NVIDIA users can claim a free Battlefield 6 Marksman SVK-8.6 DMR weapon skin from the NVIDIA app with GeForce Rewards by following these simple instructions: load the NVIDIA app, click “Redeem” on the left nav, and follow the steps to get the skin while supplies last.</p>

              <p>The 57-inch Odyssey G9 ultrawide monitor commands attention and premium pricing,<a href="https://kotaku.com/samsung-57-odyssey-curved-gaming-monitor-240hz-1ms-is-800-off-hardcore-gamings-holy-grail-at-a-record-low-2000646508"> even when sales roll around</a>, but not everyone wants or can accommodate a display that dominates entire desks and requires dedicated space planning.</p>
<p>Standard-sized desks deserve premium gaming monitors too, and the <strong>32-inch Odyssey G55C delivers flagship features</strong> in dimensions that fit normal workspaces without sacrificing immersion or performance. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5925/">At $199, down from $329, this QHD curved gaming monitor has hit a record-low price</a> on Amazon for Black Friday and became the <strong>best-selling model across Samsung’s entire Odyssey lineup</strong>. That combination of 1000R curvature, 165Hz refresh rate, and genuine HDR10 support at this aggressive discount explains why it’s so popular.</p>

<h2>1000R Curvature That Matches Human Vision</h2>
<p>This <strong>2560 x 1440 QHD resolution packs 1.7 times more pixel density than standard 1080p displays</strong>&nbsp;and makes for noticeably sharper visuals where text stays crisp and game details remain clear during fast motion. As it is a sweet spot in resolution, it offers meaningful visual improvement over Full HD without the extreme GPU horsepower that 4K displays require to maintain high frame rates in demanding games.</p>
<p>Modern mid-range graphics cards handle QHD gaming comfortably at high settings, something that often forces compromise between visual quality and smooth performance if using 4K. Its wider aspect provides more horizontal screen real estate, which benefits both gaming and productivity by allowing the display of more content simultaneously, whether tracking enemies in competitive shooters or managing multiple windows during work sessions.</p>



<p>The <strong>aggressive 1000R curve radius comes closer to the natural curvature of human peripheral vision</strong> than, say, gentler curves at 1800R or even flat panels, making for immersive viewing that wraps content around your field of view. That tight curvature puts every part of the screen an equal distance from your eyes when properly positioned, minimising eye movement required to scan across the display while maintaining consistency in focus between centre and edges.</p>
<p>Racing games are dramatically better-the curved display creates peripheral awareness of oncoming corners and competitors. First-person shooters pick up situational awareness with better peripheral enemy detection. The effect of immersion proves most pronounced during longer gaming sessions, where the curved display pulls you into game worlds more effectively than flat monitors do, which maintain psychological distance between viewer and content.</p>



<p>The <strong>165Hz refresh rate ensures smooth motion rendering</strong> that eliminates the choppiness plaguing 60Hz displays when the game’s camera pans fast or the character is moving at incredible speeds. In competitive games, high refresh enables reduced motion blur and better target tracking to give you clear views of enemies in movement and quicker reaction capability when events catch you by surprise.</p>
<p>The <strong>response time of 1ms MPRT complements</strong> the high refresh by making sure pixel transitions are done fast enough to prevent ghost trails behind moving objects. FreeSync from AMD Radeon synchronizes display refresh with your GPU’s frame output and removes screen tearing for fluid visuals without the stutter that occurs when refresh and frame rates desync.</p>
<p><strong>HDR10 support extends the color range</strong> and contrast ratio beyond what standard dynamic range displays are capable of showing, revealing details in both shadows and highlights that SDR crushes into solid blacks or blown-out whites. Game scenes gain dramatic impact through deeper blacks, brighter highlights, and more saturated colors, making virtual worlds feel more alive and realistic.</p>
<p>At $199, the Samsung Odyssey hits that perfect sweet spot between immersion and practicality for standard desks, while the feature set compares well to premium monitors available for as much as twice the price.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-m4-macbook-air-hits-a-margin-free-black-friday-price-but-apple-only-offers-a-small-batch-for-black-friday.1364047/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Well, here’s one we were not expecting on the Monday of Black Friday Week — a massive unannounced deal from Apple, of all companies. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5916/">The 2025 M4 MacBook Air is the shocking subject of a huge 25% off deal at Amazon, bringing it to an all-time low price of just $749</a>. With Apple’s laptop fleet of brand-new M5 models soaking up most of the attention, they’ve decided to sneak in a killer deal on a killer laptop.</p>
<p>Make no mistake, the M4 chip makes this MacBook Air a beast for productivity, streaming, multitasking, or pretty much anything else you ask of it. The M4 was built specifically to run Apple Intelligence, and the MacBook Air has all of Apple’s industry-best features like the brilliant 13.6-inch Liquid Retina display and 18 hours of battery life. It’s a perfect match for an iPhone, with the real-time mirroring feature that lets you answer calls and texts without having to break stride to reach for your phone, and it’s a seamless pairing with any of the AirPods models.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5916/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Not New, But Definitely Not Old</h2>
<p>The M4 chip that drives the impeccable performance of the MacBook Air was Apple’s state-of-the-art processor and possibly the best anywhere in the tech world until the M5 dropped just this past October. So you don’t exactly need a time machine to hearken back to the days when the M4 ruled the roost, and the debut of the M5 does not detract one bit from its performance.</p>
<p>The M4 chip is twice as fast as the M1, and a mind-blowing 23 times faster than the last of Apple’s Intel processors. The Neural Engine that’s built into the M4 not only makes Apple Intelligence possible, it makes it run with blazing speed. There’s sufficient processing power for the Air to power up to two external displays with the same fast, fluid performance even for demanding tasks like video editing.</p>



<h2>Multimedia Superstar</h2>
<p>The MacBooks have long been among the very best laptops for connecting remotely for work or pleasure, and the M4 MacBook Air is a great example. The 12MP Center Stage camera ensures you’ll show up on the other end of a video call looking your best, and the MacBook Air’s three built-in mics and four speakers with Spatial Audio bolster a pro-level connection. Having Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3 connections eliminates any online glitch-outs to keep the conversation rolling without interruption.</p>
<p>The MacBook Air isn’t one of those laptops with a million ports and jacks for external devices, but what it has — two Thunderbolt 4 ports in addition to its MagSafe charging port and a headphone jack — are top-notch for connecting external monitors or external storage or charging devices.</p>
<p>For a Monday deal during Black Friday Week, this one’s a shocker. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5916/">Apple’s 13-inch M4 MacBook Air shedding $250 from its price at Amazon and landing at a record-low $749 was most definitely not on our Bingo card</a>, but it’s real, and it’s potentially one that could cause a supply-draining stampede. We would not recommend sleeping on this one too long.</p>

<p>A new leak for Sonic Racing CrossWorlds reveals that the Pac-Man DLC is expected to arrive in January 2026. </p>



<p>Sonic Racing CrossWorlds has been out for some time now, bringing good competition to the kart racing space. Recently, we also learned that the game will be facing Mario Kart World next month, with the title receiving a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sonic-racing-crossworlds-releases-for-switch-2-next-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2 release date</a>. Now, the next DLC’s release window for the title has been leaked. </p>

<p>The release window for Sonic Racing CrossWorlds’ Pac-Man DLC was revealed by a user on <a href="https://x.com/8T8999/status/1992775917945700779" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter). Their recent post includes an in-game screenshot with “Crossover Course, Release expected in January” written on it.

<p>Sonic Racing CrossWorlds is really living up to its name, crossing over with as many franchises as possible. The game has already collaborated with the likes of Persona, Like a Dragon, Minecraft, and more. The latest collaboration is with SpongeBob SquarePants, which, along with new racers, machines, courses, and more, also brought the SpongeBob SquarePants festival, which introduced additional rewards players can acquire.  </p>

                <p>One of the biggest year-end questions people have about the gaming industry this year is whether or not Battlefield 6 will outsell Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, a feat that would end a 20-year run of Call of Duty's dominance. It remains to be seen if that will happen, and while we wait for the data to come in, Circana's Mat Piscatella has <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m65enfy2fk2f" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">shared some data points</a> about the shooter category in the US.</p><p>To begin with, Piscatella pointed out that the last shooter game to outsell a Call of Duty title in the US over a full year was Gears of War in 2006. The last FPS to beat Call of Duty was Star Wars: Battlefront II in 2005.</p><p>Call of Duty has reigned supreme in the US not just in the shooter and FPS categories, but generally as well. A Call of Duty game has finished the year as the best-selling title for 13 of the past 16 years, the exceptions being 2013 (GTA 5), 2018 (Red Dead Redemption II), and 2023 (Hogwarts Legacy).</p><p>"Still have some big weeks of potential sales to come, but this part of the market hasn't been this competitive in 20 years," Piscatella said of the shooter and FPS categories of the gaming market.</p><p>He added that comparing titles over such a long time horizon is imperfect because the gaming market today is much more "dynamic," especially with things like subscription services and free games like Fortnite. This means "sales alone don't tell the whole story."</p><p>Battlefield 6 is already performing better than Call of Duty's latest releases in the US. First-month sales of Battlefield 6 were <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6s-first-month-sales-were-higher-than-any-game-since-2022-in-the-us/1100-6536380/" data-ref-id="1100-6536380">higher than any other game's first-month sales going back to 2022</a>, meaning Battlefield 6 sold better out of the gate than 2024's Black Ops 6 and 2023's Modern Warfare 3. Battlefield 6 needed<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6s-first-month-sales-were-higher-than-any-game-since-2022-in-the-us/1100-6536380/" data-ref-id="1100-6536380"> just 22 days</a> to eclipse the entire lifetime sales of Battlefield 1 in the US.</p><p>It was reported earlier this year that Microsoft <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-lost-300-million-in-sales-due-to-game-pass-report/1100-6535256/" data-ref-id="1100-6535256">missed out on $300 million+ in revenue for Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> because it was on Xbox Game Pass. That doesn't tell the whole story, though, as the Black Ops 6 release no doubt incentivized people to sign up for Game Pass.</p><p>People will want to compare Battlefield 6 and Black Ops 7, but no comparison between the two would be complete or necessarily fair for a variety of reasons. One is that Black Ops 7 is available on Xbox Game Pass and PC Game Pass. Another is that Black Ops 7 is releasing on more platforms than Battlefield 6, as Activision's game is supporting last-gen platforms and EA's is not. Yet another element to consider is that <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/battlefield-6-sells-over-7m-units-in-three-days-ea-confirms" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Battlefield 6 sales are reportedly skewed toward PC.</a></p><p>Black Ops 7 launched on November 14, and in a break from tradition, Activision's celebratory first-weekend post <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/activision-isnt-sharing-any-black-ops-7-launch-weekend-game-stats/1100-6536299/" data-ref-id="1100-6536299">did not include any data about how the game is performing</a> compared to past games. Before this, Activision <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-dev-does-worry-about-fatigue-as-black-ops-7-arrives-right-after-black-ops-6/1100-6535019/" data-ref-id="1100-6535019">acknowledged "fatigue" around the Black Ops brand given the back-to-back releases of Black Ops 7 in 2024 and Black Ops 7 in 2025.</a></p><p>Prior to Black Ops 7's release, industry experts said Battlefield 6 didn't have a real chance at beating Black Ops 7, in part because of the size, scale, and momentum of the Call of Duty series. One analyst said people buy Call of Duty every year with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-looks-great-but-it-wont-beat-call-of-duty-this-year/1100-6534282/" data-ref-id="1100-6534282">"autopilot purchasing," even if they complain about a lack of new features or innovation.</a></p><p>Circana's report for US sales in November will be released on December 17, so keep checking back with GameSpot to see how Battlefield 6 and Black Ops 7 sales compare.</p>

            <p>When Konrad Tomaszkiewicz, the game director of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</a> and secondary director on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, left CD Projekt Red in 2021, he did so under a dark cloud, accused of workplace bullying. A four month-long external investigation cleared him of any charges but the taint of the accusations linger still.</p>
<p>"It's always difficult," Tomaszkiewicz told me when we met in London last week. "It's always difficult because when stuff like this happens, it's really difficult to show people that it wasn't like this, because people like to assume some things."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/witcher-3-director-leaves-cd-projekt-following-investigation-into-workplace-bullying">When Tomaszkiewicz left CD Projekt Red, he acknowledged in an email</a> that "a lot of people are feeling fear, stress or discomfort when working with me", and he apologised "for all the bad blood I have caused". He promised to work on himself and set about changing his behaviour.</p>

<figcaption>Konrad Tomaszkiewicz's new game is The Blood of Dawnwalker, which bears more than a passing resemblance to The Witcher series of games, though there are significant differences.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arbNkIdeAVs" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>


<p>Reflecting on the issue last week, Tomaszkiewicz told me problems seemed to arise when CD Projekt Red grew rapidly in size following the release of The Witcher 3, in 2015. That game was made on average by 160 people, he said - a figure that jumped to 205 closer to release, when the then-small Cyberpunk 2077 team was pulled in to help. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saving-cyberpunk-2077-how-cd-projekt-red-recovered-from-one-of-video-games-most-disastrous-launches">By the time Tomaszkiewicz left CD Projekt Red in 2021</a>, however, there were more than 1000 people working there.</p><p>During Cyberpunk 2077's unwieldy development, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekts-new-witcher-game-director-speaks-out-on-crunch">CD Projekt Red became linked with a culture of crunch</a>, but the studio's intense way of working does stretch back to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/seeing-red-the-story-of-cd-projekt">the beginning of The Witcher series of games</a>, which of course Tomaszkiewicz was a part of. "For half-a-year we were working 12-hour days every day, all weekends, all the time," lead character artist Paweł Mielniczuk once told me while recalling The Witcher 1's development.</p>
<p>In 2017, not long after The Witcher 3 as a project was put to bed, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekt-red-this-approach-to-making-games-is-not-for-everyone">CD Projekt Red responded to apparent low studio morale by saying, "This approach to making games is not for everyone</a>," so this was clearly an issue before Cyberpunk 2077 development got properly underway. Perhaps it was just a more visible issue when lots of new people joined the company.</p>
<p>Working in teams of that size made it hard to know the people you were working with, Tomaszkiewicz said to me, which made it especially hard for people to pull together during the more strenuous development periods. "The problem was - I was analysing it - that people feel differently when you are anonymous for them because the company is huge and [they don't necessarily know you]. The stress is not comparable to the situation when you work with them arm in arm every day," he said.</p>
<p>"I decided that I want to open my own company and do things differently," he added. "I want to have the maximum amount of people [similar to] how we had it in The Witcher 3, because at that time, I knew everyone, full name and surname, and in our company it's totally the same."</p><p>The company he's referring to is Rebel Wolves, which he co-founded in 2022 alongside a handful of other former CD Projekt Red staff, including writer Jakub Szamalek, artist Bartłomiej Gaweł, animator Tamara Zawada, and a few others from the Polish game development scene.</p>

<p>Rebel Wolves currently has 155 people working on The Blood of Dawnwalker, its debut half-human, half-vampire role-playing game - almost exactly the same number of people that worked on The Witcher 3 for the bulk of its development. Given the studio's heritage, it's no surprise The Blood of Dawnwalker passes more than a passing resemblance to The Witcher games, in tone as well as appearance, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-3-directors-new-rpg-the-blood-of-dawnwalker-is-different-to-that-classic-cd-projekt-red-game-in-one-big-way-it-doesnt-have-a-main-quest">but there are notable and significant differences.</a></p>
<p>"I know everyone," Tomaszkiewicz continued. "I work with them every day, not only to feedback and review their stuff, but doing the stuff with them. I implement the quests, also. I'm scripting the combat and the opponents.</p>
<p>"I want to be the leader not the boss," he said. "I want to work with them and show direction and help them to go in this particular direction, not be somewhere there in Olympus and not have the camaraderie with the people. I want to feel this crazy fire as I felt it in The Witcher 3, The Witcher 2, in The Witcher 1. And later, when the team was too big, I lost it somewhere. And right now I have it back."</p>
<p>The Blood of Dawnwalker will be released on PC, PS5 and Xbox Series S/X sometime in 2026.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The market for home speakers is full of great options from Sonos, Bose and Samsung – all of them offering solid audio quality and smart features to merit their pricing. However, if you need a high-end speaker that doubles as a conversation piece through distinctive retro aesthetics inspired by classic guitar amplifiers, nobody pulls this vision off better than Marshall.</p>
<p>The iconic brand has successfully translated their <strong>legendary amplifier design language into Bluetooth speakers</strong> that look like miniature versions of the amps that powered rock history.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4526/"> At $179, down from $299, the Acton III has reached an all-time low price</a> on Amazon for Black Friday and delivers on that signature Marshall sound that made them legends in professional audio.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4526/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Re-Engineered Soundstage</h2>
<p>The third-generation design expands the <strong>stereo soundstage beyond earlier Acton models</strong> through revised driver placement and acoustic tuning that creates wider sound dispersion throughout your listening space. This engineering delivers immersive audio where instruments and vocals occupy distinct positions across the sound field rather than collapsing into a narrow center channel.</p>
<p>The Marshall signature sound <strong>emphasizes clarity across all frequencies while maintaining the punchy, dynamic character</strong> that made their amplifiers famous among musicians who demanded both power and precision. Rock, jazz, classical, and electronic music all benefit from the balanced frequency response that doesn’t sacrifice detail for overwhelming bass or harsh treble.</p>



<p>Futureproofing is in-built into the speaker <strong>with the next-generation Bluetooth 5.2 implementation</strong>&nbsp;which supports emerging features and codecs the moment they become widely available instead of requiring hardware replacement to access new standards. This forward compatibility matters because Bluetooth audio technology continues evolving with improved codecs, lower latency protocols, and enhanced multi-device handling that will roll out over the useful life of this speaker.</p>
<p>Compared to older versions of Bluetooth, the improved connection stability reduces dropouts and interference from competing wireless signals in crowded home environments full of Wi-Fi routers, smart home devices, and neighboring networks. Traditional <strong>wired connection fallback via 3.5mm auxiliary input is available</strong> for devices without Bluetooth and for situations where you prefer avoiding wireless compression altogether.</p>



<p>It’s a pretty straightforward pairing process that eliminates complicated app requirements or multi-step configuration sequences which frustrate users who want to play music quickly: Press the Bluetooth button, select it from your phone’s Bluetooth menu, and y<strong>ou’re playing audio within seconds of taking it out of the box</strong>. This extends into daily use, where the speaker remembers previously paired devices and automatically reconnects when they come in range, rather than having to repeat the pairing every time you want to listen to something. <strong>The speaker has tactile, analog controls</strong> at the top that allow very satisfying physical interaction when adjusting the volume, bass, and treble-a feeling more engaging than simply tapping on glass touchscreens or issuing voice commands.</p>
<p>The Marshall Acton III brings re-engineered stereo soundstage at $179, a discount of 40% off retail this Black Friday. The competitive home speaker market offers many excellent audio options, but Marshall’s distinctive design and rock heritage create an emotional appeal that technical specifications just can’t provide.</p>

              <p data-start="0" data-end="519">LEGO is a timeless toy that continues to capture the hearts of people of all ages. It’s not just for kids. Anyone with a sense of nostalgia or creativity can dive into the fun. LEGO has a vast array of collaborations with different fandoms, and perhaps one of its most popular partnerships is with Marvel. Among the many sets inspired by the Marvel universe is one based on the most iconic scene from the second film in Sam Raimi’s Spider-Man trilogy, and its now available at a discounted price. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5197/">This particular LEGO set of the Spider-Man vs. Doc Ock subway train showdown typically sells for $55, but it’s currently on sale for 20% off, bringing the price down to $44</a>. This price drop makes it a great deal for any LEGO fan or Spider-Man enthusiast looking to recreate one of the most memorable moments from the early 2000s Spider-Man films.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5197/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="0" data-end="519">Most Iconic&nbsp;Spider-Man Moment</h2>
<p data-start="867" data-end="1630">If you were a teenager during the mid-2000s, you probably fondly remember <em data-start="941" data-end="955">Spider-Man 2</em>, the sequel to the 2002 blockbuster. The movie remains a fan favorite and is often cited as the best of the trilogy and even all the Spider-Man film adaptations. Spoilers for <em>Spider-Man 2</em> I guess&nbsp; but, for many, the standout scene from this movie is the subway sequence, where Tobey Maguire’s Spider-Man must save a runaway train from crashing. In this scene, Spider-Man, after losing his mask, uses his webs to slow down the train, and in the end, the New York City passengers agree to keep his identity a secret.</p>
<p data-start="1632" data-end="2357">The LEGO set that pays tribute to this unforgettable scene contains 393 pieces and includes not only a detailed train model but also four minifigures: Spider-Man, Doc Ock, J. Jonah Jameson, and Aunt May. Spider-Man comes with two interchangeable heads—one masked and one unmasked—so you can replicate the scene exactly as it happened. The set also features Doc Ock with his four mechanical arms, which are adjustable and can be posed in a variety of ways. Two of the arms are equipped with laser beams, while the other two can attach to the train to create that intense showdown. Though not actually present during this scene in the movie, J. Jonah Jameson and Aunt May are included just to fill out the set. I guess they’re more recognizable than the kid who returns Peter’s mask.</p>


<p data-start="2359" data-end="2692">The completed set measures over 3 inches high, 9 inches long, and 2 inches wide, making it a perfect size to display once you’ve finished building it. The roof of the train is removable, allowing you to take a closer look at the interior details, which is a nice touch.</p>
<p data-start="3194" data-end="3606" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">Whether you’re a Spider-Man fan or simply someone who love to collect LEGO, this set offers a great way to relive a classic moment from the <em data-start="3324" data-end="3338">Spider-Man 2</em> movie. And with the current discount, you can save $11 when bringing home this piece of cinematic history.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A 10-minute video of a Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake gameplay presentation leak has appeared online. It shows live motion capture scenes being played out, discusses the story, and important changes for Farah.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming recently provided a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-release-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake release update</a>. The game is still happening, it’s still in development, and we shouldn’t have to wait too much longer.</p>



<p>In the meantime, a huge leak has emerged—which Ubisoft initially had removed for copyright—showing what appears to be a focus group presentation, and it’s now viewable online.</p>







<h2 id="h-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-focus-group-presentation-leaks-online">Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake Focus Group Presentation Leaks Online</h2>



<figure><figcaption>They will be reunited one day. Credit to Ubisoft</figcaption></figure>



<p>The video was first reported on the Reddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1p65pyn/leaked_pitch_deck_for_prince_of_persia_sands_of/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamingLeaksAndRumors</a> page by siliconwolf13. It claimed to be a “Leaked pitch deck for Prince of Persia: Sands of Time remake from Q1 2024.”</p>



<p>Meaning, the presentation is nearly two years old at this point.</p>







<p>The thread was updated to say that the original video was pulled from YouTube, and the reasoning is clear-cut: “This video is no longer available due to a copyright claim by Ubisoft.”</p>



<p>This video is very real, and Ubisoft did not want anyone to see this. The good news is that the video has been reuploaded and mirrored to avoid further copyright claims.</p>



<p>It starts with a brief explanation of the Princess Farah character, running through her profile. It then guides us through the Sands of Time Remake story, before showing off live-action motion capture. The video quality isn’t the best, and the gameplay looks like it’s very much in the alpha stages. But it’s fascinating to see where the game started.</p>



<p>We also learn about how Farah has grown in the remake. She’s no longer an innocent support character, and <strong>Farah comes equipped with a bow to protect herself</strong>. The presentation also mentions players can “Parkour a world rebuilt from the ground up, <strong>expanded with 2 new locations.</strong>“</p>
