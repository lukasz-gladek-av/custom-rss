<p>In this update, which follows <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/psa-dispatchs-visual-censorship-settings-cant-be-removed-on-switch">a comment it made to Nintendo Life earlier this week</a>, the studio explains how the superhero workplace comedy game didn't meet Nintendo's content guidelines.</p>
<p>Apart from this, the good news is that the team is already supposedly working with Nintendo on a path forward to "address at least some of the censored content". It can't make any specific promises, but fans can apparently expect an update in the future.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067uhymzo&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>Here's the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DispatchAdHoc/comments/1qremvk/adhocs_statement_on_switch_censorship/">full statement from AdHoc</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We’ve been quiet for the last few days not because we don’t want to address this stuff, but because we’ve been trying to make sure we’re being good partners with Nintendo. They’ve made their own statement regarding this issue:</p>
<p>“<em>Nintendo requires all games on its platforms to receive ratings from independent organizations and to meet our established content and platform guidelines. While we inform partners when their titles don’t meet our guidelines, Nintendo does not make changes to partner content. We also do not discuss specific content or the criteria used in making these determinations.</em>”</p>
<p>As Nintendo states, any game that’s going to be on the Nintendo platform needs to ‘meet [Nintendo’s] established content and platform guidelines.’ This is the key point. Nintendo has content guidelines. Our game didn’t meet those guidelines, so we made changes that would allow us to release on their platform. That’s what happened here. Honestly we thought this would be obvious since we’re the devs that released the fully uncensored version of the game on other platforms.</p>
<p>We initially assumed, like some of you, that because games like Witcher 3 and Cyberpunk are on the platform with similar types of uncensored mature content, Dispatch would be allowed to do the same. During the porting process it became clear that was not the case. So we asked that we include a disclaimer on the store page to inform customers that content would be different than on other platforms. We worked with Nintendo to get storefront language approved.</p>
<p>Where we absolutely need to take full ownership is the placement of that disclaimer. Again, it was our intent to go out of our way to tell people looking to buy the game that the content was censored. While we didn’t have complete control of the language, we did have control of the placement. Wires got crossed and we put the disclaimer in the field literally titled “Disclaimer”, instead of the “About The Game” section. We didn’t catch this until after the launch when we saw people saying we should have called out the changes on the store page, and we went to go make sure it was there. It technically has been the entire time, just in the absolute worst spot that makes it look like we were trying to hide it.</p>
<p>This is 100% our mistake and it was fixed in the Americas store pages a few hours after launch to give more visibility. We’ve also added a disclaimer before purchase. As of writing this, the other regions have either published this change or are in the process of review.</p>
<p>So what now?</p>
<p>We’re already working with Nintendo on a path forward. While we can’t make any specific promises just yet, we’re confident we’ll be able to push an update to address at least some of the censored content. I’ll get ahead of it now and say that between dev time and the console submission process, we’re talking weeks not days.</p>
<p>To our fans who were looking forward to playing the uncensored version on Switch, we’re truly sorry. People have a right to be pissed. Lots of lessons learned here. Thanks for sticking with us. More soon.</p>

Microsoft joined <a href="https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/sex-offender-video-game-ban-operation-game-over-ny/1975448/">New York state’s initiative to purge sex offenders from online platforms</a> where they might bump into children back in April 2012, so it seems it didn’t ban his account for over a year.</p></div><p>It’s not clear if Epstein played Xbox himself, though. In July 2014, he asks his executive assistant <a href="https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02101088.pdf">“do we have an xbox 360 kinect?”</a> and in 2016 <a href="https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02198968.pdf">this email</a> appears to be a discussion of buying an Xbox as a surprise birthday gift for a boy.

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/respawn-entertainment/" id="95172">Respawn Entertainment</a>, via <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/publishers/electronic-arts/" id="52204">EA</a>‘s <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/apex-legends/news/update-on-nintendo-switch-support" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official website</a>, announced that season 29 will be the final update for Nintendo Switch, with all future updates continuing on the console’s successor. Season 30 begins on August 4.</p>



<p>The development team stressed that all progress, purchases, and earnings are tied to players’ individual EA accounts, and everything will carry over to Nintendo Switch 2, regardless of when you purchase the console. It also stressed that the game will continue to be supported on all other platforms and that the reason for the switch, no pun intended, is to deliver the best possible experience and utilize the power of the Switch 2.</p>

<p>“Our goal is to deliver a high-quality experience. Thanks to Nintendo’s investment in the Nintendo Switch 2, the platform offers a great handheld experience for Apex Legends.”</p>

<p>As 2026 will be the first full calendar year with the Nintendo Switch 2 on the market, the transition away from the original Switch continues. Nintendo recently held a dedicated Direct to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-reveals-tomodachi-life-living-the-dream-release-date/" id="172885">Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</a>. This is one of the final games designed specifically for the original Nintendo Switch, and it will also be playable on the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>Additionally, major Nintendo releases such as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/super-mario-bros-wonder-nintendo-switch-2-edition-release-date-announced/" id="171439">Super Mario Bros. Wonder</a> are receiving dedicated editions for the new Switch 2, adding enhanced visuals and new modes, further encouraging players to switch over.

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/highguard/" id="3394">Highguard </a>has added a new gameplay mode, now available to play.</p>



<p>Highguard has added a 5v5 Raid Mode. The mode is now live, but it will be available for a limited time. The mode is experimental and is only playable this weekend. It’s a separate playlist and will not replace the 3v3 raids.</p>



<p>Lobbies have been updated to allow for parties of 5 for the weekend. Additionally, in this mode, Raids are now 10 lives instead of 6, and respawns are slightly longer to allow for generators to be planted or diffused.</p>



<p>A new base has also been added to Highguard. In addition to the new game mode, they have also added a new base, Soul Well. Described as a dark relic from a lost age, the new base has been added to the rotation in all game modes.</p>







<h2 id="h-quality-of-life-improvements-are-also-coming-to-highguard-in-this-patch">Quality-Of-Life Improvements Are Also Coming to Highguard in This Patch</h2>



<p>Additionally, there are several updates for optimization and quality of life. Several optimizations improve animation performance, projectile behavior, and other gameplay systems. These updates benefit both console and PC and will also include features such as a motion blur toggle.</p>



<p>The developers note that players in 3v3 playlists should see some improvements, but they ask for some leeway during testing of the new game mode. Also, Firing Range does not currently support 5v5.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The stock prices of some major video game companies, including Take-Two Interactive, Roblox, and Unity, had notable declines on Friday, just a day after Google announced its Project Genie tool that lets users prompt AI to generate interactive experiences, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/videogame-stocks-slide-googles-ai-model-that-turns-prompts-into-playable-worlds-2026-01-30/"><em>Reuters</em> reports</a>. Take-Two’s stock price closed at $220.30 (down 7.93 percent from yesterday), Roblox’s closed at $65.76 (down 13.17 percent), and Unity’s closed at $29.10 (down 24.22 percent).</p><p>Other AI tools have received significant pushback from artists and creators over <a href="https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/864951/human-artistry-campaign-ai-licensing-artists">allegations of theft</a> of their work to train the underlying AI models, AI’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/845831/ai-chips-data-center-power-water">water and electricity usage</a>, and what this means for creative output. Google DeepMind’s Diego Rivas told <em>The Verge</em> that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/718723/google-ai-genie-3-model-video-game-worlds-real-time">Genie 3</a>, the AI world model powering Project Genie, was “trained primarily on publicly available data from the web,” and <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2402.15391v1">a white paper</a> from Google DeepMind researchers about the first Genie model said that it was trained from “a large dataset of over 200,000 hours of publicly available Internet gaming videos.”</p><p>Many game developers are already <a href="https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/869386/ai-game-development-gdc-survey">very skeptical of generative AI</a> and its hand in seemingly ripping off existing works to let people create AI slop. The <em>Super Mario</em> and <em>The Legend of Zelda</em>-like worlds <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/869726/google-ai-project-genie-3-world-model-hands-on">I was able to create</a> from prompts with Project Genie somewhat resembled Nintendo’s actual games, but the experiences didn’t have any of the fun or playability of the originals. For an industry already grappling with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/808332/amazon-gaming-layoffs-mmo-aaa-first-party-games">wave</a> after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/806303/netflix-squid-game-unleashed-boss-fight-entertainment-studio-shut-down">wave</a> after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/693535/microsoft-layoffs-july-2025-xbox">wave</a> of layoffs, even the current form of Project Genie represents a pitch to replace work like testing and concept building.</p><p>The version of Project Genie Google presented this week can only make interactive experiences that are 60 seconds long. They have no scores, objectives, or even sound. They can have strange errors and inconsistencies, like a racetrack road unexpectedly turning into grass. When you’re done with an experience, you can only download a video of it or generate a new one; you can’t take what you’ve made in Project Genie and slot it into a traditional game development tool like Unreal Engine or Unity.</p><p>But the push by investors and executives for AI game creation tools is already being spelled out. xAI CEO Elon Musk has <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/2016876797682467277/">promised</a> “Real-time, high-quality shows and video games at scale, customized to the individual, next year.” Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/2017327913113190789">said Friday that</a> “We’ll see constant leapfrogging between engine centric AI and world model centric AI until they come together for maximum effect.” Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg went long on the company’s earnings call this week <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/869882/mark-zuckerberg-meta-earnings-q4-2025">about how</a> AI will help games feel “more immersive and interactive,” making his comments just a couple of weeks after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/861420/meta-reality-labs-layoffs-vr-studios-twisted-pixel-sanzaru-armature">shutting down VR game studios and projects</a>.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/871348/google-project-genie-take-two-roblox-unity]]></content:encoded>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/sony-interactive-entertainment/" id="3274">Sony </a>has patented a new controller type that could revolutionize how gamers think about what a controller can be.</p>



<p><a href="https://sudoku-online.pro/pdfs/buttonless-sony-ps6-controller.pdf">According to a new patent</a> dated January 27, 2026, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/publishers/sony-interactive-entertainment/" id="52192">Sony Interactive Entertainment</a> is presenting a very forward-thinking adaptive controller. In the pack, they describe the drawbacks to modern video game controllers, including difficulties with fixed layouts. For example, they present a hypothetical scenario in which controllers are too large or too small for some users, and highlight the need for game controllers that support different configurations. They also discuss the desire for improvements in the placement of joysticks or D-pads</p>



<p>The drawing shows the layout of a typical controller without fixed buttons, but with a digital screen that allows customization. It also shows different button and D-pad placements, and notes that a button press can be recognized by different movements, such as a tap or swipe.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Sony has registered a patent for an unusual gamepad without physical buttons.</p><p>It features a fully touch-sensitive surface that supports gestures such as taps and swipes, and it will be able to adapt to finger positions, dynamically changing the control zones. <a href="https://t.co/XnQLO18WfZ">pic.twitter.com/XnQLO18WfZ</a></p></div>— Gaming.Bo3.gg (@Gaming_bo3gg) <a href="https://twitter.com/Gaming_bo3gg/status/2017206220491239924?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 30, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<h2 id="h-sony-has-redefined-controllers-in-the-past">Sony Has Redefined Controllers in the Past</h2>



<p>Sony has always been innovative with their controllers. The current standard of twin analog sticks began with the DualShock controller, which, in and of itself, was an advanced take on the original PlayStation controller. Later, they would innovate with Sixaxis motion-sensing technology in their PlayStation 3 controller. The PS4 added a touchpad, and the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/playstation-5/" id="38">PS5 </a>added haptic feedback and dynamic triggers.</p>



<p>While there’s no way to know whether this controller patent will be realized, it shows that Sony is considering ways to be inclusive and allow players to choose their own configurations and play their way. </p>







<p>Also, one could argue that, with the rise of mobile gaming, a younger generation is already accustomed to virtual gamepads. At the same time, it’s a leap into the future that may be difficult for some.</p>

            <guid>1421491</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p dir="ltr"><em>Gladlands </em>is the latest <em>Dimension 20</em> adventure to hit Dropout. Functioning as a spin on a post-apocalyptic adventure where everyone is nice and trying to help out one another instead of fighting over resources, think of it as the most wholesome <em>Mad Max</em> spinoff you've ever seen.</p><p dir="ltr">Going on this adventure are <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/ify-nwadiwe-and-jacob-wysocki-chat-never-stop-blowing-up-being-new-at-table-and" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="b02fe4e6-1370-402b-a680-949a73bfa736" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Jacob Wysocki</a>, Oscar Montoya, Vic Michaelis, and Kimia Behpoornia, among others. Midway through the season, TechRaptor was able to sit down and hear from these performers about what piqued their interest in the project, how they created their unique characters, and what role they think they'd have in the post-apocalypse.</p><p dir="ltr">Starting at the beginning, I asked each how they were approached for the project and what made them say yes. Montoya started "The pitch was essentially, this is a post-apocalyptic world, but instead of devolving into chaos, it's what happens if a caravan of people decide to spread positivity and joy."</p><h2 dir="ltr">Joining The <em>Gladlands </em>Caravan</h2><p dir="ltr">At first, Montoya was in, but when it was revealed who else would be joining the cast, it became a much more enticing offer.</p><p dir="ltr">"Oh, you mean all of my favorite people in the whole wide world? Well, of course I'm in."</p><p dir="ltr">For Wysocki, he explained that <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/how-brennan-lee-mulligan-created-never-stop-blowing-up-love-letter-to-80s" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="55a80c6c-ea7c-4151-9523-d332db6f6cd5" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Brennan Lee Mulligan </a>"hit him with the math," and while he understood the idea, it wasn't fully clicking. "These are two entities that I recognize," those entities being: <em>Mad Max</em> and 'being nice,' "and I know there's a place where they meet, but it didn't immediately click. It required me probably asking fifteen minutes of questions, but Brennan had it all locked and loaded because he's fucking Brennan, and I see the needle we're trying to thread."</p><picture>

  </picture><p dir="ltr">This idea of excitement to play in a game with all of your friends was a sentiment shared by Michaelis and Behpoornia. They shared their story in tandem, first with Michaelis rejecting the idea before learning who would be on it.</p><p dir="ltr">"David Kerns hopped on a call and said 'literally all of your best friends are going to be here, and it's <em>Gladlands</em>, it's going to be post-apocalyptic like Mad Max but things are better.'" From there, Michaelis texted Behpoornia to confirm.</p><p dir="ltr">"I got an email and I was like 'hmm, I want to do it but maybe I should wait it out' and then I got a text from Vic being like 'hey, are you doing this D20, I got all the information, here's everyone who's gonna be there, here's what's going to happen…' and I was like Oh great, somebody got all the info, somebody I really trust and then it was just all my friends there at the table."</p><blockquote><p dir="ltr">"There was all my friends there, that's kind of all I needed… they should have led with that" - Behpoornia on accepting a role in <em>Dimension 20: Gladlands</em></p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">Talking further about having so many friends at the table, Michaelis added, "So much of improv is about the chemistry that you have with people. It's something that we deal with all the time in Very Important People, when you already have that base shared language it's way easier to jump into something, and you get to places that you never would have known before."</p><picture>

  </picture><h2 dir="ltr">Choosing A Post-Apocalyptic Character</h2><p dir="ltr">In this future setting, each performer has created a truly one-of-a-kind character. Wysocki roleplays as KoKoMo, a nine-foot-tall hairy 'snorlaxian, totoroian' character. Montoya is a drag queen, Poppy Persona, Michaelis is a pale corvid-cosplaying mortician, Hugi, and Behpoornia is a normal human man with a 20-pack abs and a cockroach head.</p><p dir="ltr">For inspiration on KoKoMo Wysocki, "his head first went to the 'glad' side of things. I thought about childcare and how these communities, other than western society, raise children and pod them together and there's more of a community effort to look after people than a nuclear family. Then I went to the <em>Mad Max</em> side of things and thought 'what would mutate into that?' and I started to think of a big round couch boy."&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p dir="ltr">"Then I think I rewatched <em>My Neighbor Totoro</em> just for vibes, and I was like yeah, this is that" - Wysocki on creating Kokomo</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">Poppy Persona takes inspiration from Aunt Entity, Tina Turner's character in <em>Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome,</em> mixed with Montoya's real-life experience as the Drag Queen Ozma. "When Brennan gave the premise, my immediate reaction was 'Oh! Tina Turner in Beyond Thunderdome' and to me I've always seen Aunt Entity as a Drag Queen because she has to be this larger than life personality to run the Thunderdome."</p><p dir="ltr">"I was like, 'What would my character's Thunderdome be?' and it would be like Drag Queen Story Hour. So that's where the character of Poppy Persona was created."</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dimension-20-gladlands-poppy.jpg?itok=AgchLUFb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1919" height="1079">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dimension-20-gladlands-poppy.jpg?itok=2DChsHcy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="675">
                  

  </picture><p dir="ltr">I did ask if there were any other Drag Queen influences that he was drawing on, but Montoya explained, "No, I tried to stay away from any existing Drag Artist. They're all incredible artists."</p><p dir="ltr">Behpoornia's approach was to start with one idea and then iterate upon it. "When I heard it was post-apocalyptic, I thought cockroaches survive that long, it usually helps me in brainstorming when I trust my first idea and then go deeper into that."</p><p dir="ltr">"So then I went, 'how do I make this matter?', if it has survived this long, it's probably a lonely guy, and if it's part of a caravan going around to communities being used for the ability that it can't die, then how does that feel? Does he feel used in that way? It's also such a big idea, I wanted to make any lesson he learned kinda bite sized, so I made him a dumb guy, so everything he experiences, he can sum up the way a kid might."</p><p dir="ltr">For Hugi, Michaelis's inspiration was in the pages of the book <em>From Here To Eternity</em>, "which is about cultural death practices and things that are unique to different cultures, and it really took it from an anthropological standpoint. It made grief a lot more accessible. It was interesting exploring the way a community deals with death, especiallyone &nbsp;that has been ravaged and was one generation away from this mass extinction event."</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dimension-20-gladlands-hugi.jpg?itok=9v2P88ct 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1919" height="1076">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dimension-20-gladlands-hugi.jpg?itok=nbVDDOyu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="673">
                  

  </picture><p dir="ltr">"People are still going to die in the <em>Gladlands </em>and the way that we as a society handle death is really important because it's very indicative of the type of society that we live in and so having someone around that's going to treat that with care and respect and to make the people going through that feel seen and honored I think is important to a healthy society. But it's also a job that people don't want to do, so what does the guy who does that look like?"</p><p dir="ltr">As each character could have their own mutations for different body parts, and other irregularities, I was interested to know if that made the character creation process easier or more difficult to nail down a character design. Wysocki explained it was quite the opposite, "It's sort of an easy out in the sense that you can just say 'well, I just mutated that way,' you can't argue with that. It does give you a lot of freedom, so much freedom that somebody's dad could be a motorcycle."</p><p dir="ltr">"Or that you can be the hottest bodied person ever and have the body of a bug" Montoya added, referencing Behpoornia's Tess Tube5.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dimension-20-gladlands-tess-tube5.jpg?itok=h1nFk8U7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1919" height="1079">

  </picture><h2 dir="ltr">First And Second Times In The Dome</h2><p dir="ltr">Interestingly while <em>Dimension 20: Gladlands</em> is the 27th season of Dimension 20 for Wysocki and Montoya this was their second time in the Dome, and for Michaelis and Behpoornia it was their first. I was interested to know how it was coming back for the second time, as well as what they came away with from the experience if it was their first time on Dimension 20.</p><p dir="ltr">"I'm more comfortable now, I'm not as intimidated by what the Dome is and how important it is to a lot of people," explained Wysocki "to be supported by very great people there was no way to lose."</p><p dir="ltr">Montoya echoed similar sentiments, "I felt super comfortable because I'd done it before, the first time I was learning how to play the game while I was playing it, but even when it had wildly different mechanics it was a lot easier for me to RP, and that was the easy part of it, AND I get to RP with my friends? Say less, I'm good."</p><p dir="ltr">For those new to the Dome they had experience in playing some home games "which were really fun, but I don't think necessarily prepared me for the amount that you have to be doing in the Dome when you're being filmed and recorded" Michaelis joked.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dimension-20-gladlands-table-reaction.jpg?itok=rzAtC7bF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1919" height="1079">

  </picture><p dir="ltr">"I also hadn't played very much," Behpoornia added "this is what I think all of them are and I'm hearing that it's kind of an outlier here because we're not doing much combat, big bads, magic spells, all of that. So if I had to go back and do something like that I'd be so confused."</p><h2 dir="ltr">Improv Bits In A Strange New World</h2><p dir="ltr">Watching <em>Dimension 20: Gladlands</em> the bits that the party make up and stick with are just as outlandish as the setting they're taking place in. Knowing that it was such a strange world it seemed like there was no limit to a punchline. Talking about the 'Yes, and' at the table Montoya jokes "I feared we did go too far."</p><p dir="ltr">"I was wondering 'is any of this usable? We're just having too good of a time riffing and doing bits. That's just a testament to the kind of storytelling ability the Brennan Lee Mulligan has, he was able to steer the ship when things were getting a little bit too chaotic. We also know when to lock in and when to be silly and goofy and stuff"</p><p dir="ltr">On the flip side Behpoornia mused that she didn't think there was any way to take it too far. "Just knowing the people that were there at the table, knowing that anything you did, even if it was crazy, nothing is a mess up. We could have done anything at the table because one, Brennan is such a big brain that's taking us through exactly what we need to do, and two, everyone else there we've known for years and have performed with so it's the safest space to do anything."</p><picture>

  </picture><p dir="ltr">"I really believe that the only time you can mess up is when nobody is there to back you up," Michaelis added, "With a group like this it's never going to happen, there's going to be somebody who steps in. Even if it doesn't work, there's going to be four of you together"</p><h2 dir="ltr">What Would Your Job Be In The <em>Gladlands</em>?</h2><p dir="ltr">As our time wrapped up and we had finished discussing each characters role I was interested to pose to each of the cast members what role they think they would have in the Gladlands.</p><p dir="ltr">Montoya began "In the Gladlands I would like to think I'd be a Poppy Persona, that's why I created the character, yeah I think that's my answer."</p><p dir="ltr">Michaelis shared that they'd been "constantly threatening to go back to school to be an EMT or a nurse. I think that's probably what I would want to do. Weirdly, I think I'm quite good in hospitals or emergency situations. I'd need the training but I think in a situation like that where there's not TV I'd have a lot more time to focus on studying."</p><p dir="ltr">"I'd maybe want to do some job with the kids in the Gladlands because that just sounds really sweet," mused Behpoornia "It sounds like my level of how I would process living in the Gladlands. So to be someone who can help them process their play in the post-apocalypse sounds like a nice job to have."</p><p dir="ltr">To close us out Wysocki gave the short but sweet answer "I'm just not making it, nah nah nah I like accidentally shoot a president or something"</p><p dir="ltr">You can watch <em>Dimension 20: Gladlands</em> now on Dropout.tv, the<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W63ILhEsvGY" rel="nofollow"> first episode is also available via the Dimension 20 Youtube channel.</a></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/dimension-20-gladlands-is-mad-max-if-everyone-wasnt-being-so-rude-interview]]></content:encoded>

              <p><span>When you need a tool, you rarely reach for a Swiss Army Knife. It’s an option that only makes sense when you have no other options. Have you ever tried to </span><i><span>actually </span></i><span>cut wood with the shitty and very flimsy saw blade included in a Swiss Army Knife or any other similar kind of multitool? I have. It was a horrible experience, and I ended up buying a saw to finish the job. It turns out shoving many things into one package isn’t an effective way to make something good.</span></p> <p><span>Anyway, have y’all played </span><i><span>Highguard</span></i><span>?&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Released on January 26, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-impressions-titanfall-2-apex-multiplayer-shooter-2000663136"><i><span>Highguard </span></i></a><span>is a (</span><i><span>deep breath)</span></i><span> free-to-play fantasy-sci-fi MOBA-like 3v3 PVP hero shooter with base defense and raid mechanics. It was first unveiled as the finale of the <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-game-awards-trailer-rust-hero-shooter-interview-2000663137">2025 Game Awards</a> and received a less-than-stellar reaction from people online. And since then, the conversation about </span><i><span>Highguard </span></i><span>has been very strange and oddly aggressive. People taking sides. Takes being shot out like mortars across social media. It’s one of the weirdest reactions to a video game I’ve seen in many years.&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p><span>But I’m not here to talk about that </span><i><span>Highguard</span></i><span>, the one that exists online as a battlefield for takes, opinions, videos, and discourse about the discourse. I’m here to offer a critical look at the </span><i><span>actual </span></i><span>game. The thing people can play right now. And that </span><i><span>Highguard </span></i><span>is far less interesting than the conversation and the mess around it.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>That’s perhaps the biggest problem facing </span><i><span>Highguard </span></i><span>as it enters into its second week leaking players like a toddler spilling juice from their first big kid cup. It turns out </span><i><span>Highguard </span></i><span>just isn’t very interesting.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2><b>Bland and boring</b></h2> <p><i><span>Highguard </span></i><span>is such a boring game to look at. Developers Wildlight Entertainment seem to have been unable to decide what kind of game </span><i><span>Highguard </span></i><span>is, and the first sign of that is in how it mixes together fantasy, sci-fi, magic, and modern guns. This blending of genres and tropes can be done well, but not in </span><i><span>Highguard</span></i><span>; every asset and model has had any potential character and grit sanded down to ensure the various pieces blend together.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>And they do blend. Perfectly. Too perfectly.&nbsp; Nothing sticks out. There’s no charm. No quirks. Nothing to talk about with people or post online. It’s the kind of game that leaves your brain the moment you stop playing it.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>I’ve played over 14 hours of the game now across many matches, and I struggle to name a character beyond Slade, an obnoxious blonde dude who is the closest </span><i><span>Highguard </span></i><span>gets to creating something that has personality. Everybody else is a generic tough man or sneaky woman with clothing and armor that looks like what you start an RPG with, and then quickly replace.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>It’s a shame that </span><i><span>Highguard </span></i><span>is such a forgettable-looking game because I do think the idea of a raid shooter is a cool concept.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2><b>Let’s get ready to raid</b></h2> <p><span>When a match kicks off, you start at your base, pick a hero, and set up defensive walls. Next, you and your two teammates ride out and search for loot on the map. This mostly involves speeding around on your mount and opening chests. The other team is doing the same, and you might run into them.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Eventually, a large sword starts to form in the world, and each team needs to get to it, grab it, and take it to the enemy base to blast open their shield dome and raid the place. Do a good job raiding and the match is over. Fail and this all repeats, but the loot in the world gets better. Once a team pulls off a successful raid, they win.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>This might sound complicated compared to a lot of other shooters on the market, and it does take some time to learn how this all works. But once I did, I was having some fun with </span><i><span>Highguard</span></i><span>. I always felt like my team could come back and win. We were just one awesome raid away from victory.</span></p> <div>           <ul>                           <li>                 <p>Back-of-the-box quote:</p>                 <p>“I think one of them is named… Val?

That makes sense considering the studio behind </span><i><span>Highguard </span></i><span>is made up of devs who worked on that game. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mining-crystals-in-highguard-is-so-damn-satisfying-ps5-pc-steam-2000663527"><span>Breaking large gems out in the world between raids is also extremely satisfying</span></a><span>. I equally enjoyed setting up defenses at my base before heading out to find upgrades. And chasing someone down on the back of a mount is thrilling and not an experience found in most other online shooters. Then you have each character’s unique powers and abilities, which can dramatically change a fight as you drop down a fireblast or whip up a big wall of ice. Oh, and there’s a whole loot economy, in which you need to balance buying better guns with making sure you have enough shields to weather future firefights. And then…</span></p>

 <h2><b>Too many moving parts</b></h2> <p><span>Well, see, we’ve reached the other major problem with </span><i><span>Highguard</span></i><span>: It is trying to be everything.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Similar to its bland art style that makes it feel like the devs couldn’t commit to one idea and instead tossed it all in, </span><i><span>Highguard’s </span></i><span>gameplay is a grab bag of ideas and mechanics from other popular games. And while it would be cool if we could just put ice cream, pizza, wine, and meatloaf into a blender and mix it all up to get something even better, that ain’t how the world works.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>The fast, </span><i><span>Call of Duty</span></i><span>-like gunplay means you die quickly. This makes going out and getting into fights before raids a chore. The upgrade and crystal economy means you have to spend time hunting down and breaking blue rocks, which, while satisfying to smash, compelling gameplay it doesn’t make. And sure, you get some currency from defeating other players, but late-game gear costs so much and you get so little from kills that during long matches, I felt obligated to stop fighting and instead go mining. The raids, easily the best part of </span><i><span>Highguard</span></i><span>, also make mounts mostly worthless, robbing the game of one of its coolest features. And only having three players on each side makes raids feel less epic, and the bases you defend too big. (Though the devs are already playing around with <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-big-update-free-shooter-future-patch-notes-wildlight-2000664584">a 5v5 mode</a>, which might help.)</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000663165" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000663165"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000663165">© Wildlight Entertainment</figcaption></figure> <p><span>In other words, each piece of </span><i><span>Highguard </span></i><span>often gets in the way of the other pieces and can derail the whole experience.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Perhaps </span><i><span>Highguard </span></i><span>will receive weeks and months of updates to improve some of these problems. Perhaps it will add a 4v4 mode to make the map feel less empty. Maybe the time to kill, especially in the early part of matches, will be increased so fights last longer.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>But none of that will be able to truly fix </span><i><span>Highguard</span></i><span>. It would take a lot more work to do that. </span><i><span>Highguard </span></i><span>is a forgettable shooter that stuffs too much into one game and ends up being a sometimes fun but uneven mess. At least it’s a mess that most players won’t remember for long after they log off. </span></p>

            <guid>1421437</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Bethesda is celebrating the release of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-s2-ep6-super-mutant-character-name-2000662226"><i><span>Fallout </span></i><span>season 2’s penultimate episode</span></a><span> by thoroughly upsetting the franchise’s online multiplayer fanbase. It just released the </span><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4250650/Fallout_76_Mojave_Bundle/"><span>Mojave Bundle</span></a><span> for </span><i><span>Fallout 76</span></i><span>: a $30 DLC pack that features some nametags, a couple of items for your in-game camp, and the NCR Ranger Power Armor worn by Maximus in the previous episode. That’s half what the entire game cost back when it launched in 2018.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Those who stuck with </span><i><span>Fallout 76 </span></i><span>throughout its many highs and lows </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/bethesda-zenimax-fallout-76-crunch-development-1849033233"><span>in the aftermath of its very rough launch in 2018</span></a><span> aren’t impressed. The decision to lock the cool new Power Armor design behind such a pricey one-off payment has been made worse by the fact that you can’t even purchase it through the in-game microtransaction store, the Atomic Shop.</span></p>

 <p><span>That means that if you’ve been saving up your Atoms, the premium currency used to purchase items, either by completing daily and weekly challenges or by slowly accruing them through your monthly $13 Fallout 1st subscription, you’ll still have to shell out an extra $30 just to get this fancy-looking skin. All of <em>Fallout 76</em>‘s seasonal updates are free, but that’s not making it any easier to swallow for some fans.&nbsp;</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is CRAZY. They love making you pay a stupid amount of money for NCR stuff. <a href="https://t.co/gfqLCuUSaR">https://t.co/gfqLCuUSaR</a> <a href="https://t.co/aXgFIYhmct">pic.twitter.com/aXgFIYhmct</a></p> <p>— RyGuy (@rydirium) <a href="https://twitter.com/rydirium/status/2016932831084114052?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 29, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>“I can’t stay silent about how aggressively cash-grabby Bethesda has become since Microsoft acquired them,” reads </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/1qqhysl/yeah_the_price_of_the_mojave_bundle_is_ridiculous/"><span>one post</span></a><span> over on the </span><i><span>Fallout 76 </span></i><span>subreddit. “But what makes it even worse is that the game is still full of bugs and issues that haven’t been properly addressed. Clearly, Bethesda’s focus isn’t on fixing the game or delivering a solid experience anymore – they’re just trying to squeeze every cent out of players.”</span></p>

 <p><span>As </span><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fallout/fallout-76-is-free-to-play-until-feb-5-but-if-you-want-that-sick-ncr-power-armor-from-the-fallout-show-its-gonna-cost-you/"><i><span>PC Gamer</span></i></a><span> pointed out, you can currently buy every single mainline </span><i><span>Fallout</span></i><span> game, from the OG </span><i><span>Fallout</span></i><span>&nbsp;all the way up to </span><i><span>Fallout 4</span></i><span> (and even </span><i><span>Fallout 76</span></i><span> itself), for less than the price of the Mojave Bundle. The fact that players who have been grinding for Atoms don’t even get a discount makes it even worse.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Meanwhile, </span><i><span>Fallout 76</span></i><span> itself has been on a week-long free trial and is currently on sale for just $8. It’s almost like the $30 power armor is Bethesda trying to make it up on the back end. Genuinely impressive that they’ve managed to make Amazon look borderline charitable by comparison, considering they just dropped the first season of </span><i><span>Fallout </span></i><span>on YouTube </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-season-1-free-to-watch-youtube-prime-2000664098"><span>for free</span></a><span>.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Highguard Devs Make A Big Change As Player Count Nosedives]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/highguard-big-update-free-shooter-future-patch-notes-wildlight-2000664584</link>
            <guid>1421422</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>After launching on January 26, <em>Highguard</em> has struggled to keep players, according to data on SteamDB. But <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguards-patch-note-fov-ps5-crash-pc-optimization-2000664201">Wildlight isn’t giving up on the free-to-play raid shooter</a>, and has announced a big<strong>&nbsp;</strong>change for the game: a 5v5 mode.</p> <p>On Friday, Wildlight’s studio head and game director Chan Grenier <a href="https://x.com/ChadGrenier/status/2017271635712352533">teased on Twitter that a “big update”</a> about <em>Highguard</em> was coming, adding “You’ll want to see this one.” About four hours later, after some delay, that update arrived, and it was indeed a biggie. For a limited time, Highguard will offer players a 5v5 mode, a big shift from the game’s 3v3 mode, which many had criticized for being too small and sweaty.</p> <p>“We heard the feedback,” <a href="https://x.com/PlayHighguard/status/2017334052865658987">posted the official <em>Highguard</em> account</a>. “For the weekend, we are experimenting with a 5v5 Raid Mode. This is a separate playlist and not meant to replace 3’s. 3v3 Raids are still there for people who enjoy it! The lobby has been updated to allow for parties of 5 while the mode is live.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">You asked, we listened</p> <p>All-new 5v5 limited time mode, playable now! ⚔️ <a href="https://t.co/wBaFZUOCeZ">pic.twitter.com/wBaFZUOCeZ</a></p> <p>— Highguard | LIVE NOW! (@PlayHighguard) <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayHighguard/status/2017333024598221040?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 30, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The new mode was added as part of a patch that is live now on consoles and PC. 5v5 will only be around for the weekend, for now, and Wildlight warns that adding more players could lead to some performance issues. Still, I’m excited to give <em>Highguard</em> another shot to see if a few more players in the game’s big empty maps could help add some excitement and take some pressure off players having to perform perfectly during team fights.</p> <p>The conversation around <em>Highguard</em> has been a mess ever since it was announced via the final teaser at the <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-game-awards-trailer-rust-hero-shooter-interview-2000663137">2025 Game Awards in December</a>. That trailer failed to excite people online, and a period of radio silence afterward left a big void that was filled by angry commentators, confused gamers, lots of blogs, and random takes from users on sites like Reddit and BlueSky. When it finally arrived earlier this week, it saw a huge influx of curious onlookers, nearly reaching 100k concurrent players according to SteamDB data. But just a few days later, <em>Highguard’s</em> playercount has dwindled as <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-already-has-over-7000-negative-reviews-on-steam-2000663220">negative reviews continue to flood the game’s Steam page</a>.</p>

 <p>Will this big change be enough to turn things around, or is <em>Highguard</em> doomed to become another flop in a long line of live-service games that have failed to survive? I’m not sure, but at the very least, it seems Wildlight Entertainment is willing to make big changes to the game to try and keep it around.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>If <strong>PlayStation</strong> needed another sign that its current push to put its first-party made and published games on both PC and <strong>PS5</strong> was a good idea, it certainly has it with the latest report from <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/helldivers-2-sells-20m-copies">Alinea Analytics</a>, which claims that the popular third-person shooter <strong>Helldivers 2</strong> has sold <strong>over 20 million copies</strong>, most of them coming from PC players on Steam.</p>



<p>When Helldivers 2 launched, despite its connectivity issues <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/helldivers-2-not-enough-patriotism/">that hindered the experience</a> and the controversy regarding <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-cancels-mandatory-helldivers-2-psn-account-linking-update/">PC players initially being mandated to connect their PlayStation Network accounts to their Steam accounts to play the game</a>, it was immediately the standout hit multiplayer game of 2024. </p>



<p>It skyrocketed to the top of Steam's charts, and even though it hasn't sustained the same level of popularity it had two years ago, it has successfully carved its own dedicated community out of the swath of multiplayer games people can choose to play. Alinea Analytics even adds that in December 2025, Helldivers 2 had <strong>3.6 million monthly active users</strong> across PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S.</p>



<p>After Helldivers 2 arrived on PC and PS5 at launch, <a href="https://wccftech.com/helldivers-2-coming-to-xbox-summer/">it came to Xbox Series X/S consoles in summer 2025</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-coming-to-playstation-helldivers-2-warbond/">even ushered in the first instance of Halo coming to PlayStation</a> through a Halo and Helldivers 2 crossover, before <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-remake-halo-campaign-evolved-coming-to-pc-xbox-ps5-2026/">Halo was actually announced as coming to PlayStation</a>.</p>



<p>So far, Helldivers 2 has sold <strong>1.6 million copies on Xbox</strong>, <strong>5.6 million copies on PS5,</strong> and the remaining <strong>13.1 million on PC</strong>. According to Alinea Analytics, it has generated over <strong>$700 million in revenue</strong> for developer <strong>Arrowhead Studios</strong> and publisher <strong>PlayStation Studios</strong>.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Helldivers-2-Sales-Alinea-Analytics.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: Alinea Analytics</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The game is nothing but a roaring success, and as Arrowhead continues to update it with new content, it's likely that we're due for a spike in Helldivers 2 popularity from a new expansion, similar to what the <a href="https://wccftech.com/helldivers-2-into-the-unjust-update/"><strong>Into the Unjust</strong> update</a> did for it last year. Though the most recent update to get excited about was exclusively for PC players, as <strong>Sony's </strong>internal PC porting house, <strong>Nixxes</strong>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/helldivers-2-install-size-on-pc-shrinks-by-85-percent-thanks-to-nixxes/">figured out how to shrink the game's install size by <strong>85%</strong>, freeing up a lot of storage space on players' SSDs</a>.</p>



<p>Interestingly, as far as previously console-exclusive third-person shooters go, when comparing how <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-of-war-reloaded-surpasses-1-million-players-three-days-after-launch/">Gears of War Reloaded</a></strong> did on PS5 versus Helldivers 2 on Xbox, <a href="https://wccftech.com/helldivers-2-xbox-sells-more-gears-of-war-reloaded-ps5/">Helldivers 2 is the clear winner, selling more on Xbox than Gears of War has done on PS5</a>.</p>

Instead, audiences saw the cards as trivializing the institution of slavery in the American Wild West.</p><p>Devir Games did issue an apology for these cards, stopped all sales of the game, had retail copies recalled, designed new cards to replace the controversial ones, and issued them free of charge.</p><p>Now with the <em>Ace of Spades</em> reboot, this revised version of the game is coming back. As our <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/ace-of-space-review-shuffle-deal-draw" rel="nofollow">original review</a> mentioned, the game is a fun, Wild West spin on poker where winning, much like a gun duel, depends on the draw. The new version of the game will be sold at an MSRP of $24.99.</p><p>But this reboot isn't just a formal relaunch. Devir Games has also announced a new expansion for the game, <em>Ace of Spades: Call of the Zombie</em>. This expansion adds 15 new cards to the game, including zombie enemies and four versions of a boss zombie, called Hellbilly. Considering Rockstar Games' <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/look-back-at-red-dead-redemptions-timeless-tale-of-john-marston" rel="nofollow"><em>Red Dead Redemption</em></a> and the TTRPG <em>Deadlands</em> have done this mash-up, it fits here.</p><p><em>Ace of Spades: Call of the Zombie </em>is available for pre-order on Devir Games' website. It is set to release on May 31, 2026, and will be sold at an MSRP of $9.99.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

Pedro Pascal, who plays Joel in the show, was one of the first of her co-stars to publicly pay tribute after O’Hara’s passing, sharing a lovely photo and calling the comic star a “genius” who he was grateful to be near.</span></p>   <p><span>Since her storied career spanned decades, O’Hara’s fans have many touchstones to think back on, whether that be her presence on the beloved Canadian sketch comedy show </span><i><span>SCTV </span></i><span>early in her career or some of her voice acting roles, such as Sally from </span><i><span>The Nightmare Before Christmas</span></i><span>. When news broke, fans immediately started flooding the internet with tributes, condolences, and jokes about how the wrong </span><i><span>Home Alone 2 </span></i><span>star died.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The features for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/wwe-2k26/" id="172879">WWE 2K26</a> have officially been revealed, and with that comes the first batch of screenshots for the game. </p>



<p>The screenshots give players a look at new and updated character models, arenas, match types, and more. </p>







<p>WWE 2K26 launches on March 13 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch 2, and PC. The series is officially leaving the last-gen Xbox One and PlayStation 4 behind after over a decade.</p>



<p>This year’s game features CM Punk as the game’s main cover athlete and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-cm-punk-showcase-mode/" id="169985" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">feature wrestler in the game’s Showcase Mode</a>. Other improvements include <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-new-match-types/" id="170273" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">four new and returning match types</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-nintendo-switch-2-features/" id="173149" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch 2-specific features</a>, and a number of updates to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-features-major-updates-to-fan-favorite-game-modes/" id="173163" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fan-favorite game modes</a>. </p>



<p><strong>“Run the show your way in WWE 2K26, featuring 400+ WWE Superstars and Legends,” </strong>the game’s description reads. <strong>“Light up the ring with all-new match types, relive CM Punk’s greatest moments, and explore the secrets of The Island.”</strong></p>



<p>Speaking of the Island, the mode is officially coming to PC for the first time after skipping the platform in WWE 2K25.</p>



<p>As mentioned, WWE 2K26 launches on March 13. Those who preorder the higher-tiered editions of the game, however, get access to the game a week early on March 6.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>March is coming up fast, which means it’s nearly time for another <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/wwe-2k/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dose of wrasslin’ game goodness</a>, with 2K officially unveiling WWE 2K26 today. CM Punk is once again gracing the cover this year (a Punk with less gray in his beard appeared on the cover of WWE 2K13) and will be starring in this year’s 2K Showcase mode. Punk is far from the only wrestler in the game, as developer Visual Concepts has apparently packed a whopping 400+ Superstars into WWE 2K26 at launch – a number that will only expand with DLC, etc. You can check out a handful of early screenshots of WWE 2K26, below.</p>

<p>Visual Concepts is also promising four new match types -- I Quit, Inferno, Three Stages of Hell, and Dumpster – as well as some new plunder to use against opponents, such as shopping carts and thumb tacks. Ultimately though, perhaps most exciting for folks like myself who have been playing WWE 2K forever, Visual Concepts have promised a full revamp of the reversal and stamina system, which has long been a glaring weak point for the series. We still don’t know much about <em>how</em> these systems are changing, but apparently the updates will “add a new layer of strategy,” which is exactly the kind of thing I was begging for in last year's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/wwe-2k25/">WWE 2K25 review</a>. </p>



<p>Here’s a quick rundown of some other new features coming in WWE 2K26…</p>



<ul>
<li><em><strong>Creation Suite</strong> - 2X the CAS and Image Slots, Plus Body Morphing: The best-in-class customization mode now offers 200 Create-A-Superstar save slots, doubling the existing count in response to community demand. Community Creations now features a doubled image capacity of 2,000, deeper body and face morphing tools, and two-tone hair color blending, giving players unprecedented freedom to craft the Superstars, arenas, and other creations of their dreams.</em></li>



<li><em><strong>MyGM</strong> - More Shows, More Superstars Per Match: New Intergender Matches, 5, 6, and 8-manmatches, plus support for more match types than ever before, vastly increase the number of&nbsp; possible matches and outcomes. More shows per season pose new management challenges in2K’s strategic brand management simulation mode.</em></li>



<li><em><strong>MyRise</strong> - New Theme, Increased Replay Value: Players define their MySuperstar’s journey through two new division-based storylines where villainous or heroic decisions impact MyPlayers like never before. Players can now keep playing even after the main stories are complete, with more unlockable content and achievements to earn for increased replayability.</em></li>



<li><em><strong>The Island</strong> - New Storyline and Environment, Available on All Platforms: 2K’s WWE-themed world is now bigger and more social than ever, and available for the first time on PC. Players will choose one of three factions and battle for control with a revamped progression system. The new Scrapyard Brawl environment, fresh Towers, new shops and branded gear, an expanded MySuperstar builder with face-photo importing, plus upgraded quests, complete with Superstar voiceovers, cutscenes and dialogue screens, enhance the immersive experience.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Of course, WWE 2K26 is coming in the usual dizzying array of special editions, and, in fact, 2K is pushing the bar further than ever this year, with the $150 Monday Night War Edition. Here are the different ways you can buy WWE 2K26:</p>



<ul>
<li><em>The <strong>Standard Edition</strong> is $70.</em></li>



<li><em><strong>King of Kings Edition</strong> will be available for $1oo. King of Kings Edition includes the Standard Edition, Joe Hendry Pack, Ringside Pass Premium Season 1, and 32,500 VC, plus the King of Kings Pack which includes playable Superstars Triple H ‘98 and Stephanie McMahon ‘00, and a “Triple H Signature Taunt” Emote for The Island.</em></li>



<li><em><strong>Attitude Era Edition</strong> will be available for $130. In addition to all content included in the King of Kings Edition, Attitude Era Edition includes access to Ringside Pass Premium Seasons 1-4,plus the Attitude Era Edition Pack, which features playable Superstars The Rock ‘99, Kane ‘98, and Chyna ‘97, “Stone Cold” Steve Austin “Rattlesnake” and The Rock “People’s Champ” MyFaction EVO cards, the Raw is War ‘98 Arena, and Undertaker “Thumb Across the Neck” and Shawn Michaels “DX Crotch Chop” Emotes for The Island. The Superstar Mega-Boost is also included, which grants 200 MySuperstar attribute points for MyRise plus 100,000 VC.</em></li>



<li><em><strong>Monday Night War Edition</strong> will be available for $150. In addition to all content included in the Attitude Era Edition, Monday Night War Edition includes access to Ringside Pass Premium Seasons 1-6, plus the Monday Night War Edition Pack, which features playable Superstars Shawn Michaels DX, Macho Man Randy Savage ‘98, Rowdy Roddy Piper ‘98, the WCW Thunder ‘98 Arena, and a Diamond Dallas Page “Bang!” Emote for The Island. Monday Night War Edition also grants entitlement for the WrestleMania 42 Pack, which includes the WrestleMania42 Arena and three WrestleMania 42 Superstar Persona Cards to be automatically entitled post-launch.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Oh, and yes, there will now be a premium battle pass, er, sorry, “Ringside Pass” offered as well. Here are the details on that.</p>



<ul>
<li><em><strong>Ringside Passes</strong> - DLC Gets an Upgrade with More Post-Launch Content Than Ever Before: The all-new Ringside Pass offers players additional incentive to play, earning XP across all game modes, excluding online lobbies. 60 free tiers and 40 premium tiers will be available to reward gameplay, with players who can reach tier 40 of the Ringside Pass Premium Season able to unlock Superstars, cosmetic and customization items, VC, MyFaction and The Island content, and more. The Ringside Pass Premium replaces the previous DLC model, rewarding players with all-new playable characters unavailable on the base game roster, including current Superstars, Legends, Personas, and some unexpected names. Six Ringside Pass Seasons are planned to roll out throughout the year, with Ringside Pass Season 1 available at launch and featuring unlockable Superstars and Legends, previously available in the WWE 2K Supercharger, on the free tier.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>WWE 2K26 hits PC, Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and Switch 2 (yes, “last gen” versions seem to finally be behind us) on March 13, unless you buy the King of Kings Edition or above, in which case, you’ll be able to play a week early on March 6.</p>
