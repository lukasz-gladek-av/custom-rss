			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/assassins-creed-shadows/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a> is the next big RPG in the series from the team at Ubisoft Quebec, and the rule for recent RPG-style entries in the series has been “bigger is better.” <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/assassins-creed-origins/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Assassin’s Creed Origins was big</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/assassins-creed-odyssey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Assassin’s Creed Odyssey</a> was bigger, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/assassins-creed-valhalla/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Assassin’s Creed Valhalla</a> was perhaps even a bit larger. So, does Ubisoft plan to push the scope even further for AC Shadows? Thankfully for those who found some recent AC games a bit overwhelming, the answer is no.</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/assassins-creed-shadows-japan-is-roughly-similar-in-size-to-egypt-in-origins/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent Video Games Chronicle interview</a> with Ubisoft Quebec’s Simon Lemay-Comtois, Assassin’s Creed Shadows scales things back to a map “roughly similar to Origins.” Mind you, AC Origins still had a very sizable 80km² world, but at least the map inflation is being curtailed somewhat.</p>
<p>Lemay-Comtois further detailed what part of Japan the game focuses on, as Ubisoft won’t be trying to render all of Japan, despite the nation’s relatively compact size.</p>
<p><em>“The story that we focus on is mostly on central Japan, so we don’t expand all the way to the entirety of Japan, so therefore we knew we had a rough idea for the territory we wanted to cover. So, something important happens in Kyoto, something important happens in Osaka, Azuchi – we need these places, so how faithful to these castles can we be, because they’re very interesting, so we build out those castles, they have a very big footprint.</em></p>
<p><em>And then we think about how much of the world do we need between those castles so that it becomes credible and feels like an adventure as you move between them, and it doesn’t take a real four days of horseback riding to get from one to the other. So, it’s kind of a tricky thing to develop, but eventually we find our footing with the types of cities and castles that we want to represent and that’s what justifies the size of our world map.”</em></p>
<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows sneaks onto PC, Xbox Series X/S, and PS5 on November 15. Yesterday Ubisoft shared over <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-13-minutes-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first footage of its samurai and ninja protagonists in action</a>.</p>

                <p>Epic recently announced that it will add difficulty settings to its survival game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/">Lego Fortnite</a>, with the v30.10 update later this week, on Thursday, June 13.</p><p dir="ltr">The v30.10 update will introduce Cozy and Expert mode. As the names suggest, each of these modes accommodate very different playstyles. As detailed by a <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/lego-fortnite-v30-10-adds-cozy-mode-and-expert-mode" rel="nofollow ">Fortnite blog post</a>, Cozy mode is primarily meant for those who are new to survival games and aren't looking for too much of a challenge.</p><p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, Expert mode will be catered to those looking for more of a challenge. In this mode, Storm-Wild creatures will do more damage, receive more health, and move faster than normal enemies. In addition to storm enemies receiving a buff, permadeath will be enabled in Expert mode. But if they have a Totem of Return equipped, they'll spawn back at their bed with their backpack.</p><p dir="ltr">Despite all the new hardships Expert mode players will have to endure, it isn't all bad, because they'll be able to unlock three trophies to show off. The trophies players will be able to unlock will consist of accomplishments tied to the Grasslands, Dry Valley, and Frostlands. To unlock them, they'll need to defeat the biome-specific Storm-Wild Brute and then interact with said biome village at level 10.</p><p dir="ltr">For more Fortnite content, check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-chapter-5-season-3-the-best-landing-spots-during-wrecked/2900-5459/#1">gallery highlighting the best spots to land for Chapter 5 Season 3</a>.</p>

It requires doing a lot of exploring, fighting, and intuiting, and by the end, you'll know the new destination pretty intimately.</p><p dir="ltr">After spending a whole lot of time in the Pale Heart of the Traveler, we've narrowed down exactly how to get everything you need to unlock Khvostov and where it's all hidden. You'll first need to find all the hidden Region Chests, then complete all six variations of the Alone in the Dark quests, and <em>then</em> find a bunch more hidden collectibles. Here's everything you need to know to find just about everything in the Pale Heart of the Traveler and walk away with Khvostov for your troubles.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#Step_1__Region_Chests">Step 1: Region Chests</a><ul><li><a href="#The_Landing_Region_Chest_Locations">The Landing Region Chest Locations</a></li><li><a href="#The_Blooming_Region_Chest_Locations">The Blooming Region Chest Locations</a></li><li><a href="#The_Impasse_Region_Chest_Locations">The Impasse Region Chest Locations</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#Step_2__Search_All_Six_Cysts">Step 2: Search All Six Cysts</a><ul><li><a href="#Searing_Light_Cyst_Encryption_Location">Searing Light Cyst Encryption Location</a></li><li><a href="#Slayer_Lost_Cyst_Encryption_Location">Slayer Lost Cyst Encryption Location</a></li><li><a href="#Aerial_Ace_Lost_Cyst_Encryption_Location">Aerial Ace Lost Cyst Encryption Location</a></li><li><a href="#Pervading_Darkness_Cyst_Encryption_Location">Pervading Darkness Cyst Encryption Location</a></li><li><a href="#Sword_Dance_Cyst_Encryption_Location">Sword Dance Cyst Encryption Location</a></li><li><a href="#Moth_Infested_Cavern">Moth-Infested Cavern</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#Step_3__Claim_The_Legendary_Version_Of_Khvostov">Step 3: Claim The Legendary Version Of Khvostov</a></li><li><a href="#Step_4__Collect_All_8_Visions_Of_The_Traveler">Step 4: Collect All 8 Visions Of The Traveler</a></li><li><a href="#Step_5__Complete_Overthrows_In_Each_Pale_Heart_Location">Step 5: Complete Overthrows In Each Pale Heart Location</a></li><li><a href="#Step_6__Open_The_Golden_Chest">Step 6: Open The Golden Chest</a></li></ul></div><h2 dir="ltr" id="Step_1__Region_Chests">Step 1: Region Chests</h2><p dir="ltr">The easiest part of this whole undertaking is tracking down all nine Region Chests hidden throughout the Pale Heart. These are usually in weird and out-of-the-way places, but they're marked on your map so you'll at least know where to go when you start your hunt. Region Chests are indicated by the little plus signs on your map, which will give you a good starting point. There are three chests in each of the main Pale Heart areas: The Landing, The Blooming, and The Impasse. Each will give you a piece of an encrypted key. You're looking for 15 of these, and the first nine come from Region Chests.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="The_Landing_Region_Chest_Locations">The Landing Region Chest Locations</h3><p dir="ltr"><strong>The Landing Chest 1</strong> - From the transmat zone, turn right and go up the stairs. Ahead is a cave and, beside that, a basin area where water is pooling and enemies are hanging out. If you look up, you'll see a building stuck into the wall with a round facade and a balcony-like space, too high to immediately reach. That's where you're headed.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4317387-destiny2thelandingclimbingtochest1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4317387" data-ratio="0.56338028169014" data-width="1917" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4317387-destiny2thelandingclimbingtochest1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4317387"></a><figcaption>Look for small ledges on this wall to climb up to the building above.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4317387-destiny2thelandingclimbingtochest1.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">To the left of the building, you should see some ledges jutting out from the woody wall, which you can reach from the high ground across the pool. It'll take some slightly careful jumping, but you'll be able to climb up to the round facade and find an opening there that will lead you to the chest.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4317388-thelandingchest1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4317388" data-ratio="0.56227201667535" data-width="1919" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4317388-thelandingchest1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4317388"></a><figcaption>You'll find the chest inside the building once you reach the right height.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4317388-thelandingchest1.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>The Landing Chest 2</strong> - From the transmat zone, head straight out across the open terrace ahead toward a hole in the cliff wall, next to the path that goes over the arched bridge to your left.

Enter the Cyst and continue until you reach a room with two round gazebo-like platforms joined by a staircase. You'll find more Hive Knights to kill here with your sword, as well as an Ogre. When you're in the clear, use the sword relic to and look for a small opening in the wall beneath the round platforms and the exit passage.

Early on, you'll find a room with stairs that spiral downward, in which you'll fight an Ogre. Head down to the bottom of the stairs to another round crystalline platform and look for a cavern opening in the wall near you.

Head to The Divide, entering from The Impasse so that you'll find yourself inside a version of the Wall from the Cosmodrome. Keep moving on the linear path until you find a golden chest that looks like the Region Chests you opened earlier. If you'll notice, despite its frozen and blue coloring now, this is the same spot in which you got your first gun when you started playing Destiny (or Destiny 2), in the original Cosmodrome mission when Ghost resurrects you for the first time.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4317392-20240605204322_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4317392" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4317392-20240605204322_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4317392"></a><figcaption>The chest is the easiest to reach when you start from The Impasse.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4317392-20240605204322_1.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">All 15 Encryption pieces should have given you a new item that lets you unlock this chest. The good news is that you now have Khvostov! The bad news is that it's the Legendary version of the gun, not the Exotic version. To earn that, you have a lot more stuff to do.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Step_4__Collect_All_8_Visions_Of_The_Traveler">Step 4: Collect All 8 Visions Of The Traveler</h2><p dir="ltr">Time for another item hunt. Hidden around the Pale Heart of the Traveler are collectible little Traveler objects--they look like white beach balls. They're all in slightly obscure locations, but you can get clues to find them if you head to the north end of the Tower in the Lost City. Go through the door there and follow the path until you reach a round room full of pedestals. Each of these includes a description of where to find a Vision of the Traveler--one for each area of the Pale Heart. You might also recognize this as the room where the Speaker for the Traveler used to hang out in the original Destiny, before the Red War.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4317432-20240607014208_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4317432" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4317432-20240607014208_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4317432"></a><figcaption>Once you have the eight Visions of the Traveler, a new golden chest will appear.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4317432-20240607014208_1.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Luckily, we have a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-visions-of-the-traveler-locations-in-destiny-2-the-final-shape/1100-6524029/" data-ref-id="1100-6524029">Visions of the Traveler guide</a> for finding each of the locations. Place each Vision on its corresponding pedestal in the Tower, and once you have all eight, a second golden chest will appear. You can't open it just yet, though: you lack something.</p><p dir="ltr">What you're looking for are Motes of Light--17 in all. You get one Mote for each Vision of the Traveler you find, for a total of eight. As for the rest, you've got one more big set of objectives to complete.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Step_5__Complete_Overthrows_In_Each_Pale_Heart_Location">Step 5: Complete Overthrows In Each Pale Heart Location</h2><p dir="ltr">There are nine more Motes of Light you need. Each one drops from a boss in Overthrow, the new patrol activity you can complete in the Pale Heart. To get them, you just need to run complete, four-stage Overthrows in each of the Pale Heart locations that feature them: The Landing, The Blooming, and The Impasse.</p><p dir="ltr">While these can take a while to complete, you don't have to do anything special to get through them, nor do you have to wait a particularly long time to get all those Motes. Each consecutive Overthrow you run in a location will rotate the boss, so you can do three Overthrows in a row in one location to get all three Motes for that spot. The bosses drop them, so look for them on the ground (they're purple diamonds).</p><p dir="ltr">Bungie has noted that if you get your final Mote from a particular boss in The Landing, it can bug the process, so do that set first, just to be safe.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Step_6__Open_The_Golden_Chest">Step 6: Open The Golden Chest</h2><p dir="ltr">With all the Motes in-hand, you'll get a new version that combines them into a single item. Return to the Tower in the Lost City and head to the room where you dropped the Visions of the Traveler. You should now be able to open the final golden chest, finally earning you the Exotic Khvostov 7G-0X.</p><p dir="ltr">Check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-the-final-shape-guides-hub/1100-6523936/" data-ref-id="1100-6523936">Final Shape guide hub</a> for even more coverage of the latest Destiny 2 expansion.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">After 10 years, BioWare is finally letting you kiss Lace Harding, the dwarven scout who acts as your initial eyes and ears whenever your character uncovers a new area in Dragon Age: Inquisition. Though you can flirt with her numerous times and establish a strong rapport with Harding, she is not a romantic option in Inquisition--she's not even an official companion. That all changes in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dragon-age-the-veilguard/" data-ref-id="5000-490222">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>--previously titled Dreadwolf--as Harding is not only one of the seven recruitable companions in the game, but she's a romance option, too.</p><p dir="ltr">Harding is, without a doubt, one of the best parts about Inquisition. Sarcastic and playful, she's willing to trade a few verbal barbs with the Inquisitor if the two establish a bond, and she's a bright and shining spot even during Inquisition's darkest moments, sticking with you and the Inquisition no matter where you choose to go. Fans have been pining for the cute dwarf ever since Inquisition launched in 2014, and I've often wished she could have had a larger part to play in Dragon Age's story. So I was pleasantly surprised to learn that she'll be a major player in the fourth Dragon Age game.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Dragon Age: The Veilguard | Official 20 Minute Gameplay Reveal</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">At Summer Game Fest, I got to see the opening hour of The Veilguard played by game director Corrine Busche, who answered many of my questions about the upcoming RPG, including how romance would play a part in it. Unlike previous Dragon Age games, which included romantic partners of various sexualities and ancestral preferences, all of the companions in The Veilguard are bisexual and don't seem to have any racial preferences--you can smooch them regardless of who your character, Rook, is--so long as you raise your relationship status high enough.</p><p dir="ltr">Busche made sure to clarify that The Veilguard's companions have been written to be bisexual, not player-sexual. The romantic options don't reshape themselves to satisfy the player character's gender and sexuality. Instead, they have their own hopes, dreams, and desires informed by who they are, and if they can't find what they want with the main character, they'll find it elsewhere. For example, Busche warned me that if my Rook didn't go for Harding (as if, right?), she might find solace with one of the game's other companions in particular, akin to how Garrus and Tali explore their attraction to one another and end up together in Mass Effect 3 if Shepard does not romance either of them as, regardless of who Shepard is, both Garrus and Tali are straight.</p><p dir="ltr">The Veilguard seems to put a lot more emphasis on building relationships with your companions than in previous Dragon Age games. Though your companions will unlock their core abilities over time, the only way to earn special upgrades to these skills is to develop their relationship with Rook. I didn't get to see these upgrades in action during the preview, but I did see how The Veilguard's first two companions--Harding and Neve--perform in a fight. Harding fits the role of a long-range sniper, a rogue initially armed with a bow and arrow, while Neve is a detective and mage who specializes in close-range cold magic.</p><p dir="ltr">According to Busche, you'll meet and recruit every companion by the end of the first act, which should take players about nine to 10 hours--that's a tinge faster than the 15 or so hour recruitment time in Inquisition, which makes sense given The Veilguard only has seven companions and Inquisition has nine.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4317490-da_ea_bellara_05_3840x2160_rgb_wm.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4317490" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4317490-da_ea_bellara_05_3840x2160_rgb_wm.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4317490"></a><figcaption>Players will recruit seven companions in Dragon Age: The Veilguard, including Bellara, shown here.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4317490-da_ea_bellara_05_3840x2160_rgb_wm.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"Faster" seems to be the name of the game for The Veilguard, which looks to do for Dragon Age what Andromeda did for Mass Effect. Your perspective as a player has tightened even further--especially once combat kicks off--shifting to a view more akin to an over-the-shoulder shooter. As spells fly and swords clash, combat seems to pull you into the thick of battle where you must deftly dodge out of the way of an enemy's telegraphed wind-up to land a well-timed combo of your own. Whether you choose to go the way of the warrior, rogue, or mage, you have an assortment of speedy attacks, explosive heavy-hitting abilities, long-range shield breakers, and quick dodges.</p><p dir="ltr">In the opening hour, each battle wrapped up in a matter of moments, and even though Busche pointed out that a tactical menu exists to pause the action and direct Rook's allies, it didn't really look like that was even needed, almost like the feature existed as more of a reminder of what Dragon Age used to be, not what it is now. Real-time combat is not new for Dragon Age, but this is the first time I've seen a game in the series seem to lack much in the way of tactics. For combat at least, The Veilguard appears to lean more toward the action half of action-RPG.</p><p dir="ltr">Combat isn't the only thing that's different this time around. The Veilguard takes you to Tevinter, a never-before-seen location in Thedas. Unlike the more fantastical locations the franchise has visited so far, Tevinter has more of an arcanepunk vibe, incorporating themes of industrialization. My first look at Tevinter reminded me of Dungeons &amp; Dragons' Eberron, where magic is common enough to be used by everyday people, not just powerful spellcasters. Neon billboards illuminated paved city streets and dark alleys like the backdrop of a noir detective story, and arcane runes powered the city like a faux-electricity. Even though The Veilguard takes place just after Inquisition, it feels like we've been thrown forward a full century to a more modern era.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4317491-da_ea_standard%5Bmage%5D_09_5760x3244_rgb_wm.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4317491" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2880" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4317491-da_ea_standard%5Bmage%5D_09_5760x3244_rgb_wm.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4317491"></a><figcaption>Like in past BioWare games, choosing which allies to bring on missions can be about tactics or relationships--or both.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4317491-da_ea_standard%5Bmage%5D_09_5760x3244_rgb_wm.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The game picks up in Tevinter at what feels like the end of another adventure, as Rook--with the help of Varric--are on the tail of Solus, working to prevent him from fully destroying the Veil, an act that would surely destroy all life across Thedas. Harding joins their troupe and aids Rook and Varric in meeting with Neve, a detective also on Solus's trail and the trio eventually catches up to the fallen elven god in the midst of a ritual that is tearing the Veil apart.</p><p dir="ltr">The mission showcases plenty of Dragon Age staples (combat, choice-driven dialogue, companion approval) while also revealing what 10 years away have done for the series' visuals. Inquisition isn't an ugly game by any means, but The Veilguard is a cut above its predecessor with special care to particle effects and character animations. It looks like a damn pretty game, and I can't wait to get lost in it with my favorite forward scout at my side.</p><p dir="ltr">Dragon Age: The Veilguard is set to launch for Xbox Series X|S, PS5, and PC this fall.</p>

He stressed that while Nintendo will begin sharing details on the console’s successor in the next nine months, nothing about a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-nintendo-console-tech-release-date-1851200648&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-nintendo-console-tech-release-date-1851200648">rumored Switch 2 </a></span>would be revealed during the upcoming livestream.</p><p>It now seems like the Nintendo Direct is probably targeting a June 18 stream. That’s according to a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1dczvpj/among_us_update_set_for_june_18th_accidentally/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1dczvpj/among_us_update_set_for_june_18th_accidentally/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube video for an upcoming update</a></span> to multiplayer murder sim <em>Among Us </em>that was seemingly accidentally uploaded and published ahead of schedule before being taken down again. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWpFSNUTC-Y&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWpFSNUTC-Y" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Copies of the video</a></span>, which debuts new roles for the the popular pandemic-era party game, are still available and the contents <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://gonintendo.com/contents/36449-among-us-update-set-for-june-18th-2024&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://gonintendo.com/contents/36449-among-us-update-set-for-june-18th-2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">were reported on by GoNintendo</a></span>. </p><p>While it’s always possible that the video is for a standalone announcement, Innersloth has previously revealed updates in Nintendo Directs, and the words “available now” make it sound like a shadow-drop that would go live when the showcase airs. While companies’ plans can always change, the fact that we’re still waiting on the Direct and the month is almost over makes June 18, or later that same week, feel like the closest thing to a sure bet. </p><p>Nintendo’s 2024 schedule for the Switch is wide open following the launch of <em>Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD</em> on June 27. With the console likely to be sunset beginning next year, this will (hopefully) be the last victory lap for it before the Switch 2 is revealed after reported delays. We still haven’t gotten an update on <em>Metroid Prime 4</em>, announced at the beginning of the Switch’s life cycle, and with Microsoft going more multiplatform, Square Enix looking to port its past exclusives, and Sony bringing <em>Lego Horizon Adventure</em> to the handheld hybrid, there’s plenty of stuff that could get announced. </p><p>Maybe we’ll even get a new <em>Pokémon</em> game this fall. While <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em> has already been announced for 2025, it would be great to get a rumored remake of <em>Pokémon Black </em>and <em>White </em>in the meantime. Who knows, maybe we’ll even get an expansion for <em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</em>. I’ve already collected ever Wonder seed in the game and am desperate for more levels. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p data-characters="278" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/dark-and-darker-mobile-release-window-platforms-trailer-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dark and Darker Mobile</a></em> takes the experience of the incredibly popular PC game and pulls it into an experience that plays well and looks great on your smartphone. Ahead of its release, Krafton has announced that it’s getting a beta later this year for all fans to try out. </p> <p data-characters="445" data-current-count="445" data-injectable="true">The beta for <em>Dark and Darker Mobile</em> is slated for <strong>August 2024</strong>, giving you plenty of time to prepare for how scary these dungeons will be before you sign up and start playing. At the time of writing, there’s no official sign-up page or final date for the beta. However, the date and sign-ups will likely open soon as we enter summer, and Krafton will prepare the game to receive every fan who is excited about dungeon delving and betrayal. </p>
 <h2 id="h-get-ready-for-deceitful-dungeon-action-in-dark-and-darker-mobile-s-beta" data-injectable="false">Get ready for deceitful dungeon action in <em>Dark and Darker Mobile</em>‘s beta</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="1st Gameplay Reveal Trailer | #DarkandDarkerMobile" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bhy3serUVP0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="416" data-current-count="716" data-injectable="true">Krafton held an initial open beta in Korea in April of this year, which was a massive success. The cap of 50,000 applicants was quickly exceeded, but everyone who got in seems to have thoroughly enjoyed the dynamic gameplay that emerged. The best part about it is how you can forge fake alliances and use enemies to deal with the players you cheat. That’s where I’m going to have a lot of fun in August. </p>
 <p data-characters="285" data-current-count="285" data-injectable="false"><em>Dark and Darker Mobile</em> is very similar to the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/dark-and-darker-releasing-in-early-access-today/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC game of the same name</a>. It’s a grim, low fantasy game where you explore dungeons alone or alongside other players. Every dungeon is packed with enemies for you to kill and loot to claim, but the real danger is much closer to home. </p> <p data-characters="492" data-current-count="777" data-injectable="true">You see, other players can turn around at any point to stab you in the back and take your share of the loot if they fancy it. The game is all about building trust with others. But if you can’t achieve that, you need to be prepared to take them down at a moment’s notice. After reaching each chest, you can choose to go deeper or make a break for the exit. That risk vs reward system is so tempting that it’s hard to say no, so most players end up overstretching themselves. </p>
 <p data-characters="297" data-current-count="297" data-injectable="false">While <em>Dark and Darker Mobile </em>has a visual downgrade compared to the PC version, the gameplay appears to run extremely well. You’ll have no trouble exploring the darkest dungeons and choosing to go for just one more chest while you feel the breath of your allies getting closer to your neck. </p>

The tabletop company has made a reputation for crafting bespoke artisanal board game accessories.

Their Diceapalooza Kickstarter campaign continues that trend with high-quality dice.</p>

<p>According to its campaign page, the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/wyrmwood/dice-a-palooza/description" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Diceapalooza Kickstarter</a> is a crowdfunding campaign dedicated to producing signature dice and dice accessories.</p>
<p>The selection of dice is robust. There are resin dice with names like <em>Ancient Bronze</em>, <em>Chill Out</em>, <em>Rainbow Road</em>, <em>Oops, All Pink</em>. and <em>Fire Glass</em>. For those that appreciate more heft, there are gemstone dice ranging from Cats Eye to Amethyst to Black Obsidian.</p>

This heirloom-quality seven-dice set is made of recycled bronze, perfectly balanced in mass and weight, and chimes when rolled. There are even more luxurious options for metal dice, including gold.</p>
<p>As for their wooden dice accessories, the options are also suitably crafted. These include magnetic and collapsible dice towers, leather-lined personal trays, and foam-lined display vaults with swappable components. You even have your choice of wood from Eastern Elm to Cherry to Black Poisonwood.</p>
<p>Depending on your choice of materials, the prices of the products in the Diceapalooza Kickstarter can vary wildly. For example, an Eastern Elm dice tray is sold at $35 compared to a Black Poisonwood dice tray at $60. This is all excluding shipping fees.</p>
<p>The different pledge tiers for the Diceapalooza Kickstarter are as follows:</p>
<ul><li><strong>General Admission for $5</strong>: Get an exclusive ticket pin</li>
<li><strong>Floor Seats for $50</strong>: Your choice of any resin dice set and an exclusive pin</li>
<li><strong>Front Row for $85</strong>: Your choice of any gemstone dice set and exclusive pin</li>
<li><strong>VIP for $100</strong>: A prismatic glass dice set and exclusive pin</li>
<li><strong>Platinum VIP for $250</strong>: A set of metal Ember Forge dice and exclusive pin</li>
</ul><p>If you back any of these tiers you can add other items shown in the campaign to your pledge after the campaign has concluded. The only exception to this rule is the Ember Forge dice set, which requires a Platinum VIP pledge.</p>
<p>At time of writing, the Diceapalooza Kickstarter campaign has raised <span><span>$161,204, more than sixteen times its initial funding goal of $10,000. The campaign concludes July 11.</span></span></p>

<p data-characters="292" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Developer Systemic Reaction has announced the next update for its open world survival game that’s packed with advanced robots out for your blood. The <em>Skyfire Update</em> for <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-generation-zero/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Generation Zero</a></em> brings a lot to the table, extending the game even for players who have hit endgame and find it easy.</p> <p data-characters="375" data-current-count="375" data-injectable="false"><em>Generation Zero’s Skyfire Update</em> will be released on J<strong>une 25, 2024</strong> for all platforms. It brings many new elements to the open world stealth action that players can immerse themselves in. This includes a brand new endgame enemy machine to fight toe-to-toe with, new companion armor kits, more weapons, and an update to various mechanics like the Tyrant spawning system. </p> <h2 id="h-learn-to-master-the-machines-again-when-the-skyfire-update-drops-for-generation-zero" data-injectable="false">Learn to master the machines again when the <em>Skyfire Update</em> drops for <em>Generation Zero</em></h2> <figure data-current-count="675" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="Generation Zero Skyfire Update Trailer" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a1oI6HbFK1s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="343" data-current-count="343" data-injectable="false">The new enemy type you’ll be battling in the <em>Skyfire Update</em> for <em>Generation Zero</em> is the Vulture. It’s a new Tyrant class enemy that’s evolved from the Firebird enemy type. These things look like they could cause problems for a group, so you need to go in with your top-tier equipment and weapons if you want to take them out. </p> <p data-characters="328" data-current-count="671" data-injectable="true">A new piece of equipment you can get hold of is Companion Armor Kits. Throw one of these at your companions, and it’ll repair their armor on the fly. If your companion’s armor is depleted, you can actually re-kit them with this, too, making it much easier to go out on long runs and survive longer in tough battles. </p>
 <p data-characters="279" data-current-count="279" data-injectable="false">The update adds a new weapon to <em>Generation Zero</em>, the Meusser Hunting Rifle. It fires off a chemical laser beam that can set the ground around you on fire. It’s also got a bunch of new weapon augmentations, but you’ll need to kill some Tyrant enemies to pick them up. </p> <p data-characters="256" data-current-count="535" data-injectable="true">Lastly, this update adds new Tyrant locations to discover after killing rival machines, gathering the required coordinates, and entering those into Tyrant Terminals in bases. Fixes to machine detention are also coming alongside updated Tyrant progression. </p>
 <p data-characters="289" data-current-count="289" data-injectable="false"><em>Generation Zero</em> has grown over the years to offer the best stealth survival experience that pits you against an island filled with hostile machines. The tension you feel playing solo is second to none, and going in with others still feels like you’re facing an insurmountable enemy. </p> <p data-characters="325" data-current-count="614" data-injectable="false">This update sounds like it will only improve the endgame and offer something new to grind for after pouring dozens of hours into it. Those rewards feel great to earn because you build up a great collection of tools to head out and test out on machines. I can’t wait to set the ground on fire and watch my enemies burn. </p>

I <a href="https://kotaku.com/bethesda-announces-elder-scrolls-vi-1826718022" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blogged about it</a> at the time. Let’s go through my post line by line and see if my predictions came true:</p><p>“It was just a brief teaser that showed a large landscape, and Todd Howard implied it’ll be coming after single-player sci-fi RPG <em>Starfield</em>, which he announced seconds beforehand.”</p><p><em>Starfield </em>is out! <em>The Elder Scrolls VI</em> is not, though it is apparently out of pre-production and in “early development” <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/the-elder-scrolls-6-is-out-of-pre-production-but-pete-hines-says-it-will-be-years-before-we-start-hearing-about-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as of last year</a>. Recent comments on the teaser trailer, which has been viewed over 18 million times, celebrate its six-year anniversary. Sort of. “This is like releasing a teaser for <em>Morrowind </em>in 1985,” reads one.</p><p>Assuming <em>The Elder Scrolls VI</em> comes out during my lifetime, I’m gonna say I was technically correct here.</p><p>“If I had to guess, <em>Elder Scrolls VI </em>will almost certainly be on the next generation of consoles. So you know, get excited about that – and then stow that excitement away like a squirrel hiding acorns in a tree trunk, preparing for a long, cold, <em>Elder-Scrolls</em>-less winter.”</p><p>Past Nathan really loved tortured metaphors, but that’s beside the point. One could read this portion of my old blog and come away thinking I completely missed the mark. After all, what are the odds that <em>The Elder Scrolls VI </em>comes out on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S? Seems highly unlikely, given that the now-current console generation has been around for several years, and I sincerely doubt we’ll see Bethesda’s next fantasy opus until <em>at least</em> 2026 – probably later.</p><p>But consider: Which “next” generation of consoles was I referring to? Gave myself a pretty easy out here, and I’m gonna take it. Once again, technically correct.</p><p>“Or, you know, just play <em>Elder Scrolls: Blades</em> to tide yourself over.”</p><p>Damn, I completely forgot that <em>The Elder Scrolls: Blades</em> existed.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>One of the most anticipated games of 2024, Star Wars Outlaws, was <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-gameplay-ubisoft-forward/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">featured</a> prominently during yesterday's Ubisoft Forward event. Fans got an extended new look at protagonist Kay Vess in action.</p>
<p>Today, we've got an exclusive interview straight from Summer Game Fest 2024 with Ubisoft Massive's Navid Khavari (narrative director) and Mathias Karlson (game director alongside Julian Gerighty), who shared some juicy new details about Star Wars Outlaws.</p>
<p>As a reminder, the game is slated to launch on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X on August 30. You can read all about the various editions in <a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/star-wars-outlaws-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-first-open-world-game-in-the-far-far-away-galaxy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our roundup article</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Star Wars Outlaws: Official Gameplay Showcase | Ubisoft Forward" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QP_wXv2ErgI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>When did your team first get the idea for an open world action adventure Star Wars game themed around the Underworld?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mathias Karlson:</strong> Good question. I think what we can say is that we started our conversations with the team at Lucasfilm Games sometime in 2021. I think it's a game that felt so natural. It was in us, like as kids growing up with this trinity, specifically that era we're in between Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi.</p>
<p>And getting even the notion that we might be making a game in Star Wars, and then finally ending up with Lucasfilm themselves saying, you know what? With a scoundrel game in the underworld, we think you fit in right in between these two movies. It was just a really cool day.</p>
<p><strong>Navid</strong> <strong>Khavari:</strong> I think there's also an expertise within Ubisoft Massive in terms of the open-world gameplay, design, and world-building that you've seen in previous games, so it was just a natural fit. We always talked about the idea of stepping into Star Wars. That's something we've always wanted to do, and we're looking to realize that.</p>
<p><strong>What was it like developing a game of this caliber right under the pandemic for the first year and a half or so?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mathias</strong> <strong>Karlson:</strong> I mean, it was, of course, new to everyone. I think we quickly adapted. I think any endeavor if you're armed with a really, really clear idea of what you want to achieve, and you have a great team, and in our case also fantastic collaborators in Lucasfilm Games, and we were all, from day one, just pulling in the same direction. We quickly got into a new groove and just kept going.</p>
<p><strong>Now, Kay Vess certainly looks great. However, some Star Wars fans are a bit disappointed as they would have liked an alien protagonist for once. Was that ever a consideration before settling on Kay?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Navid</strong> <strong>Khavari:</strong> No, I don't think so. We knew very early on that we wanted to set ourselves within a scoundrel and truly Kay, and I should say Kay and Nyx, kind of organically came from that. Their dynamic duo, with Kay being a scoundrel from Canto Bight growing up on the streets as a thief and then having this companion, Nyx, who is a brand new species, a brand new creature that is a meal with sort of a mysterious history. It came about really, really organically.</p>
<p><strong>Can fans expect to see characters from other Star Wars, such as games, movies, and TV shows, appearing in Star Wars Outlaws?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Navid Khavari</strong>: Yeah, definitely. I think you'll have to wait a little bit, until August 30 (the launch date), to see them all. But you've seen Jabba, you've seen Kira, which was just an unbelievable thing to be able to have in our game. And we recently announced Lando. He's very fun to play Sabacc with. So, I think there's a lot of fun stuff coming in that regard. Honestly, I think if I got into the Easter eggs, your 15-minute interview would be over, so we shall leave some secrets for the launch.</p>
<p><strong>As a quick follow-up, is the expanded universe off-limits for Star Wars Outlaws?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Navid</strong> <strong>Khavari:</strong> I think I'm not going to answer that one. Sorry!</p>
<p><strong>Can you guys discuss Toshara, the new planet you've created in collaboration with Lucasfilm?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mathias Karlson:</strong> Sure. We were going to make a new planet, right? That's pretty cool. Of course, your mind starts racing, and we ended up with something that's very inspired by the savannas of Africa. We even had a part of the team going down there for a research trip. I think something that we found really inspiring was to couple that with something that's very Star Wars inspired just to have a very distinct vibe.</p>
<p>There's a very clear profile. All of Tatooine is desert, and Toshara is windswept on top of this savannah. And the combination of these almost amber-like mountainous structures and the wind that's just been eroding this place for many, many, many years felt very distinct. It felt like something you've never seen before. Definitely not in Star Wars. And then, of course, it's filled with new lore.</p>
<p><strong>Navid Khavari:</strong> We were really excited about this idea of a planet in the Outer Rim that the underworld sort of finds as a nexus, right? When Kay arrives on Toshara, what was really fun is that her as a rookie having to navigate the Underworld within it is, I think, going to be incredibly satisfying.</p>
<p>There is a whole range of characters that you're going to meet, but also just the feeling of zipping around on your speeder on the Tosharan savannah. Nothing really beats it. Lucasfilm really was very generous. I think they put a lot of trust in us to try and bring something new and interesting to the table. When you get on Toshara, the first stop is usually the cantina. You get to meet the locals and understand the dynamics of the characters there. I think it really fits into the underworld fantasy.</p>
<p><strong>Will players be able to see the aftermath of the Battle of Hoth firsthand?</strong></p>
<p>No comment on that one!</p>
<p><strong>Okay. I had to try! Can you tell me how many planets players can visit in Star Wars Outlaws?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Navid Khavari:</strong> Absolutely, yeah. We have five planets in Star Wars Outlaws. We have Canto Bight, which you might recognize from The Last Jedi. Toshara, which is our brand new planet - or sorry, brand new moon I should say - in the Outer Rim. And then, of course, we have Kijimi, the snow-swept planet that you might recognize from Rise of Skywalker. That is particularly exciting because it's ruled by a new syndicate we're bringing to the table called the Ashita Clan, which is this Melitto species with a hive-like hierarchical structure of control.</p>
<p>Then we have Akiva, which fans of Star Wars will know was featured in the book. It's the first time we're gonna actually be able to see and explore this jungle planet. And then, of course, there's Tatooine, which was just incredibly exciting to bring to life.</p>
<p><strong>Mathias</strong> <strong>Karlson:</strong> I think something we're very proud of in this game is being able to offer all of these different locations so seamlessly stitched together in what truly feels like one big slice of the galaxy. Being able to go to your speeder and drive it into your ship, literally take off and hyper-drive wherever you want at your own fingertips and land and then drive out again. I think people will really, really like it.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'The open world is sizable. It's definitely truly open world with a contiguous feeling to it. You can blast your speeder for minutes.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>How large of an open world should players expect when landing on the planets?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mathias</strong> <strong>Karlson:</strong> It's sizable. It's different from planet to planet. It hasn't been an exercise for us that's metrics driven in the sense that we're going for size as a primary motivator when thinking about, okay, how do we bring this planet to life? It will vary. It's definitely truly open world with a contiguous feeling to it. You can blast your speeder for minutes. But at the end of the day, it is about being truthful to the source. Or in our case, also some new stuff. And to fit it with things that are interesting. If there's something on the horizon that piques your interest, you can actually drive over there and have a look and you will stumble into some adventure.</p>
<p><strong>In addition to the speeder, will it be possible for Kay to ride animals as well?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mathias</strong> <strong>Karlson: </strong>We'll have to wait and see, but the speeder is her primary travel method—her steel horse, if you will.</p>
<p><strong> I want to kind of shift gears over to the Wanted and reputation systems. If your reputation with a certain faction drops too low, is there still a way to repair that relationship and avoid, you know, being shot on-site by their operatives?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mathias</strong> <strong>Karlson: </strong>100%. So, really central to our philosophy around the reputation system is that Kay is not a character that is about allying with a cause or allegiance and things like this. It's a very free-spirited person who is seeking ultimate freedom for her life. But for you as a player, this very naturally translates into the fact that you're the one navigating this world.</p>
<p>It's about, you know, rolling with the punches and really playing the underworld. You will have means to get back, and at the end of the day, I think you'll come to find that it's more about what you're after than what they can get out of you. You're gonna grow increasingly into the driver's seat, so to say, and how to interact with it.</p>
<p><strong>Navid</strong> <strong>Khavari:</strong> Yeah, exactly, and I think that's very true to Star Wars as well, you know. I like to say that Han, even by Empire, always believed that he could actually pay off his debt to Jabba. And I think it's the same with Kay, right? If you're useful at the right time, you can turn the tide of opinion of someone like Jabba or Kira.</p>
<p><strong>Makes sense. In one of the three demos I played today I did experience that you can essentially pay off a corrupt empire official and reduce Kay's wanted level. Can she also take contracts directly from empire officials?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mathias</strong> <strong>Karlson:</strong> Mhm.....Can't share. But I think we can share that contracts are one very player-agency-centric part of the game where you have the opportunity to say, okay, I'm on the low side with this syndicate right now. I want to push it up. Or if you really want to enjoy the fruits of being in an excellent reputation end the scale, taking jobs and contracts for the different syndicates is something you can do.</p>
<p><strong>Looking at the Trailblazer ship, can Kay Vess customize it aesthetically and/or functionally in any way?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mathias Karlson:</strong> So, in general, progressing and evolving and growing is really I think central to both the narrative and the game itself. Upgrading your abilities with Nyx. Him being able to do even more things for you. Your blaster, your speeder, your ship, you saw that Kay was maybe putting on a different jacket when you played in Kijimi.</p>
<p>That is a very player-centric choice, and these different gear pieces and clothing pieces also have gameplay effects on them. So, there's a lot to look forward to when it comes to both visual and gameplay customization.</p>
<p><strong>Okay, so does that include customizing the ship as well, then?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mathias Karlson: </strong>Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Alright. What percentage of the game will be comprised of space exploration&nbsp;or combat?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mathias Karlson: </strong>That's really up to you at the end of the day. When we think of Star Wars Outlaws as an open-world experience, space is just a natural part of the Star Wars world as a planet's surface.</p>
<p>So you are at all times free to take off into space and explore that region, jump wherever you want on and around the planets in our game. Both the story, the main campaign, which is the thrust through this game, and the contracts, etc. will also take you to space if you don't go there just on your own accord.</p>
<p><strong>Navid Khavari:</strong> Yeah, and we've described it as the story is kind of an engine. Kay's journey is an engine of pursuit through the different planets and the regions, but there's nothing stopping you from, you know, taking on the contract in space or taking on the dogfight, so I think as Mathias said, it's really how much time do you want to spend in space.</p>
<p><strong>Can you revisit planets whenever you want?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. At the end of the day, there's a lot of freedom in the hands of you as a player in that you can revisit or play these planets in the order you like.</p>
<p><strong>What sort of game length are you targeting for Star Wars Outlaws?</strong></p>
<p>It's a full-bodied single-player action-adventure experience that is very scalable with how much time you invest into exploring the world that we prepared for you. So, I'd say it at least doubles the duration of playing just the campaign part if you engage with everything else.</p>
<p><strong>How much time can you spend with Sabacc?</strong></p>
<p>As much as you ask for. And I will tell you I've spent hours playing Sabacc just on its own and it was a blast. The team's done an excellent job of creating it.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you two so very much for your time.</strong></p>

The dwarf is a fan favorite for his cheeky banter, the stories he tells, and his devotion to Bianca, his crossbow he’s been carrying with him in every appearance since 2011. He’s got a personal relationship with Solas, the <em>Inquisition</em> party member who’s revealed to be a major antagonist at the end of that game. He wants to stop the elven mage’s world-ending plan and he hopes to do it by talking things out. But as Solas refuses to listen, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-dreadwolf-teaser-trailer-xbox-1851528812&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-dreadwolf-teaser-trailer-xbox-1851528812">Varric</a></span> draws his crossbow…only for Solas to destroy it with a spell. Fans are not okay. The moment is around the 16:45 mark:<br></p><p>Scroll down to the comments on YouTube and you’ll find plenty of fans with a renewed drive to stop Solas’ plans, not just because they threaten the lives of everyone who isn’t an elf, but because Bianca’s destruction must be avenged.</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>“Mofo really betrayed me, stole my gear, took my hand, and now he’s killed Bianca?!!” writes @npc6254.</p><p>“Bold of them to put such an important character death in a teaser.

But Bianca, and Varric’s reverence for the weapon, have been a key part of the dwarf’s story over the years. <em>Inquisition </em>reveals the bow’s namesake and it’s a big moment for a character who tends to shroud his own history with a smokescreen of storytelling. He also doesn’t use other bows despite technically being an archer, and the only way to make him more powerful in that role is to find upgrades for Bianca in <em>Inquisition</em>. For <em>Dragon Age </em>fans, this is like if Cloud’s Buster Sword got snapped in half in the next <em>Final Fantasy VII</em> <em>Remake</em> game.</p><p>Will Bianca be salvaged? Is Varric going to be okay without his trusty weapon? What is Solas going to do now that Rook dropped a statue on him?

It's a new Dragon Age that continues the series' trend of offering an escalating sense of high-fantasy political and social intrigue, yet still seeks to highlight BioWare's long-standing strengths when it comes to having a cast of compelling characters and deciding their fate. The game has been unveiled after </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/bioware-lays-off-50-staff-as-part-of-long-term-reorganization">layoffs at the studio</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and years of challenging—but seemingly not impossible—directional shifts.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">At Summer Game Fest 2024, we saw an extended demo of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Veilguard</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s prologue, with commentary from creative director John Epler explaining BioWare's big focus on companion characters—a quiet return to the studio’s design roots.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="BioWare's high-fantasy comeback">BioWare's high-fantasy comeback</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Set after the events of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dragon Age: Inquisition</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the next game sees the world of Thedas facing a new threat posed by Solas, a former ally now turned villain. Seeking to destroy the barrier between the ethereal Veil and the mortal realm to restore his people, Solas unleashes otherworldly forces. A new hero, referred to as Rook, teams with returning heroes Varric and Harding to form a new party to face these threats – which inevitably unearth a greater foe that seeks to destroy all life in the world.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to Epler, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Veilguard</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in particular, focuses on the themes of choice and consequence, and that a world at its bleakest is still worth saving. Like other games in the series, it features a fully customizable protagonist with different backstories and cultural backgrounds (human, dwarf, elf, and qunari), giving a more comprehensive range of options to make the protagonist feel like a natural part of the world that's been plucked out of obscurity to become a hero.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This follows in BioWare’s tradition of making Dragon Age protagonists more of a blank slate for the player—an ambitious challenge given how much game content has to evolve around the player’s long string of choices – which are reflected in the BioWare standard dialogue wheel.</span></p><p>Image via BioWare/EA.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The strong cast of supporting characters in a BioWare game has been a staple for the developer. Epler stated that the developers were keen to lean into that with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Veilguard</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which he says has the most developed companions and related storylines from any BioWare game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I've been on every Dragon Age game previously, and I think the biggest thing that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> brings to the larger series experience is an even heavier and more deliberate focus on the companions," said Epler. "We've been saying that it's the most deliberately crafted companion experience we've ever done – each character is integral for you to save the world, and they each bring something to the table. These characters are important, and each will have their mission to see and learn more about them."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="BioWare’s getting back to hand-crafted game content">BioWare’s getting back to hand-crafted game content</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The extended demo's dramatic and action-focused opening offered a clear view of what kind of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dragon Age </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">game </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Veilguard</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> will be, which sticks with the familiar mainstays of an ensemble BioWare RPG. However, the upcoming game also has a more stylized aesthetic and snappier gameplay compared to the more gritty and tactical pace of the original game and its sequels. It's an action-focused RPG, with the combat itself having a similar flow and pace to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Witcher</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> games. However, Dragon Age's familiar tactical pause also makes a return, allowing players to carefully choose skills at your leisure.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Interestingly, while </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Veilguard</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> has a sharper narrative focus on the companions, combat still sticks solely to the protagonist, a contrast from the game’s earlier entries, which afforded the player more cross-party control. However, the game empowers players by allowing them to send commands to allies, strategically coordinating with the protagonist. This feature, reminiscent of Mass Effect's tactical commands, reminds players that these are separate characters with their own agency.</span></p><p>Image via BioWare/EA.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">During one critical moment in the prologue, Rook had to choose which party member to accompany them in a plan to thwart Solas' spell while leaving one party member behind to hold off incoming monsters. It’s a decision that will shape how each party member views Rook in the adventure ahead.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Epler said that as with previous BioWare games, companions will also have a set of unique quests tied to their individual stories, which will branch out throughout the game. How you build your party and what choices players make will define the type of adventure Rook and his party will have, which Epler stated are all bespoke events outside of the critical path.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"One of the big things we wanted to do with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Veilguard</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is to have the entire game feel like a crafted and authored experience," said Epler in a post-presentation follow-up. "While the game does have a lot of content that's not part of the critical path, and the various side-missions, all of that is hand-crafted by the team."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This again alludes to a return to form for BioWare, which experimented with fewer hand-crafted set pieces in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Anthem</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Mass Effect: Andromeda</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. If it’s successful here, it’s an unfortunate rebuke of the studio’s directional shifts for its previous two games.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> looks more like a stylized grand adventure for the series that bolsters its cast of heroes, though we didn't quite get a look at how many of these choices will come into play when your party begins to explore Thedas during a chaotic period.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It has been interesting to see where BioWare is as a developer currently, and it's no secret that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> has had trouble with development as various staff turnovers have extended dev time. That said, the upcoming game has intriguing flourishes and a tone that could be a nice pivot for the series.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With recent successes from other fantasy RPGs like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Baldur's Gate 3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> showing that building up a great cast and seeing them evolve with one another has a lot of value to a role-playing game, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Veilguard</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> looks to be doing the smart thing by focusing on what BioWare has traditionally done best, and that's put its cast of characters in the spotlight.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It was interesting to see a far more stylized adventure-like tone for</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">Dragon Age, which began its life as a dour, proper noun-laden adventure.

<p data-characters="369" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">With the reveal of the upcoming summer update, Sakurajima, <em>Palworld </em>is once again in the spotlight. The reveal came at this year’s Summer Game Fest, and<em> Palworld’s </em>community manager, Bucky, detailed his experience at the event on Twitter. While mostly positive, Bucky noted a few encounters painted <em>Palworld </em>as “the boogeyman” for some people. </p> <p data-characters="313" data-current-count="313" data-injectable="false">In his post, Bucky opened with his better experiences at the show, then acknowledged the team is “more than aware of all the Palworld discourse” since its launch earlier this year. According to Bucky, claims that<em> Palworld</em> was made with AI, stolen assets, and is the target of a lawsuit are all false. </p> <p data-characters="324" data-current-count="637" data-injectable="true">Bucky has always been pretty outspoken when it comes to negativity aimed at <em>Palworld</em>. Back in February, he again posted on <a href="https://x.com/Bucky_cm/status/1757796446739558795" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter</a> to touch on the ‘dying’ game discourse, saying that it’s ‘<a href="https://www.destructoid.com/palworlds-community-manager-says-its-fine-to-take-breaks-amid-negative-player-count-discourse/">okay to take breaks</a>’. This time, he’s aired his feelings over what he says were a minority of Summer Game Fest encounters. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Summer Game Fest comes to a close and the long flight back to Tokyo begins…lots to process but overall it was an incredible weekend. Long post incoming:</p><p>1: Meeting other devs and industry folk was so much fun. Whereas GDC was very much about the business of games, SGF felt more…</p></div>— Bucky | Palworld ✈️ Summer Game Fest (@Bucky_cm) <a href="https://twitter.com/Bucky_cm/status/1800269900545478921?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 10, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure> <p data-characters="380" data-current-count="680" data-injectable="true">For most of the post, Bucky has nothing but nice things to say about his experience at the convention, from meeting other devs and fans to meeting some of his own personal heroes. He seems to have had a good time, explaining that it was “great to share stories and advice with others in the industry”’ as they sometimes feel ‘”a bit isolated in Japan.”</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Pocketpair</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="308" data-current-count="608" data-injectable="false">Bucky goes on to promise that <em>Palworld </em>will continue to get bigger and bigger, and the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/palworld-adds-a-new-island-pals-and-more-in-just-a-few-weeks/">Sakurajima update</a> that’s coming on June 27 is part of that plan. The update will add new Pals, Raids, and Bosses to challenge. We’ll see that accompanied by new areas to explore and expanded building options, too.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/tabletop-games/24176237/archon-studios-prismacast-polish-space-magic<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="FRhJKf">There’s a new brand of pre-painted tabletop gaming terrain on the market, and no one that I’ve talked to seems to know how it’s being made. Best I can figure, it’s Polish space magic.</p>
<p id="BQXK7i">In February this year Archon Studio (<a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/2/25/21147787/wolfenstein-board-game-announcement-miniatures"><em>Wolfenstein The Board Game</em></a>, <em>Masters of the Universe: Battleground</em>) announced <a href="https://archon-studio.com/blog/prismacast-a-revelation-in-rpg-terrain-market">PrismaCast</a>, its new line of pre-painted tabletop terrain. But the pitch — that these bits would come out of the box, on a plastic sprue, but with “detail typically reserved for the industry’s elite painters” — simply sounded too good to be true. Now that I’m holding the first of its retail releases, fresh out of a box from its Polish factory, I’m fairly shook. These <a href="https://archon-studio.com/dungeonsandlasers?product=1">Dwarven Mine pre-painted half-height walls</a> look great, with multiple shades to build up a highlight and a nice, evenly-applied wash to bring out those little details. There’s even an attempt at object source lighting, with lanterns and torches casting colorful shades and shadows along the walls.</p>

<p id="MIDYnm">Simply put, Archon’s terrain looks excellent — not quite as good as I could do <a href="https://www.polygon.com/tabletop-games/23643118/how-to-paint-miniatures">here myself at home</a>, but far better than anything I’ve ever seen come fresh out of the box. And I have absolutely no idea how they’ve done it, nor how they managed to make it so inexpensive. The set here costs $89.99 and covers a fair amount of the table. For a proper layout, you’ll probably want at least a couple of them.</p>

<p id="jhE2pP">I’d say they were doing it by hand, but the pieces are simply too consistent. There’s a machine involved somewhere in the process, that’s for sure. Trouble is that none of the professionals in the world of industrial printing that I’ve quietly talked to this week have seen anything that can do this kind of work here in the United States. They, too, are stumped.</p>
<p id="Tn4fij">“It is entirely our own technology and we develop it consistently,” said project and marketing manager Kamil Grochowski in an email to Polygon. “The product you have in your hand is the first in a series. So it is safe to assume that the quality will only get better!”</p>

<p id="seHp5r">So while we don’t know what kind of equipment they’re using, Archon has provided the broad strokes. According to its initial press release, the terrain is first hand-painted by a professional artist. This box lists Kuba Sawicki as its painter on the Dwarven Mines, and they are even credited on the back of the box. Sawicki’s work was then turned into a digital model using <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2014/3/25/5547708/how-the-vanishing-of-ethan-carter-devs-are-using-photography-to-mimic">photogrammetry</a>, a technique that’s been in circulation in the world of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2016/3/17/11251930/star-wars-battlefront-gdc-photogrammetry-at-at-foot">video gaming</a> for at least a decade now. But then... somehow... they then put it on to the highly irregular surface of the miniature.</p>
<p id="QMh5KD">How remains a mystery. But I tell you what: The finish is strong as hell. Scratching it with a metal drill bit, even with a decent pressure, does next to nothing to it. If you want to repaint or otherwise improve on it, Grochowski says not to bother stripping it. Instead, he says to just paint right over the top.</p>
<p id="xHm3gI">In addition to these Dwarven Mines, Archon also has another set coming out shortly. Designed in partnership with Paizo, the <a href="https://archon-studio.com/shop/products/dungeons-lasers/pathfinder-terrain-abomination-vaults-pre-painted">Pathfinder Terrain: Abomination Vaults Pre-Painted</a>, with all its mindflaying horrors, will begin shipping soon.</p>

You’ll need to step into the teleporter to return to the game. Once you do, you’ll find yourself on a beach with marines and Banished (or, Covenant, as they were known back in 2001) exchanging fire.</p><p>You’ll start the mission by fighting along the beach, pushing forward to the first Forerunner structure you’ll see jutting out of the island’s cliffside. At the end of this battle, you’ll see a Warthog spawn.</p><p>Drive the Warthog (or travel on foot), counterclockwise around the island, moving across the beach until you come to the next Forerunner building, which we’ll refer to as building A.

The mission will end once you’re outside of building A on the elevated landing that looks out on the beach. </p><hr><p><br>With its excellent assortment of combat challenges in a semi-free-roaming mission structure, “The Silent Cartographer” is easily one of the all-time best <em>Halo</em> missions. Don’t miss this chance to experience it with up to three friends, which really changes the dynamic and makes it feel akin to a <em>Destiny </em>strike. <br></p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Star Wars Outlaws was one of the more exciting gameplay trailers we saw during Summer Game Fest, specifically kicking off Ubisoft Forward. It looks like a mixture of Red Dead Redemption 2 and Star Wars, and I’m all here for it! But I have a question, as do many of you. How many planets are in Star Wars Outlaws?</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-planets-can-we-explore-in-star-wars-outlaws">How Many Planets Can We Explore in Star Wars Outlaws?</h2>



<p>In all, Star Wars Outlaws features five planets for us to venture to and explore, with quests on each one to flesh out the main and side stories. The available planets include:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Akiva</strong>: Akiva is a jungle planet home to numerous droid factories and industrial complexes. Its large city welcomes outlaws.</li>



<li><strong>Cantonica</strong>: A hub world full of wealthy criminals, where gambling is the go-to vice daily for many. There’s even a luxury resort, should you care to sneak in and lift a few items.</li>



<li><strong>Kijimi</strong>: A frozen-over world, which we first saw in The Rise of the Skywalker, that fell to bandit attacks and became a haven for criminals.</li>



<li><strong>Tatooine</strong>: An iconic Star Wars planet from the films—a seemingly endless desert expanse home to criminal organizations, such as the Hutts, but full of opportunity for an outlaw.</li>



<li><strong>Toshara Moon</strong>: The Moon of Toshara, while not technically a planet, is a brand-new location explicitly built for the game. It features settlements, a sprawling city, and plenty of open land to race your speeder bike.</li>
</ul>







<h2 id="h-does-star-wars-outlaws-feature-space-flight">Does Star Wars Outlaws Feature Space Flight?</h2>



<p>Star Wars Outlaws does feature space flight to some extent, though many liken it to Starfield’s mechanics. It appears you can fly around the immediate orbit of a planet or moon, but if you want to travel between two planets, you must use a hyperdrive to immediately zip through space.</p>



<p>If this is disappointing to you, consider the fact that Star Wars Outlaws isn’t a space simulator. It’s an on-the-ground story about an outlaw and her pals, and space flight is simply a means to an end for the group.</p>



<p>That said, here’s hoping it’s a little more fleshed-out and fun!</p>



<hr>



<p>What do you think about a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/can-you-play-as-a-male-in-star-wars-outlaws-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multiplayer mode in Star Wars Outlaws</a>?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/carcassonne-board-game-buying-guide<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Carcassonne is a modern classic that stands up against any of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-all-time"><u>best board games</u></a> today. Like Ticket to Ride or Settlers of Catan, Carcassonne has widely become known as one of the gateway board games thanks in part to an approachable ruleset that gives players an introduction to popular mechanics while still offering enough strategy for serious hobbyists. </p><p>Also like other gateway games, Carcassonne features dozens of expansions and spin-offs that allow new players to grow alongside the series. Unfortunately, a wealth of options can sometimes be a double-edged sword for newer tabletop gamers as it often leads to analysis paralysis. That’s why we have compiled this easy-to-follow guide to the entire series. Naturally, the best place to start is with the base game, as all expansions require it to play.</p><h2>The Base Game</h2><h3>Carcassonne</h3><div id="201749"><p><h3>Carcassonne</h3></p></div><p><strong>MSRP</strong>: $39.99 USD</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Age: 7+</li><li>Players: 2-5</li><li>Play Time: 30-45 mins</li></ul><p>Carcassonne is a relatively straightforward tile-placement game. Players take turns drawing tiles to help build out the ever-expanding map. During a player’s turn, they can also choose to place a meeple on the board to claim landmarks such as roads or cities. Claiming landmarks scores points and the player with the most points after the map is completed is the winner. Of course, things are never that simple as other players will also want to claim valuable landmarks and potentially keep you from scoring as well.</p><p>Placing tiles soon becomes a strategic operation where players want to expand the map in a way that benefits themselves but not others. Sometimes, however, it cannot be helped. The luck of the draw may not give you the tile you so desperately need, meaning you’ll be forced to weigh your options and make the best of a bad situation. </p><p>As two rounds of Carcassonne never quite play out the same way, the base game offers plenty of replayability. In fact, the base game is likely all newer players will need for quite a while. Still, it’s nice to have some variability for games like Carcassonne that tend to get to the table quite often. Many of the various expansions add features and mechanics that relate to scoring, giving players even more strategic options. It should also be noted that the latest version of Carcassonne includes both the fan-favorite River and Abbot expansions. All river tiles must be played first and the abbot is a special meeple that can be picked up and scored before landmarks are completed.</p><h2>Expansions</h2><h3>Carcassonne Expansion 1: Inns &amp; Cathedrals</h3><div id="201750"><p><h3>Carcassonne Inns &amp; Cathedrals Expansion</h3></p></div><p><strong>MSRP</strong>: $17.99 USD</p><p><strong>Components</strong> (REQUIRES THE BASE GAME)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>New Pink Meeples for Sixth Player</li><li>18 New Land Tiles Featuring Inns and Cathedrals</li><li>Six Large Meeples</li><li>Double-sided Scoring Tiles</li></ul><p>Before diving into the inns and cathedrals aspects of the expansion, this add-on is noteworthy in that it includes components for a sixth player. These components are designed to be inserted directly into the original box, giving players even more options for crowded game nights. If you want to see our recommendations for even more titles that play well with large groups, check out our list of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-6-player-board-games"><u>best six-player board games</u></a>.</p><p>The titular inns and cathedrals are new landmarks that allow for additional scoring when completing roads or cities. These tiles simply shuffle into the original box and are otherwise placed normally. When scoring, cities with cathedrals and roads with inns net more points than those without. Lastly, Inns &amp; Cathedrals adds a big meeple that essentially counts as two regular-sized meeples, leading to even more scoring and serving as a tie-breaker for controlling landmarks.</p><h3>Carcassonne Expansion 2: Traders &amp; Builders</h3><div id="201751"><p><h3>Carcassonne: Traders &amp; Builders Expansion</h3></p></div><p><strong>MSRP</strong>: $17.99 USD</p><p><strong>Components</strong> (REQUIRES THE BASE GAME)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>24 New Land Tiles</li><li>20 Goods Tokens</li><li>6 Builder Pieces and 6 Pig Pieces</li><li>1 Cloth Bag</li></ul><p>Traders &amp; Builders isn’t a game-changing expansion, but it does offer some new ways to score and place tiles. Arguably the biggest addition is the new tiles that feature symbols for goods such as cloth, wine, and wheat. Players collect goods when claiming landmarks with these icons, and bonus points are awarded to those with the most of a certain resource at the end of the game.</p><p>Additionally, Traders &amp; Builders introduces two new pieces – the builder and the pig. Essentially, builders allow players to place a second tile during their turn if placed on a landmark that already contains a meeple, and pigs score additional points for meeples claiming fields.</p><h3>Carcassonne Expansion 3: The Princess &amp; The Dragon</h3><div id="201752"><p><h3>Carcassonne: The Princess &amp; The Dragon Expansion</h3></p></div><p><strong>MSRP</strong>: $17.99 USD</p><p><strong>Components</strong> (REQUIRES THE BASE GAME)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>30 New Land Tiles</li><li>1 Dragon Token</li><li>1 Fairy Token</li></ul><p>The Princess &amp; The Dragon introduces the biggest tweak to gameplay thus far, meeple removal. Volcano tiles summon the dragon token that takes out those who get in its way. Additionally, the princess tile can be played to remove knights from cities. The only protection against these tactics is the fairy token. The other new addition is the magic portal tile which allows players to place meeples on previously laid tiles.</p><p>Rather than incorporating new ways to score, The Princess &amp; The Dragon adds new competitive tactics to Carcassonne. It’s still not a fundamentally new game, but it offers one of the bigger deviations from the original title.</p><h3>Carcassonne Expansion 4: The Tower</h3><div id="201753"><p><h3>Carcassonne: The Tower Expansion</h3></p></div><p><strong>MSRP</strong>: $19.99 USD</p><p><strong>Components</strong> (REQUIRES THE BASE GAME)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>18 New Land Tiles</li><li>30 Tower Floors</li><li>1 Tile Tower</li></ul><p>The Tower is one of the more divisive expansions as it focuses more on building up rather than expanding outward. Towers essentially act as area control landmarks, but even more than that, these structures can capture opposing meeples on adjacent tiles. The higher the tower goes, the further its reach. Captured meeples can be returned to their original player, but only for the ransom price of three victory points.</p><h3>Carcassonne Expansion 5: Abbey &amp; Mayor</h3><div id="201754"><p><h3>Carcassonne: Abbey &amp; Mayo Expansion</h3></p></div><p><strong>MSRP</strong>: $17.99 USD</p><p><strong>Components</strong> (REQUIRES THE BASE GAME)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>12 New Land Tiles</li><li>6 Abbey Tiles</li><li>Barn, Mayor, and Wagon Pieces for Each Player</li></ul><p>The Abbey &amp; Mayor expansion takes a break from removing meeples and instead gets back to offering players even more ways to score points. The new abbey tiles act as a sort of wild card piece designed to plug holes that might otherwise be difficult to complete. Mayors, on the other hand, serve as tie-breaker pieces for city control when two or more players are vying for the same town. Barns are placed in fields to score points from completed cities and wagons can move to adjacent landmarks after existing ones are completed.</p><h3>Carcassonne Expansion 6: Count, King &amp; Robber</h3><div id="201755"><p><h3>Carcassonne: Count, King &amp; Robber Expansion</h3></p></div><p><strong>MSRP</strong>: $17.99 USD</p><p><strong>Components</strong> (REQUIRES THE BASE GAME)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>2 Large City Tiles</li><li>22 New Land Tiles</li><li>Count, King, and Robber Pieces</li><li>King and Robber Tiles</li></ul><p>Count, King &amp; Robber is yet another expansion that deviates considerably from the base game. Arguably the biggest change is the addition of the large city tiles that allow players to move meeples from the city to complete landmarks and vice versa. Players can even add meeples to the city after completing other players’ landmarks, promoting even more interaction and strategy. Additionally, the king and robber components reward players for developing the longest road and the biggest cities. Because of the added rules and components, Count, King &amp; Robber is not quite as easy to teach as other expansions, but it’s still simple enough to understand after a round or two.</p><h3>Carcassonne Expansion 8: Bridges, Castles &amp; Bazaars</h3><div id="201756"><p><h3>Carcassonne: Bridges, Castles &amp; Bazaars Expansion</h3></p></div><p><strong>MSRP</strong>: $17.99 USD</p><p><strong>Components</strong> (REQUIRES THE BASE GAME)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>12 New Land Tiles</li><li>12 Castle Tiles</li><li>12 Bridge Pieces</li></ul><p>Before we dive into Bridges, Castles &amp; Bazaars, some eagle-eyed mathematicians might have noticed that we skipped Expansion 7. That’s because the dexterity-based add-on is out of print. As we’ll discuss just a bit later, Carcassonne has released dozens of expansions over the years, and many of them have since been discontinued.</p><p>One of the more notable features of this expansion is the bazaar tiles that allow players to host an auction where they can spend earned points on desirable tiles. This is a bit of a hit-or-miss add-on that some fans find fun and others feel slows the game down too much. Additionally, the expansion allows players to build around dead ends using bridges. Castles, on the other hand, can be placed in cities to score even more points. </p><h3>Carcassonne Expansion 9: Hills &amp; Sheep</h3><div id="201757"><p><h3>Carcassonne: Hills &amp; Sheep Expansion</h3></p></div><p><strong>MSRP</strong>: $17.99 USD</p><p><strong>Components</strong> (REQUIRES THE BASE GAME)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>18 New Land Tiles</li><li>18 Flock Tokens</li><li>6 Shephard Piece</li><li>1 Cloth Bag</li></ul><p>The Hills &amp; Sheep expansion adds a sort of test-your-luck mechanic thanks to the shepherd piece and flock tokens. Shepherds are placed in open fields and players then select tokens blindly from a bag. Sheep tokens score points while wolf tokens remove the shepherd piece from the board. Hills, on the other hand, are a new tie-breaking feature. Additionally, vineyards are added for even more scoring potential.</p><h3>Carcassonne Expansion 10: Under the Big Top</h3><div id="201758"><p><h3>Carcassonne: Under the Big Top Expansion</h3></p></div><p><strong>MSRP</strong>: $17.99 USD</p><p><strong>Components</strong> (REQUIRES THE BASE GAME)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>20 New Land Tiles</li><li>12 Circus Tiles</li><li>8 Acrobat Tiles</li><li>16 Animal Tokens</li><li>1 Big Top Token</li><li>6 Ringmaster Meeples</li></ul><p>Under the Big Top goes all in on its circus theme. Interestingly, however, the circus tiles are a bit of a gamble. When new circus tiles are played, the big top tile is moved from the previous one and replaced by an animal token with a number value. The number value is then attributed to surrounding meeples. Additionally, the ringmaster meeple scores additional points for every circus feature adjacent to it. Not to mention, meeples can stack on acrobat tiles to net even more points. Rather than other expansions that allow players more scoring options, Under the Big Top more or less changes the focus of Carcassonne altogether. This isn’t necessarily a good or bad thing; rather, it’s a change of pace that can make an old favorite feel like new.</p><h2>Other Versions</h2><h3>Carcassonne Big Box (2022 Edition)</h3><div id="201759"><p><h3>Carcassonne: Big Box (2022 Edition)</h3></p></div><p><strong>MSRP</strong>: $89.99</p><p><strong>Components</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Carcassonne Base Game</li><li>Inns &amp; Cathedrals Expansion</li><li>Traders &amp; Builders Expansion</li><li>The Abbot, The River, The Flying Machines, The Ferries, The Messengers, The Gold Mines, Mage &amp; Witch, The Robbers, and The Crop Circles Expansions</li><li>More Than 150 Tiles</li><li>7 Different Types of Meeples</li></ul><p>Every so often, Carcassonne releases a new big box that contains the base game and several expansions. The most recent edition contains the base game, the Inns &amp; Cathedrals expansion, and the Traders &amp; Builders expansion, as well as the abbot, river, robbers, and several other pieces from previous expansions. The big box is a great place to start as it offers quite a bit of content all in one package. Many fans consider the first two expansions some of the best, so having both in one package is certainly a win for the Carcassonne Big Box.</p><h3>Carcassonne 20th Anniversary Edition</h3><div id="201760"><p><h3>Carcassonne 20th Anniversary Edition</h3></p></div><p><strong>MSRP</strong>: $49.99</p><p><strong>Components</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>87 Land Tiles</li><li>17 River Tiles</li><li>40 Meeples</li><li>5 Abbotts</li><li>1 Scoreboard</li><li>Character Stickers</li></ul><p>Carcassonne also offers a 20th-anniversary edition that is mostly the same as the base game but adds some upgraded visuals and meeple stickers. Additionally, the anniversary edition also includes exclusive tiles that add even more variability and scoring opportunities.</p><h3>Carcassonne: Amazonas</h3><div id="201761"><p><h3>Carcassonne: Amazonas</h3></p></div><p><strong>MSRP</strong>: $34.99 USD</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Age: 8+</li><li>Players: 2-5</li><li>Play Time: 35 mins</li></ul><p>Carcassonne: Amazonas is a standalone title incompatible with the original game and its expansions. Amazonas plays similarly to standard Carcassonne, but it introduces boats that venture down the river. However, in a given turn, players must decide if they want to play meeples or advance their boat. Both actions score points, giving players various potential paths to victory.</p><h3>Carcassonne: Gold Rush</h3><div id="201762"><p><h3>Carcassonne: Gold Rush</h3></p></div><p><strong>MSRP</strong>: $34.99 USD</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Age: 8+</li><li>Players: 2-5</li><li>Play Time: 35 mins</li></ul><p>Like Amazonas, Carcassonne: Gold Rush is a standalone title incompatible with the original game and its expansions. This time, however, the franchise takes a trip to the Old West. Outside of aesthetics, the major difference between Gold Rush and standard Carcassonne is the mining mechanic. Claiming mountains more or less works like any other landmark in Carcassonne, except they return mining tokens. These tokens can award up to five points (or pieces of gold) or as little as zero points. Essentially, it's like mining gold – sometimes you get lucky, and sometimes you don’t. </p><h3>Carcassonne: Hunters &amp; Gatherers</h3><div id="201763"><p><h3>Carcassonne: Hunters &amp; Gatherers</h3></p></div><p><strong>MSRP</strong>: $39.99 USD</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Age: 8+</li><li>Players: 2-5</li><li>Play Time: 35 mins</li></ul><p>Carcassonne: Hunters &amp; Gatherers is a prehistoric-themed version of Carcassonne. It mostly plays the same as standard Carcassonne, however, players can score additional points for animals located within their landmarks. Additionally, finishing forests (Hunters &amp; Gatherers’ version of cities) awards players special valuable tiles. This occurs even when finishing another player’s forest, promoting even more player interaction. Like other standalone titles, Carcassonne: Hunters &amp; Gatherers is incompatible with the original game or any of its expansions.</p><h3>Carcassonne: Safari</h3><div id="201764"><p><h3>Carcassonne: Safari</h3></p></div><p><strong>MSRP</strong>: $39.99 USD</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Age: 7+</li><li>Players: 2-5</li><li>Play Time: 35 mins</li></ul><p>Carcassonne: Safari is yet another standalone version of Carcassonne incompatible with other entries in the series – this time, with an African safari theme. The rules largely remain the same, however, additional points are scored for different animals present on landmarks. Additionally, the newly added safari truck game piece also serves as a new mechanic. These pieces are placed in yet-to-be-played tile areas and can be picked up and moved for additional points when the map eventually expands to that part of the grid. Strategic placement can even lead to blocking other players, or at least, encouraging them to help you. </p><h3>Mists over Carcassonne</h3><div id="201765"><p><h3>Mists Over Carcassonne</h3></p></div><p><strong>MSRP</strong>: $39.99 USD</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Age: 8+</li><li>Players: 2-5</li><li>Play Time: 35 mins</li></ul><p>Mists over Carcassonne is the first cooperative iteration of the series. This version plays similarly to standard Carcassonne, however, players score points together to try and reach the threshold for victory. While that sounds simple enough, players also need to worry about managing the number of ghosts on the board present by finishing up the new mist landmarks. Allowing too many ghosts to run rampant on the board or failing to achieve a certain amount of points in a given period means that players lose. Also, for fans of the traditional Carcassonne experience, there is an additional set of rules to play Mists as a competitive experience.</p><h3>My First Carcassonne</h3><div id="161851"><p><h3>My First Carcassonne</h3></p></div><p><strong>MSRP</strong>: $34.99 USD</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Age: 4+</li><li>Players: 2-4</li><li>Play Time: 10-20 mins</li></ul><p>As the name would suggest, My First Carcassonne is a simplified version of Carcassonne that targets a younger demographic. Due to its streamlined ruleset and more colorful artwork, we identified My First Carcassonne as one of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-5-year-olds"><u>best board games for five-year-olds</u></a>. This title leads younger gamers nicely into standard Carcassonne, which is easily one of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-family-board-games"><u>best family board games</u></a> available and suited best for ages eight and up.</p><h2>Other Versions</h2><h3>Carcassonne: Digital Version</h3><p>Like many other popular titles, Carcassonne has also made the leap to digital on several platforms. It is available as Carcassonne on the Nintendo Switch <a href="https://zdcs.link/mV2gN" target="_blank">eShop</a> for $19.99 MSRP. Additionally, it can be found as Carcassonne - Tiles &amp; Tactics on PC and mobile for $9.99 MSRP. Expansions such as Inns &amp; Cathedrals and Builders &amp; Traders can be purchased as DLC. Carcassonne can also be played online at <a href="https://en.boardgamearena.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Board Game Arena</a> with a Premium subscription. Premium memberships start at $3 per month and give subscribers access to hundreds of popular board games like Ark Nova, Terraforming Mars, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/wingspan-board-game-buying-guide">Wingspan</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/azul-board-game-buying-guide">Azul</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/catan-3d-review">Catan</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ticket-to-ride-legacy-legends-of-the-west-board-game-review">Ticket to Ride</a>, and more.</p><h2>Discontinued Versions</h2><p>In your Carcassonne research, you may come across discontinued titles like Carcassonne Star Wars, for example. Entries like this, the Old Testament-themed Ark of the Covenant spin-off, and the missing Catapult expansion referenced earlier are generally only available on the secondhand market. While current publisher Z-Man Games has reprinted many iterations, some are simply lost to time, potentially destined to become collector’s items.</p><h2>Bottom Line</h2><p>Carcassonne is a versatile game that can be enjoyed simply as its base experience or be iterated upon through its various expansions. Luckily, many of the games listed above can be found for well under MSRP at retailers like Amazon, Target, and Walmart.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/shop-titans-celebrates-its-fifth-anniversary-with-a-myriad-of-new-content<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>The free-to-play tycoon simulator/adventure RPG Shop Titans is celebrating its fifth anniversary with gifts to players. The game just launched a big new update that's available now — players can earn several rewards by logging in during the anniversary event, and there will be giveaways and sales too.</p><p>Since its launch in 2019, Shop Titans has attracted players with its cozy, relaxing gameplay, charming aesthetic, and endless options for creating and customizing their perfect shop. Available on both PC and mobile devices, the game lets you step into the life of a new shopkeeper. Set in a fantasy world filled with character-driven banter between its Champions and city Workers, you can become a fantasy shop tycoon by crafting epic weapons, managing a store to success, building a team of adventurers to quest for loot, and selling items for huge profits.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/31/5-year-key-art-1717180495800.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Customers will consistently come by your shop, but won’t know what you have to offer if it's not on display. So you need to create weapon racks, armor mannequins, and the like to show off your crafted gear. Customers will buy items off the rack, giving you money that you can use to improve your shop. You can expand your space, add decorations, or hire more craftspeople to give you access to new types of items.</p><p>As you craft more of each item, you’ll unlock blueprints for higher level items that will make you more money. Some of them will require materials you don’t have on hand, so you’ll need to hire Heroes to go out and gather the materials for you. That’s where the RPG elements come in. After you hire Heroes, you’ll equip them before sending them on quests to gather the materials you need. Once their quest is over, they’ll return with the materials you requested in addition to treasure chests with even more loot.</p><p>All of these different systems also have their own levels. As you craft items to sell, the craftspeople will level up. As you sell items, your merchant level will grow. As you send heroes out into the field, their levels will increase. They’ll learn new skills and be able to tackle more difficult quests, spurring constant growth.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/05/shop-frame-1717568364632.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>The new Fifth Anniversary update extends that growth even more, adding several new blueprints, merchant level loops, shop expansion options, and more. Players can look forward to the update's biggest addition — a new type of very rare blueprint called artifacts that come in three minor or major levels.</p><p>The six new artifacts are each a different type of equipment — there’s a katana, suit of armor, amulet, cowl, spellbook, and pickaxe. They are difficult to acquire and craft, but they're much stronger than other blueprints of the same tier and give special bonuses that can’t be achieved any other way.</p><p>Those bonuses can make certain artifacts especially useful to specific classes. For instance, the new artifact katana gives a 200% boost to critical damage but limits critical chance to 20%. However, the Samurai automatically gets a critical hit in the first round. So that attack gets the benefit of the damage boost without the drawback of lower chance. Similarly, the amulet gives a boost to evasion and skill HP bonus, but it seals that character’s weapon and makes it useless. Well, that drawback doesn’t affect fist fighters.</p><p>The artifacts aren’t the only new addition. There are now looping merchant levels that allow you to progress past level 100. Once you pass level 100, you’ll get a new level banner and loop back to level 1. You can level up to 100 again, and you can do this up to five times for a total level of 500. You’ll still get gems every time you level up, and each time you enter a new loop, you’ll get added bonuses with every level of that loop.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/31/backyard-example-1717180371697.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Then there are new options for shop customization. You’ve always been able to expand your shop with new sections in a 3x3 grid, but now you can transform any of those sections into yard space. That means you can place outdoor decorations in those spaces, giving you lots of new ways to get creative with the look and layout of your shop.</p><p>There’s still more coming, too. There will be a daily giveaway exclusively on the Webstore starting June 14, where players can claim a free item every day. The giveaway item changes every 24 hours, so if you want to get everything, make sure to log in each day. There will also be a big sale from June 14–17, where players can get all kinds of discounts, as well as a new item called the Seed of Merit, which can increase a Hero or Champion’s level past the level cap, available exclusively during the anniversary sale.</p><p>In addition, players can expect an in-game anniversary login calendar that will give free rewards, and two additional new artifacts will be revealed during the anniversary event as well. In short, now’s the time to jump into Shop Titans and take advantage of all these exciting opportunities. Players rave about the game on Steam, IOS, Google Play, Epic Games Store, and the Microsoft Store, so download the game for free and start your shopkeeping journey.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

In the video, we see a more grown-up, Max Caulfield, as a photographer for Caledon University.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Life is Strange: Double Exposure – Announce Trailer (ESRB)" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TOYz4NCFIXg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="187" data-current-count="487" data-injectable="true">Compared to the original <em>Life is Strange</em>, <em>Double Exposure</em> ups the ante in terms of graphics. Max’s character design, especially, has much more detail, making her seem more lifelike.</p>
 <p data-characters="182" data-current-count="182" data-injectable="false">In addition to the Announcement Trailer, a <em>Life is Strange: Double Exposure</em> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5oyn4xIYRY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">special livestream</a> is on its way. Look forward to the event on June 13 at 9 a.m. PT/5 p.m. BST/6 p.m. CET.</p> <h2 id="h-is-life-is-strange-double-exposure-a-sequel" data-injectable="false">Is Life is Strange: Double Exposure a sequel?</h2> <p data-characters="353" data-current-count="535" data-injectable="true">Given that the game is a continuation of Max’s story, it is assumed that <em>Life is Strange: Double Exposure </em>is a sequel. However, the <a href="https://deckninegames.com/introducing-life-is-strange-double-exposure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Deck Nine Games</a> site states that it is a “standalone experience.” That means you don’t need any knowledge of the original, and they may offer a potential recap of the events that transpired before.</p>
 <p data-characters="321" data-current-count="321" data-injectable="false">Even though it’s a standalone game, it’ll likely feature plenty of callbacks to <em>Life is Strange</em>. We already got some hints of this in the trailer when Max mentions that she made a promise never to use her powers again. This, of course, refers back to the original when she harnessed her ability to time shift.</p> <h2 id="h-is-chloe-in-life-is-strange-double-exposure" data-injectable="false">Is Chloe in Life is Strange: Double Exposure?</h2> <p data-characters="313" data-current-count="634" data-injectable="true">Many <em>LiS </em>fans have wondered about Chloe Price’s whereabouts, as she is not mentioned in the trailer. As of right now, it isn’t clear if Chloe will reappear in <em>Life is Strange: Double Exposure</em>. We can hope that she will make her return to the game or get some clarification about her current standings.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Dontnod Entertainment/Deck Nine Games</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="242" data-current-count="542" data-injectable="false">While we don’t know about Chloe’s fate in <em>Double Exposure</em>, she was at least mentioned in <em>LiS 2</em> and <em>True Colors’ Wavelengths</em>. The same thing could be done for her again in this new entry, but we’ll need to wait and see.</p>

            <p>
Sumo Group, the parent company of Sackboy: A Big Adventure and Texas Chain Saw Massacre developer Sumo Digital, has announced plans to reduce its workforce by up to 15 percent, putting nearly 270 employees across the UK, Canada, Poland, Czech Republic, and India at risk.
</p>
<p>
"Whilst Sumo has been able to manage through many of the recent difficulties the games industry has faced," the company <a href="https://www.sumogroupltd.com/news/2024/sumo-group-update/">wrote</a>, "we have not been immune and reshaping operations across the business to better navigate the upcoming challenges expected in the coming months is a path we must now take to ensure the security of the business going forward."
</p>
<p>
To that end, Sumo has made "the difficult decision to reduce our costs across the business in a number of ways", which "unfortunately will include a reduction in the number of people the business can support". While Sumo says it has considered "every alternate route to limit the impact to our people", it confirms up to 15 percent of employees in the UK, Canada, Poland, Czech Republic, and India (from a workforce of 1,790 according to <a href="https://www.sumogroupltd.com/">its website</a>) will be affected.

"This is an incredibly challenging process to go through for everyone at Sumo," it continued, "and our focus is now on supporting our people and working with our partners on their games as we move forward to ensure we emerge from this difficult time, ready for the future."

After ten years of waiting, BioWare is finally blowing the lid off the fourth entry in its fantasy RPG series. The studio put out a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-dreadwolf-teaser-trailer-xbox-1851528812&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-dreadwolf-teaser-trailer-xbox-1851528812">cinematic trailer</a></span> showcasing the game’s party members during the Xbox Showcase, and released a gameplay trailer that showed off 20-minutes of in-game footage. There’s a lot to sift through, but here are some big takeaways from the past week of <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> reveals.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7176fe9a5ca4d1e30ea51b482caac94c" data-recommend-id="image://7176fe9a5ca4d1e30ea51b482caac94c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Veilguard combat encounter." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Veilguard combat encounter." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7176fe9a5ca4d1e30ea51b482caac94c" data-recommend-id="image://7176fe9a5ca4d1e30ea51b482caac94c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Veilguard combat encounter." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Straight up, <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard </em>is the hardest pivot to an action game the series has ever done. While <em>Dragon Age II</em> and <em>Inquisition</em> tried to blend the tactical combat of <em>Origins </em>with real-time action, <em>The Veilguard </em>forgoes any notion of doing that in favor of something that resembles a character action game like <em>God of War</em>. It looks <em>really</em> solid as an action game, at least. But your mileage may vary on if that’s what you’re looking for out of a new <em>Dragon Age </em>game.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="4e9a953cd47712efe00de19abae8ece7" data-recommend-id="image://4e9a953cd47712efe00de19abae8ece7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1081" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Veilguard ability wheel." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Veilguard ability wheel." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4e9a953cd47712efe00de19abae8ece7" data-recommend-id="image://4e9a953cd47712efe00de19abae8ece7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1081" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Veilguard ability wheel." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>While there’s a focus on real-time action this time around, you will still have abilities to use, cooldowns to manage, and a way to pause the action as you sort through which of those you want to use. <em>The Veilguard </em>will have its own equivalent of the <em>Mass Effect </em>combat wheel that lets you stop the fight, pick an ability, aim it at the baddie of your choice, and fire it off. The wheel we saw in the gameplay trailer had nine ability slots, but it appears that you’ll be able to tab over to another wheel similar to previous games.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e5d63ba57d5de2da2aa71ced33a1560b" data-recommend-id="image://e5d63ba57d5de2da2aa71ced33a1560b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Rook, Davrin, and Bellara prepare for a fight." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Rook, Davrin, and Bellara prepare for a fight." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e5d63ba57d5de2da2aa71ced33a1560b" data-recommend-id="image://e5d63ba57d5de2da2aa71ced33a1560b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Rook, Davrin, and Bellara prepare for a fight." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The first three <em>Dragon Age </em>games let you have three party members with you at all times. That won’t be the case in <em>The Veilguard</em>. In keeping with the aforementioned <em>Mass Effect</em>-ification of things, <em>The Veilguard </em>will only let you have two companions by your side at once. This will naturally affect party composition and strategies, but if <em>The Veilguard </em>keeps the series’ beloved party banter, it will change how those conversations play out as it will often be between only two characters.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="db6ca0ffc6d660dc0f9a2d0072d725bb" data-recommend-id="image://db6ca0ffc6d660dc0f9a2d0072d725bb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Inquisitor serving cunt." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Inquisitor serving cunt." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="db6ca0ffc6d660dc0f9a2d0072d725bb" data-recommend-id="image://db6ca0ffc6d660dc0f9a2d0072d725bb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Inquisitor serving cunt." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Given <em>The Veilguard</em>’s focus on Solas, the party-member-turned-antagonist from <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em>, it’s not a surprise that The Inquisitor, the protagonist from the 2014 RPG, will be returning. Players will be able to customize the appearance of The Inquisitor similar to how they did <em>Dragon Age II </em>protagonist Hawke in the last game. We don’t know yet what their role will be, but it’s at least good to know they’ll be around for the conclusion of the story they started ten years ago, even though I would argue they should have been the protagonist of <em>The Veilguard</em>, but I digress.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="31265d47d1ba760edecd80ca9a214387" data-recommend-id="image://31265d47d1ba760edecd80ca9a214387" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Rook, Emmrich, and Harding." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Rook, Emmrich, and Harding." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="31265d47d1ba760edecd80ca9a214387" data-recommend-id="image://31265d47d1ba760edecd80ca9a214387" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Rook, Emmrich, and Harding." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>While BioWare has yet to publicly show <em>The Veilguard</em>’s character creator, <em>Kotaku</em> saw a glimpse of it at Summer Game Fest, and it has some real depth to it. You can play as four races: Human, Dwarf, Elf, and Qunari, and it will have sliders to change your body type. BioWare confirmed that even if you make your Rook a short king, the team has done work to ensure animations fit any character build. You’ll also be able to pick Rook’s pronouns, as well as their origin based on what faction they come from. This includes the Shadow Dragons, Grey Wardens, Antivan Crows, Lords of Fortune, Mourn Watch, and the Veil Jumpers. Each of these orders has a distinct place in <em>Dragon Age </em>lore and whichever one you pick will affect how some characters interact with you and open up new dialogue options. Like <em>Inquisition</em>, <em>The Veilguard </em>will have four voice options, two with British accents and two with American ones.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="5dded3fd995f8611f98622f74d0347de" data-recommend-id="image://5dded3fd995f8611f98622f74d0347de" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot of the Dragon Age Keep." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of the Dragon Age Keep." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5dded3fd995f8611f98622f74d0347de" data-recommend-id="image://5dded3fd995f8611f98622f74d0347de" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot of the Dragon Age Keep." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>BioWare has become synonymous with importing choices from old games into new ones, but it’s been ten years since the last <em>Dragon Age</em>. As such, the studio is changing how it’s approaching bringing those choices across games. <em>The Veilguard </em>will allow you to pick what big decisions you made in the old games in its character creator, rather than importing an old save from <em>Inquisition</em>. This also means it won’t draw from <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-ages-save-file-solution-lets-you-rewrite-your-h-1217092939&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-ages-save-file-solution-lets-you-rewrite-your-h-1217092939">Dragon Age Keep</a></span>, a browser app that lets you craft world states to import into <em>Inquisition</em>.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="5004a09b1ba7fc2df6fe274a5493b32c" data-recommend-id="image://5004a09b1ba7fc2df6fe274a5493b32c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Rook picking a dialogue option." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Rook picking a dialogue option." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5004a09b1ba7fc2df6fe274a5493b32c" data-recommend-id="image://5004a09b1ba7fc2df6fe274a5493b32c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Rook picking a dialogue option." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>The Veilguard </em>is bringing back <em>Dragon Age 2</em>s dialogue system, which was tone-based and resulted in its protagonist Hawke falling into one of three different personality states. You have three general tones in a conversation: kind, humorous, or aggressive, with slight variations depending on the situation. This dialogue system was interesting in the 2011 RPG because it would shape Hawke’s personality, even in scenes where you weren’t directly picking a dialogue option.

<p>With the ongoing Steam Next Fest, which allows players a chance to download and check out various demos for upcoming games, folks find themselves drawn to Once Human. It was the first demo downloaded, and I’m finding it absolutely fantastic. But there’s a question in the air. Is Once Human Early Access?</p>



<h2 id="h-is-once-human-early-access-or-full-release">Is Once Human Early Access or Full Release?</h2>



<p>When Once Human officially releases on <strong>July 9</strong>, it will do so as a full-release title. Unlike most other survival-crafting games on the market today, the upcoming open-world survival shooter will not launch into Early Access. </p>



<p>It’s a fresh take and one we’re wholly open to. The current gameplay is satisfying, the creature designs are phenomenal, and, with a little more polish, it’ll prove itself as a long-term survival game for fans of the genre!</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-survive-in-once-human">How to Survive in Once Human</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Image via Starry Studio</figcaption></figure>



<p>When you first dive into Once Human, either in the beta during Steam Next Fest or upon launch in early July, you’ll find the prologue rather welcoming. It does a fantastic job of smoothly introducing you to the gameplay mechanics, loot, and overall story beats. But then you’re thrust into the open world alongside a magical crow and told to survive. Here are a few tips:</p>



<ul>
<li>While you won’t die of hunger or thirst immediately upon touching down, it’s a wise move to keep food and water in your inventory for when times get tough. After all, this is a survival game. You require both to operate at peak efficiency.</li>



<li>While playing on a PvE server, don’t be afraid to make a friend or two. You can group up to tackle challenging points of interest, share loot, or even build a small community together in the open world. Even better is you can ask for help!</li>



<li>Your starting crossbow is excellent at dealing with shambling zombies and Watchers, but you’ll require smoothing with more oomph before long. Do your best to seek out a better weapon, ideally a firearm, quickly!</li>
</ul>



<hr>



<p>Alongside Once Human, there’s a handful of quality <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/steam-next-fest-june-2024-10-games-you-need-to-check-out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">demos we recommend from Steam Next Fest</a>!

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/best-quicken-teams-for-sethos-in-genshin-impact/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=best-quicken-teams-for-sethos-in-genshin-impact<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="282" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">If you’ve gotten lucky and pulled <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-sethos-builds-genshin-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sethos</a> in <em>Genshin Impact</em>, you might be wondering how he fits into your team. As an on-field Electro DPS character, Sethos’ kit is balanced around the Quicken and Aggravate reactions. Here are Sethos’ best Quicken teams to maximize his damage!</p> <h2 id="h-sethos-in-quicken-teams" data-injectable="false">Sethos in Quicken teams</h2> <p data-characters="313" data-current-count="313" data-injectable="false">First, a brief <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/genshin-impact-dendro-reactions-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">overview</a> of Quicken and Aggravate reactions. When Electro and Dendro combine in any order, an enemy receives the Quicken status. This looks like a green lightning effect around the enemy. Hitting an enemy in this state with Electro attacks triggers Aggravate, which increases the attack’s damage.</p> <p data-characters="193" data-current-count="506" data-injectable="true">Since Sethos relies on Quicken and Aggravate reactions, his best teams will feature Dendro teammates. You can supplement additional Electro or Anemo units, too, for additional damage and buffs.</p>
 <h2 id="h-best-dendro-teammates-for-sethos" data-injectable="false">Best Dendro teammates for Sethos</h2> <p data-characters="287" data-current-count="287" data-injectable="false">Sethos should be paired with <strong>at least one Dendro teammate</strong> in order to maintain the Quicken status on enemies. Off-field Dendro application is particularly important, since Sethos will want to stay on-field <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-play-sethos-in-genshin-impact-normal-vs-charged-attack-playstyles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">using either Normal or Charged Attacks</a>. The best Dendro teammates for Sethos are:</p> <ul data-found-items="4" data-current-count="447" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong>Nahida</strong> – Provides high off-field Dendro application and damage.</li> <li><strong>Dendro Traveler</strong> – Provides good off-field Dendro application, but less damage than Nahida.</li> <li><strong><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-baizhu-builds-weapons-and-teams-in-genshin-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Baizhu</a></strong> – Has less Dendro application, but still good enough, and provides healing.</li> <li><strong><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-yaoyao-healer-builds-in-genshin-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yaoyao</a></strong> – Budget Baizhu.</li> </ul>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-other-teammates-for-sethos" data-injectable="false">Other teammates for Sethos</h2> <p data-characters="189" data-current-count="489" data-injectable="true">Once you have your Dendro unit(s) picked out, fill in the empty slots on your team with some flex picks. Try a second Electro character who can deal off-field damage. Some examples include:</p>
 <ul data-found-items="2" data-current-count="80" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-fischl-builds-weapons-and-teams-in-genshin-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fischl</a></strong> – Provides energy and significant off-field Electro damage.</li> <li><strong>Yae Miko</strong> – Deals off-field Electro damage.</li> </ul> <p data-characters="236" data-current-count="316" data-injectable="false">You can also add an Anemo teammate holding the 4pc Viridescent Venerer artifact set. This set reduces enemies’ Electro RES, causing Sethos to deal more damage. Any Anemo unit can work here, but the best Anemo teammates for Sethos are:</p> <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="436" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong>Sucrose</strong> – Grants Elemental Mastery buffs.</li> <li><strong><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-kazuha-builds-in-genshin-impact-updated-4-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kazuha</a></strong> – Increases your team’s Electro DMG.</li> <li><strong>Jean, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-xianyun-support-builds-in-genshin-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xianyun</a>, or <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-sayu-builds-weapons-and-teams-in-genshin-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sayu</a></strong> – Provide healing.</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="250" data-current-count="250" data-injectable="false">Certain Geo characters also work well with Sethos. There is an opportunity cost to using some of them, though, since Geo characters often do best in full Geo teams, not Quicken teams. Nevertheless, these Geo units can have a place in Sethos’ teams.</p> <ul data-found-items="2" data-current-count="330" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-zhongli-builds-weapons-and-teams-in-genshin-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zhongli</a></strong> – Provides a shield and reduces enemy RES to all elements.</li> <li><strong><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-albedo-build-in-genshin-impact-updated-4-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Albedo</a> or <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-chiori-builds-in-genshin-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chiori</a></strong> – Deal off-field Geo damage at intervals.</li> </ul> <figure data-current-count="630" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-example-teams-for-sethos" data-injectable="false">Example teams for Sethos</h2> <ul data-found-items="4" data-current-count="160" data-injectable="false"> <li>Sethos – Fischl – Yaoyao – Sucrose</li> <li>Sethos – Fischl – Baizhu – Kazuha</li> <li>Sethos – Yae Miko – Nahida – Baizhu</li> <li>Sethos – Fischl – Nahida – Zhongli</li> </ul>

<p data-characters="202" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Niantic has revealed details for the upcoming <em>Pokemon GO</em> Scorching Steps event, which kicks off on June 21, 2024. The event will start at 10 am local time, and ends on June 25, 2024, at 8 pm local time.</p> <p data-characters="207" data-current-count="207" data-injectable="false">During this event, <em>Pokemon GO</em> players will get to take advantage of a number of event bonuses and catch a variety of featured Pokemon. Here are all the event bonuses active during <em>Pokemon GO</em> Scorching Steps:</p> <ul data-found-items="4" data-current-count="367" data-injectable="false"> <li>Twice the amount of candy from hatching eggs</li> <li>Half distance required to hatch eggs that are placed into incubators during the event</li> <li>The first three eggs will only require one-fourth distance to hatch when using the <em>Pokemon GO</em> egg hatching widget</li> <li>There will be an increased chance to encounter hatch Shiny Slugma and Shiny Litleo</li> </ul> <figure data-current-count="667" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <h2 id="h-featured-pokemon" data-injectable="false">Featured Pokemon</h2> <p data-characters="399" data-current-count="399" data-injectable="false">As the event bonuses suggest, the <em>Pokemon GO</em> Scorching Steps revolves around egg hatching, and will reward players for hatching eggs during this event. Larvesta can be hatched from 2 km, 5 km, and 10 km eggs during this event. All other featured Pokemon can be hatched, depending on the egg and the distance required to hatch it. Here are all the Pokemon you can hatch through eggs during the event:</p> <p data-characters="9" data-current-count="408" data-injectable="true"><strong>2 km eggs</strong></p>
 <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="200" data-injectable="false"> <li>Growlithe</li> <li>Slugma</li> <li>Houndour</li> <li>Magby</li> <li>Larvesta</li> </ul> <p data-characters="9" data-current-count="209" data-injectable="false"><strong>5 km eggs</strong></p> <ul data-found-items="9" data-current-count="569" data-injectable="true"> <li>Hisuian Growlithe</li> <li>Darumaka</li> <li>Litwick</li> <li>Larvesta</li> <li>Litleo</li> <li>10 km eggs</li> <li>Larvesta</li> <li>Turtonator</li> <li>Charcadet</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="241" data-current-count="241" data-injectable="false">There are also event-themed field research tasks coming with this event, which will allow players to catch Slugma and Litleo by completing the tasks, and some players might be lucky enough to encounter Turtonator in the task rewards as well.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/rebel-moon%E2%80%99s-director%E2%80%99s-cut-is-coming-with-a-new-title.898554/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/rebel-moons-directors-cut-is-coming-with-a-new-title/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rebel-moons-directors-cut-is-coming-with-a-new-title<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="119" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The <em>Rebel Moon </em>director’s cut is coming to Netflix on August 2, and when it gets here, it will have a new name.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="207" data-current-count="207" data-injectable="false">Actually, it’ll have two new names. Zack Snyder took to social media today to unveil the release date for his extended double-feature as well as the fresh titles for each chapter of “Rebel Moon.”&nbsp;</p> <figure data-current-count="507" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <p data-characters="505" data-current-count="505" data-injectable="true"><em>Chalice of Blood </em>and <em>Curse of Forgiveness </em>are inevitably going to tell the same story as the PG-13 <em>Rebel Moon </em>movies, but fans are still going to have plenty of new things to see. Snyder told Variety that the new movies feature over an hour of extra content, and some of the new scenes were specifically held back until now. “We shot scenes just for the director’s cut,” Snyder said, adding, “So in that way, it’s really a revelation because it gives that second kick at the can for big fans.”</p>
 <p data-characters="757" data-current-count="757" data-injectable="false">The extra runtime will presumably flesh out the multiple worlds and characters that make up the core of <em>Rebel Moon</em>. The original <em>Child of Fire</em> had to introduce so many characters and concepts that the experience felt rushed, but that almost certainly won’t be the case with the new R-rated version. We’ll see how many people tune back in for these new versions. Both <em>Rebel Moon </em>movies were critical flops, and there might not be many people willing to sit back down for a longer version of the original experience, even if it does depict – as the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/another-snyder-cut-is-on-the-way-later-this-year/1100-6524155/">official description states</a> – “the viciously sexier, bloodier world of <em>Rebel Moon</em>.” If it does well enough, maybe Snyder will get to make the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/latest-sci-fi-news-spielbergs-ufo-movie-for-all-mankind-renewed-and-rebel-moon-part-3/"><em>Rebel Moon 3</em> he’s apparently already plotted out</a>. </p>

            <p>I try to avoid describing video games in mathematical terms, but I can hardly avoid it here. Treasure Planet's flying galleons plus Spirited Away's bath house plus Spiritfarer's gentle building and management mechanics equals Hotel Galactic. Watch the trailer below and tell me I'm wrong.

<p>I'm not being reductive, right? Although it's not like Spiritfarer wasn't already channeling Ghibli.
</p>
<p>You build your hotel and design each room to cater to different kinds of guests, manage your staff by assigning actions and priorities, and seemingly form friendships with alien companions with special abilities and traits they can pass on to new joiners. 
</p>
<p>There's an implied villain at the end of the trailer above, although there's no real mention of potential conflict on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2183670/Hotel_Galactic/">Hotel Galactic Steam page</a>. The closest it gets is a reference to a "spooky underground complex", in which you can discover "new materials, creatures and expand the construction space." Otherwise it's pitched as cosy from top to bottom.
</p>
<p>Hotel Galactic has no release date yet, but I'm intrigued. It'll apparently have a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/528325741/hotel-galactic-studio-ghibli-inspired-25d-inn-management">Kickstarter in July</a>, although whether that's to fund its existence, or polish, or something else, I don't know. In the meantime, let me do what YouTube did to me after I watched the trailer, and recommend Jenny Nicholson's latest video <a href="https://youtu.be/T0CpOYZZZW4?si=pG-I1fkZLA0NpIRF">on a different kind of galactic hotel</a>. I've watched all four hours of it twice.</p>
