            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/28/pokemon-legends-z-a-release-date-confirmed-for-october/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Pok√©mon Legends: Z-A is launching on 16th October 2025 for Nintendo Switch and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a>, The Pok√©mon Company has announced.</p>
<p>The company also confirms that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/pokemon-legends-z-a">Pok√©mon Legends: Z-A</a> Switch 2 Edition, which brings improved graphics and frame rates, will be available as a higher priced version of the game. Those who buy the Nintendo Switch version of the game, both digital or physical, will be able to upgrade to the Switch 2 Edition. Curiously, it seems that the Switch 2 version is compatible to Switch, which I‚Äôm not 100% sure how this will work with the physical edition.</p>


<p>Here‚Äôs TPC‚Äôs specific wording:</p>
<p><em>In addition to the Nintendo Switch title Pok√©mon Legends: Z-A, the Nintendo Switch 2 title Pok√©mon Legends: Z-A ‚Äì Nintendo Switch 2 Edition will also be available. With the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition, you can enjoy improved graphics and frame rates.</em></p>
<p><em>If you own the Nintendo Switch title Pok√©mon Legends: Z-A, you can upgrade it to the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition by purchasing an upgrade pack, whether you own the digital version or the physical version of the software. The Nintendo Switch 2 Edition will also be playable on the Nintendo Switch system. When playing the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition on Nintendo Switch, the content will be the same as that of the Nintendo Switch software. Additional content that utilizes the specs of Nintendo Switch 2 will not be included.</em></p>

<p>No pricing details have been announced at this time, but paid upgrades of this scope ‚Äì namely Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom ‚Äì have had <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/24/nintendo-switch-2-edition-game-upgrade-prices-set-at-8-and-17-depending-on-the-game/">a ¬£8 / $10 price difference</a>.</p>
<p>The second Legends spin-off after <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/01/26/pokemon-legends-arceus-review-nintendo-switch/">Arceus</a>, Pok√©mon Legends: Z-A takes us back to Lumiose City from the Kalos region of Pok√©mon X&amp;Y. The city is undergoing a redevelopment plan to make it better for Pok√©mon and people to share. This means there‚Äôs Wild Zones within the city where Pok√©mon are allowed to thrive behind locked gates‚Ä¶ until pesky trainers of a high enough level stomp in and start chucking Pok√© Balls at everything that moves and fighting them!</p>
<p>Pok√©mon battles have been given an overhaul so that both the player and Pok√©mon can move around in the battle arenas, dodging incoming attacks and then triggering moves in real time ‚Äì this is a huge change up from the turn-based battles that have been the series staple. The fan-favourite <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/27/pokemon-legends-z-a-brings-real-time-battles-and-mega-evolutions-coming-late-2025/">Mega Evolution system returns from X&amp;Y</a> with Pok√©mon unlocking a new level of power when triggered.</p>
<p>Another new feature is the addition of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/27/pokemon-legends-z-a-gets-more-dangerous-after-dark-with-the-z-a-royale-battles/">a day-night cycle</a>, with things getting much trickier after dark. At this time, more challenging rival trainers will emerge to take part in the Z-A Royale, adding a little extra peril to your battling.</p>

			<p>Today, CD Projekt RED has <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/pl/wp-content/uploads-pl/2025/05/prezentacja-wynikowa-grupy-cd-projekt-q1-2025-en.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted</a> its Q1 2025 financial report and revealed updates on its games, both those already out (for sales) and those on the way (for development news), such as Cyberpunk 2.</p>
<p>The sequel to Cyberpunk 2077, previously known as Project Orion, has officially entered the pre-production phase at the <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-will-do-better-justice-to-its-settings-americana-thanks-to-the-new-boston-studio-says-cdpr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Boston-based North American office</a>. Moreover, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-shiny-firmware-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">excellent expansion</a> to Cyberpunk 2077, Phantom Liberty, has sold over 10 million units since its debut in September 2023. As for the studio's other big franchise, The Witcher, the third and most successful entry in the franchise has now surpassed 60 million units sold just as the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/cd-projekt-red-celebrates-the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-10-year-anniversary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">celebrated its tenth anniversary</a>.</p>
<p>Presenting the successful quarterly results, CD Projekt RED Chief Financial Officer Piotr Nielubowicz said:</p>
<p><em>On 5 June Cyberpunk Ultimate Edition will be coming to Nintendo Switch 2, marking the global launch of the console itself. The game takes full advantage of the console‚Äôs new features ‚Äì weapons can now be aimed gyroscopically, and touchscreen interaction is supported. For the first time ever one of our games is a launch title for a brand-new console system ‚Äì which we regard as a great honor, as well as further proof of the power of our brand and our partners‚Äô trust in us.</em></p>
<p><em>On the subject of Night City ‚Äì the Phantom Liberty expansion has reached another sales milestone, having been purchased by 10 million gamers. This is an excellent result, given that only 20 months have passed since its release, and it confirms sustained interest in the Cyberpunk universe on the part of the gaming community. Given these developments, it fills me with even greater satisfaction to announce another important stage in our work on the next big game in this franchise. Several weeks ago, Cyberpunk 2 ‚Äì previously referred to as Project Orion ‚Äì wrapped up its conceptual phase and entered preproduction. Congratulations to the entire team!</em></p>
<p><em>Moving on to our other franchise ‚Äì on 19 May we celebrated a major anniversary, with 10 years having passed since the release of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. The game brought thrilling adventures and emotions to millions of games worldwide, and earned us hundreds of awards, along with global recognition. We are proud to announce that since its launch The Witcher 3 has sold over 60 million copies, securing a firm position among the best-selling video games in history. It‚Äôs also worth mentioning that our aggregate revenues from sales of The Witcher 3 ‚Äì along with its expansions ‚Äì have reached 2 billion 400 million PLN over the past decade. The success and enduring popularity of The Witcher 3 fill us with even greater motivation as we work on Ciri‚Äôs new adventures in the upcoming The Witcher 4.</em></p>
<p><em>Regarding financials, in the first three months of the year our consolidated sales revenues topped 226 million PLN. This is mainly due to continuing strong sales of Cyberpunk and its Phantom Liberty expansion. The Group‚Äôs net Q1 profit reached 86 million PLN.</em></p>
<p>As usual, CD Projekt RED also provided an update on its workforce. The total number of employees grew in the last quarter from 707 to 730, with 422 developers working on The Witcher 4 (+11), 96 developers on Cyberpunk 2 (+12), 48 developers on the multiplayer spin-off Project Sirius (-1), 19 developers on the new IP Project Hadar (+2), 131 developers on 'shared services' (+7), and 14 on other projects (-8).</p>
<p>The Witcher 4 entered pre-production in May 2022 and <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-4-is-officially-in-full-scale-production-game-director-is-confident-in-a-remarkable-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">graduated to full production</a> a few months ago. Given this timescale, we can estimate that Cyberpunk 2 could enter full production somewhere around late 2027.</p>
<p>In other recent news, the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel will feature Night City as well as <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-new-chicago-city/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">'Chicago gone wrong'</a>, according to setting creator Mike Pondsmith.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty's Biggest Changes</p>
      </div>
<p>Extremely early development on Cyberpunk 2 began several years ago, and pre-production generally means that more pieces need to fall in place--from concept art to staffing and multiple other crucial factors--before work kicks off in earnest.</p><p>The game title could also change in time, but that's hardly uncommon in the industry today. The Cyberpunk 2 title reveal was done during an investor announcement after all--suggesting that this is in fact a working title that doesn't give away any concrete details--and a formal reveal for the game could see that title altered to better reflect what the sequel is about.</p><p>CDPR described Cyberpunk 2 as being in the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-gets-an-update-on-how-its-coming-along/1100-6520849/">"early stages of development,"</a> back in 2024, as the company first focused on building a strong foundation for the people tasked with producing it. Senior staffers from the original game--including game director Gabriel Amatangelo and associate game director Pawe≈Ç Sasko--are leading development at CDPR's new Boston studio, and the company has hired experienced people from Blizzard, IO Interactive, and Massive Entertainment to join the Cyberpunk 2 team.</p><p>Details are slim at this point in the game's development journey, but what we do know is that it will be built inside of Unreal Engine 5--Cyberpunk 2077 was developed in CDPR's internal Red Engine--and Cyberpunk creator Mike Pondsmith hinted that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-will-feature-a-second-city/1100-6531705/">players will get to explore a second city in some capacity</a>.</p><p>While Cyberpunk 2 is still a long way from being seen, the first game and its award-winning expansion Phantom Liberty are being bundled together as a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-nintendo-switch-2-launch-game/2900-6401/" data-ref-id="2900-6401">Switch 2 launch title</a>, which will likely add to the game's already <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-how-much-cyberpunk-2077-has-earned-so-far/1100-6522250/">impressive lifetime sales figure of 25 million units sold</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/russian-military-backed-squad-22-zov-wants-to-show-the-complexities-of-the-ukraine-war.1200795/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/squad-22-zov-russian-military-propaganda<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Squad 22: ZOV</em>, a tactical RTS that appears to have the official support of the Russian military, has appeared on Steam, and although it's free to play, that very fact is arguably pretty concerning.</p>

<p>As spotted by the folks at <a href="https://simulationdaily.com/news/steam-russian-military-propaganda-game/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Simulation Daily</a>, the game claims to be based on the "real wartime experience of living Russian veterans of war in Ukraine". Not only that, but&nbsp;<em>Squad 22: ZOV</em>'s developers say it's "officially recommended by the Russian military" as a basic training tool.</p>

<p>In gameplay terms,&nbsp;<em>Squad 22: ZOV&nbsp;</em>is a tactical strategy game in which you must issue orders to your squad, presumably as they invade Ukrainian towns and villages and ransack the homes of innocent civilians. It's not the best look in the world for Steam, I'd argue.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/squad-22-zov-russian-propaganda-game-tactical-view.jpg?itok=Jq7mTYWj 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/squad-22-zov-russian-propaganda-game-tactical-view.jpg?itok=zAnI1JS9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Squad 22: ZOV&nbsp;</em>aims to depict the Russia-Ukraine war from, er, the Russian side. Right.</figcaption></figure><p>Tellingly, developer SPN Studio and publisher Zarobana Entertainment say that the game offers the chance to "delve into the complexities of the 2014 and 2022-2024 events through compelling campaigns". I'm not sure if it's deliberate that the date range doesn't include the current year.</p>

<p>In case you're not aware, those dates refer to the 2014 <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-26686949" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">annexation of Crimea</a> by Russia, then 2022's <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/world-europe-60454795" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">full-scale invasion</a> of Ukraine, referred to by Russian leader Vladimir Putin as a "special military operation". It's not exactly the most creative euphemism in the world.</p>

<p>Said invasion led to various studios voicing their opposition to Russia in several ways, with companies like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/games-workshop-suspends-warhammer-sales-in-russia" rel="nofollow">Games Workshop</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bloober-team-halts-sales-in-russia-and-belarus-over-invasion" rel="nofollow">Bloober Team</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cd-projekt-red-halts-sales-with-russia-and-belarus" rel="nofollow">CD Projekt</a> halting sales in Russia and Belarus owing to the event.</p>

<p>The two studios say the game gives you the opportunity to "gain insight into the perspectives of those who lived through these periods, understanding how these events shaped their lives and opinions".</p>

<p>Of course, I highly doubt that&nbsp;<em>Squad 22: ZOV&nbsp;</em>includes any Ukrainian viewpoints on the situation; given that it's endorsed by the Russian military, I can't imagine that organization condoning any kind of game that attempts to be that even-handed.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/squad-22-zov-russian-propaganda-game-outdoors.jpg?itok=jCdqiYZM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/squad-22-zov-russian-propaganda-game-outdoors.jpg?itok=AmEQDWJi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Squad 22: ZOV&nbsp;</em>promises to depict Russia's incursions into Ukraine, for some reason.</figcaption></figure><p>As if all of this wasn't bad enough,&nbsp;<em>Squad 22: ZOV&nbsp;</em>also utilizes generative AI, and the game's description of the way in which this was achieved is a head-scratcher.</p>

<p>SPN Studio says "some 2D images in game where [sic] pre-rendered with usage of AI as a base for work of our 2D artists", with those images "later drawn-over in order to make them geniue [sic] art". I don't think that's how "genuie" art works.</p>

                <p>Work has begun on a new "major" <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft</a> Classic project, according to Blizzard. As a result, development on Season of Discovery looks to be coming to a close.</p><p dir="ltr">In a <a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/update-from-the-wow-classic-team/2110944" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">forum post</a>, WoW Classic producer Josh "Aggrend" Greenfield explained what's next for the WoW Classic team and dove into its philosophy behind the more <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-classic-season-of-discovery-looks-to-make-a-20-year-old-game-surprising-again/1100-6519561/" data-ref-id="1100-6519561">experimental Season of Discovery servers that launched in 2023</a>, and what comes next.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYGvtbrDiiw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/uYGvtbrDiiw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">"Season of Discovery was a success beyond our wildest imagination in 2023," Greenfield said. "We learned so much, we grew as a team both literally and figuratively, and we've been invigorated for the future like never before. That future for Season of Discovery is somewhat bittersweet, as we've made the decision to slow down on Season of Discovery and begin work on our next major project in the original WoW design space."</p><p dir="ltr">He said Blizzard has "big plans and big ambitions" for its next WoW Classic project, plans that will require Blizzard to take the time to "get in the proverbial kitchen and cook," he said. Blizzard will use that time to further shape and iterate on ideas from Season of Discovery into "something truly exciting."</p><p dir="ltr">What that next major project will be is still unclear, but many WoW Classic fans are assuming (and hoping) it's what the community, and even Blizzard itself, has for years referred to as Classic+. It's an idea that calls for essentially a new version of WoW Classic with new content like class changes, raids, and zones. Rather than progress to a new expansion and landmass as was the case originally, Classic+ would remain in the core regions of Azeroth and explore locations that never made it into the original version of WoW, like Mount Hyjal and others. In theory, it's something that would be similar to Season of Discovery, but less radical in some of its class changes and intended to continue as an ongoing game rather than a seasonal server meant to run its course.</p><p dir="ltr">Greenfield said the original plan for Season of Discovery, which added new abilities and content to the over 20-year-old original version of WoW, was for it to end with the release of the game's retooled Naxxramas raid and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/one-of-wow-most-famous-pieces-of-cut-content-is-playable-today/1100-6529076/" data-ref-id="1100-6529076">introduction of a new dungeon, the Karazhan Crypts</a>, in January 2025. Instead, the team decided to realize one more unfulfilled dream, releasing an entirely new raid several months later, the Scarlet Enclave.</p><p dir="ltr">It's that new raid where Blizzard is now offering a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzard-is-giving-away-free-wow-classic-mists-of-pandaria-boosts-but-youll-have-to-earn-it/1100-6531833/" data-ref-id="1100-6531833">free level 85 character boost to use in the upcoming Mists of Pandaria Classic</a> for players who defeat its first boss. Greenfield said the character boost serves as a "capstone" for Season of Discovery and a way for players to jump straight into a new version of Classic now that Season of Discovery development is winding down. While development is slowing for Season of Discovery, Greenfield said it has no plans to shut down servers, and that they will remain online for many months if not years to come.</p><p dir="ltr">"When we think of the impact that Season of Discovery will ultimately have on World of Warcraft, we think about how it helped prove something that a lot of us already knew: there is an enormous appetite for new experiences set against the backdrop of original World of Warcraft," Greenfield said.</p>

The battle royale's next live event, titled Death Star Sabotage, kicks off on Saturday, June 7, at 2 PM ET // 11 AM PT / 2 PM ET, and it will have players participate in an organized assault against the planet-killing space station, which has its sights aimed at the island.</p><p>Developer Epic Games doesn't detail what the event will entail in a <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/death-star-sabotage-on-june-7-the-fortnite-live-event-concluding-galactic-battle" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>, but players can queue up for the event two hours before it begins, flying around in X-wings or TIE Fighters as a countdown ticks down. The event will support parties of up to four players.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Fortnite - Galactic Battle Cinematic Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>In the lead-up to the event, Epic Games is providing players with several new goodies and toys to use in battle. Following an update scheduled for May 29, players can enter rift gates in Battle Royale or Zero Build modes to take control of a Star Destroyer's Turbolaser. Players will fire the destructive weapon from orbit, destroying any structures and damaging opponents that its lasers hit.</p><p>Players can redeem an "Assault on the Death Star" loading screen and Captain Phasma's "Quicksilver Baton Spear" as a pickaxe as login rewards between June 3 at 9 AM ET and June 10 at 9 AM ET. Fortnite fans can also nab rewards through Twitch; starting May 29, viewers of any streams by creators with the "Galactic Battle" Twitch extension can earn a bundle of five sprays, each representing a different Star Wars faction, to use in-game.</p><p>Additionally, simply linking your Epic and Twitch accounts will yield you a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnites-darth-jar-jar-skin-takes-a-ridiculous-amount-of-xp-to-unlock/1100-6531655/" data-ref-id="1100-6531655">Darth Jar Jar</a> emoticon. Participants of the Twitch event will also get a loading screen if a community goal is met, and according to Epic, those players "might get a jump on what's coming in Death Star Sabotage."</p><p>Despite its relatively short length, this Star Wars mini-season of Fortnite has been quite eventful, introducing a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnites-ai-darth-vader-voice-draws-union-complaint/1100-6531662/" data-ref-id="1100-6531662">controversial Darth Vader AI character</a> and welcoming mobile players back to the game after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-is-finally-back-on-ios-in-the-us-heres-how-to-download-it/1100-6531696/" data-ref-id="1100-6531696">its return to the iOS App Store</a>. It's unknown what the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-chapter-6-season-3-whats-next-after-star-wars-season-ends/1100-6531797/" data-ref-id="1100-6531797">next season of Fortnite</a> will look like, but rumors suggest the battle royale is shifting from a galaxy far, far away to superhero-themed antics.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/cd-projekt-profits-down-as-cyberpunk-2077-sequel-enters-pre-production.1200732/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cd-projekt-profits-cyberpunk-sequel-pre-production<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>CD Projekt has announced that the tentatively-titled <i>Cyberpunk 2</i>, the upcoming sequel to the hit RPG&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, has officially entered the pre-production phase.</p>

<p>This news comes via CD Projekt's latest <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/wp-content/uploads-en/2025/05/cd-projekt-group-presentation-q1-2025.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">financial presentation</a>, in which it's also revealed that the company's profits are down when compared to last year, although sales revenue has remained largely the same and gross profit is actually up.</p>

<p>Last year, CD Projekt raked in around $26.6 million in profits, while this year, that figure fell to about $22.9 million, a drop of roughly 14%. It's likely not a figure CD Projekt will be losing sleep over, but it's less than ideal.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-cd-projekt-financials-phantom-liberty.jpg?itok=dySG16ih 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-cd-projekt-financials-phantom-liberty.jpg?itok=vuHvA9Mi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>'s sequel has officially entered pre-production.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, given that the company hasn't released any major games since&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>'s&nbsp;<em>Phantom Liberty&nbsp;</em>DLC <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-release-date-revealed" rel="nofollow">back in 2023</a>, it's essentially coasting on back catalog sales and revenue from its GOG.com digital storefront, so a drop isn't necessarily unexpected.</p>

<p>Those back catalog sales are still pretty strong, though, it seems. Back in November, CD Projekt revealed that&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077&nbsp;</em>sales have <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cyberpunk-2077-sales-witcher-production" rel="nofollow">passed the 30 million mark</a>, with the game managing to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cyberpunk-2077-generated-752-million-in-revenue-as-cd-projekt-shares-update-on-its" rel="nofollow">generate $752 million in revenue</a> for its publisher in the 2023 fiscal year alone.</p>

<p>As for the&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk&nbsp;</em>sequel entering pre-production, it could still be a while before we hear anything more about the game, unfortunately. Pre-production is a pretty early stage; it involves prototyping, conceptualizing, and other tasks necessary to get a game ready for full production.</p>

<p>Still, the fact that the sequel is moving ahead is encouraging in and of itself, and given the extensive problems&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077&nbsp;</em>faced at launch, it's probably a good thing if the sequel has a more protracted development process.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-cd-projekt-red-financials-cars.jpg?itok=TEcX6JM2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-cd-projekt-red-financials-cars.jpg?itok=tU5KW9uC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>CD Projekt's profits may be down, but I doubt the company is panicking.</figcaption></figure><p>As for what else lies in CD Projekt's future, the studio is currently working on&nbsp;<em>The Witcher 4</em>, which it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/witcher-4-official-reveal" rel="nofollow">officially unveiled in December</a>. The game will star Ciri as its protagonist, although it's probably a few years off yet, so we don't know too much else about its setup.</p>

<p>Not only that, but a full remake of the original&nbsp;<em>Witcher&nbsp;</em>is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/witcher-remake-announced-by-cd-projekt-red" rel="nofollow">also in the works</a>, with Polish outfit Fool's Theory (which itself counts several ex-<em>Witcher&nbsp;</em>developers among its staff) handling the game's development.</p>

                <p>Former Grand Theft Auto lead developer Leslie Benzies had an ugly exit from Rockstar Games nearly a decade ago when <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-gta-5-exec-suing-take-two-claims-hes-owed-1/1100-6438762/" data-ref-id="1100-6438762">he sued its parent company, Take-Two Interactive</a>. Benzies subsequently co-founded Build a Rocket Boy and developed a GTA-like game called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ex-gta-producers-mindseye-brings-sci-fi-action-to-ps5-this-summer/1100-6529472/" data-ref-id="1100-6529472">MindsEye</a>, which is releasing next month. Now, Build a Rocket Boy co-CEO Mark Gerhard has suggested that the bad word of mouth about MindsEye is part of a "concerted effort" to trash the game and his studio.</p><p>Gerhard recently took part in a Q&amp;A session on Discord (via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mindseye-co-ceo-claims-there-is-a-concerted-effort-by-some-to-trash-the-game-and-the-studio-suggests-people-are-being-paid-or-using-spam-bots-to-post-negative-comments" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>), where he agreed with the potentially explosive allegation that the negative responses to the game "were financed by someone." Gerhard's response to that suggestion was, "100%... Doesn't take much to guess who."</p><p>Although Gerhard didn't back down from his initial implication, he later clarified that he isn't accusing any specific players of being paid to bad mouth the game.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbhEMXn_osc" data-width="854" data-height="480" data-video-start="23">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/rbhEMXn_osc?start=23" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"I just said that there is a concerted effort by some people that don't want to see Leslie or Build A Rocket Boy to be successful that are making a concerted effort to trash the game and the studio. Its [sic] pretty easy to see the bots and the repeated replies to any content that we put out."</p><p>Gerhard went on to suggest that "there are bot farms posting negative comments and dislikes" for MindsEye, but didn't elaborate beyond that.</p><p>MindsEye will be released on June 10 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. The game puts players in control of Jacob Diaz, a former soldier who has a implant in his head that's called the MindsEye. That device gives Jacob the ability to control drones and a few other tricks. It also shows him glimpses of a mission he can't remember, which results in an unknown faction attempting to kill him before he can piece that part of his past together.</p>

            <p>A Death Stranding anime is in the pipeline.</p>
<p>The news was confirmed by the game's creator <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hideo-kojima">Hideo Kojima</a>, who when discussing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-is-getting-a-movie-adaptation">the upcoming live-action Death Stranding film</a> with <a href="https://www.vogue.co.jp/article/my-view-hideo-kojima-game-creater">Vogue Japan</a>, casually slipped in that an anime adaption is also in the works.</p>

<p>"I am currently working with A24 on a live-action film adaptation of Death Stranding," Kojima said (translated by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/a-death-stranding-anime-is-in-the-works-hideo-kojima-confirms/">VGC</a>). "When it comes to adapting games into visual media, there are works like The Last of Us, which stays true to the original storyline, and films like The Super Mario Bros Movie which are more of a service to fans of the game.</p>
<p>"While these works have their own merits, as a film enthusiast, I want to pursue the expressive potential of cinema. I aim to create a Death Stranding that can only be realised through film, one that could win awards at festivals like the Cannes Film Festival or the Venice Film Festival. In fact, we are also currently working on an anime adaptation."</p>
<p>So, there you have it! One Death Stranding anime coming up, although for now we don't know when.</p>
<p>As for the film adaptation, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kojima-productions-announces-partnership-with-a24-for-death-stranding-movie">Kojima announced his company was partnering with A24 in December 2023</a>. A24 is the production and distribution company behind the likes of Everything Everywhere All At One and Hereditary, so it sounds like a good match for Kojima.</p>
<p>More recently, it was reported <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-movie-reportedly-being-helmed-by-a-quiet-place-day-one-director">A Quiet Place: Day One's Michael Sarnoski was attached to write and direct the Death Stranding adaptation</a>.</p>

</figure>
<p>But, while all of this is going on behind the scenes, we have Death Stranding's sequel releasing via PS5 next month, on 25th June.</p>
<p>"<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a> is clearly a labour of love, filled with carefully balanced gameplay systems, exceptional visuals, and extraneous details and secret scenes," our Ed wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-big-death-stranding-2-preview-how-a-big-dollop-of-metal-gear-is-expanding-kojimas-bizarre-epic">Eurogamer's Death Stranding 2 preview</a>. "I still don't know why we shouldn't have connected, but in this instance I'm glad I did."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Following the dire days of the Wii U, the company came out swinging with a tablet-console hybrid with defining games like <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em> and <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em>. The Switch went on to sell more than 150 million units, and Nintendo built on that success with expansions into feature films, theme parks, and other areas outside of gaming.</p><p>Now, the company is trying to do it again with the Switch 2. Ahead of the new console‚Äôs launch on June 5th, <em>The Verge</em> is looking back at the various ways that Nintendo has changed over the last eight years and how those changes might continue into its next generation.</p></section><section id="updates-section"><ul><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6NjcxNjU4" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/671658/nintendo-switch-indie-games-eshop-legacy">The Nintendo Switch was an indie game haven, until it was overrun with slop</a></h2><div><p><cite>Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge</cite></p></div><div><p>The first several months after Nintendo released the Switch in 2017 have been described as <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-nintendo-switch-indie-gold-rush">a ‚Äúgold rush‚Äù for independent game developers</a>. The Switch‚Äôs eShop wasn‚Äôt exactly barren, but early on there was a lot of room for new releases. To put it into perspective, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200603111823/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Put0Dtck164">Nintendo announced in 2018</a> that around 1,000 games were added to the platform in its first year or so. The number of games released each year just adds to the number of games available on the eShop; in 2024, <a href="https://newsletter.gamediscover.co/p/revealed-the-biggest-switch-eshop">GameDiscoverCo reported that 50 games were added per week</a>, leading to more than 2,300 new games in 2024 by November.</p><p>What started as a gold rush for indie developers slowly spoiled, and eventually the eShop became overrun with slop.

In retrospect, it‚Äôs easy to see why: it‚Äôs a device that seamlessly transitions from a home console to a handheld, erasing the distinction between the two. It‚Äôs been so successful that Nintendo isn‚Äôt changing all that much with the Switch 2. But both consoles are well-executed versions of ideas Nintendo has been working on since the failed Wii U ‚Äî and maybe even earlier.</p><p>Purely by sales numbers, the Wii U was a flop. The Switch has sold more than 150 million units in its eight-year lifetime. The Wii U, by comparison, sold 13.56 million units ‚Äî less than a 10th of what the Switch did ‚Äî making it Nintendo‚Äôs worst-selling home console.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/671323/nintendo-switch-2-wii-u-technology-games">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6NjcxOTQ5" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/671949/nintendo-switch-2-era-risks">Nintendo‚Äôs bold new era is full of safe bets</a></h2><div><p><cite>Image: Cath Virginia / The Verge, Nintendo</cite></p></div><div><p>Nintendo is entering a new era.
