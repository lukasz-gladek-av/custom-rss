            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/another-crabs-treasure-new-game-plus-update<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Another Crab's Treasure&nbsp;</em>developer Aggro Crab has announced that the game is getting a major update later this month, and it'll bring some oft-requested features like New Game Plus, a new boss, and more.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1887840/view/507324341817443971" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on Steam, Aggro Crab says the update, which is "slightly earlier than our 1 year anniversary", will finally add a New Game Plus mode to last year's cartoony Soulslike adventure when it lands on April 21st.</p>

<p>Aggro Crab goes on to say that the mode doesn't "just lazily scale up enemy stats and call it a day", but instead adds new moves to certain bosses, new items, and remixes to "almost every enemy encounter in the game", plus a higher threshold for upgrading your fork and stowaway weight.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/another-crabs-treasure-new-game-plus-update-boss.jpg?itok=1Jv8E5I8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/another-crabs-treasure-new-game-plus-update-boss.jpg?itok=cmsScLS5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Another Crab's Treasure&nbsp;</em>is getting a big update later this month.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as New Game Plus, the update is also bringing the ability to confront any boss you've already fought again, and you'll be able to do so from any of the game's Moon Snail Shell checkpoints (think&nbsp;<em>Dark Souls</em>' bonfires).</p>

<p>A new Boss Rush mode will also be made available, allowing you to take on bosses in "a variety of themed sequential fights" and win rewards like new costumes.</p>

<p>You'll also now find a Bestiary within the newly-reopened Museum, allowing you to see the range of enemies you've taken on as part of your journey through&nbsp;<em>Another Crab's Treasure</em>'s underwater kingdom.</p>

<p>Excitingly, a new boss fight has also been added. Aggro Crab stops just short of revealing said boss, but does say it'll be a "well deserved fight". Hmm.</p>




<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Another Crab's Treasure</em>, it's a Soulslike that melds the genre's classic third-person lock-on combat with 3D platforming elements and a greater emphasis on a linear narrative.</p>

<p>The game, which sees you playing as timid hermit crab Kril, was popular following its release, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/another-crabs-treasure-sales" rel="nofollow">racking up 150,000 sales</a> within just a couple of weeks of its launch.</p>

            <p>A little pigeon, huh? <a href="https://x.com/rosaslutzemburg/status/1655706412977209344">And she's your pal!</a> Well, isn't that great. <a href="https://x.com/tenstackstudios">Tenstack</a> are a tiny Swedish studio on a mission to make "digestible games so people won't choke playing them". They're currently making a new small game every 3 months, the latest of which is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/little-wings-deliveries">Little Wings Deliveries</a>. It's under a fiver, under an hour, and is maybe the third or fourth game at this point to have a skateboarding pigeon in. I do not mind. I have a headache. The soothing coos and soothing faceplants of a skateboarding pigeon are just what I need right now.</p>

<p>You play as Skye, a purple pigeon that's decided to stand out from her scavenging brethren by getting a bloody job, bless her. On her way to the Royal Postal Academy, you'll visit floating islands, grind, fly, meet weirdo inhabitants, and collect various objects of note. "Embark on a short, playful adventure in your cozy flying boat and sail through fluffy clouds," reads <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3457390/Little_Wings_Deliveries/">Steam</a>. "Discover floating islands and befriend their quirky citizens. Jump, roll, climb, and skate through Cloudburg."</p>
<p>Featuring:</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Around 30 minutes to 1 hour of playtime!</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Sail through the clouds with your flying boat!</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Explore 5 different tiny flying islands!</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Meet a small cast of quirky characters!</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Collect cool items like a skateboard, selfie stick, and more!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I could berate this pigeon for building a wooden sky raft instead of using her perfectly good wings, but this is the kind of avian innovation we should be praising. The more calories the pigeons save, the less disastrous chippy assaults. Nicely done, Skye.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Back in 2020, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/half-life-alyx">Half-Life: Alyx</a> developer Robin Walker <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-half-life-alyx-interview">told Katharine</a> (RPS in peace) that one of the hardest things in first-person shooter development is persuading people to look up. "One of the problems you always run into in an FPS is that players are really good at looking horizontally with their mouse, but they don't look up and down nearly as much," said Walker. "You've really got to work to make a player look up in FPS games."</p>
<p>You will definitely need to look up in Orbifold, a forthcoming shooter project from Hi-Rez programmer Chris Cullen. In this Unreal Engine 5 creation, firefights take place inside a giant, verdant ball akin to a miniature Dyson Sphere, but with no captive star. Players are gravitationally rooted to the exterior of the ball, meaning you can run all the way around the inside. There are also Halo-style launchers that punt you directly through the middle. Here's a slice of very WIP footage featuring some airborne android nuisances.</p><!--more-->

Cullen has been working on Orbifold in his spare time for a few years. The game doesn't have a store page or presskit just yet, though Cullen did show it off at <a href="https://events.humanitix.com/indie-game-showcase-2024">an event in Auckland, New Zealand last year</a>. I've scraped together a few more details from the project's <a href="https://x.com/OrbifoldGame/">Xitter feed</a>, with the stern caveat that all of this is, again, in a state of evolution, and that certain features might be abandoned.
</p><p>Cullen mentions rivers that flow around the inside of the sphere, tunnels and elevators beneath the surface, an upgrades system, various enemy android classes, co-op multiplayer, and a level editor that could be released alongside the game. Among the recent reveals is a Saturn Blast ability that lets you palm strike yourself skyward - this reminds me of Pharah's Concussive Blast in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a>. Catch a video of it below.</p>

<p>Most tempting of all, for my money, are Cullen's ideas for grenades. He envisages slapstick varieties that launch attackers right across the sphere. You can imagine a co-op scenario where players punt groups of foes back and forth as though playing robot tennis.</p>
<p>You can imagine all kinds of things. Come, let us bask in the glow of hypotheticals. I'd love to see a Halo Warthog driver attempt to make sense of these conditions. I'd love to see players, enemies and pieces of debris getting stuck in a Lagrangian point at the sphere's centre. Ah, Lawbreakers, you died too young. A little less explosively, the playspace also recalls the ringworld from the amazing <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/outer-wilds">Outer Wilds</a> DLC expansion Echoes Of The Eye.</p>
<p> Hopefully Cullen will treat us to a proper announcement in the not-too-distant future. I'm not sure what exactly he does at Hi-Rez Studios, but it's obviously worth noting that, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/paladins">Paladins</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/smite">Smite</a> aside, Hi-Rez are the creators of the momentous, gravity-snubbing FPS Tribes: Ascend. They sold the rights to that series to a spin-off subsidiary, Prophecy Games, in 2019. Prophecy released Tribes 3: Rivals in 2023, but it didn't set the internet alight and the developers have now <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tribes-3-rivals-already-in-trouble-as-developers-shift-focus-elsewhere">shifted their attention elsewhere</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Nintendo has confirmed Animal Crossing: New Horizon players will be able to transfer their island save data from the original Switch to the all-new <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a>, without having to download an additional app or use a cloud save.</p>
<p>This handy little nugget comes from Nintendo Switch 2 director Takuhiro Dohta.</p>

<p>"When you do the system transfer, everything like save data will remain on the Nintendo Switch and once it moves to the Nintendo Switch 2 as well," Dohta told <a href="https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/553410/acnh-animal-crossing-new-horizons-island-transfer">Polygon</a>, before adding:</p>
<p>"But the [Animal Crossing] island will be an actual move. So it will leave Nintendo Switch and move over to Nintendo Switch 2."</p>
<p>At the present time, if players want to transfer their island to a different Switch console, they have two options. The first is to download the Island Transfer Tool, which is a Nintendo Switch app which will facilitate both the transfer of full New Horizons' save files or individual player accounts from the game.</p>
<p>The second way is Nintendo's cloud saving and island recovery option, which allows players to upload their island and save data to the internet.</p>
<p>So, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/animal-crossing-cloud-saving-island-recovery-transfer-new-horizons-7018">both current Switch options are perfectly do-able</a>, it sounds like transferring an island to Switch 2 is going to be far more straightforward.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-impressions/">The Nintendo Switch 2</a> will obviously not be able to offer the same visual quality as the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X, but so far, it's been shown that it is doing a pretty good job of turning in PS4-level visuals with some select enhancements.</p>
<p>During the latest episode of their weekly podcasts, the tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> compared the gameplay footage of Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade, Hogwarts Legacy, and Elden Ring running on Nintendo Switch shown during last week's Direct with PlayStation 4 footage, highlighting some interesting findings.</p>
<p>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade on Nintendo Switch 2 is comparable to the PlayStation 4 version in terms of resolution and general image quality, but the game benefits from the lighting changes introduced in the Intergrade version, which is not available on Sony's previous-generation console, resulting in much better visuals in some scenarios. Hogwarts Legacy's case is even more interesting, as the game looks somewhat better on Nintendo Switch 2 than on PlayStation 4 with a much sharper and less aliased image despite the lower resolution, 720p vs 1080 upscaled with AMD FSR 1, which suggests that the Switch 2 version may be using a different temporal upscaling solution that returns better image quality.</p>
<p>Of the three games, Elden Ring on Nintendo Switch 2 is the game that looks the closest to the PlayStation 4 version, sporting a similar resolution and only slightly higher shadow drawing distance, although the comparison was limited by the bad quality footage available and the difficulty of recreating similar shots. These early comparisons not only highlight how the upcoming console can deliver PS4-level visuals but also how it can deliver better ones, not only because of more modern hardware but also because late ports give the developers the chance to make different choices that can lead to better results, as the Alien Isolation Switch port highlighted a while back by sporting a different image treatment with TAA over the other console versions which delivered better image quality.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Nintendo Switch 2 could deliver significantly better experiences in multiplatform ports than base PlayStation 4 thanks to the console's 120 Hz screen. Up until now, 40 FPS modes and HDR support have been considered as some sort of "bonus" modes since 120 Hz panels with HDR support are not standardized, but the Nintendo Switch 2 screen does, meaning that it's very likely we will see 40 FPS modes and HDR support frequently in games. With the console potentially being used more in handheld mode, the 120 Hz is a massive boon, as more advanced ports will have a hard time hitting 60 FPS at 1080p resolution, making a 720p resolution game running at 40 FPS in handheld mode a much better experience than running at 30 FPS.</p>

<p>A new report has revealed that Michael Sarnoski, the director behind <em>A Quiet Place: Day</em> One will be directing the new Death Stranding movie.</p>



<p>The new report comes from <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/04/death-stranding-movie-michael-sarnoski-a24-1236360094/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Deadline</a>, who say that Michael Sarnoski will be the director and writing of the live-action adaptation of Hideo Kojima’s video game&nbsp;Death Stranding. Sarnoski ‘broke out’ with his movie ‘Pig’ that starred Nicolas Cage. Shortly after, Sarnoski went on to direct ‘<em>A Quiet Place: Day</em> One’, grossing more then $250 million worldwide.</p>



<p>The Death Stranding movie was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/death-stranding-film-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first announced in 2022</a> and will be a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kojima-partners-with-a24-for-death-stranding-movie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">partnership project between Hideo Kojima and film studio A24</a>. Details on the movie are still unclear, but Kojima has said&nbsp;he’s “aiming for a more arthouse approach” with the movie.</p>



<p>Those comments might make a bit more sense if you’re familiar with A24’s past movies, including the likes of ‘The Witch’ and ‘Everything Everywhere All at Once’.</p>



<p>Death Stranding the movie hasn’t currently had any announcements as to who the film will star, but for those hoping that Normal Reedus will reprise his role, it’s likely not to happen. </p>



<p>According to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/death-stranding-film-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previous information</a> reported by Deadline, the movie will focus on a story set apart from the content found within the games, introducing all-new ‘elements and characters’ within the existing universe of Death Stranding.</p>



<p>The original game see’s the player control Sam Porter Bridges (portrayed by Normal Reedus) as he’s tasked with supplier isolated outposts and colonies with a wireless communications network so they can be reconnected. It’s set in the United States, where an unknown event has caused the planet to be a shell of its former self, where creatures of the unknown roam. </p>

<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong developers have confirmed that the game will also be released on the original Nintendo Switch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Matthew Griffin, who handles Marketing and Publishing for Hollow Knight: Silksong, recently took to <a href="https://x.com/griffinmatta/status/1909395467945099502" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) to clear up the confusion. After the game appeared during the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct, many players were worried that it would be only available on the upcoming console. However, Griffin’s latest tweet confirms, “Hollow Knight: Silksong is coming to both Nintendo Switch and the Nintendo Switch 2.”</p>



<p>With the confirmation of Switch 1, Hollow Knight: Silksong is now confirmed on all the leading platforms, including PC via Steam, PlayStation 5, Xbox and Nintendo Switch. Moreover, when it releases, Hollow Knight: Silksong will be available as a <a href="https://x.com/XboxGamePass/status/1907487462840029397" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Day One</a> title on Xbox Game Pass. However, the developers have yet to provide a release date for the game; we only know that it is slated to be released in 2025.</p>

The game follows a traditional, hand-crafted, 2D art style that beautifully encompasses unique environments like Gilded cities, Lakes of fire, and misted moors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Regarding combat, players will find 150 all-new foes that need to be taken down, ranging from beasts, hunters, assassins, kings, monsters and knights. They must use their newly learned silken abilities while crafting more lethal weapons to overcome these challenges.&nbsp;</p>

purchase. Customers in the US who want to purchase a Switch 2 through the My Nintendo Store have to <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/how-to-buy/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">register their interest</a> to receive an invitation to preorder the console. Nintendo will be prioritizing invitations for users who have had an active Nintendo Switch Online membership for a minimum of 12 months, as well as at least 50 hours of gameplay.</p><p>"Our motivation there, with the number of hours played, was really to reward our most loyal players and give them a chance to queue up first and have an opportunity to purchase the product." Bowser said of Nintendo's preorder system, noting that Nintendo's various retail partners will each have their own preorder system in place. Nintendo's system should, theoretically, also limit the ability of scalpers to buy up inventory for resale. </p><p>While originally scheduled for April 9, Switch 2 preorders have been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/" data-ref-id="1100-6530531">temporarily delayed</a> for US customers while Nintendo assesses the "potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions."</p>

GAME will not offer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> pre-orders in stores, Eurogamer understands. 
</p>
<p>
The beleagured brand, once a familiar sight on the high street, will instead have a "small allocation" of consoles available to pre-order via the company's website. That's according to the chain's internal communication to staff, as seen by Eurogamer.
</p>
<p>
Following various cuts and changes to GAME's offering made over the past two years by owner Frasers Group, the brand now largely exists as a concession area in other stores such as Sports Direct.

In other GAME news, staff tell Eurogamer of a fresh internal shakeup by Frasers Group. The decision has been made to shut GAME's head office and main warehouse in Basingstoke, where the brand has been headquartered for more than two decades, with the loss of further jobs expected. 
</p>
<p>Eurogamer has contacted Frasers Group for comment.</p>

            <p>
I fondly cherish my many memories of claustrophobia, confusion and terror in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-siege">Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege</a>. I can't get enough of the experience of being lodged behind the furniture like some teenager's hurriedly hidden copy of Loaded (or whatever the kids are reading now), rifle pivoting wildly between barricaded doors and windows, as enemy players bustle around the roof like awful, C4-toting pigeons.</p>
<p>Still, every now and then I do feel the urge for some kind of proper, real-time tactical overview. Don't we have drones for that, Mr Clancy? As such, I'm moderately pleased to hear that Ubisoft are working on a top-down turn-based game set in the Rainbow Six universe.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The rumour in question comes from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-turn-based-game/">Insider Gaming</a>, who appear to have access to a whole wardrobe full of Ubisoft's dirty laundry, and are now skulking inside that wardrobe with a shotgun. The project is allegedly one or two years from release. As it stands, it's said to play a lot like XCOM, but with fixtures and a "loop" borrowed from Siege: you'll pick operators based on their skills to raid buildings and save hostages, all the Clancy favourites. It's said to last approximately 25-30 hours. The report has been corroborated by Kotaku's Ethan Gach, who adds in <a href="https://deadgame.substack.com/p/the-switch-2-is-having-an-xbox-moment">the latest Dead Game newsletter</a> that the project is codenamed <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/slice-and-dice">Slice &amp; Dice</a> and is led by Elie Benhamou, the game director for Ghost Recon: Breakpoint.
</p>
<p>
The estimable Rock Paper Shotgun verdict on Breakpoint was that it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wot-i-think-ghost-recon-breakpoint">broadly sucked arse</a>, despite a meticulously-woven open world. The rumoured "Slice &amp; Dice" concept seems promising, however, particularly if it can incorporate all the tricky things Siege players do with destructible surfaces. 
</p>
<p>
Assuming the reports are legit, I imagine the major worry for the project's developers right now is the potential impact of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tencent-hand-ubisoft-a-big-wad-of-cash-to-spin-out-assassins-creed-far-cry-and-rainbow-six-as-a-separate-business">Ubisoft's carving out of a new Tencent-backed subsidiary for their most profitable games</a> - that's Assassin's Creed, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/far-cry">Far Cry</a>, and Rainbow Six.</p>
<p>We're still waiting for a proper, top-down tactical overview of how this subsidiary will be run: the deal covers studios in Montreal, Quebec, Sherbrooke, Saguenay, Barcelona, and Sofia, but the number of individual developers involved remains to be determined. It's also not clear how developers might move back and forth between the new subsidiary and the rest of Ubisoft: Siege's development is led by Ubisoft Montreal, but features contributions from teams based in Toronto, Kyiv, Shanghai and Chengdu.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/path-of-exile-2">Path of Exile 2</a> developer Grinding Gear Games has acknowledged feedback to its Dawn of the Hunt update from players frustrated with the game's slow pace.</p>
<p>The update, <a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3740562">0.2.0</a>, arrived last week with a wealth of new content and a new playable character class, the Huntress. Simultaneously, the developer nerfed plenty of abilities and made other changes to tweak the endgame, many of which have unintentionally impacted the main campaign.</p>
<p>Now Grinding Gear Games has <a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3746205">released a post</a> detailing new and forthcoming changes to appease fans, as development continues in early access.</p>

<p>"Many people are reporting that gameplay is feeling too slow," the developer acknowledged. "Sometimes this comes in the form of people saying that monster life is too high, or player damage is too low, or areas are taking too long. In this post we will talk about some of the things we have already done, and more of the changes we are planning on making."</p>
<p>Having nerfed minion damage and life, these will now be increased to a level similar to before the update, while retaining the new scaling for the endgame.</p>
<p>Monster health has also already been dropped by 25 percent to alleviate clearspeed concerns.</p>
<p>The developer is also looking into the size of environments, with players criticising their large size. "Many players are reporting that areas feel like they are too large," wrote the developer. "Normally when this is the case, the main reason is due to other concerns such as monster life or player damage being incorrect, or just a lack of entertaining content in the area. However, we are checking to see if there are any outliers that players are spending too long in to see if any changes to area size need to happen."</p>
<p>Additionally, the developer is making changes to its new Huntress class, following concerns the power of the class is locked behind the parry mechanic. As such, a new skill will be added to provide Frenzy charges without needing to parry, though this will be carefully balanced to still reward those using the mechanic.</p>
<p>Further, the feel of the parry itself will be improved and spear throws will be buffed to incentivise players alternate more between ranged and melee playstyles.</p>
<p>Server side crashes have been approximately six times higher in this update, but the developer noted these are "significantly easier for us to debug" so should be fixed imminently.</p>
<p>Lastly, quality of life features are on the way such as bookmarking locations on the map, and adding stash tab affinities for more item types.</p>
<p>It's hoped these changes will address concerns from players, with the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PathOfExile2/">game's subreddit</a> full of memes and frustration. Perhaps the game's most famous player, Elon Musk, however, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/themayormccheese/comments/1jt42f8/elon_musk_tried_to_prove_hes_a_real_gamer_by/">attempted to play from his private jet and died to the tutorial boss</a>.</p>
<p>Still, Grinding Gear Games is attempting to give Path of Exile 2 more demanding combat in comparison to its biggest competition, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/diablo-iv">Diablo 4</a>. Indeed, Eurogamer's Bertie described "Souslike thrills" in his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/path-of-exile-2-early-access-review">Path of Exile 2 early access review</a>.</p>
<p>As for the full release of the game, there's a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/path-of-exile-2s-full-release-has-a-65-chance-of-arriving-this-year-says-grinding-gear-games-so-what-could-go-wrong">65 percent chance it will be released this year</a>, according to game director Jonathan Rogers.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Mouse Work is a fun-looking <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Nintendo Switch 2</a> exclusive that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/shovel-knight-dig">Shovel Knight Dig</a> developer Nitrome began work on in January, just four months ago, following Nintendo's first Switch 2 trailer. 
</p>
<p>
Remember in that trailer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-trailer-appears-to-confirm-joy-con-mouse-functionality">how we got a glimpse of a Joy-Con 2 controller zooming along a flat surface</a>? This prompted whispers that Switch 2 would include mouse controls - which, of course, we now know that it does! And it was this hunch that prompted Nitrome to begin work.
</p>
<p>
"The truth is that this project has been developed very rapidly after assuming the mouse mode rumour was true from the January Direct," Nitrome founder Mat Annal told Eurogamer, following the launch of Mouse Work's first trailer - which has already been positively compared to Switch 1 launch title SnipperClips.

<p>
Like SnipperClips, Mouse Work is an indie game from a British studio with experience in Flash development - and it's this background which has enabled Nitrome to make such fast progress, Annal continued. 
</p>
<p>
"We have a background in making games in one month back in the browser days so we are used to working fast," Annal told me, adding that the team was aiming to get Mouse Work ready as soon as possible for the Switch 2's launch window.
</p>
<p>
Mouse Work sees one to four players completing quick mini-games using mouse controls, with more than a dozen shown in the game's reveal trailer, above. There's a distinctive visual style to the project, too, reminiscent of Nintendo's own mini-game compilation, WarioWare. It's definitely one to keep an eye on.
</p>
<p>
Nitrome won <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shovel-knight-dig-a-great-series-safe-in-the-hands-of-the-very-best">praise for its work on Shovel Knight Dig</a>, as well as other past titles such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gunbrick-reloaded-an-ingenious-platformer-gets-a-new-direction">Gunbrick:Reloaded</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bomb-chicken-review-a-blast-from-the-past-that-doesnt-quite-fill-you-up">Bomb Chicken</a>. For more from Annal, Eurogamer previously chatted with Nitrome's founder for a look at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/why-the-spirit-of-flash-gaming-must-never-die">why the spirit of Flash gaming should never die</a>.

Arrowhead Games Studio CEO Shams Jorjani has criticised other games industry executives for letting rank-and-file developers take the fall for what he styles "very unsound business decisions" over the past two years.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
An extremely compressed recap: tens of thousands of people have lost their jobs across companies like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/embracer-have-laid-off-8-of-their-global-workforce-since-their-restructuring-began">Embracer</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-toss-another-650-jobs-onto-the-layoff-pyre-in-the-name-of-sustainable-future-growth">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-lay-off-another-185-people-and-shutter-one-of-the-studios-behind-star-wars-outlaws-and-the-division-2">Ubisoft</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sega-sells-company-of-heroes-developer-relic-and-lays-off-more-staff-at-creative-assembly-and-hardlight">Sega</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sony-announce-900-layoffs-across-naughty-dog-guerilla-insomniac-and-playstation-studios-worldwide">PlayStation</a> in the past year alone, as the industry's beefiest operators <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-do-we-stop-the-next-round-of-games-industry-mass-layoffs">struggle to meet the expectations of investors and repay debts</a> following a period of expansion kindled by a gaming boom during the worldwide Covid pandemic lockdowns. Much-hyped, functionally bogus new technologies such as NFTs, cryptocurrency and generative AI have yet to fill the hole, so costs are being cut instead.
</p>
<p>
Arrowhead's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> is one of last year's big success stories, despite not having much buzz around it before launch. For all that, and despite <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/when-helldivers-2-was-at-its-lowest-arrowhead-looked-to-hello-games-and-no-mans-sky-to-keep-their-chin-up">very public difficulty keeping up with an unexpectedly large audience</a>, Jorjani says he's not interested in significant studio expansion. "I want us to be a role model for how to do sustainable growth, because the industry today is not in a good place," he told <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/helldivers-2s-big-challenge-how-to">The Game Business</a> (HELLO DRINGO) in an interview last week. 
</p>
<p>
"A lot of companies are shedding a lot of jobs. And it's not the people at the top that are losing their jobs, it's people who have moved half across the world to take jobs. And that's because of bad growth decisions made by business leaders who have taken stupid risks."
</p>
<p>
Jorjani had more vitriol to share elsewhere in the chat.  "I wish that our industry hadn't shed almost... 30, 40, 50,000 jobs over the past two years," he said. "A lot of people at the top were making very unsound business decisions, and there's very little accountability on their part. Who among these executives is stepping down? Or slashing their salaries?
</p>
<p>
"What's happening is that regular developers, are paying the cost of that. That's a terrible way to run our industry. Just because you can hire and triple in size in six months, doesn't mean you should. Or that it's the best thing for the studio's long term business health.
</p>
<p>
"I'm not saying don't grow, but do it in a way where you don't have to then let go of one third of the company because you made stupid decisions. I'm not going to hire a hundred people., I would like to do that and help people in the industry, but my first priority is to make sure that people have jobs for many years." 
</p>
<p>I've written up a bunch of stories about industry layoffs, rich with rhetoric about not taking decisions "lightly" and "aligning" for success. It's rare that the executives quoted in those announcements fall on their swords, or even lightly graze themselves with their swords in the form of some reduced annual compensation. The only caveat I will offer is that executive pay structures can be rather byzantine: many are paid partly in stock. As XenoFear points out below, this also means that their incomes are tethered to the overall financial performance of the company rather than whether they can keep individual developers employed.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-act-two-expansion-mod-showcased-in-teaser-trailer/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Thanks to Larian's decision to <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-mod-downloads-are-at-5-4-million-in-just-four-days/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">release official mod tools for Baldur's Gate 3</a>, several interesting custom campaigns are currently being worked on. One of them, called Act Two Expansion, has received an intriguing teaser trailer from its creator, SquallyDaBeanz.</p>
<p>According to the modder, Baldur's Gate 3: Act Two Expansion adds a whole new region to the game that players can access between Acts 2 and 3. The area includes new areas, dungeons, encounters, items, secrets, puzzles, and lore. The mod aims to provide a whole new region to experience, similar in scope to the Wilderness of Act 1. It is meant to be sandboxy, focusing on combat and exploration rather than story. There will be some new notes, though, expanding on the lore of this region.</p>
<p>The mod takes place after the player leaves the Shadow Cursed Lands but before you reach Baldur's Gate. With the Absolute's army on the march, the main character and their party must find a way to cross the Chionthar River before taking part in an epic battle against the Absolute's army at Rivington.</p>
<p>Baldur's Gate 3: Act Two Expansion is balanced for level 8–10 characters. According to its creator, most mods should be compatible with it, except for those that modify the Shadow Cursed Lands levels and/or level templates. Multiplayer, on the other hand, should be perfectly supported as long as everyone in the group has it installed.</p>
<p>Baldur's Gate 3 supports cross-platform mods, but the creator says this mod wouldn't pass the approval process for consoles, so do not expect to find it there. The current goal is to release it before the end of the year.</p>

The modder is also working on Forsaken, a custom Baldur's Gate 3 campaign that seeks to recreate World of Warcraft's undead starting zone of Tirisfal Glades. A teaser level is already available <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/14844" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Nexus</a>.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> game cartridges taste horrible, Nintendo has confirmed, just like Switch 1.</p>
<p>This may sound like a silly thing to write about (because why is someone tasting a Switch 2 game?) but, once again, the bad-tasting Switch cartridge coating is a safety measure.</p>
<p>Original Switch games are coated in denatonium benzoate, which on <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Support/Nintendo-Switch/FAQ/After-touching-a-Nintendo-Switch-game-card-my-hand-has-a-strange-bitter-taste-Could-this-be-harmful-/After-touching-a-Nintendo-Switch-game-card-my-hand-has-a-strange-bitter-taste-Could-this-be-harmful-1204008.html?srsltid=AfmBOorBwyOUad4PwhRea2L1pf4c0Yx4LyMH_5sVFlmjF7WNVHysxrXC">Nintendo's own support page</a>, the team describes this as "a bitter-tasting substance". But don't worry, it isn't harmful to your health. It is often used in those polishes that are meant to deter wearers from biting their nails (a tactic my parents' deployed on me when I was younger, I can still recall the taste very well).</p>

<p>"We don't want anybody to be at risk of any unwanted consumption," Nintendo Switch 2 director Takuhiro Dohta explained to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-carts-still-taste-bad-designed-purposefully-to-be-spat-out/1100-6530649/">GameSpot</a>.</p>
<p>Nintendo had "indeed made it so that if [a Switch 2 game card] enters your mouth, you'll spit it out", Dohta continued. While I assume the likes of you and I would know instinctively not to pop a game into our mouths, small children may not think along those same lines. </p>
<p>Continuing, Dohta said he would not advise even trying just a cursory lick of a Switch 2 cartridge, no matter how tempting it may seem.</p>
<p>Nintendo Switch 2 producer Kouichi Kawamoto also joined in with the 'why you shouldn't pop a game cart into your mouth' conversation, stating he did indeed lick an original Switch game, but only once and once was more than enough.</p>
<p>"Never again," Kawamoto said, "I can't believe that other people are trying that."</p>

<p>After months of fans awaiting news on the game's release, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silksong-release-window-finally-narrowed-down">Silksong appeared briefly at last week's Switch 2 Direct</a> confirming its release on the new console and a launch window of 2025. It doesn't narrow down the date, but it at least confirms the game remains on the way.</p>
<p>Some fans presumed this meant the game was a Switch 2 exclusive, but Team Cherry's marketing boss Matthew Griffin confirmed on social media Silksong is coming to both Switch consoles.</p>

<p>As one response reads: "...anywhere else?". Silksong is also set for release across PC (Steam), Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PS4, and PS5.</p>
<p>Last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-lists-hollow-knight-silksong-as-part-of-incredible-upcoming-indie-line-up-and-i-am-acting-totally-normal-about-that">Xbox listed the game in a recent Xbox Wire post focused on its lineup of indie games</a>. And while an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksong-is-real-progressing-and-will-release-says-team-cherry">ARG on the release date was debunked</a> at the start of the year, Griffin confirmed at the time "the game is real, progressing and will release".</p> <div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/mistfall-hunter-a-fantasy-pvpve-action-rpg-announces-new-steam-beta-test-for-late-april/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Mistfall Hunter, an upcoming dark fantasy PvPvE extraction action RPG, is continuing its journey to launch. Originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/mistfall-hunter-is-a-dark-fantasy-soulslike-extraction-rpg-coming-to-pc-and-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> last October during an Xbox Partner Preview event, the game will soon open up for a second beta test on Steam.</p>
<p>The developer from Bellring Games <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3282300/Mistfall_Hunter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> that the second CBT will begin on April 22, 2025, at 01:00 UTC. They also shared plenty of details on the new content and feature additions that players can expect there.</p>
<p>A new class called Reverent Seer will be available to select. These characters use Catalysts to attack or cast spells, making them the first class in Mistfall Hunter with support capabilities. They can also summon supportive runes called Rune Pillars for healing, shielding, and stealth. There are offensive runes, too, that continuously attack, blind, or bind enemies. Furthermore, they're even equipped with a death-prevention spell, which can be incredibly helpful when used at the right time.</p>
<p>The Closed Beta Test will introduce a vast new region north of Brandrgarde. The Forge, where Master Smith Vronn once toiled tirelessly, is now home only to the craftsmen and laborers who have become the Corroded alongside its eternal furnace fires. The developer said that Brandrgarde would simply be too large with these new areas, so they have split the entire fortress into two maps. You'll be placed in one of these two at random in each session.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Mistfall Hunter now supports Solo Mode as well. The maps are the same, though Bellring changed the placement of monsters to accommodate for the different gameplay compared to Trio Mode. Speaking of monsters, there are some new foes to fight: the Warden, the Prison Guard, the Nightwatcher, and the Penitent.</p>
<p>After collecting enough resources, it'll also be possible to upgrade&nbsp;various features in your camp to gain benefits such as increased healing from the Springhorn, increased Warehouse capacity, a higher Gylden Jar limit, and more. In addition, the Warehouse has been upgraded to an account-shared storage facility, which is helpful when playing multiple classes.</p>
<p>There's more: class balance, progression tweaks, performance improvements (including lowered system requirements), and brand new features such as a Friends system, a Fill Team system, an in-game emote system, a Journey system, and real-time voice chat have been added to this new build.</p>
<p>Mistfall Hunter does not have a release date yet, but it is slated to launch this year on PC and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

			<p>We’re always very keen on discovering the best ways to deliver sounds directly (and often quite loudly) into our ears. If we can do that for less than £200, that’s even better, and OneOdio have proven time and again that they’re capable of delivering top-end sound for less than their competitors. The <a href="https://amzn.to/4i44Qao">Studio Max 1</a> ramps that up, with a package that offers an astounding amount of value.</p>
<p>The Studio Max 1 are a Hi-Res certified pair of headphones that are primarily aimed at the DJ and audiophile market, though they’ll suit anyone with a Nintendo Switch, PC or mobile device as well, so long as you work out if you’re going to get the best out of them.</p>
<p>If we were rating tech on the number of things in the box, the Studio Max 1 would push itself to the top of the pile the moment we opened the voluminous packaging. You’ve got the headphones themselves, USB-A to USB-C charging cable, fabric carry bag, a 3.5mm to ¼” jack cable, a 3.5mm to 3.5mm cable and a further ¼” adaptor. Besides that, there’s the M1 transmitter, which allows Hi-Res wireless connections, from the source of your choice.</p>



<p>Clad all in black, with bright red speaker covers, the Studio Max 1 are a relatively unassuming pair of headphones. The gloss finish, and vinyl-like design of the OneOdio logo on each earpiece is attractive without calling for too much attention, but the plastics used are a little too light and feel cheaper than I’d expect for the price. The headband is topped by a piece of leatherette embossed with the OneOdio brand, alongside red stitching that adds a touch of visual interest.</p>

<p>The joints between the headband and earpieces once again look and feel cheaper, and though I had no problems during testing, I do wonder just how much punishment they’ll put up with over an extended period of time.</p>
<p>Comfort levels are very good here, with plush leatherette ear cushions and a memory foam headband cushion that’s just the right thickness to protect your head through long listening stints. I happily wore them for hours, and didn’t suffer from any fatigue around my ears or on my temple, which is exactly what you want from a headset that boasts a ridiculous 120-hour battery life.</p>
<p>So, the OneOdio Studio Max 1 can connect wirelessly with the M1 transmitter or via Bluetooth, or just be wired up, each of which has specific use cases. The M1 transmitter takes a USB or analogue input and then uses a proprietary RAPID WILL+ connection (Rapid Wireless Low Latency Link) to the headphones that aims for a mere 20ms of latency, when compared to even the fastest Bluetooth codecs. It has all the appearance of a USB powerbank, because it almost could be; the transmitter has a battery built in that can last up to 60 hours.</p>

<p>Of course, the only way to get the best out of the Studio Max 1 is with a library of high-resolution music or a Hi-Res streaming service. All three inputs are capable of Hi-Res playback, but Bluetooth depends on if your device is capable of LDAC. If you’re on iPhone or Nintendo Switch it’s only going to use the standard AAC or SBC codec, which isn’t the best way to experience these headphones.</p>
<p>It’s perhaps little surprise to find that the best connection to be had here is wired. The level of detail is frankly astounding, and using the first of my test tracks Billie Eilish’ ‘No Time To Die’, the Studio Max 1 delivered on all of its technical promises. Billie’s reverb-heavy vocals are joyously crisp, while the swells of orchestration felt powerful and overwhelming, without a hint of bloat or distortion and good separation between the different instrumentation.</p>
<p>The second-best connection is via the M1 transmitter, its multiple inputs and built-in battery making it suitable for turning any wired music session wireless, and with its low latency codec ensuring that you’re as close to the music or action as possible.</p>
<p>The LDAC Bluetooth connection stands as the third best option, as there was a harsher edge here with my other test track, Papa Roach’s ‘Even if It Kills Me’, that wasn’t present via the other two. That’s not to say that it was a bad effort, but compared to my faithful Sony XM5s, the audio lacked the same level of depth or sparkle.</p>

<p>Switching between the wired connections is simple enough, but at various points I struggled to reconnect to the M1 transmitter after being in Bluetooth mode. It’s supposed to automatically connect, and while it seemed to think it had, no audio was passed through. I had to resort to re-pairing the two each time, which was annoying, but not a total deal-breaker.</p>
<p>OneOdio have tuned the Studio Max 1 for reference as opposed to emphasising any particular element of the audio, and it feels like a true representation of the original production which should please producers and aficionados alike. Some listeners may be looking for a more lively response though, and while you can EQ some extra heft or thump to the bottom end, it isn’t the Studio Max 1’s primary use case.</p>
<p>My two favourite cost-effective Hi-Res certified wired headphones remain the Audio-Technica ATH-MSR7 and Philips Fidelio, and though they lose out to the OneOdio on the alternate connection types, they’re still the ones I’d reach for if I was going to indulge in a wired listening session. That said, the OneOdio can fit into your life in a far more complete manner, and will sound great while doing so.</p>
<p><em>The OneOdio Studio Max 1 is available now from <a href="https://amzn.to/4i44Qao">Amazon</a> (15% discount: CJHVATYN) and direct from the <a href="https://bit.ly/42ribFc">OneOdio website</a> (15% discount: STM1social)</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/last-of-us-season-two-first-half/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The reviews for the second season of The Last of Us are rolling out right now, and they’re mostly positive, bar a few outliers. This batch of all-new episodes has been a long time coming, given that it has been more than two years since the first season dropped and turned heads worldwide.</p>



<p>The award-winning show returns to the pleasure of fans everywhere, and if there’s one thing the reviews are confirming, it’s how much meat is on the bones of the second season. The earlier reports are being confirmed – The Last of Us season two only represents the first half of the 2020 release of The Last of Us Part II.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-makes-sense">Makes Sense</h2>



<p>We always knew The Last of Us Part II would be a beast to adapt for a live-action series. It’s an expansive title that spans years and several settings – plus there are two playable characters who each have their perspective on the game’s intense and cinematic story.</p>



<p>It was suggested a while ago by showrunners Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann that it would take <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/last-of-us-tv-show-around-forever/">‘two or three seasons’</a> to cover everything in The Last of Us Part II, and that’s not including original content that’s created specifically for the show.</p>



<p>The reviews that are emerging now have confirmed that around <strong>one-half </strong>of The Last of Us Part II is covered by the first <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-last-of-us-season-2-release-date-and-episode-count-revealed/">batch of seven episodes</a>. Some have complained that it feels ‘spread thin’ when compared to the first season, which saw the entirety of the game covered by a single sprint.</p>



<p>This likely means that setting up the climax for a painful transition into the third season, which will likely take another two or three years, will be front and centre as the episodes unravel.</p>



<p>The Last of Us season two is set to release with a schedule of one episode a week starting this Sunday, April 13.</p>

<p>In July 2023, Disney Illusion Island was released exclusively on Nintendo Switch. It wasn’t a groundbreaking title, but it boasted a charming enough 2D side-scrolling operating model that allowed players to control some of Disney’s most beloved characters.</p>



<p>It was recently revealed by dataminers that after almost two years on the market, Disney Illusion Island is leaving the Nintendo Switch and heading to PlayStation 5. It hasn’t been confirmed if it’ll be launching on Xbox and PC.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-more-disney">More Disney </h2>



<p>In a listing posted on <a href="https://psdeals.net/us-store/game/2956512/disney-illusion-island-starring-mickey-and-friends" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PSDeals.net</a>, it was revealed that ‘Disney Illusion Island Starring Mickey and Friends’ is headed to PlayStation 5 (digitally) on May 30. This information was first uncovered by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gematsu.com/post/3lmbnmasc7k2t" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gematsu</a> on social media.</p>



<p>In Illusion Island, players can pick from Mickey, Minnie, Donald Duck, or Goofy, taking those characters and navigating through perilous levels and avoiding enemy attacks to resolve quests. As the game unravels, players unlock more abilities and broader areas of the map.</p>



<p>From the game’s description from the PS Store scraping:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Join Mickey &amp; Friends on a quest to explore the mysterious island of Monoth and recover three mystical books to save the world from disaster!</p>



<p>Disney Illusion Island Starring Mickey &amp; Friends includes the base game plus the Keeper Up, Mystery in Monoth, and brand new C.A.S.H. update featuring Scrooge McDuck.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s a game with local co-op mechanics, so it’s perfect for families. It hasn’t been suggested how much it’ll cost, but it’s $39.99 in the Nintendo Store, so use that as a guide.</p>



<p>The game was developed by Dlala Studios, and it was noted that the title took inspiration from Rayman Legends when it was being created. On launch, the game garnered mixed reviews, going on to land a Metacritic score of 73 but securing some high praise from Nintendo-centric outlets.</p>



<p>For instance, while IGN gave Illusion Island a score of 7/10, Nintendo Life reached for a score of 9/10.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/kojima-explain-why-solid-snake-silent-tough-guy/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Hideo Kojima created and released Metal Gear in 1987, introducing Solid Snake to the world. He would go on to become one of the most widely recognised characters in gaming, but his first outing rendered him a silent, stalwart figure incapable of uttering a single word.</p>



<p>Kojima has gone on record explaining why Solid Snake was silent, breaking down his earliest experiences with voice actors and reflecting on past technologies.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-games-still-couldn-t-speak">‘Games Still Couldn’t Speak’</h2>



<p>In a recent interview with <a href="https://ananweb.jp/categories/entertainment/49804" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">An An</a> (thanks to <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/metal-gear-solid-snakes-silent-tough-guy-personality-was-influenced-by-technical-limitations-of-the-first-game-kojima-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Automaton</a>), Hideo Kojima explained at length why Solid Snake was a silent protagonist in the first Metal Gear game that debuted in the late eighties:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>In 1986, when I entered the game industry, <strong>games still couldn’t speak</strong>. The characters didn’t have voices. There wasn’t even a kanji font, and the characters were just displayed one by one. Solid Snake, the protagonist of my debut game, Metal Gear (1987), was born as <strong>a silent tough guy</strong> because of this.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It didn’t take long for things to change, though. The legendary developer revealed that just one year after Metal Gear was released, a technological leap forward occurred when NEC released the CD-ROM2, a console with a disc drive. This was an evolution that accommodated Kojima’s desires:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Because the media was CD, it was possible to use voice dialogue, which had not been possible until then. I was one of the first to step forward and remake it.</p>



<p>It was my first time doing voice recordings. I did the casting myself, but since I was a complete outsider, I left the management to an agency. I took the first bullet train from Kobe and arrived at the studio in Tokyo. The gorgeous voice actors were already standing by in front of the microphone. </p>



<p>There was no time to greet or even have a meeting. It was an outrageous schedule, with everything recorded in almost half a day. There was no way I could build relationships. The regret and regret of this first experience would greatly change my subsequent voice recordings.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p><em>(Text translated from Japanese by AI)</em></p>



<p>From there, history started being made, and Kojima went on to explain how his various teams tried to innovate in the voice recording department whenever possible. Today, Kojima’s games feature Hollywood celebrities and deeply cinematic scripts and performances, so it’s fair to say he was successful in that mission.</p>
