Reading the document on the support beam of the cabin will give you hints as to which symbols you need to use for the door's lock, so it isn't terribly hard to figure out, but there are a few things that can be misleading and make this look much harder than it actually is. I spent way too long thinking the symbol at the bottom of the ladder was the one I needed, when actually it's the symbol at the top of the stairs in the attic that I overlooked.

<h2>What now?</h2>
<p>In <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2383614433">a follow-up stream on Monday</a>, Nico called his latest gaming achievement "by far the most difficult run I have ever completed. We did the same run leveled, but it is not even close to as difficult as the level 1 run. The level 1 run, the difficulty level is just insane."</p>
<p>Aside from being an incredible individual achievement, Nico's level 1 God Run helps put FromSoft's reputation for difficulty into perspective. While these games can punish failure very harshly—and require lots of arcane knowledge to play well—Nico shows that they're also designed to be fair to players with the steely nerves to attack and dodge with perfect timing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">After almost 2 years of attempts!<br>
IT'S FINALLY DONE!<br>
7 Games, 0 Hits, Character Level 1!</p>
<p>WE DID IT!</p>
<p>Here is the last fight! (and sorry that it is cinder again) 😅<a href="https://t.co/0g24MY4wRy">https://t.co/0g24MY4wRy</a></p>
<p>— Nico (@dinossindgeil) <a href="https://twitter.com/dinossindgeil/status/1891230190291788237?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 16, 2025</a></p></blockquote>
<p>With his ultimate FromSoft achievement now complete, Nico said he's "going to take a vacation now. And by vacation, I mean I'll continue doing hitless runs, I will continue being live every day... but we're going to do some smaller ones for now." In the longer term, Nico hinted that he is "going to work on one really big project again," but wasn't willing to provide details just yet.</p>
<p>If you want to follow in Nico's hitless FromSoft footsteps, he puts out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svsAMPM9Pzc">instructional videos</a> laying out the specific paths and strategies needed to get through specific games (Pro tip: It involves a lot of well-timed rolling and memorizing attack and stagger patterns). Nico also took the time to recently <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzQ2o0pejVQ">rank how hard he finds each game in the God Run</a>, putting <em>Elden Ring</em> in the easiest tier and <em>Dark Souls II</em> in the hardest.</p>

Free-to-play hero shooter Marvel Rivals has been a huge success for publisher NetEase, smashing through the 20m player barrier just weeks into its launch and still regularly attracting over 250K daily concurrent players on Steam. But that hasn't been enough to stop NetEase from making lay offs across the US development team that helped land it a hit.
</p>
<p>
Marvel Rivals game director Thaddeus Sasser broke the news of job cuts at NetEase's Texas-based studio in a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7297672154060361729/">post shared on LinkedIn</a>. "This is such a weird industry," he wrote. "My stellar, talented team just helped deliver an incredibly successful new franchise in Marvel Rivals for NetEase Games... and were just laid off!"
</p>
<p>
Sasser didn't say how many people have lost their jobs following NetEase's decision - Eurogamer has reached out to the publisher for clarification - but Marvel Rivals level designers Jack Burrows and Garry McGee both confirmed they'd been affected in separate posts.

"Welp, just got laid off from my job working on Marvel Rivals with NetEase," Burrows <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7297445172118724608/">wrote</a>. "Was an enormous pleasure to work with my American coworkers who join me in this sad culling. Just couldn't dodge that big boot I guess, no matter how big the success of the gig."
</p>
<p>
McGee <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7297717165019803649/">shared a similar sentiment</a>, writing, "My team recently helped develop and launch Marvel Rivals, which turned out to be a bigger hit than any of us expected! Unfortunately my team was also laid off. Strange times all across the industry indeed."
</p>
<p>
As unexpected as NetEase's decision might seem in context of Marvel Rivals' breakout success, the move follows layoffs across a number of its western studios. In November, for instance, BioWare veteran Mac Walters announced a "pause" in operations at his NetEase-backed Worlds Untold. Similarly, Jar of Sparks - a first-party NetEase developer founded by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/halo-infinite">Halo Infinite</a> head of design Jerry Hook in 2022 - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/halo-infinite-head-of-designs-netease-studio-halting-work-on-first-game-as-it-searches-for-new-publisher">halted work on its currently-unannounced debut title</a> in January, laying off staff and began searching for a new publishing partner.
</p>
<p>
This week also saw an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/just-cause-creators-new-studio-suffers-layoffs-before-launching-first-game">unspecified number of layoffs</a> at Swedish developer Liquid Swords, which was formed in 2020 by Avanlanche Studios' Christofer Sundberg with NetEase funding.
</p>
<p>
Today's layoffs continue a devastating few years for the games industry, which has seen over 25,000 employees lose their jobs since the start of 2023. Less than two months into 2025, another 900 layoffs have <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/vg-layoffs/Archive/2025">already been recorded</a>, affecting workers across the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unity-slashes-jobs-tells-employees-theyre-unemployed-via-5am-email">Unity</a>, HiRez Studios, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/layoffs-look-likely-at-sumo-digital-as-company-ditches-plans-to-work-on-its-own-ip">Sumo Digital</a>, Ubisoft, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splash-damage-cancels-transformers-reactivate-says-roles-at-risk-of-redundancy">Splash Damage</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/drdisrespect-studio-midnight-society-announces-closure-four-months-after-significant-layoffs">Midnight Society</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/final-fantasy-magic-gathering-crossover-brings-classic-art-and-new-mechanics<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wizards of the Coast has released new details on the upcoming <em>Final Fantasy</em> <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a> crossover. The crossover will showcase various iconic characters in the Commander decks alongside new gameplay mechanics.</p>



<p>In an official press release, Wizards of the Coast showcased both new cards and gameplay features coming in the <em>Final Fantasy</em> <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> crossover.</p>

Each Commander deck will act as adaptations of a specific iconic <em>Final Fantasy</em> games:<em> Final Fantasy VI</em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/final-fantasy-vii" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Final Fantasy VII</em></a>, <em>Final Fantasy X</em>, and the <em>Shadowbringers</em> arc of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Final Fantasy XIV</em></a>.</p>

<p>The release will feature over 100 iconic <em>Final Fantasy</em> characters with over 55 in special booster fun versions. These will be showcasing the influential artwork of several artists in the series including Yoshitaka Amano and Tetsuya Nomura. Those characters will feature in Borderless Character Cards, Borderless Woodblock Cards inspired by Japanese woodblock paintings, and Borderless <em>Final Fantasy</em> Artist cards.</p>

They include the prodigal knight Cecil. the existential threat known as Sin, the goofy Cactuar, and the iconic Moogle merchant.</p>

Examples include <em>Yuriko, the Tiger's Shadow</em> as <em>Yuffie Kisaragi</em> and <em>Ancient Copper Dragon</em> as <em>Final Fantasy I's</em> <em>Dragon of Mount Gulg</em>. Both of these cards feature the acclaimed work of Final Fantasy series' artists Yoshitaka Amano and Tetsuya Nomura. The Final Fantasy Through the Ages is a bonus sheet, so will be included in boosters in some form or another that is not yet specified.&nbsp; We have previously seen it in only collector boosters (planeswalkers in collector's boosters for <em>Bloomburrow</em>), multiple types in each play/draft booster (<em>Wilds of Eldraine</em>, and <em>March of the Machine</em>) as examples, and more.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/final-fantasy-magic-the-gathering-double-faced-cards.jpg?itok=cK-gx3Wf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/final-fantasy-magic-the-gathering-double-faced-cards.jpg?itok=YCiCCWWg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>In addition, the <em>Final Fantasy</em> <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> Commander decks will introduce new and returning mechanics. First is the return of Double-Faced Cards. Pay the mana cost on the front to play the card, then flip it when the required conditions are met.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/final-fantasy-magic-the-gathering-shiva-artwork.jpg?itok=ppQUNyD- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/final-fantasy-magic-the-gathering-shiva-artwork.jpg?itok=_BXZtkOh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Second is the introduction of Saga Creatures, which are depictions of <em>Final Fantasy</em> Summons. They cost a bit of mana and leave the battlefield after a fixed number of turns, but the investment may be worth it with the right combo.</p>

<p>Lastly, Wizards of the Coast will be releasing three <em>Final Fantasy</em> Secret Lair drops alongside the release of these Commander Decks. As for what those Secret Lairs will include, that remains to be seen.</p>

<p><em>Magic: The Gathering - Final Fantasy</em> will release on June 13, with the pre-release happening a week earlier.</p>

According to the report, the developer is having discussions with <em>Fortnite, Roblox</em>, and <em>GTA</em> creators about making “custom experiences” inside what’s shaping up to be the biggest gaming release since the last <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> game launched way (<em>way</em>) back in 2013.</p><p>That Rockstar has made user-generated content part of its strategy for <em>GTA VI</em> should come as no surprise. Despite the last <em>GTA</em> launching over ten years ago (same with <em>GTA Online</em>), interest in the game <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/23/20880410/twitch-gta-nopixel-role-play-best-grand-theft-auto-v">has stayed fresh with the help of mods</a> like FiveM that allow users to host and join their own multiplayer servers. </p><p>Rockstar <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/rockstar-responds-to-grand-theft-auto-mod-ban-complaint/">initially banned some of the creators of FiveM</a> back in 2015, citing that their mod was “an unauthorized alternate multiplayer service that contains code designed to facilitate piracy.” However, as the popularity of the kinds of games and role-playing enabled by FiveM and similar mods grew, Rockstar reversed course. In 2023, the company acquired Cfx.re, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/11/23828431/rockstar-cfx-re-mod-tools-roleplay-server">the team that developed FiveM</a>.</p><p>Games like <em>Fortnite</em>, <em>Roblox</em>, and <em>Minecraft</em> remain at the top of US sales charts years after their release thanks to the popularity of user-generated content. Arranging deals with creators prior to its launch will help <em>GTA VI</em> hit the ground running in a crowded marketplace.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Marvel Rivals - The Thing Character Gameplay Reveal Trailer | You Know What Time It Is</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The Thing also has a support-focused ability, which allows him to leap to a nearby teammate, giving himself bonus health when he reaches them. The bonus health comes from rocks that float around The Thing and give bonus health when destroyed by enemies. This was paired with his team-up with Wolverine, which allows him to throw Wolverine as part of the fastball special, a team-up already in the game with Hulk. His ultimate is a large ground pound, which deals damage in an outward cone, knocking up enemies hit, leaving them vulnerable to other attacks.</p><p>The Thing is the first Vanguard to be added to the roster since launch, likely making him a popular pick when the Marvel Rivals Season 1 mid-season update launches on February 21.

And while Sony continues to fight on with its PlayStation despite the war being over, Xbox CEO Phil Spencer recently confirmed that, yeah, it’s all over, and the company is no longer trying to steal users away with exclusives. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196181" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Best Reveals From The Game Awards 2023" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="180" data-playlist="196181,196230,197298" data-current="196181"><div><p>The Best Reveals From The Game Awards 2023</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21718.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://xboxera.com/2025/02/15/xboxera-interviews-phil-spencer/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://xboxera.com/2025/02/15/xboxera-interviews-phil-spencer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Over the weekend, Spencer sat down for a lengthy interview with <em>XboxEra</em></a></span><em> </em>in which he discussed his favorite games, talked about what various Xbox studios are working on, and dished on the industry at large. And he was also honest about Xbox no longer being part of any console war, as it shifts to selling Xbox games on other consoles, like PlayStation. </p><p>“I would love to make all of the money for all of the games that we ship, right? Like, obviously we make more on our own platform,” said Spencer. “It’s one of the reasons that investing in our own platform is important. But there are people, whether it’s their libraries on a PlayStation or Nintendo, whether it’s they like the controller better, they just like the games that are there.”</p><p>“I’m not trying to move them all over to Xbox anymore,” added Spencer. </p><p>That last quote, about not trying to bring everyone over to Xbox anymore, is a very telling one. And for sure, Xbox hasn’t <em>really </em>been competing with Sony or Nintendo for a few years now—<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-boss-spencer-halo-ps5-switch-exclusive-no-red-line-1851697549?_gl=1*1n51jqf*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczOTg4NjcwMy40ODYuMS4xNzM5OTEwODE3LjUwLjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-boss-spencer-halo-ps5-switch-exclusive-no-red-line-1851697549?_gl=1*1n51jqf*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczOTg4NjcwMy40ODYuMS4xNzM5OTEwODE3LjUwLjAuMA..">that kinda stops when you start selling your games on their platforms</a></span>—but this is confirmation from Spencer that Xbox was once fighting in the console wars  and that it no longer is part of that battle, as the entire point of the console wars was to sell more boxes and steal away other players with exclusives. </p><p>Elsewhere in the interview, Spencer further explained that Asia is one of Xbox’s “fastest-growing regions,” and it’s thanks in large part to Cloud Gaming via Game Pass and PC. And according to Spencer, the users driving this are players who were never going to buy an Xbox. </p><p>“We were never going to catch that person with our console,” said Spencer. <br>So let’s find them in a way that works, and it’s better for <em>Indiana Jones</em>. It’s better for Xbox.”</p><p>If it wasn’t obvious before, this is the ultimate confirmation that the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/console-wars-are-over-ps5-xbox-forza-switch-2-sony-1851752956&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/console-wars-are-over-ps5-xbox-forza-switch-2-sony-1851752956">console wars have indeed ended.</a></span>&nbsp;</p><p>Nintendo doesn’t care anymore and just releases consoles whenever it works best for itself rather than trying to directly compete with the other big players in the space via powerful hardware. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/forza-horizon-5-ps5-playstation-xbox-fans-react-angry-1851752763&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/forza-horizon-5-ps5-playstation-xbox-fans-react-angry-1851752763">Xbox is happy to sell you a game on PS5 or Switch</a></span> or even just let you stream it via the cloud.

So I guess they won, but I’m not sure it really matters in 2025. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It also sees the return of loot boxes, updates to Overwatch 2's competitive mode, and more. You can see the full patch notes below.</p><p dir="ltr">The addition of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzard-injects-more-moba-energy-into-overwatch-2-with-new-perks-system/1100-6529410/" data-ref-id="1100-6529410">Perks is by far the biggest feature of Season 15</a>. There are basically no balance changes, aside from the game-altering addition of four perks for each hero. Over the course of a match, players will earn XP from dealing damage, earning eliminations, and healing allies. As players level up, they'll get to choose between one of two minor Perks at level two and one of two Major Perks at level three.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZR6lbjMFnk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mZR6lbjMFnk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Minor Perks augment existing abilities in smaller ways, while Major Perks are designed to be a game-changing moment that can massively change how an ability works or even grant a hero an entirely new one. Blizzard says the feature will add more player choice and strategy to matches. For a full breakdown of all the new Perk abilities for each hero, check out the patch notes at the bottom of this article.</p><p dir="ltr">As for other changes, Season 15 also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-is-bringing-back-loot-boxes-very-soon-with-some-changes/1100-6529450/" data-ref-id="1100-6529450">brings back loot boxes</a>, which can be earned through weekly challenges and the game's free and premium battle pass. They are not available for purchase separately. Players can earn three free loot boxes each week, with players getting a guaranteed Legendary item after opening 20 boxes and a guaranteed Epic item after opening five. At least one Rare item is guaranteed to drop in every loot box.</p><p dir="ltr">On the competitive side of the update is a rank reset, as well as the removal of two maps, Hanaoka and Throne of Anubis, from the rotation. Players can also earn new Galactic weapon skins with their competitive points.</p><p dir="ltr">Overwatch 2 Season 15's addition of Perks may be a big change, but an even bigger ones will be coming as part of Season 16 with the introduction of the game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2s-round-based-stadium-mode-looks-to-reinvent-blizzards-shooter-in-a-big-way/1100-6529416/" data-ref-id="1100-6529416">third-person Stadium mode</a> and a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-latest-hero-is-the-crossbow-wielding-bounty-hunter-freya/1100-6529451/" data-ref-id="1100-6529451">new hero, Freya</a>.

As such, we restricted any custom hostile ultimate VO to special game modes, but we were not able to implement them into the broader game.</p><p>By changing the way we trigger ultimate voice lines, we can now play a player-specific custom line without affecting the line heard by enemy players. This means that we'll have much more flexibility for changing ultimate voice lines in the future.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Emotes</strong></p><ul><li>Emotes can now be cancelled mid-animation shortly after they are activated.</li></ul><h4>Introducing Perks</h4><p>Take your gameplay to the next level with Perks—Overwatch 2’s dynamic new mid-match upgrade system for Quickplay and Competitive. As the action heats up, unlock and choose game-changing abilities to amplify your hero’s power and evolve your strategy in real time. Adapt to every challenge, counter your enemies, and turn the tide of battle in your favor.</p><ul><li>Perks are now enabled in Quick Play and Competitive modes.</li></ul><p dir="ltr"><strong>How to gain Perk progress</strong></p><p>• Perk progress is gained by dealing damage, securing eliminations, and healing your allies. • Throughout the match, the rate at which you gain Perks will gradually increase. • When you eliminate an enemy who is at a higher perk level than you (full level), that elimination is also worth more Perk progress.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Swapping Heroes</strong></p><ul><li>When you swap heroes, your new hero will be set to level 1 with zero perk progress.</li><li>Your progress will be saved on any heroes that you play throughout the round though. So, if you played Tracer to Level 3 and got her Major Perk, when you switch back to Tracer you will be at Level 3 with your perks equipped.</li></ul><p dir="ltr"><strong>Selecting Perks</strong></p><p>There are multiple options available to select your perks into fit your personal play style.</p><ul><li>Standard Selection: Hold down Left Alt on keyboard or up on the directional pad for controller, then aim at the left or right perk or press your shoulder buttons on controller to select.</li><li>Quick Selection: You can also set your own bindings to select your perks without bringing up the Perk selection user interface, which is great for once you've really gotten your perks down and don't need the menu.</li><li>You can also bind your perk selection to be a toggle instead of holding by default.</li></ul><p dir="ltr"><strong>Celebrate In Our Perked-Up Event</strong></p><p>Celebrate the debut of Overwatch 2’s game-changing Perks system with the Perked Up Event, available all season long. Take on challenges to snag weekly rewards, including up to 10 Loot Boxes per week and Rainy Day Mercy! Plus, team up with the community via Twitch Drops and Support a Streamer to unlock Rainy Day Mei and Tracer. This limited time event runs from February 18 to April 22.</p><ul><li>For season 15 only, players can earn up to an additional 10 loot boxes each week by completing up to 15 games with wins counting as double.</li><li>Challenges for Loot Boxes reset every week, so any loot boxes not earned in that week are missed out.</li></ul><h4>Hero Perks</h4><p>Instead of hero balance updates, we're opening up Season 15 with adding Hero Perks to all 41 heroes. Our intention is to give you some time to adapt to such a large shift for the game, but we'll be monitoring to see if any perks need immediate tuning. So, check out each new perk and plan out new strategies and playstyles that can benefit your playstyle.</p><h4>Tanks</h4><h5>D.Va</h5><p dir="ltr">Bunny Stomp</p><ul><li>Call Mech's damage radius is increased by 50%.</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Ejection Suit</p><ul><li>Eject grants 75 temporary overhealth.</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Shield System</p><ul><li>Convert 150 health to shields.

                <p>Silksong, the highly anticipated sequel to Hollow Knight that has the player take control of the mysterious Hornet, has been removed from Nintendo's eShop. While the game is still listed on the PlayStation Store, Xbox, Steam, and the Nintendo eShop in the EU, the circumstances of why it was removed from Nintendo's North American eShop is a mystery.</p><p>A strong theory is that it's being moved to a Switch 2 launch and not outright canceled. Just last month, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-developer-gives-hopeful-update-says-game-is-real/1100-6528905/" data-ref-id="1100-6528905">developer Team Cherry assured fans</a> that development was going smoothly and that the game would indeed be released at some point.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/griffinmatta/status/1880523110816051696" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Yes the game is real, progressing and will release. &lt;3</p>  — Matthew Griffin (@griffinmatta) <a href="https://twitter.com/griffinmatta/status/1880523110816051696?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 18, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>"Yes the game is real, progressing and will release," said Team Cherry marketing and publishing lead Matthew Griffin, in response to a fan asking about Hollow Knight: Silksong's development. Unfortunately, no other details were given. Since being announced six years ago, updates have been sparse and sporadic at best.</p><p>In fact, in 2022, Hollow Knight: Silksong won a "Most Anticipated Game" award from Unity. Team Cherry thanked the community for their support and said "It can't be too much longer, surely!" It won again last year but without any word from the developers.</p><p>Nintendo will be hosting a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-revealed-launch-date/1100-6528762/" data-ref-id="1100-6528762">Direct presentation on April 2</a> focusing on the Switch 2, so the game may make an appearance there.</p>

			<p>Relic Entertainment, the Vancouver-based developer behind games like the first two Homeworld, Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War, Company of Heroes, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/age-of-empires-iv-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Age of Empires IV</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/sega-sells-relic-entertainment-cuts-another-240-jobs-in-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">returned</a> to independence last year after SEGA decided to sell it. Earlier this month, the developer <a href="https://wccftech.com/relic-entertainment-announces-ambitious-plans-for-the-future/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> a roadmap for its future, including support of existing titles like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/company-of-heroes-3-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Company of Heroes 3</a> and the development of smaller titles.</p>
<p>Today, Relic unveiled Earth vs Mars, one of this new indie-style breed of games. These 'Relic Labs' games will allow the studio to explore new sub-genres, experiment, and release games more frequently. Earth vs Mars is a single player turn-based strategy game where a group of commanders must lead Earth's military as they face an overwhelming Martian invasion of high-tech saucers, grav tanks, and elite alien warriors in a battle for the survival of the planet.</p>
<p>Players have the opportunity to combine human "volunteers" with Earth creatures to create powerful hybrid super soldiers to fight alongside Earth's regular military. As they go through the campaign, new creatures, powerful unit upgrades, and game-changing commander abilities can be unlocked. But the enemy will evolve as well, deploying everything from the sentient organic weapon known only as The Creep to the Martians' own mutant creations.</p>
<p>Many of the units featured in Earth vs. Mars will have their own unique abilities, adding new strategies and gameplay depth to this style of play. There will also be multiple commanders in the game, each bringing passive and active abilities to enhance the way you play.</p>
<p><iframe title="Earth vs. Mars - Exclusive Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/H1fcAfm_gLM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Earth vs Mars will feature an expansive, narrative-driven campaign consisting of over thirty hand-crafted missions. There's also a VS mode where players can fight against the AI on custom maps.</p>
<p>In online multiplayer, the game pits you against other commanders as either the armies of Earth or the forces of the Martian invaders. Moreover, a full-featured map editor allows players to create custom maps and scenarios. There's no release date yet, but you can wishlist the game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3269230/Earth_vs_Mars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Steam</a> right now.</p>

Today, employees of NetEase Games working on <em>Marvel Rivals</em> have shared that they have been laid off, and the Seattle studio is being shut down.</p>

<p>The news broke on LinkedIn as employees began sharing their stories about being laid off. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/thadsasser_this-is-such-a-weird-industry-my-stellar-activity-7297672154060361729-xYIX?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAWFcNgBTnKdYM4ShDjI2C0H2DackkNIFLU" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Thaddeus Sasser LinkedIn">Game Director Thaddeus Sasser wrote</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"This is such a weird industry...</p>

<p>My stellar, talented team just helped deliver an incredibly successful new franchise in Marvel Rivals for NetEase Games...</p>

<p>...and were just laid off!</p>

<p>Oh well! Times are tough all over - Let's find these incredible people new jobs, because we all need to eat, right? :D"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He went on to share a profile of Garry McGee, a level designer who is one of the many people now looking for a job. Another level designer, Jack Burrows <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jack-burrows-b7896399/recent-activity/all/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Jack Burrows LinkedIn">wrote on LinkedIn</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Hey folks!<br>
Welp, just got laid off from my job working on Marvel Rivals with NetEase.</p>

<p>Was an enormous pleasure to work with my American coworkers who join me in this sad culling.<br>
Just couldn't dodge that big boot I guess, no matter how big the success of the gig.</p>

<p>So now I’m seeking a new role and would appreciate your support. If you hear of any opportunities or just want to catch up, please send me a message or comment below. I’d love to reconnect. hashtag#OpenToWork hashtag#YaCantWinThemAll"</p>

<p>Released last year, <em>Marvel Rivals</em> has been a huge success as a hot hero shooter that has taken on the behemoth of Blizzard and the <em>Overwatch</em> franchise. It picked up <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-player-count-10m" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Marvel Rivals Player Count Reaches 10 Million in &quot;Just 72 Hours&quot;">10m players in its first 72 hours</a>, and it has been going strong since with players flocking to the hero shooter featuring some of their favorite super heroes.</p>



<p>The move comes as Netease has been downsizing a lot of its operations outside of China, and studios it has backed. It has impacted a number of other studios that they previously backed such as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/liquid-swords-layoffs-just-cause-creator" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Just Cause Creator's Studio Liquid Swords Announces Layoffs">Liquid Swords </a>(from the creator of <em>Just Cause</em> ), <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/visions-of-mana-layoffs-netease-report" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Visions of Mana Studio Hit by Huge Layoffs on Release Day Per Report">Ouka Studios</a> (released <em>Visions of Mana</em>), and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/worlds-untold-netease-pause-shutdown" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" BioWare Veteran's NetEase Studio Worlds Untold to &quot;Pause Operations&quot;">Untold Worlds </a>(from Bioware alumni Mac Walters)</p>

<p>This continues a trend over the last few years where we've been seeing massive layoffs. In this case, it seems that even a commercially, massively successful hit isn't enough to stop a company from deciding that they might be able to get people working on it cheaper somewhere else.</p>

<p>Marvel Rivals, one of the more success games of the last year, has seen its development staff it with layoffs. According to multiple posts on social media, publisher NetEase has laid off an entire Marvel Rivals development team.</p>



<p>Marvel Rivals’ game director Thaddeus Sasser <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7297672154060361729/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">took to LinkedIn</a> to reveal the news on Tuesday afternoon. </p>



<p>“This is such a weird industry…” Sasser wrote. “My stellar, talented team just helped deliver an incredibly successful new franchise in Marvel Rivals for NetEase Games…and were just laid off!”</p>



<p>Based on his wording, it’s unclear if Sasser was included in the layoffs or if it was just his team. Insider Gaming reached out for comment, but Sasser declined.</p>



<p>According to Sasser’s profile, his team—which is based in Seattle, Washington—focused on game and level design.</p>



<p>One member of his team, a level designer from the game, Jack Burrows, confirmed he was part of the layoffs. No reason was shared by either party for the cuts.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has also reached out to NetEase for comment on the layoffs and how many people are being let go. Should a response to any outstanding questions be received, they will be added to this story.</p>



<p>Since its release, Marvel Rivals has been at the top of the player count charts on Steam. The game peaked at 644,269 on the platform while it continues to average over 255,000 people per day on Steam alone.</p>

                <p>Activision has announced Call of Duty: Recon Squad--but it's not the next entry in the series. Recon Squad is a new community feedback program that Activision is launching to gather thoughts and opinions from fans about the state of the game. Activision is debuting this as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ModernWarfareIII/comments/1icjzkt/is_black_ops_6_really_that_bad_and_people_are/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">online sentiment around the state of Call of Duty is wavering</a>, with many saying Activision is not doing enough to support the game.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/02/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-warzone-zombies-season-two-reloaded-announcement" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>, Activision said Black Ops 6 and Warzone players may receive an invitation to join Recon Squad via an invitation from the market research company Fuel Cycle.</p><p>"You'll have opportunities to provide feedback through surveys, online community discussion boards, and potentially even invited to focus groups," Activision said.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4445883-screenshot2025-02-18at2.52.38pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4445883" data-ratio="0.55540166204986" data-width="722" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4445883-screenshot2025-02-18at2.52.38pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4445883"></a><figcaption>Introducing Call of Duty: Recon Squad</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4445883-screenshot2025-02-18at2.52.38pm.png"></figure><p>Players in the Recon Squad program can earn points by submitting feedback that can then be redeemed for in-game content for Black Ops 6 and/or Warzone. To begin with, Fuel Cycle surveys will focus on recently released content for Black Ops 6 and Warzone, along with "many other topics related to Call of Duty."</p><p>The feedback program is available by invitation only. Activision said it's looking for feedback from "all types of players," including those who play Call of Duty a lot and those who do not. Players will be informed of an invitation to the program by way of the email they have connected to their Activision ID.</p><p>In recent weeks and months, some Call of Duty players have complained about the state of the game in Black Ops 6 and Warzone, especially in the area of cheating. Players have also expressed opinions about Activision simply not giving players enough compelling reasons to come back to Call of Duty.</p><p>In other news, Activision just announced a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-season-2-reloaded-adds-tmnt-event-plus-splinter-included-in-paid-pass/2900-6270/" data-ref-id="2900-6270">lot of new maps, modes, features, and more coming to Black Ops 6 and Warzone in the Season 2 Reloaded update</a>, including the long-awaited TMNT crossover. The update arrives February 20.</p>
