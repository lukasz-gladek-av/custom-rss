			<p><strong>Ubisoft</strong> has had a close relationship with <strong>Nintendo</strong> for a long time. It was one of the few third-party developers to happily support the original Nintendo Switch from the get-go, and it even partnered with them to create the oddball but quite well-received XCOM-inspired crossover game <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/mario-rabbids-kingdom-battle/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle</a></strong> (2017) and its sequel, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/mario-rabbids-sparks-of-hope-funs-out-guns-out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Sparks of Hope</strong></a> (2022).</p>



<p>This collaboration continued with the <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong> this year as Ubisoft successfully ported its most technologically advanced games, Massive's <strong>Star Wars: Outlaws</strong> and Ubisoft Toronto's <strong>Assassin's Creed Shadows</strong>, to the new hybrid console.</p>



<p>As we <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-nintendo-switch-2-runs-30-fps-nvidia-dlss-baked-gi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previously reported</a>, the latter game, which launched earlier this month on Nintendo Switch 2, also includes a dedicated algorithm for <strong>VRR (Variable Refresh Rate)</strong> that manages to keep the feature enabled even at the game's locked frame rate of 30 FPS, despite the hardware only technically allowing that for 40 FPS and above. </p>



<p>Now, <a href="https://frvr.com/blog/news/ubisoft-is-working-with-nintendo-to-improve-vrr-support-on-nintendo-switch-2-to-bring-better-fluidity-to-lower-framerate-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">speaking to FRVR</a>, Ubisoft revealed how it works:</p>



<p><em>Both Assassin’s Creed Shadows and Star Wars: Outlaws use a similar technique to take advantage of Switch 2’s Variable Refresh Rate, even below 40Hz. Since Shadows targets 30fps, and the console’s VRR currently only works at 40Hz or higher, we use a clever workaround. The same frame is effectively presented twice, once in the middle of the frame and again at the end, so the hardware outputs at a 60Hz interval while maintaining smooth visuals</em>.</p>



<p>Even more interesting is the fact that Ubisoft said it is working with Nintendo to potentially apply this custom algorithm system-wide. If that option was actually implemented, it could benefit all Nintendo Switch 2 games, offering a smoother experience in handheld mode. Sadly, the interview does not specify any timeframe, so we don't know yet when it could arrive. </p>



<p>At the very least, Ubisoft has added that it is now a standard feature of the Anvil Engine, so it will be found in future games powered by the proprietary technology. The first one to release could be the Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time remake, which, <a href="https://wccftech.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-is-rumored-to-release-in-january-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to the latest rumor</a>, could be launched as early as mid-January 2026. Anvil should also <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag-remake-targeting-march-2026-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">appear again in March 2026</a> for the rumored debut of <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag-remake-assassins-creed-black-flag-resynced-pegi-rating-ubisoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag Resynced</a>, the remake of the 2013 game.</p>

            <guid>1390348</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="12 minutes, 13 seconds Yeah. any artist amongst athletes,">Timothée Chalamet is one of the biggest actors around right now after starring in hit movies like <em>Dune</em> and <em>Wonka</em>. But before that, he was just a teenager on YouTube trying to get big by modding and painting Xbox 360 controllers. And the director behind his upcoming film, <em>Marty Supreme,</em> wanted the 29-year-old actor to tap into that part of his life while filming.</p> <p tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="12 minutes, 13 seconds Yeah. any artist amongst athletes,">Arriving in theaters nationwide on Christmas, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9gSuKaKcqM"><em>Marty Supreme</em></a> stars Chalamet as Marty Mauser, a young and scrappy wannabe table tennis pro who works hard, deals with plenty of naysayers, and pushes through various obstacles on his mission to turn his passion into a career. To help Chalamet properly portray Mauser, who is loosely based on a real table tennis pro,<em> Marty Supreme</em> director and co-writer Josh Safdie told the young actor to remember his days making YouTube videos about gamepads.</p>

 <p tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="12 minutes, 13 seconds Yeah. any artist amongst athletes,">“[Director] Josh [Safdie] wanted me to tap into, you know, he was always talking about, like, I modded controllers on YouTube growing up,” <a href="https://youtu.be/NhMqMdu6Wlc?t=757">Chalamet told the <em>BBC</em> in a recent interview.</a> “He’s like that part of you. He’s like the hustler part of you. The swaggerful part of you.”</p>

 <p tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="12 minutes, 13 seconds Yeah. any artist amongst athletes,">And yeah, in case this is news to you: <a href="https://kotaku.com/dune-s-timothee-chalamet-was-once-an-xbox-youtuber-1847946368">Chalamet used to have a small YouTube channel back in 2010</a> where he uploaded a <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/3ab835/is-this-timothee-chalamets-xbox-modding-youtube-channel-an-investigation?utm_source=VICE_Twitter&amp;utm_medium=social+">few short videos of himself showing off modded and customized Xbox 360 controllers</a>. The channel was aptly titled ModdedController360, and in 2021, Chalamet admitted to running the channel, which has since sadly been removed from YouTube. Thankfully, people have saved some of the videos, like this one of Chalamet, who never reveals his face, showing off a “sexy” red tiger paint job.</p>

  <p tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="12 minutes, 13 seconds Yeah. any artist amongst athletes,">Here’s what Chalamet had to say about the channel <a href="https://youtu.be/Xv5l-hisFuA?t=486">back in 2021</a>, when he revealed he was the one behind it: “I had a YouTube channel people found. It’s YouTube dot com back-slash ‘ModdedController360.’ And I used to paint-mod controllers, I did three, and I spray-painted them and…opened them up, and I would charge people $10.”</p>

 <p tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="12 minutes, 13 seconds Yeah. any artist amongst athletes,">According to the actor, it didn’t take off, though he made $30 off three clients.&nbsp;If you own one of those controllers, I bet it’s worth a lot more than $10 in 2025.</p>

            <link>https://gameinformer.com/2025/12/22/ark-2-is-now-targeting-a-2028-launch</link>
            <guid>1390345</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>The long-awaited <a href="https://gameinformer.com/the-game-awards-2020/2020/12/10/ark-ii-announced-featuring-vin-diesel">Ark 2 was announced in 2020</a>, and after a lengthy wait with minimal updates and a few delays, it finally has a new release window. Unfortunately, it’s still a few years away, but we now have a better idea as to why and what to expect from the upcoming sequel.</p><p>In an <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/sci-fi-dino-taming-survival-game-ark-2-eyes-a-2028-release-with-a-little-or-a-lot-of-vin-diesel">interview with Epic Games’ Brian Crecente</a>, Studio Wildcard co-founder Jeremy Stieglitz confirmed that Ark 2 is now planned to launch in 2028. This was revealed during publisher Snail Games’ Investor Day. He also explains the studio’s approach to releasing Ark 2, and how it wants to incorporate the lessons learned from releasing <a href="https://gameinformer.com/xbox-partner-preview/2023/10/25/check-out-the-dinosaurs-in-ark-survival-ascended">Ark: Survival Ascended</a>, the current and remastered iteration of the original Ark: Survival Evolved.</p><p>“One of the things about doing Ark 2 was that we felt we had to learn a lot more about how to make the kind of game we wanted to do, and to do it kind of in phases,” Stieglitz explains. “Learning about both the technology and the mechanics seemed, to us, safer than to just try to go and release a whole standalone product called Ark 2.”</p><p>To do this, Studio Wildcard is planning to use Ark: Survival Ascended, which has now surpassed 4 million units sold, to gradually prepare for Ark 2’s launch. The first taste of the sequel will come in an expansion called Legacy of Santiago, arriving in late 2027. This expansion will feature mechanics and features planned for the 2028 sequel and serves as a prequel that will help set the stage for Ark 2’s events – Santiago is, after all, Ark 2’s protagonist, portrayed by Vin Diesel.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/D8KbXpk2J9Y"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/D8KbXpk2J9Y" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>“Legacy of Santiago will allow us to explore a lot of mechanics that we want to do with Ark 2, but it kind of derisks that, " says Stieglitz. “Essentially, if we don't do it right, if we don't do it perfectly, we're able to iterate on it with a live game and get a lot more feedback than to just release something standalone. It's much safer for us to get a lot of that feedback in a live game where we can react much more fluidly to what players are telling us.”</p><p>In terms of Vin Diesel’s role in Ark 2, Stieglitz says his total involvement is still “an open question” that will determine the full scope of ambition of the game’s plot. &nbsp;</p><p>“The question is: How much performance are we going to get from him?” Stieglitz said. “Are we going to get one day, five days, eight hours? You don’t know. And the scope of how much performance we are going to get determines just how the narrative is going to play out. We have a narrative that’s if we get a lot of Vin Diesel, this is what we will do, and if we get a little Vin Diesel, this is what we will do.”</p><p>Stieglitz also explains that Studio Wildcard wants to ensure players are ready to leave the previous game behind before launching Ark 2; it doesn’t want to stop updating Ark: Survival Ascended and leave those players in the cold. Thus, it is implementing a robust content roadmap throughout 2026 and 2027. This includes new narrative expansion Ark: Lost Colony launching this week, and 2026 additions such as the esports-focused Ark: Survival of the Fittest, a pirate-themed expansion called Bob’s True Tales: Tides of Fortune, and a modding-focused update called Ark World Creator. Even when Ark 2 launches, Stieglitz states that Ark: Survival Ascended will continue to be updated as long as demand exists.</p><p>Ark 2 was announced during The Game Awards in 2020&nbsp;with a 2023 launch window. The game was delayed to 2024, with Studio Wildcard releasing Ark: Survival Ascended in 2023 instead. Obviously, Ark 2 would miss this 2024 launch window, and is now slated to arrive eight years after its reveal, assuming everything (hopefully) goes as planned.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/12/22/ark-2-is-now-targeting-a-2028-launch]]></content:encoded>

<figure data-uuid="1f104f3b2e595"><a title="Clair Obscur" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1f104f3b2e595/clair-obscur.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Kepler Interactive</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>What a week.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, comments from Larian founder and CEO Swen Vincke to Jason Schreier at <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-12-16/-baldur-s-gate-3-maker-promises-divinity-will-be-next-level">Bloomberg</a> (paywall) created headlines we've grown all too used to over the last couple of years. Following the reveal of a new <strong><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/divinity">Divinity</a></strong> game at The Game Awards, Vincke said that the studio was actively using generative AI for concept art generation and placeholder text.</p>
<p>He clarified that nothing in the final game would be the product of genAI and that <a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/2001011042642505833">concept artists weren't being replaced</a>, but for many, the damage was done, the online backlash swift.</p>
<p>In the interview, Vincke said that people at the company are "more or less OK with the way we’re using it," and, as made explicit in <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3ma5dqbmgm22o">the transcribed text later shared</a>, the CEO also admits, "I don't actually think it accelerates things." Which begs the question (which Schreier posed): <em>If it's not improving efficiency, why use it?</em></p>
<p>The reply:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"This is a tech driven industry, so you try stuff. You can't afford not to try things because if somebody finds the golden egg and you're not using it, you're dead in this industry."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Artificial Intelligence has attracted enormous investment since ChatGPT took off, and a brand of breathless investor spin to make non-fungible token-shilling crypto bros weep.</p>
<p>Unlike NFTs, though, AI in its various forms is nigh-on impossible to ignore or escape. You can't open your emails without Google offering to summarise or Copilot wanting to write replies. Search results turn up AI overviews by default. Old photos are being colourised or 'cleaned up', or straight-up fabricated, and shown alongside real images.</p>

<p>When it comes to big corporations in the business of producing media, interactive or not, Disney is on board now, to the tune of <a href="https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/disney-openai-sora-agreement/">$1 billion of equity investment</a> in OpenAI's Sora, and you'll soon see those videos popping up on Disney+. The corporation also greenlit <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fortnite">Fortnite</a>'s AI-generated Darth Vader voice, which led to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/fortnite-turns-to-the-dark-side-with-ai-darth-vader-voice-and-of-course-its-been-swearing">the obvious</a> and an <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/fortnite-devs-hit-with-unfair-labour-practice-filing-following-ai-darth-vader-fiasco">angry SAG-AFTRA</a>.</p>
<p>YouTube is increasingly filled with genAI material ranging from simple thumbnails to entire videos. And to bring it back to games, a trip to the Switch eShop shows piles of <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/search/#cat=gme&amp;f=softwarePublisher&amp;softwarePublisher=Aldora%20Games">AI-generated pap</a> riffing on whatever trends and IP are in the charts.</p>
<p>Like it or not, AI is in your face, in your feeds, and in your thoughts if you're a creative in any field.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/related-articles:195431 @ 1766426403 -->
<p>It's probably worth noting that the AI we're discussing here isn't the human-programmed responses and rudimentary pathfinding that's been guiding CPU bots in deathmatches for decades. Generative AI has been trained on samples and can generate results — images, audio, words, code, and more — according to its specific function. And Larian is very far from alone when it comes to experimenting with the emerging tech.</p>
<p>Having given up on <a href="https://www.siliconera.com/square-enix-will-end-symbiogenesis-nft-project-shares-final-roadmap/">its NFT game</a>, Square Enix <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/square-enix-aims-to-automate-70percent-of-qa-with-generative-ai-by-2027">has goals</a> to automate 70% of its quality assurance with genAI by 2027. Sega is looking to leverage it <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/sega-will-carefully-assess-appropriate-use-cases-when-it-comes-to-leveraging-ai">where "appropriate"</a>. Falcom has been <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/nihon-falcom-actively-using-ai-for-brainstorming-scenarios-conducting-research-and-similar-applications.1386748/">using it for brainstorming</a>. As significant investors in OpenAI, it's no surprise that Microsoft loves it (although <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2025/05/xbox-developer-insists-generative-ai-is-not-mandated-at-microsoft">apparently does not mandate its use</a>).</p>
<figure data-uuid="e9f02a8c89f51"><a title="Black Ops 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e9f02a8c89f51/black-ops-7.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Xbox Game Studios</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Using — or admitting to using — AI tools for generating in-game art assets was a line that many were unwilling to cross until fairly recently, though. Now we're beginning to see more than the tip of the iceberg.</p>
<p>Microsoft-owned Activision is probably the largest to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-responds-to-complaints-of-ai-generated-assets-in-call-of-duty-black-ops-7">acknowledge its use</a> in generating multiplayer Prestige icons. Whether that is a factor in <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/call_of_duty_black_ops_7">Black Ops 7</a>'s <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2025/12/black-ops-7-sales-and-players-down-massively-on-last-years-call-of-duty-new-data-shows">underwhelming sales performance</a> is unclear (it seems unlikely), but the tech certainly hasn't hurt <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/arc_raiders">ARC Raiders</a>, which has been a massive success for Embark Studios despite <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/11/as-arc-raiders-takes-off-developer-embark-defends-its-use-of-ai-tools">drawing ire</a> with its use of AI-generated text-to-speech voices.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, it was employed for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/front-mission-3-remake-appears-to-replace-2d-art-assets-with-generative-ai">blurred, distorted images</a> in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/front_mission_3_remake">Front Mission 3: Remake</a>. 11 Bit Studios' <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-alters-ai-controversy/"><strong>The Alters</strong> used AI</a> for placeholder text and some quick translations. The multi-award-winning <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/clair_obscur_expedition_33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> <a href="https://playingthisweek.substack.com/p/why-i-no-longer-cheer-for-clair-obscur">used it for some assets</a> (before they were patched out), which has led to the Indie Game Awards retracting its GOTY and Debut Game awards over the weekend due to a "hard stance on the use of gen AI" as per <a href="https://www.indiegameawards.gg/faq">the IGA's regulations</a>.</p>

<p>If you're interested — and you should be — <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/list-of-games-that-use-generative-ai.1367848/">Resetera members</a> are compiling <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19nVevq_bW5ZnC8jUiBvB-Rh1wKbAoc3mShY8ALCi9hY/edit?gid=0#gid=0">a spreadsheet</a> listing games where genAI usage has been confirmed. It's turning up in games of all sizes, from teams reputable and otherwise.</p>
<p>Most big companies, though, are still hedging their bets and waiting for the dust to settle, unwilling to risk their reputation and workforces on the new hotness and implement tech that could still create a catastrophic mess in an uncertain legal environment</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/related-articles:191392 @ 1766426403 -->
<p>Another thing that's unclear right now is whether enough players are genuinely troubled by the direction genAI is taking the industry. AI-fabricated images and videos from prompts may fool a casual glance, but if a game's artistic integrity is obviously being compromised and cheapened by uncanny textures and character portraits with 17 fingers, you'd imagine there will be complaints. AI-generated code running beneath it, though? How would the end user even identify that?</p>
<p>Even aspects that don't seem <em>quite</em> right could be the result of some good old-fashioned jank or human error. Is that odd dialogue text or flat-sounding performance an artistic choice? A sub-par localisation? A weird line read that the VO director missed? As the tech improves, it will get tougher to tell.</p>
<p>For many industry creatives, the answer to the genAI question is self-evident. What are you left with if you cut the artist out of the art?</p>

<p>For <em>players</em>, though — especially those who don't keep up with the industry's ins and outs — it's less clear-cut.</p>
<p>Jacob Navek, a former director of bizdev at Square Enix and current CEO of Genvid Technologies, suggests (unsurprisingly) that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/consumers-generally-do-not-care-about-ai-in-games-says-former-square-enix-exec">"consumers generally do not care"</a> about AI in games. Looking at the aforementioned ARC Raiders, which sold more than four million copies in two weeks, there seem to be enough players who either don't know or don't care about the controversy - as long as the game's good.</p>
<p>As he's wont to do, <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2025/11/epic-games-ceo-comments-on-arc-raiders-and-its-use-of-ai-voice-generation">Epic's Tim Sweeney</a> weighed in on the subject of Embark's game, claiming that the increased productivity of AI "leads to building better games rather than employing fewer people". Nexon (Embark's parent company) CEO Junghun Lee <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/its-important-to-assume-every-game-company-is-now-using-ai-nexon-ceo-comments-on-role-of-human-creativity-as-ai-tools-become-the-norm/">told Automaton</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It's important to assume every game company is now using AI. But if everyone is working with the same or similar technologies, the real question becomes: how do you survive?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some real race-to-the-bottom energy there, with a dash of anxiety akin to Swen Vincke's golden egg comment. But if we assume that AI usage <em>is</em> as widespread as Lee suggests, the real question, again, is whether players really mind if a game uses genAI. Or, more specifically: Do <em>enough</em> players care about it to give companies pause?</p>
<p>It's an inflammatory subject online, that's for sure, as evidenced most recently (well, probably not by the time this goes live) by the activity surrounding <a href="https://www.escapistmagazine.com/news-indie-game-awards-clair-obscur/">The Escapist's article and subsequent apology</a> following accusations that <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/blue_prince">Blue Prince</a> dev Dogubomb had used genAI, prompting <a href="https://x.com/RawFury/status/2002748999388844330">a response</a> from publisher Raw Fury. The echo chambers of social media and gaming forums naturally amplify the outrage, and we're now starting to see devs targeted with unfounded accusations from aggrieved parties, too. <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/rpg-dev-pushes-back-against-steam-review-ai-accusations-we-poured-years-of-our-lives-into-this-game-and-only-worked-with-real-human-artists-on-everything/">It's getting ugly out there.</a></p>

<p>As a writer for a games outlet, AI is the latest existential nightmare to ensh*tify the internet and stretch the economics of games media to breaking point. All those necessary SEO evils you spent years living with and working around? They've been usurped by a fresh hell which consumes your every word — and your <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/oct/01/artificial-intelligence-em-dashes-ai-stealing-my-livelihood">em dashes</a> — for itself. No, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/franzferdinand2.bsky.social/post/3lyeu7wkfzk2w">absolutely not</a>.</p>
<p>Vincke's suggestion that AI helps with idea generation ('ideation', a word which I struggle to even type) but simultaneously <em>doesn't</em> speed up the process feels like the confused take of a CEO fearfully reframing tech he surely knows torches the respect of anyone with an appreciation of art versus 'content' (another term that induces <a href="https://media3.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExN3kza2lqcXY1eHIwNWthMmp2NzZpOTJobGU1MnBqc2htY2xldHo0cSZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/e4Jyxh9zQjgnC/giphy.gif">Eastwood shudders</a>).</p>
<p><em>It's useful for inspiration - ideation for the human-crafted content!</em> Is it, though? Really?</p>

<p>Given the dubious quality of the 'inspiration', it doesn't take long to realise the bubble <em>will</em> burst. And knowing what the landscape will look like afterwards — when there's no mice left for the snake that gorged on its own tail — is perhaps the biggest unknown.</p>
<p>Personally, the idea of AI planning my free time, summarising and responding to my emails, speaking to my staff, and writing my words is abhorrently unappealing. As a transcription tool for a long interview, sure, but the moment it starts making suggestions, offering 'inspiration', or generating anything, any self-respecting creator should reject with extreme prejudice.</p>

<p>Even beyond purely creative fields, outsourcing connection — taking the human out of human resources or any interaction that depends on communication — feels like a fundamental failure and misunderstanding of how we interact as a species, let alone what sparks imagination and joy. It's an affront that will lead to confusion, burnout, productivity ruin, and a thick sludge of product that the algorithm insists you really should like. My worry is that the killjoys claiming everything was better in the past will one day be right.</p>
<p>A tad dramatic? Perhaps, but given the state of things, you'll forgive my heightened alert. We try not to flood the site with AI controversy because, frankly, it's a massive downer - but it is a huge issue facing the games industry, so I'm interested to get a temperature check from people who love games but aren't professionally obliged to follow the ins and outs.</p>
<p>Do you worry about AI and its effect on the industry? Are you satisfied with genned-up overviews, even if they contain factual errors? Do you really care if developers use genAI in their games? Let us know in the polls below if you're genuinely bothered by the biggest and best studios using AI during development, and if there's a difference in your mind in how it's employed.</p>


<hr>
<p><em>Apologies, that's all a bit rambling. AI could have tightened it up, no doubt, and nuked those typos I missed despite rereading it two, three, ten times. What can I say? Last week was a long one.</em></p>

            <guid>1390324</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-winners-full-list/">one of the most winning-est games in the history of the industry</a>, with multiple Game of the Year wins under its belt on top of awards for several other major categories. Though it now has one less win on its mantle, with the Indie Game Awards, an annual awards show that specifically highlights indie games in the industry, stripping Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 of its Game of the Year win over the fact that Sandfall Interactive used GenAI (generative AI) technology in the game's development.</p>



<p>Now, if you're a regular Wccftech reader, then you'd know that Clair Obsucr: Expedition 33 launched with what were seemingly meant to be temporary, AI-generated assets, <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-ceo-responds-backlash-over-genai-use-divinity-baldurs-gate-3/">as we've brought it up</a> in <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-actor-jennifer-english-using-generative-ai-in-games-dont/">multiple articles</a>. But no one would blame you for not knowing, particularly because the only time Sandfall Interactive admitted to <a href="https://english.elpais.com/culture/2025-07-19/the-low-cost-creative-revolution-how-technology-is-making-art-accessible-to-everyone.html">using GenAI was in an interview with Spanish publication El País this past July</a>.</p>



<p>As to how it got through the IGAs' nominations round and, eventually, to initially winning in two categories, both Debut Game and Game of the Year, <a href="https://www.indiegameawards.gg/faq">an FAQ on the IGAs website reads</a>, "<em>When it was submitted for consideration, a representative of Sandfall Interactive agreed that no gen AI was used in the development of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33.</em>"</p>



<p>Upon learning that was not the case, with the article from July resurfacing and Sandfall Interactive finally confirming to the IGAs when the show premiered that GenAI technology was used in the making of Clair Obscur, the committee ultimately chose to retract its wins for the two aforementioned categories, since any GenAI use at all goes directly against its rules regarding a game's eligibility.</p>



<p>The award for both categories was then given to the closest runner-up, which, for Debut Game, was <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1796580/Sorry_Were_Closed/">Sorry We're Closed</a>, and for Game of the Year was <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1569580/Blue_Prince/">Blue Prince</a>.</p>







<p>Sponsored by publishers like Annapurna and Panic, the Indie Game Awards is an annual awards show with a jury made up of several notable video games industry organizations, including the IGDA (International Game Developers Association) and indie-focused publications and creators.</p>



<p>It may not attract the audience size that The Game Awards does, but it is no less of an authority in the industry with its jury panel, which is partly what makes this whole situation so odd, as Sandfall Interactive seems to have potentially lied directly to notable industry bodies about its use of GenAI in Clair Obscur's development.</p>



<p>It could be that the representative who initially confirmed there was no GenAI use was unaware of it, and Sandfall never realized the confusion until it was too late. That's the most generous reading of what could have happened. The least generous would be that, even if Sandfall realized the issue, the studio chose not to make the IGAs aware and retract its own eligibility, for fear of drawing more attention to the fact that the studio did, in fact, use GenAI technology.</p>



<p>Whether you think GenAI tech should be used in game development or not, the last couple of weeks have proven that it is still a controversial topic among players and game developers alike. Everything that has happened so far <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-ceo-says-a-lot-has-become-lost-in-translation-over-genai-backlash/">with Larian Studios admitting its own GenAI use</a> shows that no matter how universally beloved a studio and its work is, players and developers against GenAI technology will rally and loudly proclaim their disappointment.</p>



<p>That said, the reality of the video game industry seems to be turning more towards <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-said-they-were-doing-something-absolutely-everyone-is-doing-ai-hysteria/">more and more studios at least testing out the technology in their development pipelines</a>, if not using it to create final in-game assets. If none of those games continue to qualify for Indie Game Awards, it's unlikely they'll shed any tears about that. </p>



<p>But with how coy Sandfall Interactive has seemingly been with its own GenAI use, it seems like we're still going to have a fair share of developers who fear the backlash that comes with the public knowing you've 'gone to the dark side,' so to speak. </p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/kim-kardashian-fortnite-skin-item-shop-most-used-2000655163</link>
            <guid>1390318</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i><span>Fortnite</span></i><span> Chapter 7 introduced a Kim Kardashian skin into the battle royale’s shop as part of its Icon series, and though the media mogul and long-time law student wouldn’t be my first choice, she’s apparently everyone else’s (</span><a href="https://www.thegamer.com/fortnite-kim-k-most-popular-skin-landslide/"><span>h/t TheGamer</span></a><span>). According to recent stats from the independently operated site </span><a href="http://fortnite.gg/"><span>Fortnite.GG</span></a><span>, which scrapes publicly available information from the game and presents it in easy-to-read graphs, the “Iconic Kim Kardashian” skin, which first hit </span><i><span>Fortnite</span></i><span>’s shop on December 13, is the most popular skin of the season, with around 5 percent of players using it.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>For reference, the second-most used skin in Chapter 7 is Backlash, a sought-after, in-universe cosmetic that some players believe offers an in-game advantage because it can somewhat camouflage itself in certain areas on the map. Then there’s Cat Holloway, another in-universe character, followed by Chani, Zendaya’s character from the </span><i><span>Dune</span></i><span> series. There are only four other skins in the top 15 that aren’t original </span><i><span>Fortnite</span></i><span> creations: Catwoman, rapper Playboi Carti, Lara Croft, and The Bride from </span><i><span>Kill Bill</span></i><span>. According to Fortnite GG, Kim Kardashian ranks 70th in all-time </span><i><span>Fortnite</span></i><span> cosmetic usage, and she’s only been available for a week and a half.</span></p>

 <p><span>The Kim Kardashian bundle, which is available in-store until December 28, is currently on sale for 3,000 V-Bucks (which is around $19). The bundle includes the Iconic Kim Kardashian skin (a black, latex-style catsuit reminiscent of one of her SKIMS styles); a regular Kim Kardashian skin (a removable fur coat, crop-top, and pants), two backpacks, two pickaxes, two emotes, and a glider.</span></p>

 <p><span>Though I find some of her items to be painfully boring, this is one of the better </span><i><span>Fortnite</span></i><span> skins I’ve seen for a major celebrity in terms of its recreation of Kardashian’s likeness (likely because she is particularly precious with her image) and its variety, which we’ll get to in a sec.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">2025 was a big year for Dill Bits. <a href="https://t.co/JqZ3LWna8S">pic.twitter.com/JqZ3LWna8S</a></p> <p>— Fortnite (@Fortnite) <a href="https://twitter.com/Fortnite/status/2002725861011947999?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 21, 2025</a></p></blockquote>   <p><span>A </span><a href="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/2002725861011947999/photo/1"><span>December 21 post on the official </span><i><span>Fortnite</span></i><span> X account</span></a><span> showing some 2025 highlights suggests these numbers are fairly accurate: the graphic shows that there were 37.5 million games played with Kim Kardashian (and 6.7 million games played with full squads of Sabrina Carpenters).&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Kim Kardashian has a massive reach in the world of pop culture—her TV show, </span><i><span>Keeping Up with the Kardashians</span></i><span>, regularly pulls in millions of viewers, and she has over 350 million followers on Instagram, putting her in the top ten most-followed accounts on the social media app (she’s got more than </span><span>Beyoncé</span><span>).&nbsp; But I think her popularity as a </span><i><span>Fortnite</span></i><span> skin isn’t </span><i><span>just</span></i><span> because she’s a shrewd businesswoman who has cleverly tied her pop culture image into several successful brands.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>First, the Kim Kardashian Icon skin is incredibly customizable, more so than most skins in the game. Like Kardashian herself, many of the items in her bundle are basic. The crop top outfit is pedestrian, the makeup brush pick axe is expected (and she doesn’t even have a makeup brand anymore), and the private jet glider is whatever. But her Iconic catsuit skin has </span><i><span>so</span></i><span> many variations that you’re getting a ton of value for the cost. It can be a tank top, a mock neck, a turtle neck, or strapless. You can choose from seven different colors, some of which look more metallic or latex-y than others. You can put gloves on her or remove them. She can wear sunglasses or not. And her hair can be up in a messy bun, or down and either blonde or brunette.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>It’s this customization, coupled with </span><i><span>Fortnite</span></i><span>’s vibrant community of girls and gays, that makes Kardashian’s skin so popular. Now the crew can drop in as a whole squad of varied Kims and mine the skin for its rich meme potential. I’ve seen dozens of clips of Kim K players </span><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@royaljkr/video/7583534305326959894"><span>hunting down a Chun-Li,</span></a><span> or </span><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@fasher_off/video/7583810227443666198"><span>dancing in a circle with Peely</span></a><span>, or using the pocketbook pickaxe to</span><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@user1235787271/video/7583773343791336759"><span> recreate an iconic </span><i><span>Keeping Up with the Kardashians</span></i><span> clip.</span></a><span> Sabrina Carpenter’s skin was popular for similar reasons: it had several style options and, when coupled with her TikTok-friendly music and emotes, offered a steady stream of clip fodder.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>And of course, there’s the gooner element. </span><i><span>Fortnite</span></i><span> players used to love the aforementioned Chun-Li skin because of her ample ass, and now they’ve got Kim Kardashian’s behind to ogle while playing.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>If you want to get </span><i><span>Fortnite</span></i><span>’s Kim Kardashian skin, it’s available until December 28.&nbsp;</span></p>

              <p>Looking for a new portable speaker that’s great for taking anywhere you go? The Marshall Stanmore III Bluetooth Home Speaker is a great choice. Like all Marshall speakers, the Stanmore III has that classic Marshall look and feel that goes well with a bookshelf, desk, or media center.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6553/">You can find the Marshall Stanmore III Bluetooth Home Speaker on Amazon for $299, previously priced at $400.</a> That’s $101 off and a 25% discount.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6553/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A portable speaker fit for a rock star</h2>
<p>The Marshall Stanmore III Bluetooth Home Speaker provides a high-quality, full-sounding output of music. This comes from the combination of two types of speakers (tweeters &amp; woofers) working together to provide clean and defined highs, as well as deep, rich lows. So no matter what you’re listening to, the audio feels very balanced and fun to listen to. The woven-grille fabric cover on the front protects the speakers from dirt and minor bumps. And its tribute to rock history makes it a fun addition to any collection.</p>
<p>Connecting your mobile device to the speaker via Bluetooth is extremely easy and fast. Once connected, there are no cords to mess with, and you’ll be able to control your playlists from anywhere in the room. Since this speaker allows multiple connections at one time, you can easily switch between users without having to disconnect and reconnect each time. This makes it perfect for parties or gatherings, where many guests want to play their own music.</p>



<p>Those that prefer a hands-on approach can easily adjust the volume, bass and treble with the controls on top of the speaker. Adjusting these settings takes only a few quick turns, allowing you to boost the bass for a workout playlist or add some extra treble for clear vocals.</p>
<p>When designing the Stanmore III, Marshall focused on using high-quality components and making sure they felt sturdy and long-lasting, but not too heavy. They designed the speaker to stay in place on a shelf or table, and it won’t slip around when playing music. In addition to feeling durable, the speaker withstands typical usage without showing a lot of wear.</p>
<p>All in all, the Marshall Stanmore III Bluetooth Home Speaker is a cool looking, easy-to-use and a very powerful speaker that offers a ton of value at its price point. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6553/">As the price of the Marshall Stanmore III Bluetooth Home Speaker is currently on sale for $299 on Amazon, which is down from $400</a>, it is a good option if you are looking for good sound and classic style without breaking the bank. For $299, the Marshall Stanmore III is great for performance that feels worth every penny.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Bloober Team has announced that Cronos: The New Dawn will get a new difficulty option called Temporal Diver Mode in 2026.</p>



<p>Cronos: The New Dawn is a survival-horror third-person shooter released by Bloober Team this September. The title features a spectacular narrative blended with challenging gameplay, which has been well received by players. However, some have complained about it being too difficult for casual players. Now, the developers are introducing a new, easier difficulty mode to open the title for more players. </p>







<h2 id="h-cronos-the-new-dawn-s-temporal-diver-mode-is-an-easier-difficulty-option">Cronos: The New Dawn’s Temporal Diver Mode is an Easier Difficulty Option</h2>



<p>Bloober Team posted a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2BVRu26Fug" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">new video</a> on their official YouTube channel, announcing the arrival of the Temporal Diver Mode difficulty option for Cronos: The New Dawn. The video shows a cinematic in which the Bloober Team HQ receives calls to lower the difficulty or introduce an easy mode for players because it can be too challenging for non-hardcore gamers, or players who wish to experience just the story. </p>



<p>The video ends with the developers addressing the players directly, stating that “Cronos: The New Dawn was a game developed to challenge the players.” However, they have heard the community’s feedback and acknowledged that some would like to explore the story at their own pace. Hence, they are working to create a new difficulty option called Temporal Diver Mode and plan to release it in early 2026. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Since first releasing in 2022, open-world racing game CarX Street has gotten countless updates and pieces of new content, but the update it just dropped is one of its biggest yet. Titled Showdown, it adds a brand-new PvP team mode that pits street racers against pursuing law enforcement.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The mode can be played by up to 16 people at a time, eight on each team. On one side, street racers need to reach a designated area to earn points and then deliver them to a garage. On the other side, police officers are rewarded for neutralizing racers in several different ways, which we’ll cover in detail in a bit.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/19/2-1766174008538.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Each match is played in two rounds, with everyone randomly assigned to either the racers or police, then switching sides between rounds. So you’ll always play as a racer once and a police officer once. The racers have HP, and if their HP is brought down to zero, they lose all their undelivered points and respawn at the garage to try again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Racers lose HP when they run into environmental objects or other cars, so you can’t drive recklessly. But speed is still very important. If a racer drives too slowly while police cars are nearby, their HP will gradually be drained. So you need to make use of your nitro boosts and consistently drive as fast as possible while still keeping your car under control.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/19/4-1766174040402.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">While racers earn points for safely reaching certain parts of the map, police officers earn points for actions that prevent it. They can score points for ramming racers’ cars, arresting racers, or using their unique ability to deploy spike strips that puncture racers’ tires. Plus, they can get points for assisting their teammates, so if you ram a racer that’s later arrested by someone else, you’ll still get points. Police cars can also teleport between police stations scattered across the city, meaning they can strategize and cut off escape routes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But the police aren’t the only ones with a trick up their sleeves: Racers are equipped with an EMP that can temporarily disable any police cars caught in its radius. Both the police’s spike strip and the racers’ EMP are on cooldown timers, so be careful not to waste them. And for the sake of a fair match, cars in this mode are restricted by class, and tire wear and fuel are both ignored. So it’s all about driving skill and strategy, not raw vehicle stats and durability. Each round lasts for about 10 minutes, and whichever team manages to score the most points after two rounds wins.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/19/5-1766174103671.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Developer CarX Technologies has said that the dev team dreamed of creating a cops-and-racers mode since before the game originally launched in 2022, but it was too labor-intensive and complex to develop in tandem with the open-world experience the rest of the game offers. And the inclusion of unique features and visual effects makes it clear how much work went into this mode. Police cars have flashing lights and sirens, arrests are accompanied by voice lines from a police radio channel, and collisions and EMP activations feature unique glitch-like effects.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The gameplay experience of this mode is in stark contrast to the rest of the game, which sees you travel around the fictional Sunset City and its outskirts, facing off against local racing clubs that each have their own unique identity and narrative. You fine-tune your car, from the body kit and brake discs to the engine and suspension, gradually upgrading so you can qualify to take on more difficult opponents.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/19/9-1766174146261.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">A lot went into the development of that core gameplay loop, which then needed to be polished for each platform CarX Street released on. It came to mobile first in 2022, then PC in August 2024, then finally PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S earlier this year. Its multiplatform approach resulted in success, reaching more than 1 million sales across Steam and consoles. Once they had it successfully running on all platforms, the dev team was able to focus on development of the new mode, which started about six months ago with the first concepts and prototypes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It was meant to feel unlike anything else in the game, and police chases were always the primary focus. However, after extensive internal testing, the dev team realized police chases alone weren't enough. That’s how the unique abilities arose, resulting in the addition of spike strips and EMPs.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/19/7-1766174764197.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s safe to say that the result accomplishes the goal of introducing a mode with completely different gameplay, but this is far from the end of the game’s evolution. CarX Technologies has stayed engaged with its community and gets regular feedback that helps guide their updates and new content, and that won’t stop anytime soon. Based on that feedback, they’ve previously mentioned that their future plans include additional competitive multiplayer modes, a dedicated highway network added to the open-world map, and a full story campaign with quests. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">On top of the new mode and other planned updates, CarX Street is also currently on sale on Steam and Xbox, and it just launched a special promotion on PlayStation as well. So there’s never been a better time to get behind the wheel.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a> fans have accused EA of selling an AI-generated image after spotting a sticker of what looks like an M4A1 with two barrels in the in-game store.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Following a similar generative AI controversy for rival shooter Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, Battlefield 6 has come under fire for selling what some fans have called “low quality AI generated garbage.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The sticker in question comes as part of the Windchill cosmetic pack for Battlefield 6, which costs 900 Battlefield Coins. It includes six items, one of which is a player card sticker called Winter Warning. The red flag here are two barrels on the M4A1, but the hand position of the soldier as well as the scope do not look properly aligned.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Remove this AI s**t from the store,” said redditor Willcario in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1prq9x9/remove_this_ai_shit_from_the_store/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a thread upvoted 4,600 times</a>. “Two barrels on the M4A1, sure. I would literally prefer to have no sticker than some low quality AI generated garbage. You can look at BO7 and see how many favors AI generated rewards won with them.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The use of generative AI is one of the hottest topics in the video game industry, with the pressure on publishers to cut costs and speed up development in order to boost profits despite the risk of backlash from some fans. Indeed, according to a report by <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/be980240-13ec-498c-ba79-71eada30d133" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>The Financial Times</u></a>, EA’s new prospective owners (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-goes-private-in-55-billion-deal-with-pif-silver-lake-and-affinity-partners-andrew-wilson-to-remain-as-ceo"><u>the ones who just spent $55 billion to take the company private</u></a>) are betting on the use of generative AI to do just that. And EA itself, even before it was bought out, had signalled that it was all-in on generative AI, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-says-ai-is-the-very-core-of-its-business-what-does-that-mean"><u>CEO Andrew Wilson insisting AI is at “the very core of its business.”</u></a></p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">This definitely looks AI Generated right? <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Battlefield6?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#Battlefield6</a> <a href="https://t.co/VLYMhEMOqQ" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/VLYMhEMOqQ</a></p>— Battlefield 6 News (@BF6Updates) <a href="https://twitter.com/BF6Updates/status/2002568867575705950?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">December 21, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">While EA has yet to issue a statement on the Battlefield 6 allegations, fans are digging up past comments from Rebecka Coutaz, general manager of original series developer DICE in Sweden, and Criterion, the UK studio now also a part of what’s collectively called Battlefield Studios, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-exec-insists-players-wont-see-anything-made-by-very-seducing-generative-ai-in-battlefield-6">who in October said players wouldn’t see anything made by generative AI in Battlefield 6</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Coutaz said that while generative AI “is very seducing,” currently there is no way to work it into the developers’ daily work. However, Coutaz clarified that generative AI is used in preparatory stages "to allow more time and more space to be creative.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While this is Battlefield 6's first significant generative AI controversy, Call of Duty has suffered a number of gen AI controversies in recent years, including the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-fans-give-black-ops-6s-zombie-santa-loading-screen-the-finger-amid-ai-slop-backlash"><u>now-infamous six-fingered zombie Santa bundle</u></a>.

Currently, Battlefield 6 has no such AI content disclosure on Steam.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And last month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-responds-to-complaints-of-ai-generated-assets-in-call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Activision issued a statement in response to a player outcry regarding the seeming use of generative AI art assets in a number of areas of Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>. Players took to social media to complain about images they believed to be AI-generated across the game, primarily focusing on calling card images that they claimed used Studio Ghibli styling, following <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/studio-ghibli-ai-trend-sparks-chatgpt-backlash-resurfaces-old-comments-from-hayao-miyazaki-and-even-zelda-williams-has-waded-in"><u>a trend of AI-Ghibli images from earlier this year</u></a>. The Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Steam page also includes the following disclaimer: "Our team uses generative AI tools to help develop some in game assets."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This week, IGN reported on video game Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/indie-game-awards-strips-clair-obscur-expedition-33-of-game-of-the-year-over-gen-ai-dev-says-placeholder-textures-were-patched-out-after-slipping-through-qa-process"><u>which was stripped of its Game of the Year award by The Indie Game Awards over its use of generative AI</u></a>.

                <p dir="ltr">These past two months with Arc Raiders have been the most fun I've had with games all year. It represents the most exciting and unpredictable multiplayer landscape I've jumped into since Sea of Thieves in 2018, which I consider my favorite game ever made. It's safe to say I really love Arc Raiders. But it's become difficult to fully espouse those feelings as we learn about Embark Studio's use of generative AI.</p><p dir="ltr">According to the studio, Arc Raiders' voice acting was initially performed by humans, then used to "train" AI so that it could speak in the actors' voices while addressing any possible circumstance. For Embark, the team doesn't need to bring in the voice actors each time new content is added to the game. The AI voices learn to speak in the voices of the actors, which the actors are said to have agreed upon when they were hired, and the tools take it from there. Maybe it shouldn't have come as a surprise, since the team's previous game, The Finals, uses generative AI in a similar way. In an <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/arc-raiders/generative-ai-use" rel="nofollow ">interview</a>, Embark assured players that the game's visual artwork is entirely human-made, but admitted to using this text-to-speech training to bring voices to the game's shop NPCs, emotes, and other character barks. Knowing this has left me conflicted when I think to sing the game's praises.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Arc Raiders Review</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">On one hand, I can't deny the hold Arc Raiders has taken over me. The heart wants what the heart wants, and Embark's extraction shooter, rich in emergent, player-driven drama, has lit my heart on fire in a way few games ever have. At the same time, I've already written <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/arc-raiders-review-us-against-the-world/1900-6418435/">my review</a>. Though it was a glowing one that I don't regret, I also feel it's my job to call out this disappointing practice. In recent weeks, similar practices or plans have arisen in several high-profile examples. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-divinity-dev-reveals-how-it-uses-generative-ai/1100-6537001/">Larian Studios' boss vouched</a> for it in some cases. Nexon's former CEO said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-nexon-ceo-says-aaa-games-are-in-end-of-days-and-ai-is-about-to-rewrite-everything/1100-6536651/">AI is about to rewrite everything</a> in the games industry. Ubisoft announced it's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-is-using-an-ai-tool-for-writing-in-its-games/1100-6512552/">using an AI tool to help write its games</a> in some instances. Even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ai-should-be-embraced-not-feared-two-prominent-game-developers-say/1100-6535479/">Hideo Kojima, often considered a unique voice in the industry, says he uses it at times</a>. It's being presented as not just helpful, but inevitable.</p><p dir="ltr">Is it, though? It seems that most of the people vouching for the technology are C-suite executives and studio higher-ups, who are obviously invested in it, emotionally and professionally, because it has the chance to cut down on the time and money a project demands. But so much of what generative AI does is also, to put it bluntly, a crock of shit.</p><p dir="ltr">We know by now that, when used as a search engine, generative AI is woefully problematic. It's not scrubbing the internet for facts. It's a sentence construction guessing machine, in which each word in a sentence or paragraph is based on what it expects the right sequence of words or sentences to be, based on a mass of data it rips from whatever sources its creators have fed it. This allows for some AI bots, like X's Grok, to <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/grok-antisemitic-posts-x-xai/" rel="nofollow ">routinely express factually incorrect, sometimes even hateful rhetoric</a>. It was raised on the views of its CEO's exhausting edgelordism.</p><p dir="ltr">As a writing tool, generative AI is a legendary plagiarizer, remixing the mass of older books, articles, and other human-made works it's been fed and regurgitating them as pure, irredeemable slop, often sold for cheap on Amazon, where it <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DO6C14Tielx/?hl=en" rel="nofollow ">preys on readers and gift-givers who don't have the internet literacy to recognize the mess they're buying</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">AI pictures and videos, meanwhile, are getting much more lifelike, which some say hurts the argument that we ought not use the tech. Others say they consult with AI-generated imagery merely as a jumping-off point, a brainstorming speedrun, where human artists take the kernels of ideas the AI creates and build on them from there. Executives, like Epic's Tim Sweeney, say generative AI will become so ubiquitous that efforts like Steam's labeling system used to<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ai-disclosures-make-no-sense-for-game-stores-tim-sweeney-says/1100-6536526/"> disclose generative AI usage in games will quickly become pointless</a>. There's even some debate about just <a href="https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2025/09/what-you-need-to-know-about-ai-and-climate-change/" rel="nofollow ">how problematic it may be for the environment</a>, which further muddies the ethical questions surrounding the tech. When, if ever, is it reasonable to use it? But I find all of these caveats and arguments ultimately fail to respond to the most significant consideration that will be forever tied to generative AI, no matter how reliable, clean, or unbiased it could someday become: Our humanity matters.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4596258-arcraiders_16-9_13.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4596258" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4596258-arcraiders_16-9_13.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4596258"></a><figcaption>In this image: how it sometimes feels to oppose the rise of generative AI in games.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4596258-arcraiders_16-9_13.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Art is one of the greatest gifts we can give back to the world as human beings. The depth of our thinking and creating is unique to this world, possibly to this universe. I can't see a valid argument or excuse for the use case of generative AI that overcomes this truth. That's why Arc Raiders' use of it is so unfortunate. One of the best games of the year comes with this heavy asterisk beside it. Those voice actors deserved better, and their signing-away of their likenesses only hurts themselves and their peers, both currently and into the future. What seems true of this technology is that it tends to improve the more you train it. Because of that, using it is ethically questionable, and in some cases, such as the one in Arc Raiders, truly disheartening. Maybe Arc Raiders' AI voiceovers will get better with time, but that doesn't substitute for the fact that voice acting is a talent, an art form of its own, that deserves to be performed by people who bring authentic emotions to their roles, rather than bots that are faking it every step of the way.</p><p dir="ltr">What advocates for AI usage overlook is that the creation itself is a vital part of the project. This is what instills it with life and perspective. Generative AI can't be art because it's not made with a perspective; it's made with a prompt. Of all the counterarguments to using generative AI, I think this is the hardest to convey to people casually interested in the technology. The people who ask ChatGPT to conjure up a meme, write their cover letter, or answer their health-related questions may not be thinking about the cumulative human toll that using this tech takes. It's hard to quantify just why our humanity matters and how the use of generative AI harms it. It's sort of an abstract argument that must appeal to their hearts, first and foremost.</p><p dir="ltr">But there is also a practical argument, because the more we use generative AI, the more we are training it to replace us, as workers, as creators, as beings with a sense of belonging. As tech execs once again boat-race legislators on where the regulatory lines should be drawn, we are speeding toward a world where a highly exclusive few accumulate all the wealth, while working people are replaced industry by industry. There is an economic reckoning on the way, so any feeding of this beast becomes an architect of that dystopia. This issue stretches well beyond Arc Raiders and even well beyond games, of course. This is a problem that will worsen for everyone. It's hard for me to lose sight of that truth.</p><p dir="ltr">Arc Raiders proves how generative AI use doesn't necessarily ruin a game, but in its case, it hasn't really improved it either. It improves it from a workflow standpoint, some may say, but the finished artwork that is Arc Raiders doesn't seem to have been made better because of generative AI, so is it really worth the cost? As <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-concept-artists-say-genai-isnt-making-things-easier/1100-6537107/">more developers speak out about obstacles being created by generative AI</a>, studios seem to be adopting it out of fear they'll be left behind, not realizing it's sometimes what slows others down.</p><p dir="ltr">All of this will be at the forefront of my on-the-job mind for the foreseeable future. I've done a lot of interviews here at GameSpot and expect to do many more. I'll ask developers I speak with how they plan to use this technology. I feel that we've reached an inflection point, a fork in the road. We can normalize this, accept it as inevitable, and let it further seep into games, TV, books, and other art forms we appreciate, or we can ask important questions. Why are you using this tech? What problems does it solve? What problems does it create? <em>Who benefits, and who is left behind?</em> Arc Raiders was a lightning rod for this topic here at the end of 2025. It's made my personal Game of the Year pick feel awkward and uncomfortable, but it's not the last of its kind. If executives can so thoughtlessly trade creative spirit for a percentage on their bottom line, I think it's extremely important that we challenge them to tell us why.</p>

                <p>The actor who provided the motion capture for Clair Obscur: Expedition 33's Gustave has spoken out to say it would be "more logical" to have a Best Character category at awards shows to help give credit to everyone who contributed to bringing a character to life in a game. The actor, Maxence Cazorla, is saying this against the backdrop of only one person, voice actor Charlie Cox, being nominated for Best Performance at The Game Awards for the role of Gustave. For what it's worth, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/expedition-33-star-reacts-to-tga-nomination-says-he-doesnt-deserve-all-the-credit/1100-6536464/" data-ref-id="1100-6536464">Cox was open in acknowledging that Cazorla deserved credit, too</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/expedition-33-actor-says-hes-truly-grateful-for-outpouring-of-support-after-charlie-cox-spoke-out/1100-6536509/" data-ref-id="1100-6536509">Cazorla said Cox was kind to say that.</a></p><p>Cox did not end up winning Best Performance, as it was Jennifer English as Maelle from Expedition 33 who <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-game-awards-2025-winners-nominees/2900-7258/" data-ref-id="2900-7258">took home the award</a>. In any event, Cazorla told <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscurs-gustave-motion-performer-argues-game-awards-should-have-a-best-character-category-rather-than-isolating-a-single-performer-and-potentially-leaving-others-invisible" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a> that he believes a "Best Character category feels more logical" than "isolating a single performer and potentially leaving others invisible."</p><p>Whether or not this is something that host and organizer Geoff Keighley is considering for next year's The Game Awards is unknown.</p><p>Cazorla went on to say that it was an "incredible honor" for him that Cox "spoke publicly and acknowledged my work."</p><p>"I was deeply moved by his humility and generosity," he said.</p><p>Cazorla said a character like Gustave is a "combination of these two performances," referencing his physical contributions to the motion capture and Cox's voice. He also gave credit to the "incredible writing and development work" for Gustave.</p><p>While Cazorla said he would like to see a Best Character award in the future, he's not so sure about an award for the best performance capture. "I think it's a delicate subject, because every game is built differently," Cazorla said. "In this case, Clair Obscur is a game where many of the characters are created through collaboration between two actors."</p><p>Expedition 33's other major characters, including Maelle, Lune, and Verso were performed by multiple actors as well, Cazorla pointed out. "Other games might have a single actor doing full performance capture, and some projects even involve stunt performers, motion-capture actors, and voice actors all contributing to the same character," he said.</p><p>Given all that, Cazorla said he thinks the "fairest way to celebrate performers" is through an award, or some kind of recognition, that celebrates the character instead.</p><p>The DICE Awards already do this, Cazorla pointed out. "I think it's a very intelligent approach," he said. For the latest DICE Awards, the character Indiana Jones from Indiana Jones and the Great Circle won the award. He was performed by Troy Baker, for both his voice and the motion capture.</p><p>Expedition 33 just had one of its awards taken away, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-just-lost-its-indie-game-of-the-year-awards-over-ai-concerns/1100-6537129/" data-ref-id="1100-6537129">The Indie Game Awards revoked the title's Game of the Year win amid AI concerns.</a> GameSpot <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-is-gamespots-game-of-the-year-2025/1100-6536771/" data-ref-id="1100-6536771">named Expedition 33 our Game of the Year. </a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Titan Quest II developer Grimlore Games has revealed the next major update for its early access action-RPG. The next update adds Chapter 3 of the story and is expected to arrive "<em>soon</em>," and in the meantime, Grimlore Games has outlined everything players will get to check out in the new update in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1154030/view/494963545565299631">new blog post on the game's Steam page</a>.</p>



<p>Chapter 3 will take players to the Plains of Arkadia and to Mount Olympos, where you'll meet Olympians and find yourself in the center of a centaur-riddled battlefield, facing off against the half-human, half-horse creatures and even more mythical beasts.</p>



<p>You'll also get to explore the city of Tegea, which you'll find to be currently under the control of a centaur tribe that you'll fight to liberate the city from. Chapter 3 also adds three new boss fights, which also includes a chapter boss fight that Grimlore Games didn't spoil in the blog, but one that the studio says will be an "<em>exciting</em>" fight.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/titan-quest-ii-first-major-content-update-coming-soon-grimlore-games/">Chapter 2's arrival back in September</a> was the game's first major content update, which took the story of Nemesis further and, similarly to the upcoming Chapter 3, added a new enemy faction and areas for players to explore. Grimlore Games has been slowly adding more and more since the release of Chapter 2, and there's still plenty more to come beyond Chapter 3 and after the holidays.</p>



<p>If you want to jump into Titan Quest II now while it continues to grow in early access, the game is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1154030/Titan_Quest_II/">currently on sale on Steam as part of the platform's big Winter Sale</a>.</p>

            <guid>1390270</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Studio Wildcard has confirmed that you're not going to see upcoming survival sequel <em>Ark 2 </em>until 2028 at the earliest, and while this doesn't technically represent a delay, it's later than the studio's otherwise most recent assessment.</p><p>As revealed by Studio Wildcard co-founder Jeremy Stieglitz on the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/sci-fi-dino-taming-survival-game-ark-2-eyes-a-2028-release-with-a-little-or-a-lot-of-vin-diesel" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Epic Games Store</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/after-originally-being-revealed-in-2020-ark-2-has-been-delayed-again-until-2028/" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">VGC</a>), <em>Ark 2 </em>is currently targeting a 2028 release. Presumably, that'll be an Early Access launch as well, which means it could be a number of years more before the full version is out there.</p><p>Back in <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/ark-2/interview-development-update" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">June</a>, Stieglitz and Studio Wildcard said that <em>Ark 2 </em>would "hopefully" be released "within the next two years", which would have put the release at June 2027 at the latest. Technically, then, this latest 2028 estimate could be said to be a delay of sorts.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>It's going to be a while before you can get your hands on <em>Ark 2</em>.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Before <em>Ark 2</em>'s arrival, however, there will be an expansion for <em>Ark: Survival Ascended </em>by the name of <em>Legacy of Santiago</em>, and it'll introduce "a lot of the mechanics and features" intended for the sequel by way of a sort of test launch for Studio Wildcard.</p><p>There's plenty of other stuff planned for <em>Ark: Survival Ascended </em>throughout 2026 and 2027 as well, so if you're worried you'll be hurting for <em>Ark</em>-related content, you needn't be. You'll just have to wait a little longer for the full-blown sequel.</p><p><em>Ark 2 </em>was originally announced all the way back at <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/live-game-awards-2020-announcements-and-news" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a982241a-bdbb-4ed6-918b-2b5ee8272e07" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">2020's The Game Awards ceremony</a>. It was intended for release in 2023, but was subsequently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ark-2-delayed-to-end-of-2024-ark-survival-ascended-remaster-announced" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="27a1bb9d-48a9-4dea-990b-fbb9e6982107" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">delayed to 2024</a>, although obviously, that rough release window didn't hold true in the end either.</p><p>When it does arrive, <em>Ark 2 </em>promises "the definitive next-gen survival experience", and it's got big names like Vin Diesel and Auliʻi Cravalho behind it, so this one'll be a more star-studded project than its predecessors, it seems.</p>
<p><em>Ark 2 </em>is currently slated for release in 2028, although given previous delays, that may not hold true for long. Stay tuned for more.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

<figcaption><em>Cronos: The New Dawn </em>is getting a new, easier difficulty mode next year.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Bloober Team hasn't explained exactly how the new difficulty mode will work, but we can make a few educated guesses; it'll probably reduce <em>Cronos: The New Dawn</em>'s focus on resource management and combat, although it likely won't remove those elements entirely.</p><p>In any case, the storied horror studio is promising more information "in the coming weeks", so we will learn more about what will change and what will stay the same in the Temporal Diver difficulty mode soon.</p><p>If you're not familiar with <em>Cronos: The New Dawn</em>, it's an original survival horror game by Bloober Team, perhaps best known for its work on last year's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-2-remake-sales-2-5m-worldwide" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="b6940450-1468-41cf-8204-e4a2084d3f43" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">successful <em>Silent Hill 2 </em>remake</a>, as well as the likes of licensed spook-'em-up <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/blair-witch" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e47e5379-5686-451a-9164-1641ecae29eb" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Blair Witch</em></a><em> </em>and horror walking sim series <em>Layers of Fear</em>.</p><p>Unlike other Bloober Team offerings, this one's a full-blooded survival horror, complete with resource management-based gameplay and combat against gribblies, as well as the requisite mind-bending narrative element. You can check out the rather fun new trailer for its Temporal Diver difficulty mode here.</p>

<figcaption>The <em>Octopath Traveler </em>series has hit a new sales milestone.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>If you're unfamiliar with <em>Octopath Traveler</em>, it's a series of JRPGs using Square Enix's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/trademark-for-octopath-travelers-hd-2d-filed-by-square-enix" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e05c87ad-0bb0-443f-8718-b1f4c33495b5" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">trademark HD-2D style</a>, and the first two games in the series revolve around eight individual characters, each of whom has their own story.</p><p>The first <em>Octopath Traveler </em>game essentially tells each of the stories separately; there are opportunities for party members to speak to one another, but essentially, you're playing eight different narratives, <em>Live a Live</em>-style.</p><p>For the sequel, Square Enix shook up the formula a little, allowing more conversation between party members and introducing a more interconnected narrative, but in essence, <em>Octopath Traveler II </em>still espouses the more disparate approach favored by its predecessor.</p><p>The recently-released <em>Octopath Traveler 0</em> is a different kettle of fish, though; it's an attempt to tell a more unified story with a slightly more conventional structure, although our reviewer Robert <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/octopath-traveler-0-review-free-to-play" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ecc530cb-3c09-4d26-bf98-39e372f94c50" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">didn't exactly feel that it succeeded</a> in this goal.</p>
<p>The HD-2D series doesn't stop with <em>Octopath Traveler</em>, of course; it also encompasses Square Enix's recent and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-outsold-expectations" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="413ac67f-86f4-4570-947d-dd9b76574dde" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">rather successful</a> <em>Dragon Quest </em>remakes, as well as the upcoming (and rather oddly-named) action RPG <em>The Adventures of Elliot: The Millennium Tales</em>.</p><p>With numbers like this, it's safe to say there will be another <em>Octopath Traveler </em>game along before you know it. For now, though, you'll have to content yourself with <em>Octopath Traveler 0</em>, which is available now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3014320/OCTOPATH_TRAVELER_0/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">PC</a><a data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">, </a><a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/octopath-traveler-0/" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">PlayStation</a><a data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">, </a><a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/octopath-traveler-0-digital-deluxe-edition/9NB9WKNPNRPQ/0010/9RR2ZP5WQ7QS" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and both <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/octopath-traveler-0-switch-2/" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Switch 2</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/octopath-traveler-0-switch/" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Switch</a>.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-clears-out-ugreen-6-in-1-steam-deck-dock-at-almost-nothing-works-with-rog-xbox-ally-macbook-and-more-2000655062</link>
            <guid>1390255</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you have a Steam Deck, one of its most underrated features is the option to use it with your TV. You can do just that with the the UGREEN 6-in-1 Steam Deck Dock. In fact, it has several ways to expand the functionality of your Steam Deck with additional ports and connectivity options for using controllers, monitors, and adding additional storage. And it’s on sale right now, in addition to all those things.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6343/">You can find the UGREEN 6-in-1 Steam Deck Dock on Amazon for $29.97 (which is a savings of $16.03 and 35% off) compared to the standard price of $46</a>. So now’s the best time to get one.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6343/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A portable Steam Deck dock that unlocks additional features</h2>
<p>This dock has some useful features, like an Ethernet port to let you connect via cable to a wired internet network for better stability. It also includes a USB-C port that allows you to pass through power to your Steam Deck while you use the rest of the ports.</p>
<p>It also includes two USB-A ports that you can use to hook up controllers, external hard drives, flash drives, and more. So you could use this to plug in a controller you already own or a keyboard and mouse for a more PC-like experience.</p>
<p>Finally, there’s an HDMI port so you can connect your Steam Deck to a monitor or large-screen TV for a better viewing experience. Since the dock can send a clean signal, you should be able to see your games clearly on your TV or monitor, and since you can easily switch back and forth between handheld mode and docking mode with the dock, you can easily transition from handheld gaming to a TV or computer experience.</p>



<p>Setting up this dock is relatively easy and straightforward. Once you connect the dock to your Steam Deck and any devices you wish to use, you are good to go. There is no need to download any software to set it up or configure anything complicated. In addition, since it is very compact, it doesn’t take up a lot of space on your desk or entertainment system, and since it has a simple design, it will fit right in next to your gaming gear.</p>
<p>I would say that the build quality of the UGREEN dock is well-suited for the price point. The connectors are securely attached to the dock, so when you insert your cables they won’t come loose. Additionally, the dock itself is very light weight, making it easy to take with you wherever you may go.</p>
<p>If you plan to frequently switch between handheld and docked gaming modes, then I think the UGREEN 6-in-1 Steam Deck Dock is a useful and affordable addition to your gaming rig. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6343/">For just $29.97 on Amazon, the dock is an affordable way to add more connectivity options to your Steam Deck, and provide yourself with a more flexible gaming experience.</a></p>

Reese didn't directly confirm those titles, but he also seemed to leave the door open for them.</p><p>"We've successfully brought back the classic era [Tomb Raider 1-6] and now the origin story of Lara Croft to modern Nintendo platforms," said Reese. "We can't announce anything at the moment, but the passionate response to this release is strong encouragement for us to continue exploring those possibilities."</p><p>Reese also indicated that more patches will be added for Tomb Raider's Switch ports, but didn't share any details beyond that.

            <link>https://aftermath.site/nyc-subway-omny-metrocard/</link>
            <guid>1390243</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>This morning, The New York Times provocatively declared “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/22/nyregion/new-york-city-metrocard-end.html?unlocked_article_code=1.-k8.1N5p.K2WopG2xwDEr&amp;smid=nytcore-ios-share&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>good riddance?</u></a>” to the MetroCard, New York City’s transit pass that has been in use since 1994. The MTA, NYC’s transit authority, has been rolling out a new system, OMNY, which you can pay with your phone or by tapping a card rather than swiping. No one would disagree that the rollout has been a <a href="https://nygroove.nyc/omny-problems/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>disaster</u></a>, but New Yorkers are torn on whether OMNY represents a brave new technofuture or the death of a small piece of the city’s soul. I am in the latter camp, in large part because the OMNY card machine sucks.</p><p>And look, I get that you aren’t supposed to <em>need</em> the machine; you’re supposed to connect OMNY to your phone or bank account and never have to refill it again. The classism here is obvious–what if you don’t have a smart phone or a bank account?–which is why I appreciate that an OMNY card can also be filled with cash like a MetroCard. That is the only way I personally have used it: While the MetroCard is still accepted until the end of the year, I was forced to convert to the OMNY card a few months ago when the last MetroCard machines finally vanished from every station in my neighborhood. I am old and contrary and do not want to pay for anything using my phone, and I was also turned off enough by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/10/nyregion/metrocard-omny-nyc-rider-issues.html?ref=aftermath.site"><u>horror stories</u></a> of glitchy OMNY cards to refuse to give it access to my bank account, so I shove my wrinkled dollars and random coins into the new machine and then live with the mystery–which the MTA <a href="https://pix11.com/news/transit/omny-users-may-soon-see-remaining-balances-in-nyc-subways/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>might fix</u></a>–of never knowing how much money is on my card when I use it, because the new OMNY gates don’t show your balance the way the MetroCard reader did.</p><p>This means I am frequently confronted with the OMNY machine. The OMNY system is designed by <a href="https://go.cubic.com/hubfs/CTS%20Collateral/CTS/Case%20Studies/Cubic%20Transportation%20Systems%20OMNY%20Case%20Study.pdf?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Cubic Transportation Systems</u></a>, which administers several cities’ transit and also dabbles in <a href="https://theintercept.com/2022/10/03/cubic-military-public-transit-mta-omny/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>military contracts and surveillance</u></a> (another good reason, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/12/18/justice-department-fbi-first-amendment-antifa/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>especially these days</u></a>, to put <a href="https://www.404media.co/i-tracked-nyc-subway-rider-home-omny-mta/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>cash</u></a> on your card). It’s a squat machine with a giant touch screen, and if you ask me the whole thing looks like a scrunched-up face, like it’s a little disgusted that you’d dare to use it. It has a silver case accented with dull gray plastic, with tiny cutouts for your coins and credit card but, in its favor, a very obvious area where you tap your OMNY card to start the interaction. I don’t know why the machine is so small; in the stations near me, single OMNY machines huddle in the cavernous spaces where multiple MetroCard machines once stood, looking outmatched and adrift. It is easy enough to use, when it’s working–I have frequently encountered machines that aren’t taking payments–but as I get used to it, its blank, undifferentiated surface sometimes leaves me casting around for where I need to interact with it as if I’ve never used a transit fare machine before, when I have lived in this city for over 20 years and feel like I need to make a big show of that fact as I wave my hands around the OMNY machine in angry bafflement. Using it is perfunctory and commonplace, but it does–or is supposed to–translate your money into public transit rides.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hy5YK-6Zb1A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="How to Buy OMNY Card in NYC | Subway &amp; Bus Contactless Payment ॥ Step by Step"></iframe></figure><p>Contrast that to the MetroCard machine, designed by <a href="https://www.antennadesign.com/work/transit/metrocard-vending-machine?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Antenna</u></a>. The New York Times pointed out that the MetroCard machine got an exhibit in the Museum of Modern Art in <a href="https://www.moma.org/interactives/exhibitions/2011/talktome/objects/145494/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>2011</u></a>, and I can see why. The MetroCard machine takes great pains to make its <a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/affordances?srsltid=AfmBOoruX6ow8Ou9XptEvCDOlaNLV7ZXFWiXUTPyWQ_jGybKvSyOPly-&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>affordances</u></a> obvious: color-coded areas for your money, card, and change. It’s got raised surfaces and big rounded edges; dated, sure, and a little reminiscent of a kid’s toy, but all of it guides your eyes and hands through the process of using the machine. Unlike the OMNY machine, it <em>wants </em>you to use it; its size and bright colors grab your attention and draw you to it in the station. And look, all of us know the pain of endlessly poking at a non-responsive touch screen, a problem I have not yet had with an OMNY machine, either because the OMNY screens are better or because millions of New Yorkers’ grubby hands haven’t broken them yet. And I’ll acknowledge that all of us know the frustration of facing a row of broken MetroCard machines when we’re trying to get somewhere. But the MetroCard machine is cheerful and welcoming and distinct. It looks robust, like a functional public object should. <em>You’re walking here</em>, it seems to declare. <em>Let’s walk here together.</em>&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Liliana Drew/Pexels</span></figcaption></figure><p>The OMNY machine does not want to walk with you. The OMNY machine looks like some mixup with its secretary reduced it to mingling among the masses and it just wants to hide in a corner of the station reading The Wall Street Journal on its phone until someone from corporate comes to pick it up in a car. It doesn’t <em>want</em> to be an object; it <em>wants</em> you to have done all this online, but it’s been reluctantly conscripted into existing in the physical world with you. It wants to downplay its nature as a machine and be as seamless an item as possible between you and the lonely, weightless <em>Tron</em>scape of cyberspace. But don’t we live that way enough?</p><p>This weekend a friend and I went to the <a href="https://www.nytransitmuseum.org/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>New York Transit Museum</u></a>, which currently features a <a href="https://www.nytransitmuseum.org/exhibits/?ref=aftermath.site#brooklyn"><u>farewell exhibit</u></a> for the MetroCard. We strolled the cases of old MetroCards saying “I remember this one!” and reminiscing about when we used to use tokens (which I also clung to until the last possible moment), and the experience did remind me that New York is a city of change. It frequently demands you move out of your comfort zone, leaving behind apartments, friends, and favorite haunts as the city transforms and the world spins on. But the one constant in my time in New York has been being <em>in New York</em>: not on my phone or on the internet, but in the physical city with its chaos and bustle and opportunity. The MetroCard machine was a machine for the real world, a gateway to touch and interaction and weight. The OMNY machine, despite being a transit machine, just seems to want me to stay home.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I’ll admit the OMNY card itself is a step up from the flimsy, losable MetroCard, and that tapping is easier than swiping, if so far not terribly less error-prone. (A personal quibble: the OMNY card does not fit in my wallet as neatly as my MetroCard given its girth, making it annoying to take out and put away.) I’m sure the MetroCard will slowly fade from my vocabulary, and that I’ll get used to the OMNY card and its bullshit machines. But this adaptation will take a piece of my soul with it, as so much change in the city has. You will never be my real dad, OMNY card machine, and I will never love you.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Demeo x Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Battlemarked is a game that immediately charms you… once you’ve finished reading the dissertation-length title and start playing it. Taking the digital boardgaming of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/02/27/demeo-psvr-2-ps5-review/">Demeo</a> and mixing it with the setting and tropes of Dungeons &amp; Dragons, it presents a light, fun and accessible entry into the preeminent world of role playing games.</p>
<p><iframe title="Demeo x Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Battlemarked | Accolades Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W7kih-c-RJc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>There’s two campaigns to delve into within Battlemarked, visiting the well-known regions of Neverwinter and Icewind Dale from the wider D&amp;D world, both of which are on the cusp of disaster with the need for an adventuring party of heroes to step in and rescue the situation.</p>


<p>This provides one of the biggest differences to Demeo, as the campaigns are more than just battling through multi-level dungeons. The stories pick up in a thoroughly traditional D&amp;D fashion, you’ve got dialogue with other characters, skill check rolls to see if you can avoid battles, and a map of the region where you can choose between main quest locations, side missions and more to visit. With voiced narration and how each scenario is framed, it does a great job of capturing the structure and tone of a D&amp;D adventure, even if the story itself is pretty rote and predictable. If you just want to dungeon crawl? Well, the two main dungeons from each campaign can be unlocked to play separately, though you need to beat them first.</p>


<p>As with Demeo, everything is rendered as though it’s this gloriously elaborate tabletop RPG boardgame, moving static digital figured around the board, instead of having their limbs articulate to run around, rolling dice and seeing them bounce around the environment, but still having flames, water, lightning and more elemental effects shoot through the levels. Playing on a flatscreen, it might take you a good long while to realise that this board is actually situated within a 3D environment, catching little peripheral glimpses of hanging wall art as you zoom in, and then taking more control of the camera to look around. It’s there so that you’re sharing the same space as anyone that’s playing in VR, and a nice bit of continuity between the two modes.</p>
<p>The fundamentals here remain the same as in Demeo, just with all the D&amp;D classes, enemies and abilities now folded into the experience. That means that when you’re stuck in the thick of the action, you’ll have two action points per turn with which to move and to playing abilities from a hand of cards and items. As you look to attack, you’ll be rolling a bespoke 20-sided die which is all successful hits, bar for the one critical hit and critical failure. It’s a simplified rendition of role playing that’s much more like a dedicated boardgame than a turn-based RPG like Baldur’s Gate 3, and that keeps things nice and light as you go dungeon crawling and battling through throngs of enemies.</p>
<p>And there really can be some big hordes that you face off against. When you get down into a dungeon, you’re working through multiple levels, searching for an enemy that holds the key to the exit, which you also need to find. Countless times, you’ll open up a door and find half a dozen enemies waiting for you on the other side – not least because dungeons have an endless spawn mechanic. Time it well within the turn order and you’ll have the drop on a cluster of enemies, able to then unleash chained magical attacks and control the zone of engagement, but do it with the last character in your turn and you could be put on the back foot.</p>

<p>You can include four characters in your party, with a Dragonborn Paladin, Tiefling Rogue, Hallfling Wizard, and more in the line up of six defined classes. You sadly don’t have a full character creator, but can tweak the colours through their design, give them a custom name, and as you level up, have some limited ways to tweak the class build. You’ll put points from levelling up into the main class skill, and then chosen sub-attributes, picking from three options at each point, which can be chance-based boosts, additional damage, or even new skill cards. This isn’t the traditional RPG power scaling, but every little boost will help.</p>
<p>You’ve got a hand of ten cards, unless you spend upgrades to expand it, and that includes the fixed abilities, as well as items. As you open chests in the level, buy them from a shop, and earn them periodically for dishing out damage, it can become a real juggling act, and you’ll often feel like you’re missing some of the best abilities. I regularly find myself dismissing cards I don’t want, and you’ll have to do this preemptively as cards earned are just chucked in the bin automatically if your hand is filled.</p>
<p>It’s all part of the tactical management you engage in through battle, choosing when to open a chest for maximum benefit, or go back and use a healing fountain, how to use barrels and AoE attacks, when to delay a hero’s turn so that another can soften up enemies, and so on. Playing solo you’ve got a pretty full overview of the possibilities, but in multiplayer you’ll need to talk and coordinate through your options. I’d love to be able to see other people’s hands, or inspect and manage out of turns, but that’s a relatively minor quibble.</p>

<p>One thing I do feel throughout is a slight clumsiness to interacting with the game. As charming as it is to move a hero unit through the 3D levels, to roll a die and see it bounce of the scenery, to take a card from your hand to deliberately place it, it’s also a little bit of a chore and difficult to parse at times. Scenery can often get in the way of visualising AoE attacks and movements, thanks to the strict camera angle when playing on 2D, and selecting a card often puts the initial target point far away from anything that’s relevant, making you scroll around. It’s also a bit too easy to accidentally just move and not attack at the end of it, as you choose the position and then try to nudge into the target for a basic attack. It feels as though this game was designed with VR more in mind, but here you have to deal with some VR pointing jitter when selecting cards to play, and it’s easy to be too far away from what you can reach and have to drag yourself over.</p>
<p>That said, playing in VR is a real treat. The characters look so much more physical and model-like in VR, and there’s great flexibility to being able to move your view around. Heck, you can even zoom all the way in until your shoulder-to-shoulder with the characters.</p>

<p>At launch one a big complaint was that you had to fill vacant slots with basic level 1 ‘Hireling’ versions of characters that couldn’t be levelled up. Thankfully Resolution Games has already started to rework this – an update last week now means you can have full-fledged, upgradable heroes in all your slots in a single player party, and a similar update is set to come for multiplayer as well.</p>

			<p>There are great Indie Games every year, but it's not every year that games from independent developers dominate the conversation around what could be game of the year, and then actually go on to win Game of the Year at multiple awards shows.</p>



<p>2025 was a massive year for independent studios and their games, so dwindling our top choices down to five was no easy task. That said, the following five games should be on your must-play list.</p>



<p><em>Other Best Games of 2025 per Category: <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-action-games-of-2025-a-relentless-year/">Action</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-role-playing-games-of-2025-another-incredible-year/">Role-Playing Games</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftech-best-sports-and-racing-games-2025/">Sports &amp; Racing</a></strong></em></p>



<h2 id="h-clair-obscur-expedition-33-9-5-10">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/">9.5/10</a>)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Clair-Obscur-Expedition-33.png"></a><figcaption><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 key art. Image credit: Sandfall Interactive</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>We might as well start with the big one. Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 was the game that caught everyone by surprise this year, and for good reason. It's perhaps not doing anything incredibly new or innovative when it comes to the wider RPG and JRPG genres, but it undeniably does what it does extremely well.</p>



<p>The cast, writing, storytelling, animation, art design, score, gameplay - everything about Clair Obscur is polished to an incredible shine, and if you could only play one video game from 2025, it's the easy pick for what you should play.</p>



<p>As Wccftech's Francesco De Meo wrote in his review, "<em>Before launch, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 looked like a solid yet safe role-playing game, but Sandfall Interactive’s debut shattered expectations in the best possible way. With a gripping story, a beautifully written cast of characters, and engaging gameplay that breathes new life into familiar mechanics, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is a journey that leaves a lasting mark on both the mind and the heart.</em>"</p>



<h2 id="h-hades-ii-10-10">Hades II (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hades-2-supergiant-guide-us/">10/10</a>)</h2>

<p>Now on to the other 'big one' of the year. In a year that doesn't have Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 in it, Hades II would be the other 'easy choice' for what to play if you could only play one game this year. The action and soundtrack push everything to new heights, which I would've told you was an impossible feat before playing it, based on how incredible the first game is.</p>



<p>And that's what ultimately makes Hades II so incredible. It's able to evolve on what was already one of the best games to release in the last decade, with deeper mechanics that drive its build-crafting and give you more to do in-between runs.</p>



<p>It also wonderfully plays into its new protagonist, Melinoë, and her magical sensibilities. Like its predecessor, it's a stunning example of how to weave narrative and gameplay together, and it goes beyond what it means to be a great game to being a truly excellent game.</p>



<p>As I wrote in my review, "<em>Hades 2 is a stunning follow-up to an already incredible game. It does everything its predecessor did right, and then expands on it in meaningful ways that add depth to the gameplay, narrative, and visual experience (which was already deep in the original Hades). It's a shining example of how a sequel can take everything right about what came before, turn it all up to 11, and even go a bit further.</em>"</p>



<h2 id="h-eternal-strands-8-5-10">Eternal Strands (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/eternal-strands-the-world-is-your-playground/">8.5/10</a>)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Eternal-Strands.png"></a><figcaption><em>Eternal Strands. Image credit: Yellow Brick Games</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Yellow Brick Games was <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-mike-laidlaw-new-studio-yellow-brick-games/">founded in 2020</a> by BioWare's former franchise director for Dragon Age, Mike Laidlaw. Laidlaw gathered a whole host of Canadian talent and based the studio in Quebec City, with the studio's goal being to create "wondrous journeys" for players to experience. Five years later, Eternal Strands is the first journey the studio is asking players to join them on, and you'd be hard-pressed to say the team did not hit its goal of creating a "<em>wondrous journey</em>."</p>



<p>From <a href="https://wccftech.com/eternal-strands-gamescom-hands-on-preview-magical-mayhem/">early previews months ahead of its release</a>, and from <a href="https://wccftech.com/eternal-strands-qa-game-length-confirmed-between-25-and-35-hours/">speaking with the studio</a>, it was clear Yellow Brick Games had something on their hands with an extremely colourful and engaging mixture of game mechanics that sometimes made the game feel like a greatest hits of mechanics players loved from games within the last decade. </p>



<p>Thankfully, that wasn't to its detriment, and while it's not a perfect package, it's an impressive feat for a debut project from a new team, and easily one of the more impressive indie titles this year. As Wccftech's Francesco De Meo wrote in his review, "<em>Despite pulling features and mechanics from a variety of different series, Eternal Strands manages to feel like a cohesive experience that really shines once players get the hang of its advanced physics and combat system. However, the average story and the game's repetitive latter half hold it back from being truly fantastic, making it a solid action-adventure that's just a few steps away from greatness.</em>"</p>



<h2 id="h-hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Xbox-Game-Pass-September-2025-2.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Hollow Knight Silksong key art. Image credit: Team Cherry</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Just like how it would be impossible to talk about 2025's indie games and not mention Clair Obscur, it's also nearly impossible not to talk about Hollow Knight: Silksong. The long-awaited DLC-turned-full-sequel <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-dlc-team-cherry/">over the course of its seven-year development</a>, when Team Cherry was finally ready for the spotlight, the rest of the industry cleared the stage.</p>



<p>Literally and figuratively, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-delays-indie-games/">indie games were getting out of Silksong's way</a>, delaying their own release so as not to be swallowed up by the fact that Silksong would go on to <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-shatters-original-steam-user-record-within-minutes/">break concurrent player records for its predecessor</a> and freeze up every digital storefront you could play it on. It passed <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-5-million-audience-overlaps-soulslike/">5 million players as fast as Team Cherry could snap its fingers</a>, and all because it really does live up to the expectations.</p>



<p>Silksong is yet another wonderfully crafted action-platformer that will continue to find ways to excite and surprise you for as long as you play it. Whether you're 10 hours in or 60 hours in, there's a good chance there's something around a corner that you've not seen yet. It's a stunning achievement in practically every facet of its game design, and is undoubtedly one of the year's best indies, and even one of the year's best games hands-down.</p>



<h2 id="h-routine-8-5-10">ROUTINE (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/routine-review-lunar-software-raw-fury/">8.5/10</a>)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ROUTINE_KeyArt_16x9_3840x2160-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>ROUTINE key art. Image credit: Lunar Software</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The second game on this list that returned after years away from the limelight, ROUTINE's story is a bit different from Silksong's. Instead of being able to coast on the financial success of their debut release and take as much time as they wanted, Lunar Software was busy trying to get its debut release out the door while keeping a roof over its head. ROUTINE's gap between announcement and release spanned over a decade, as the small team at Lunar Software had to pause development for several years <a href="https://wccftech.com/routine-comes-back-from-a-ten-year-slumber-with-a-new-trailer/">before returning to the project after finding a publisher in Raw Fury</a>.</p>



<p>I can't tell you if it was worth the wait. Not only is that something you'll have to decide for yourself, but I was not one of the die-hard fans who had been waiting for ROUTINE since 2012. What I can tell you, however, is that ROUTINE is easily one of the year's best indie accomplishments, and one of 2025's top horror experiences. It's dripping with atmosphere and a tension that never really lets you breathe, and is probably one of the best sci-fi horror games since Alien: Isolation.</p>



<p>As I wrote in my review, "<em>ROUTINE is an excellent puzzle-focused first-person horror game that, despite its slow pacing, is able to keep you at the edge of your seat for 10 hours straight, with a tense, rich atmosphere created by wonderful execution of its retro futuristic aesthetic and stunning soundscape that immerses you in its world and gets you listening for the sound of a pin drop to avoid getting caught. Its narrative may be unable to shine through, but at the end of the day it is altogether an interesting game, a game worth playing again, and the game that Alien: Isolation fans should play while we all wait for Alien: Isolation 2.</em>"</p>






<h2 id="h-honorable-mentions">Honorable Mentions</h2>



<p>There were so many incredible indie games in 2025, and we can only choose five to make the cut for our main highlights. That said, this list of honorable mentions is as long as it is because we wanted to ensure you walked away knowing that the following indies are more than worth your time, should you check them out.</p>



<p>One small note, the list begins with Sunset Visitor's debut title, 1000xResist, which came out last year and appeared in our honorable mentions for indie games in 2024. But with its ports to PS5/Xbox Series and our review of it coming this year, it felt appropriate to include it again, even if it technically didn't qualify for the main five.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/dreamcast-web-browsing-is-dead-over-25-years-later-thanks-to-google-2000655137</link>
            <guid>1390222</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Surely Google could afford to let Dreamcast users keep checking the weather on their 27-year-old consoles? Why are games still launching without difficulty settings, only to add them in later when enough people don’t play at launch? And what new sex jokes will<em> Fortnite</em> stumble into in 2026? It’s the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of smaller gaming news and culture.</p> <p>We are officially in the end-of-year holiday stretch and I can’t decide which of the 10 games I started and didn’t finish this year to go back to during the winter break lull. I just keep picking up new games instead. I just started <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-11-21/-kingdoms-of-the-dump-is-a-charming-role-playing-game-made-by-two-janitors"><em>Kingdoms of the Dump</em></a> and it’s proving to be a lovely-looking comfort food old-school JRPG. What have you picked up so far during the winter 2025 Steam sale?</p> <h2>RIP PlanetWeb</h2> <p>Dreamcast players can no longer browse the World Wide Web. Its groundbreaking PlanetWeb browser capability has been killed by Google decades after it launched, according to <em><a href="https://x.com/dclivenet/status/2000321889970078120">Dreamcast Live</a></em>. “Sad news guys. After over 25 years of support, Google has finally discontinued support for Dreamcast web browsers,” the account posted over the weekend.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000655158" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000655158"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000655158">Amazon</figcaption></figure> <p>It shared a screenshot of an error telling the user to update their browser “to a recent version.” “<span>And for your information </span>Google<span>, I am on the latest web browser! PlanetWeb 3.0, yo!” <em>Dreamcast Live </em>replied. Sega was at the forefront of bringing the internet to game consoles, beginning in 1990 with Sega Meganet for the Genesis and continuing through to the launch of the Dreamcast in 1998 and the eventual release of <em>Phantasy Star Online</em>.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2><em>Chronos: The New Dawn</em> is getting an easier mode</h2> <p>The immersive survival horror action game <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2BVRu26Fug">has a new update</a> coming in early 2026. It’ll add Temporal Diver Mode, an easier difficulty option that will hopefully let more people experience one of this year’s bigger releases that didn’t get a ton of attention at launch (it launched a day after <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>).</p> <h2><em>Fortnite</em> accidentally gets too horny again</h2> <p>A new accolades trailer for <em>Fortnite</em> Chapter 7 seemed harmless enough. It included censored posts from random internet users saying things like “Fuck the Dark Voyager” and “Like a fucking fever dream.” But as <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/fortnite-chapter-7-trailer-deleted/"><em>TheGamer</em> points out</a>, the issue was with what the trailer didn’t censor: the user name of someone who goes by Jonesy Frotting. Frotting is slang for a particular type of <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=frotting">dick-on-dick foreplay</a>.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">FORTNITE DELETED THE AD 💀 <a href="https://t.co/l7PchA10kO">pic.twitter.com/l7PchA10kO</a></p> <p>— HYPEX (@HYPEX) <a href="https://twitter.com/HYPEX/status/2002833641656013040?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 21, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>I guess it ended up being too risqué for Epic once people pointed it out. The trailer has since been removed from YouTube. This isn’t the first time this year that<em> Fortnite</em> had to backtrack on sexual innuendo. It posted and deleted the phrase “mother of rose toys” when Doja Cat had ostensibly taken over the<em> Fortnite</em> social accounts <a href="https://kotaku.com/doja-cat-fortnite-sex-toy-deleted-skin-halloween-2025-2000633338">back in October</a>.</p> <h2>Limited Run Games has reached a $2.7 million settlement over data surveillance</h2> <p>The money will go to customers whose data the boutique physical game publisher <a href="https://www.limitedrungamessettlement.com/">allegedly mishandled</a>. At issue is whether Limited Run Games “disclosed its subscribers’ personally identifiable information (“PII”) to Meta Platforms, Inc. and/or other third parties, without consent and in violation of the Video Privacy Protection Act (“VPPA”).” The company admits no wrong-doing but a fraction of the money will be paid out to everyone who submits a claim.</p> <h2><em>Patapon 1+2 Replay</em> just got a free new mode</h2> <p>The rhythm games have <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlGp0s25Pm8">a boss rush now</a>. It’s actually probably the ideal way for fans to re-experience the game. It’s currently $10 off on PSN and Steam.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-dev-explains-why-its-ditching-game-key-cards-thanks-to-nintendo-2000654878">A developer accidentally lets slip that Nintendo might have a new solution for game key cards</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/modretro-anduril-chromatic-attack-drone-metal-luckey-2000654868">Palmer Luckey’s new Game Boy sucks</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/best-christmas-songs-ever-top-15-santa-2000654678"><em>Kotaku</em>‘s definitive list of the best Christmas songs</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Amazon Echo Dot Max is the latest addition to Amazon’s line of Alexa-enabled smart home hubs. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6550/">Currently, you can snag it for 20% off in a limited-time deal. Originally priced at $100, you can now grab it for just $80, saving you $20.</a></p>
<p>This does all of what we’ve come to expect with an Amazon smart speaker. Despite its small size, the Echo Dot Max delivers impressive sound quality, providing rich bass and clear audio. It features a front-facing speaker that produces high-quality sound, capable of filling a room with music, podcasts, or audiobooks. You’ll enjoy crisp, clear vocals, making it perfect for listening to your favorite tunes or catching up on your latest audiobook. The Echo Dot Max provides three times the bass versus 2022-release Echo Dot.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6550/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Introducing Alexa+</h2>
<p>The real addition that comes with the new Echo Dot Max is its support for Alexa+. All of the tech companies now have their own proprietary AI assistants like Google’s Gemini to Anthropic’s Claude. It only makes sense that Amazon would bump up the Alexa branding to cover its LLM too. Alexa+ is designed to provide a more natural and conversational Alexa, way more capable than the Alexa we’ve all come to know since Amazon launched it more than a decade ago.</p>
<p>If you get yourself this new Echo Dot Max, you’ll get early access to Alexa+.</p>
<p>The Echo Dot Max supports lossless HD audio from services like Amazon Music HD, ensuring an enhanced listening experience. In addition to Amazon Music, it also works with a variety of streaming platforms such as Apple Music, Spotify, and SiriusXM, offering you plenty of options for your entertainment needs. You can adjust the volume with the physical controls on top or, for hands-free convenience, simply ask Alexa to set the audio to your preferred level.</p>



<p>As a smart home hub, the Echo Dot Max allows you to control a range of smart devices in your home. Whether it’s adjusting the brightness or changing the color of your smart lightbulbs, or managing your smart TV with built-in streaming apps, the Echo Dot Max serves as the central control point for all these connected devices. You can use voice commands like “Alexa, play the latest episode of Pluribus” or “Alexa, dim the lights” for effortless control of your home.</p>
<p>The Echo Dot is available in three stylish colors: graphite, glacier white, and amethyst. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6550/">With the current 20% discount, you can grab it for just $80, down from its original price of $100.</a></p>

                <p>Sucker Punch Productions co-founder Brian Fleming is leaving the gaming studio after working there since it opened 28 years ago in 1997. What's he doing next? Fleming says he does not know.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7406746502825660416/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">post on LinkedIn</a>, Fleming said, "I really don't know what's next."</p><p>He's staying with Sucker Punch through April 2026 to help with the transition efforts, and after that he said he plans to travel. He's also going to spend the time trying to "sort out which opportunities" he wants to pursue next.

Nate Fox will continue his role as co-creative director. Fleming said he's leaving Sucker Punch "in the capable hands of the strongest leadership team we've ever had."</p><p>"They are all so capable and so READY for new challenges that I have nothing but confidence the studio will continue to flourish," he explained.</p><p>After releasing the N64 game Rocket: Robot on Wheels in 1999, Sucker Punch's first big hit was 2002's Sly Cooper, which became a franchise that spawned multiple sequels. In 2009, the studio released Infamous, which would also become a success.

            <p>Time-travelling psychological horror game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cronos-the-new-dawn">Cronos: The New Dawn</a> is finally getting an additional, easier difficulty mode for people who want less of a gameplay challenge.</p>
<p>Temporal Driver, as the mode will be called, will arrive in early 2026, and it will double player health while halving enemy health. And that's it; otherwise, the experience of the game will remain intact.</p>

<p>Polish developer Bloober released Cronos back in September and it reviewed well. Our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cronos-the-new-dawn-review">Kelsey gave the game four stars in their Cronos: The New Dawn review</a>, calling it "<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/bloober-team">Bloober Team</a>'s best original game yet". "An immersive romp through a suffocating portrayal of 80s Poland, where your journey is far from what it first seems."</p>
<p>There's currently a Cronos demo available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2101960/Cronos_The_New_Dawn/">Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/cronos-the-new-dawn-85b409">Epic</a>, too, if you fancy giving it a go.</p>
