			<p>Options are never a bad thing. Over the years, different peripheral manufacturers have made sure that console makers can never rest on their laurels, often besting and improving on the official controller designs by adding extra features or updating the technology within them. The new wireless Turtle Beach Rematch controller focuses more on providing a similar experience to the Switch Pro Controller, while cutting into Nintendo’s fairly steep asking price. In this case, however, it’s not a steep enough price cut for the reduction in quality.</p>
<p><iframe title="Turtle Beach® Rematch Wireless" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7gqWyLu0VDU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>I’ve loved many of Turtle Beach’s most recent controllers, from the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/04/turtle-beach-stealth-ultra-pro-controller-review/">Stealth Ultra Pro</a> to the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/10/turtle-beach-stealth-pivot-controller-review/">Stealth Pivot</a>. They’re doing things differently and bringing new features to bear that have a real-world use case. The Rematch slightly glows in the dark. Fundamentally, its looks are its best feature, with its green and purple Mario-toting livery very pleasing to the eye, and certainly bright enough to stand out next to all those bland black and grey controllers you’ll find elsewhere. The glow-in-the-dark effect isn’t really bright enough to warrant its inclusion, and it’s not applied to the buttons, which are, surely, the most important thing you’d want to glance at in the dark.</p>


<p>The top shell is made from a great-feeling soft-touch plastic, to lift the experience somewhat, but the lightly-textured purple underside doesn’t carry that through, and you get two, very different, sensations when you’re holding the controller in your hands.</p>


<p>Designed with the original Switch in mind, the Rematch works with both of Nintendo’s consoles, though it lacks the Switch 2’s C button for opening up GameChat. That’s not the biggest problem when it’s accessible via the central menu, but it’s odd to release it at the same time as the Switch 2 without the new console’s full functionality. For all that it feels like an omission, that’s balanced out by an impressive 40 hours of battery life, which makes the Rematch a very easy controller to live with.</p>
<p>The most immediately gratifying aspect of the Rematch are its well-tuned analogue sticks. They feel great in use, with a nice level of tautness, and a quick return to centre. Now, that’s balanced with the disappointing fact that these are not Hall Effect or TMR type sticks, meaning they’re using the old style of stick tech that has a far higher chance of wearing out. When other manufacturers, Gamesir in particular, are putting out similarly priced hardware, with improved analogue sticks, it feels like Turtle Beach are a step behind with the Rematch.</p>
<p>As the Rematch is targeted as an entry-level pro-styled device, it’s little surprise to find the inclusion of two additional grip inputs, the flared, decently-sized buttons sitting easily beneath your middle fingers, and activating reassuringly with a press or even just a squeeze of the grip. They feel great in use, and are a real boon to players looking for an edge in competitive games.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the rest of the inputs don’t feel as good. The main face buttons are overly firm, and feel a fraction too high, making them feel slower in use. The digital triggers maintain some of that firmness, but they also make a slightly loose clacking sound that lends a sense of cheapness each time you use them. The shoulder buttons, at least, are fine, and benefit from activation across their entire length, but no interaction with the Rematch makes it feel as if this is a £50 controller.</p>
<p>There’s a lot of alternatives out there. If you own a Switch 2, the official <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/16/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-review/">Switch Pro Controller 2</a> is an easy choice, and while it’s more expensive, the overall build, the inclusion of a 3.5mm headphone socket, and the console-level customisation for the grip inputs, are streets ahead of what the Rematch offers. As mentioned before, Gamesir is the current champion of this category, and both the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/28/gamesir-cyclone-2-controller-review/">Cyclone 2</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/05/gamesir-super-nova-controller-review/">Super Nova</a> are fantastic. They’re fully featured pro controllers, with Hall Effect Sticks, better-feeling inputs, and a charging stand, and they come in at more or less the same price as the Rematch. The only downside is the need for an additional dongle that the Rematch doesn’t need.</p>

			<p>Just like every year around Gamescom, Berlin-based developer Elysium Game Studio has released a fresh trailer for their upcoming debut title, NEO BERLIN 2087.</p>



<p>The story of NEO BERLIN 2087, a first and third-person action roleplaying game, begins on a dark and ominous night in the German capital, which has been plunged into chaos following the brutal assassination of the police chief. The protagonist is Nolan (voiced by Elias Toufexis, the same actor behind Deus Ex's Adam Jensen), a detective with a troubled past who is given the daunting task of finding and protecting the police chief's daughter. She may hold the key to solving her father's murder. With state-of-the-art technology and weapons at his disposal, Nolan begins a perilous journey to find Natalie as quickly as possible.</p>



<p>Eventually, with each new step, he grows closer to a sinister conspiracy that endangers him and the entire city. When Nolan finally meets the fiercely independent and resourceful Natalie, it becomes clear how their fates are intertwined in ways he could never have imagined. Their connection is a volatile mix of love, fear, and uncertainty. As they navigate the treacherous path ahead, they must confront their deepest fears and the shadowy forces threatening to tear them apart.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>According to Elysium Game Studio, the gameplay lets players customize Nolan's abilities and weapons to suit their preferred play style. They will be able to choose from a wide array of shooter, stealth, and RPG mechanics. NEO BERLIN 2087 is inspired by classic cyberpunk movies (Blade Runner, Ghost in the Shell), albeit with a different city at its heart. Berlin in the year 2087 has become a cyberpunk metropolis shielded by massive walls from its devastated surroundings. There, outcasts gather, and malfunctioning machines roam the land. In the game, players will also explore the surrounding wasteland, which is full of dangerous enemies. They'll also get to test their reflexes in exciting combat sequences or, if they prefer, they may avoid confrontation entirely by adopting a stealthier approach.</p>



<p>NEO BERLIN 2087, which is powered by Unreal Engine technology, still doesn't have a release window. However, we know it will be available for PC (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2326200/NEO_BERLIN_2087/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a>, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/neo-berlin-2087-500f0d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Epic Games Store</a>), <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10008070" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation 5</a>, and Xbox Series S|X. You can already add it to your favorite platform's wishlists.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>FromSoftware is the undisputed master of Souls games, but they’re not the only company that makes stellar Soulslike experiences. Here are 5 Soulslike games not made by FromSoftware you should be playing in 2025.</p>



<p>Demon’s Souls and its spiritual successor, Dark Souls, started a revolution in gaming, which eventually turned into its own genre: the Soulslike game. But over time, this term has come to refer to games that were not made by FromSoftware but borrowed heavily from them.</p>



<p>Some of these games are only imitators, but others move the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/things-soulslike-games-must-stop-doing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Soulslike</a> needle in new and creative ways, going on to become as celebrated as FromSoftware’s own games. Below, we’ll reveal the 5 best Soulslike games you can play in 2025 that were not developed by Hidetaka Miyazaki or the team at FromSoftware. </p>



<h2 id="h-stellar-blade">Stellar Blade</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Eve is an android sent to save Earth from vicious alien invaders. Image credit: Shift Up</figcaption></figure>



<p>There will be some that dispute Stellar Blade’s status as a Soulslike, but in terms of its overall gameplay loops, it absolutely is one. However, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stellar-blade-devs-are-considering-a-switch-2-port-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stellar Blade</a> doesn’t conform to all of the conventions of the genre and strays from them at times, sometimes feeling more like Nier Automata or Bayonetta— and this is why it’s excellent.</p>



<p>Stellar Blade is a great entry point for those who want to try Soulslike games, and even features some very challenging boss fights that would even make Malenia from Elden Ring blush. Rather than imitating Dark Souls, Stellar Blade simply takes inspiration from it and other action-adventure games, says a respectful “Thank you”, then blazes its own trail. </p>



<h2 id="h-lies-of-p">Lies of P</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Lies of P: Overture features new combat styles and bosses. Image credit: NEOWIZ</figcaption></figure>



<p>Lies of P is a dark retelling of the story of Pinocchio, but this time, the puppet who wants to be a “real boy” needs to defend his creators against a robot uprising, all while weighing up the cost of honesty and deceit. It really shouldn’t work, but it does, and despite the game releasing in 2023, it’s still one of the best Soulslike games that wasn’t developed by FromSoftware. </p>



<p>While Lies of P was a highly original game, its gothic setting is eerily reminiscent of Bloodborne, a game that FromSoft fans are desperate to receive a remaster or sequel. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lies-of-p-headlines-augusts-free-playstation-plus-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lies of P</a> scratches that itch and manages to be an excellent game in its own right. Its first major expansion is also coming in summer 2025, making the game relevant all over again. </p>



<h2 id="h-the-lords-of-the-fallen-2023">The Lords of The Fallen (2023)</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Lords of the Fallen is a worthy successor to Dark Souls. Image credit: Hexworks </figcaption></figure>



<p>The Lords of the Fallen is actually a sequel to another title called Lords of the Fallen that came out in 2014, and what makes this game so good is that this is truly one for the Dark Souls purists. Never mind Sekiro, Bloodborne, or Elden Ring, The Lords of the Fallen is a love letter to where the Soulslikes genre began.</p>



<p>The game pays tribute to Dark Souls by existing in a similar grimdark world where nearly everything wants to kill you, and is quite capable of it. Those who love Demon’s Souls and Dark Souls will feel immediately at home. But that’s not all, the game also allows players to move between the world of the living and the world of the dead, adding a mechanic that feels similar to old-school Soul Reaver games. </p>



<p>Some would call <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lords-of-the-fallen-friend-pass-crossplay/">The Lords of the Fallen</a> derivative, but what it’s really doing is providing Soulslike veterans with the thing we’ve been craving, something that can serve as a Dark Souls 4 surrogate. </p>



<h2 id="h-the-first-berserker-khazan">The First Berserker: Khazan</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The First Berserker is one of the best Soulslikes not made by FromSoftware. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Like Stellar Blade, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-bosses-in-the-first-berserker-khazan-how-many-bosses-are-there/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The First Berserker: Khazan</a> is unmistakably a Soulslike game, but it also does its own thing and represents evolution rather than stagnation. Even on its normal difficulty, Khazan is a tough but rewarding adventure, but it also offers an easy mode for those who just want to enjoy the story, but test their mettle after mastering its mechanics, which is fair enough. </p>



<p>The First Berserker: Khazan isn’t trying to hide the fact that it’s inspired by games like Bloodborne and Dark Souls, but it’s also not afraid to lean into more arcade-style action like Ninja Gaiden. Its theme of Norse mythology also helps it to stand out in the increasingly crowded space, and in 2025, it’s easily one of the best Soulslike adventures that wasn’t designed by FromSoftware. </p>







<h2 id="h-wuchang-fallen-feathers">Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Wuchang is the best Soulslike of 2025, so far. Image credit: Leenzee</figcaption></figure>



<p>In a post-Elden Ring world, Soulslikes that use the old interconnected world system feel slightly antiquated, but that hasn’t stopped Wuchang: Fallen Feathers from being the best Soulslike of 2025 (as of August at least). Set in ancient China, Wuchang wakes up suffering from a dark malady that is slowly killing her, and with no memory of how she caught it. Desperate for answers, she picks up her blade and starts slashing monsters until a solution can be found.</p>



<p>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers has more in common with games like Nioh, Wo-Long, and Black Myth: Wukong than Dark Souls, but the FromSoftware DNA is there. The game is probably the most difficult on this entire list, and even seasoned Tarnished warriors will find the game a serious challenge. While <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-longsword-build-wuchang-fallen-feathers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wuchang</a> doesn’t have an invasion mechanic, if you die while touched by “Madness”, your own ghost will remain after death and then relentlessly hunt you down to kill you again.</p>



<p>Now that’s the sort of violent delight Soulslike fans appreciate. </p>

He confirmed that could mean additional divestments are in the offing. Will we also see layoffs? Who knows, but Embracer has been rather trigger happy in that regard previously. Rogers also explained that Embracer is keen to use AI technology to streamline its processes and support its teams.

It's a deeply harmful practice that can stall careers and create uncertainty as to who is actually making the games we play, but what is the solution?

The South Korean publisher once again insisted that all three downed tools as soon as it purchased Unknown Worlds and placed their own "monetary interests" over those of the development team and Subnautica 2 itself.

Union workers at Arkane, known for producing titles like Dishonored and Deathloop, accused Microsoft of being an "accomplice" to genocide. "Microsoft has failed both its teams &amp; its customers by being actively complicit of the invasion and war crimes happening in Gaza," they wrote in the open letter.

This week, however, the company posted a series of photographs on X to reveal it has been training employees how to use the mystery engine.

			<p>Vancouver-based game developer Blackbird Interactive has <a href="https://x.com/BBIgames/status/1956060573453705411" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that it has acquired the rights to the Hardspace: Shipbreaker IP from Focus Entertainment, which published the original game in 2022. Hardspace: Shipbreaker was well-received at launch; it <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hardspace-shipbreaker-its-a-hardspace-life-for-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">earned a 9/10 score here on Wccftech</a> from reviewer Rosh Kelly:</p>



<p><em>If you’re after a game to recover from the burnout and exhaustion of daily life in the 21st century, Hardspace offers a game that lets you lose yourself in satisfying, procedurally generated puzzles that are the ships that appear in your dock each and every ship. Whether you just want to listen to some ambient country music that calls into mind Firefly and other less problematic science fiction frontier stories, rip apart unique and detailed ships, or want to feel what it’s like to fight a massive company, win or lose, Hardspace: Shipbreaker is a fantastic game worthy of the fifteen hours or so it takes to complete.</em></p>



<p>Clearly, Blackbird Interactive feels there's much potential to expand the IP. Indeed, they have already announced that multiple games in the Hardspace: Shipbreaker franchise are in development.</p>



<p>At the same time, they have also unveiled the so-called LYNX Pioneer Program. Pre-registration <a href="https://blackbirdinteractive.com/lynxpioneerprogram/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is open on the official website</a> for users who would like to get:</p>



<ul>
<li>Exclusive early playtests of future Hardspace (and other BBI original IP) projects</li>



<li>Behind-the-scenes development updates and access</li>

<p>Blackbird Interactive, a studio founded by former Relic Entertainment developers, has historically focused on strategy games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/deserts-of-kharak-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak</a>, Crossfire: Legion, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/homeworld-3-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Homeworld 3</a>. However, it has found success with an unusual action/adventure simulation game. Still, one of these Hardspace projects could very well be a strategy game take on the IP, which would be interesting to see at some point.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Roblox is facing an insurmountable wave of controversy at present, with child safety activist groups and ‘predator hunter’ organizations pummelling the game for not adequately protecting young players. The situation hit a new all-time high recently when the Roblox Corporation’s lawyers harangued Schlep, a creator who has directly influenced the arrest of several predators preying on Roblox players.</p>



<p>The Roblox ‘child safety’ scenario unfolded further in recent hours, with a claim surfacing that Chris ‘Have a Seat’ Hansen, the iconic face of To Catch a Predator, is planning a documentary to shed light on Roblox’s nefarious side.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-chris-hansen-making-a-roblox-documentary">Is Chris Hansen Making a Roblox Documentary?</h2>



<p>On social media, claims emerged from several prominent channels that Chris Hansen, the host of To Catch a Predator for <strong>many years</strong>, is preparing to create a documentary hand-in-hand with Schlep, the creator who was recently pursued by Roblox’s legal team.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Anything tied to Schlep is being destroyed by the Roblox Corporation as we speak, with players receiving bans just for having <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-legal-notice-banned-predator-hunter-freeschlep/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#FreeSchlep</a> written in their username or anywhere else on their profile. This trend comes despite users pointing out that nefarious and harmful games are still sitting in the Roblox library, despite countless reports from concerned users.</p>



<p>It’s a question of priorities.</p>



<p>The situation is skyrocketing as we speak. In recent days, it was revealed that Louisiana’s Attorney General <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/08/15/us/louisiana-roblox-lawsuit-child-protection-hnk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">had filed a lawsuit</a> against Roblox for allowing sexual predators to ‘thrive, unite, hunt, and victimize kids’ on the platform.</p>



<p>Congressman Ro Khanna of California has also taken action, <a href="https://act.rokhanna.com/a/save-roblox-petition" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">starting a petition</a> to demand that the Roblox Corporation do ‘more to protect children, provide more support to parents, and strengthen law enforcement protocols.’</p>



<p>It’s hard to tell what will happen next in this ongoing debacle, but the team at Roblox isn’t helping things. Just days ago, it was claimed that Roblox might one day become the home <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-dating-someday-for-those-afraid/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">of a legitimate dating platform</a>.</p>



<p>It’s hard to believe how some of this is unfolding.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Game Science has teased Black Myth: Wukong’s attendance during the Opening Night Live showcase at Gamescom. Fans saw this reveal and instantly jumped to the assumption that Black Myth: Wukong DLC is inbound and about to be revealed. The time is right, and the game drops on Xbox just one day after the Opening Night Live show.</p>



<p>It has been almost a year to the day since Black Myth: Wukong was released, and fans are <strong>hungry </strong>for more content.</p>



<h2 id="h-black-myth-wukong-at-gamescom">Black Myth: Wukong at Gamescom</h2>



<p>In a post on social media, the Game Science team behind 2024’s Black Myth: Wukong teased a reveal:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Destined Ones, GameScience will be joining this year’s Gamescom Opening Night Live. The show kicks off at 8:00 p.m. (CEST) on August 19, and we look forward to seeing you there.<a href="https://x.com/BlackMythGame/status/1956174001128268031/photo/1"></a></p>
</blockquote>



<p>The core belief within the community is that a grand expansion is incoming for the game that turned heads in August 2024 when it proved to be one of the most successful additions to an already dense lineup of Soulslike games.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The post went hand-in-hand with a charming image showing fearsome monsters, calligraphy, and some ethereal elements. In the comments under the post, a user translated the visible script:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The extraordinary is ordinary in this world; ‘gods and devils’ often wear respectable attire.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Strangely, there’s a date on the image of August 20, 2025, the <strong>day after </strong>the Opening Night Live reveal will be shown. This has fans believing that a shadowdrop of sorts will take place, with Game Science revealing that Black Myth: Wukong DLC will be available almost instantly after the show.</p>



<p>Are you hoping for DLC for Black Myth: Wukong, or are you more curious about the potential for a sequel? Let me know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/all-dying-light-the-beast-pre-order-bonuses-explained%E2%80%94hero-of-harran-bundle-rewards.1270806/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Dying Light: The Beast is officially my most highly anticipated game of 2025. I can’t wait for it to be released in September, and you can bet your last dollar I’ll be picking up the Deluxe Edition. With that being said, I thought I’d take some time to explain all the Dying Light: The Beast pre-order bonuses and rewards, as there are a few that you can unlock.</p>



<p>Let’s take a deep dive into Dying Light: The Beast and learn about the Hero of Harran bundle and all the digital content and cosmetics you get for pre-ordering Dying Light: The Beast</p>



<h2 id="h-every-dying-light-the-beast-pre-order-bonus">Every Dying Light: The Beast Pre-Order Bonus</h2>



<p><strong>Dying Light: The Beast pre-order bonuses include the Hero of Harran bundle, which comes with an exclusive Ultimate Survivor outfit, crossbow, and vehicle skin.</strong></p>



<p>The Hero of Harran bundle shouldn’t be missed, and fans of the franchise would be remiss to skip over the content, even if it’s ‘only’ in-game cosmetics.</p>



<p>Here’s everything included in the Hero of Harran bundle:</p>



<ul>
<li>Ultimate Survivor outfit</li>



<li>Harran combat knife</li>



<li>In Jade’s Memory pistol</li>



<li>The Follower crossbow</li>



<li>Castor Woods Patrol vehicle</li>
</ul>



<p>All pre-orders for Dying Light: The Beast will earn the Hero of Harran bundle free of charge.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-in-the-deluxe-edition-of-dying-light-the-beast">What’s in the Deluxe Edition of Dying Light: The Beast</h2>



<p>While every pre-order of Dying Light: The Beast secures the Hero of Harran bundle, buying the Deluxe Edition grants you so much more. As this is a digital-first release, everything is in-game or available separately on a digital basis, but that doesn’t take away from the quality of what you’re getting.</p>



<p>Here’s everything included in Dying Light: The Beast Deluxe Edition:</p>



<ul>
<li>Official soundtrack</li>



<li>Wallpaper pack</li>



<li>Castor Woods tourist map (digital)</li>



<li>Castor Woods prepper bundle:
<ul>
<li>Roadhog vehicle</li>



<li>Castor Woods prepper outfit</li>



<li>Survivalist SMG</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Base game</li>
</ul>



<p>The Deluxe Edition is just $10 more expensive than the standard version of Dying Light: The Beast, so it’s a bargain and a very easy buy for fans of the decade-old franchise.</p>



<p>What version of Dying Light: The Beast will you be buying? Let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Dying Light: The Beast is one of the most highly anticipated titles of 2025, and it’s set to be released <strong>very soon</strong>. This open-world, zombie-slaying epic has been dubbed ‘Dying Light 3’ by Techland, and in many ways, this major title kickstarts the next generation of the series. In this guide, learn everything about the Dying Light: The Beast release date and platforms.</p>



<p>I’m hugely excited for Dying Light: The Beast, which marks an evolution from 2022’s Dying Light 2: Stay Human in many ways. I’ve been a fan of the franchise since 2015’s Dying Light turned heads, and Techland has worked hard to make the series a shining gem of the zombie apocalypse niche ever since.</p>



<p>Read on to find out when Dying Light: The Beast is coming out and how much it’ll cost when it does.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-dying-light-the-beast-coming-out">When is Dying Light: The Beast Coming Out?</h2>



<p><strong>Dying Light: The Beast will be released on September 19 on <strong>PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</strong></strong></p>



<p>The game was originally intended to be released on August 22, but <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dying-light-the-beast-delayed/">a delay was needed</a> for Techland to fully polish the game and make it the best zombie-slashing adventure possible.</p>



<p>Dying Light: The Beast started life as an expansion to Dying Light 2: Stay Human, but Techland realized it was too big for that and needed to flex as a standalone title. For this game, Roger Craig Smith (the original game’s lead voice actor) returned to play the role of Kyle Crane, a fan-favorite protagonist.</p>



<p>The Beast will now be a full-fledged game with all-new mechanics, upgraded visuals and effects, and an original story that brings to life the future of Dying Light.</p>



<h3 id="h-dying-light-the-beast-pricing-structure">Dying Light: The Beast Pricing Structure</h3>



<p>As Dying Light: The Beast has plenty of meat on the bones, it’s coming out with a premium price tag:</p>



<p><strong>Standard Edition </strong>– $59.99 / £59.99</p>



<p><strong>Deluxe Edition </strong>– $69.99 / £69.99</p>



<h2 id="h-is-there-early-access-for-dying-light-the-beast">Is There Early Access for Dying Light: The Beast?</h2>



<p><strong>There is no way to access Dying Light: The Beast earlier than the global launch</strong>.</p>



<p>Techland has arranged a neat Deluxe Edition for Dying Light: The Beast, but the bonus content you get includes digital collectibles and in-game cosmetics; there is no way to get early access to The Beast.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/every-xbox-game-confirmed-gamescom-schedule/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/every-xbox-game-confirmed-for-gamescom%E2%80%94full-stream-schedule-explained.1270797/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Gamescom is almost here, and Xbox has published an extensive list of games that will be revealed or expanded on during the Xbox at Gamescom broadcast slate. This is made up of two streams that will take place between August 20 and August 21, with the team broadcasting a stack of trailers, panels, and reveals <strong>live from Gamescom</strong>.</p>



<p>Below, I’ve outlined every Xbox game coming to Gamescom to populate the stream schedule. Enjoy!</p>







<p>Here’s how the first day of Xbox at Gamescom will work:</p>



<p><strong>Wednesday, August 20</strong></p>



<p>Stream times: 6 AM PT / 9 AM ET / 2 PM BST / 3 PM CEST</p>



<p><em>Headlines:</em></p>



<ul>
<li>ROG Xbox Ally</li>



<li>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</li>



<li>Dying Light: The Beast</li>



<li>Keeper</li>



<li>World of Warcraft: Midnight</li>



<li>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</li>



<li>Grounded 2</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Hotel Barcelona</li>



<li>Invincible Vs</li>

<li>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</li>



<li>Outbound</li>



<li>Powerwash Simulator 2</li>



<li>Starsand Island</li>



<li>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle: The Order of Giants</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Thursday, August 21</strong></p>



<p>Stream times: 6 AM PT / 9 AM ET / 2 PM BST / 3 PM CEST</p>



<p><em>Headlines:</em></p>



<ul>
<li>Ninja Gaiden 4</li>



<li>At Fate’s End</li>



<li>Onimusha: Way of the Sword</li>



<li>Age of Empires IV</li>

<li>My Hero Academia: All’s Justice</li>



<li>Silent Hill f</li>



<li>Lego Voyagers</li>



<li>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-how-to-watch-xbox-gamescom-streams">How to Watch Xbox @ Gamescom Streams</h3>



<p>The best places to watch the Xbox streams broadcast from Gamescom will be YouTube and Twitch. Ensure you’re watching the official channels to have the best chance of unlocking any live rewards:</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/xbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YouTube</a></li>



<li><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/xbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Twitch</a></li>
</ul>



<p>I’m fully expecting more to appear during these broadcasts, titles that aren’t necessarily being touted ahead of the streams taking place. Every year, Xbox invests <strong>a lot </strong>in Gamescom, occupying a vast section of the show floor and putting on one hell of a show. They’d be remiss to not have a few surprises up their sleeves.</p>

<p>But it will have "full crossplay"</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Borderlands 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5bcb028bc3af9/borderlands-4.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: 2K Games</em></figcaption></figure><p>Since the announcement of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> for the Switch 2, we've had a number of updates from Randy Pitchford and the team at Gearbox Software about what exactly fans can expect.</p>
<p>Following the news last month the game would run at "mostly" 30fps (instead of 60fps) on Nintendo's new hybrid hardware, we've now got another Switch 2-related update. This was spotted in the <a href="https://support.borderlands.com/hc/en-us/articles/43481582561939-Borderlands-4-Nintendo-Switch-2-FAQ#h_01K1XYNQ5NRRFJZ170AXZSQYQ7">game's official FAQ</a>, which was updated earlier this month.</p>
<p>This version will apparently offer "the same exciting" experience as other platforms "minus the split-screen option". Although this is missing, the same paragraph notes how the Nintendo release will have crossplay support with the other platforms. Here it is in full:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Switch 2 players will have the same exciting <em>Borderlands 4</em> experience as other platforms minus the split-screen option, and yes, it will have full crossplay with Epic, Steam, PlayStation 5, and Xbox X|S!"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, if you were hoping to enjoy some split-screen action on a single Switch 2 device, it seems you may need to instead consider the game on another console platform for this particular option.</p>
<p>It was also confirmed not long ago how the Switch 2 physical release of Borderlands 4 will require a download, so expect a Game-Key Card release. This game launches for this platform on <strong>3rd October 2025</strong>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/wuchang-fallen-feathers-implodes-following-bizarre-1-5-%E2%80%98censorship%E2%80%99-update.1270788/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It has only been a few weeks since Wuchang: Fallen Feathers was released, adding yet another Soulslike to the increasingly expansive array of titles in the niche. In that time, Wuchang has suffered, being plagued by stability issues at launch and facing the wrath of gamers in thousands of negative reviews.</p>



<p>In the latest debacle, Wuchang: Fallen Feathers’ 1.5 update has rendered fans furious as developer Leenzee ‘censors’ various aspects of the game, applies a nasty retcon, and skews some of the title’s more challenging sequences.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-happened-with-wuchang-s-1-5-update">What Happened With Wuchang’s 1.5 Update?</h2>



<p>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers isn’t a terrible game, but it doesn’t do too much to differentiate itself from the slew of Soulslike games drowning out the industry these days. That’s <strong>one reason </strong>why it earned some negativity at launch, but the UE5-related performance issues (particularly on PC) didn’t help the situation.</p>



<p>Recently, Leenzee released the 1.5 patch for Wuchang, causing chaos and disappointing fans worldwide.</p>



<p>With a single line in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2277560/view/498329191821869869?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">full 1.5 patch notes</a>, Leenzee made waves:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Added dialogs for some NPCs to complete some plots. We will further optimize the exhaustion animations in the future to improve the plot performance.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Eagle-eyed Wuchang fans dove into the game after the 1.5 patch and discovered what that meant. Following the update, certain bosses can’t be killed and enter a state of ‘exhaustion’ after being defeated. Some have been reworked with new voice lines that alter the story, and other enemies in certain sequences (such as Ming Dynasty soldiers) won’t attack you at all.</p>



<p>This has caused one key chapter that was previously very difficult to become a breeze, further disappointing sadomasochistic Soulslike fans. </p>



<p>The situation was exacerbated by mods on the official Wuchang subreddit reportedly deleting posts complaining about the 1.5 patch. This has naturally caused the review stats for Wuchang to fall into the red once again.</p>



<p>In a post on social media, user Lance McDonald expressed concerns about <strong>why </strong>these changes were made:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>By the way, it isn’t the Chinese Government that forced these changes, WUCHANG is quite pro-government, it’s to please fringe groups of nationalists. I don’t really understand the details sadly.</p>
</blockquote>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">lmao Liu Wenxiu just stands around exhausted after the fight now, no dialogue . By the way, it isn't the Chinese Government that forced these changes, WUCHANG is quite pro-government, it's to please fringe groups of nationalists. I don't really understand the details sadly. <a href="https://t.co/QdjMZQbX8W">pic.twitter.com/QdjMZQbX8W</a></p>— Lance McDonald (@manfightdragon) <a href="https://twitter.com/manfightdragon/status/1956007542284268001?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 14, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>It’s relatively easy to predict that Wuchang: Fallen Feathers will start falling to the wayside now, and that this will forever be a mark on Leenzee’s reputation. This was the first outing for the studio, and it certainly isn’t how you’d want to make a name for yourself.</p>

<figure><a title="Kirby Air Riders" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/56c21bd8dc43d/kirby-air-riders.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>One of the many surprises during the Switch 2 reveal in April was the new game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a>, a sequel to the GameCube outing.</p>
<p>It's scheduled to arrive later this year, so what's the latest? Game director Masahiro Sakurai has issued another small update <a href="https://x.com/Sora_Sakurai/status/1956187495991009776">via social media today</a>, mentioning how he thinks the team should be able to share some information about this game soon.</p>
<p>This small update on this project about Kirby's new game lines up with Sora's 20th anniversary in 2025 – with Sakurai thanking fans for their "continued support" over the years. Here's a rough translation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Masahiro Sakurai:</strong> "It doesn't matter to most people, but today, Sora Co., Ltd. is celebrating its 20th anniversary. …That's a long time! Thank you for your continued support.</p>
<p>"The new game *Kirby Air Rider* hasn't even shown gameplay footage yet, but I think we'll be able to share some information soon. Please wait!"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This latest update on Kirby Air Riders follows the game getting a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/kirby-air-riders-has-been-rated-for-switch-2">classification last month</a>. Sakurai also mentioned in July how the title was "shaping up to be something great".</p>
<p>Again, Kirby Air Riders is scheduled for <strong>2025</strong>, so hopefully we'll at least get some gameplay footage soon. In the meantime, you can take another look at the announcement cinematic.</p>

<p>Scalpers are reportedly at it again, and this time they're targeting exclusive merch available at the 2025 Pokémon World Championships.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-world-championship-merchandise-scalper-reseller-2000617744">highlighted by Kotaku</a>, there are already eBay listings popping up for the commemorative Pikachu plush, themed TCG playmats, card binders, the <a href="https://x.com/JoeMerrick/status/1955663752457810413">jukebox</a> and various other items available at the event taking place in Anaheim, California this weekend.</p>
<p>Although there's a "one-per-person" rule in place at the venue, scalpers are still taking advantage of the fact the merch is currently exclusive to this event. Some of the community is already highlighting the scenes at the World Championships, as well as the resellers and online listings.</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fnjuhlw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLc1VHm8D80" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Here's one post, in particular, that's been called out by the Pokémon community. And below this are some scenes from the Pokémon Center pop-up at the event.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Selling 2025 worlds bearwalker and shiny gyarados statue. $1000 on bearwalker and $600 on shiny gyarados statue. Payment up front. Zelle/PP FF/cashapp preferably. Pm me if interested. Thanks"</p>
</blockquote>






<p>It's sad to see this sort of behaviour, as it continues to ruin the hobby for many legitimate Pokémon fans and collectors.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this follows a story earlier this week about McDonald's Japan having to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/mcdonalds-japan-pulls-happy-meal-pokemon-cards-early-and-fans-blame-scalpers">pull its Pokémon TCG Happy Meal promotion</a> after 24 hours because of similar issues tied to scalping – with one customer supposedly attempting to buy 40 Happy Meals. The fast food giant even issued a formal apology.</p>

<p>When you enter the badge pickup zone at the venue, you'll receive a unique code for a Toedscool. It's apparently "based on the Toedscool on this year's key art" for the World Championships (<a href="https://serebii.net/">thanks, Serebii.net</a>). You'll need to redeem this code in-game by <strong>August 29, 2025</strong>. Here's a look:</p>

<p>If we hear anything about an online distribution, we'll let you know. For now, if you want to get your hands on this, you'll need to attend this weekend's event, which takes place between <strong>August 15 - 17, 2025</strong>.</p>

<p>You can see the full schedule for the 2025 Pokémon World Championships in our previous post.

In fact, if you've tried to pay for something on Steam using PayPal recently, you might've noticed that the option isn't available. This is apparently isolated to certain countries, and now Valve has offered an explanation.</p><p>"In early July 2025, PayPal notified Valve that their acquiring bank for payment transactions in certain currencies was immediately terminating the processing of any transactions related to Steam," Valve wrote on its <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/731C-13C7-7D04-A11E#purpp" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Purchasing Issues support page</a>, as reported by RockPaper Shotgun. "This affects Steam purchases using PayPal in currencies other than EUR, CAD, GBP, JPY, AUD and USD."</p><p>"We hope to offer PayPal as an option for these currencies in the future but the timeline is uncertain," the page continues. "We are also evaluating adding additional payment methods on Steam for the customers affected by this. In the meantime, please use one of our other current payment methods during checkout. If you can't use any of the available options, you can consider using a Steam Wallet code to add funds to your account."</p><p>Valve further confirmed to RPS that this is "regarding content on Steam related to what we've previously commented on surrounding <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mastercard-responds-to-censorship-allegations-after-forcing-storefronts-to-remove-adult-games/1100-6533641/" data-ref-id="1100-6533641">Mastercard</a>."</p><p>"One of PayPal’s acquiring banks decided to stop processing any Steam transactions, which cut off PayPal on Steam for a number of currencies," Valve explained via a spokesperson.</p><p>In other words, unless you're paying with euros, pounds, dollars (US, Australia, Canada), or Japanese Yen, you can't make Steam purchases using PayPal for the time being.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/call-of-duty-black-ops-7%E2%80%98s-final-campaign-mission-will-reportedly-be-a-big-multiplayer-battle.1270665/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>A new report claims that Activision’s upcoming <a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-announced-trailer-xbox-ps5-1851784008"><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em></a> will merge the franchise’s famous multiplayer with the game’s single-player campaign by having the final mission take place in a 32-player online match.</p><p>In June, Xbox and Activision <a href="https://youtu.be/uUo5gnaYB_w">officially revealed <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em></a> as the next entry in the uber-popular shooter series. The game’s first teaser trailer offered up some glimpses of its future-based campaign as well as a brief look at multiplayer and Zombies, two <em>Call of Duty</em> staples at this point. We also know the game will feature a campaign that can be played solo or with up to three other players in co-op. That’s not a first for the series, but it isn’t common. What would be a first is that, reportedly, <em>Black Ops 7</em>‘s campaign will end in a climactic mission set inside a multiplayer match.</p><p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-avalon-map-campaign/">On August 14, as reported by </a><em><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-avalon-map-campaign/">Insider Gaming</a>,</em> sources told the outlet that <em>Black Ops 7</em>‘s campaign will feature 12 missions, and the final one will integrate the campaign into a 32-player multiplayer experience. The mission will take place in the map “Avalon,” which has been rumored for a bit now to be a battle royale location, but is actually the setting of this odd campaign experiment.</p><div data-player-id="plTxkEoh" data-name="Video_Collapse_Autoplay_SoundOff" id="cls-video-container-n9o50j6H"> <p><em>Insider Gamin</em>g says that the final mission sounds a lot like it will be an extraction-based experience with players needing to complete objectives before exiting the level and, presumably, finishing the game’s final campaign mission, though we’ll have to wait and see just what this all looks like in practice. While I’m always happy to see <em>Call of Duty</em> trying new things and shaking up the formula, I’m not a big fan of locking the game’s final mission behind an internet requirement. Will people be unable to play the last mission in 20-30 years when the servers are dead? Hopefully there’s a backup plan for offline folks.</p> <p>The merging of campaign and multiplayer like this is reportedly part of a larger push in <em>Black Ops 7</em> to merge the game’s various modes and offer players full progression across every part of the upcoming shooter, with the idea being that regardless of where you play, even in campaign, you can level up weapons, characters, and the battle pass. That’s a neat idea that seems inspired by <em>Fortnite’s</em> universal progression and XP system, <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/coming-soon-progress-your-fortnite-passes-by-playing-any-experience?lang=en-US">which Epic implemented last year</a>.</p> <p><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em> doesn’t have a release date yet, but Xbox and Activision will show off the game’s multiplayer later this month at Gamescom, and that seems like a fine time to announce a launch date. If the past is prologue, I’d expect you’ll be playing <em>Black Ops 7</em> in October or November.</p> </div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7s-final-campaign-mission-will-reportedly-be-a-big-multiplayer-battle-2000617873]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><i>Jurassic Park: Survival</i> still doesn't have a release date, but at least we have some new footage of the game's dinosaurs
                </p><div>
              
              
              <p>It feels like a long time ago that Saber Interactive and Universal announced<em><a href="https://kotaku.com/games/jurassic-park-survival--2"> Jurassic Park: Survival</a>.</em> And that’s because yeah, it’s been nearly two years! Since then, we’ve not gotten much else about the game, but earlier today, we finally got some fresh looks at <em>Survival </em>in action.</p> <p><em>Jurassic Park: Survival</em> is an upcoming first-person action-horror game set one day after the events of the original<a href="https://kotaku.com/jurassic-park-jurassic-world-rebirth-movies-ranked-1851776876"><em> Jurassic Park</em> film</a>. You play as a new character, Dr. Maya Joshi, who is left on the island after everyone else escapes. Now she has to survive (oh, I get the name of the game now) while trying to figure out a way off dino island, aka Isla Nublar. <a href="https://kotaku.com/jurassic-park-survival-fps-action-trailer-game-awards-1851083053">The game was announced 19 months ago, all the way back in December 2023</a>, and since then, we’ve not seen much about it. That changed on Thursday with a new behind-the-scenes featurette from Universal and developers Saber Interactive.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Jurassic Park: Survival | Behind-The-Scenes Featurette" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lLuxDHCY6kw?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>On August 14, the official <em>Jurassic World/Jurassic Park</em> YouTube account posted <a href="https://youtu.be/lLuxDHCY6kw">a nearly six-minute-long video</a> featuring interviews with various developers and others working on <em>Survival.</em> And sprinkled throughout this video, which is mostly focused on all the movie-accurate details in <em>Survival</em>‘s environments,&nbsp;how it connects to the film, and the new main character–are some new looks at how the <a href="https://kotaku.com/dinosaur-games-dino-crisis-jurassic-park-horror-pc-ps5-1851771664">franchise’s iconic dinosaurs</a> will appear in the game.</p>

 <p>Look at that T. rex! I love it! And we get some more glimpses of how Velociraptors and the extremely tall Brachiosaurus look in<em> Jurassic Park: Survival,</em> too. As a massive <em>Jurassic Park</em> fan, all of this has me really excited to play the game. Sadly, we still don’t have a release date for <em>Survival</em>. And I’m not feeling good about it arriving this year. In a press release shared with <em>Kotaku</em> announcing this new video, Saber Interactive explained that “<em>J</em><i>urassic Park: Survival</i><i>&nbsp;</i>won’t be present at this year’s Gamescom.” Maybe it still shows up at Geoff Kielghley’s annual Opening Night Live ceremony later this month, but I’m not holding my breath about that.</p> <p>If you want to kill some time while waiting, you can always watch the original announcement trailer from 2023. It’s pretty cool.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Jurassic Park: Survival | Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UinsNBOTNyU?feature=oembed"></iframe></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/battlefield-6/">Battlefield 6</a> Open Beta is currently playable on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC right now until August 17. But PC players in particular learned that they might have to jump through more hoops than those on consoles. If you've been unable to launch the beta due to an error message telling you that 'Secure Boot' needs to be enabled, this guide will show you how to do that so you can get into the action on your PC in no-time.</p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-beta-how-to-enable-secure-boot">Battlefield 6 Beta - How To Enable Secure Boot</h2>



<h3 id="h-what-is-secure-boot">What is Secure Boot?</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Battlefield 6 will require Secure Boot to be enabled even when the game launches in October.</figcaption></figure>



<p>To put it simply, Secure Boot is a feature available on both Windows 10 and Windows 11 that scans for malicious software, and in this case, cheat software, that could load ahead of your operating system.</p>



<p>It's a feature that EA needs your PC to have enabled, so that it's kernel-level anti-cheat Javelin software can help keep Battlefield 6 cheater-free.</p>



<p>On EA's <a href="https://www.ea.com/en/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/secure-boot-information">official website</a>, the company calls Secure Boot being enabled a "<em>requirement</em>" for "<em>enhanced security while playing and utilizing new anti-cheat features in Battlefield...Requiring Secure Boot provides us with features that we can leverage against cheats that attempt to infiltrate during the Windows boot process. It also lets the Battlefield Positive Play team use its own features and related dependent security features like TPM to combat other forms of cheating</em>."</p>



<p>Kernel-level anti-cheat isn't always the most popular thing with PC players, as some see it as giving companies too much access to your personal device. But regardless of your feelings, you won't be playing Battlefield 6 on PC without it. And at least for now, it seems to be doing its job, with EA reporting that it has <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-beta-breaks-470k-users-steam-anti-cheat-stopped-330k-attempts/">already stopped hundreds of thousands of cheaters in this beta</a>.</p>



<h3 id="h-step-1-check-to-see-if-you-can-even-enable-secure-boot">Step 1 - Check to see if you can even enable Secure Boot</h3>



<p>Before you jump down to the rest of the steps, you need to figure out if you can even enable Secure Boot without taking a few more extra steps, like potentially having to contact the manufacturer of your PC's motherboard. </p>



<ul>
<li>The first thing you'll need to do is navigate to your <strong>System Information </strong>menu, which you can find just by searching 'System Information' in the Start Menu on your taskbar. You can also type 'misinfo32' into your menu to open the menu without the need for an extra click.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>Once you're there, you'll be checking after the status of two of the listed items, <strong>Secure Boot State</strong> and <strong>BIOS Mode</strong>. If you've been getting the error message that Secure Boot needs to be enabled to run the Battlefield 6 Open Beta, then the former of the two should say 'Off.'</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>Regarding BIOS Mode, you want the value to be <strong>UEFI</strong>. If the value is 'Legacy,' than you're unfortunately going to have to jump through a few more hoops to make this work, specifically checking to see if your Windows disk partition is GPT or MBR.</li>
</ul>



<figure><figcaption>You're looking for the settings at the top and bottom of this image.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Before we get into that, however, you'll also need to do a quick check that TPM 2.0 is enabled and ready to use. You can do this by typing '<strong>tpm.msc</strong>' into your Start Menu taskbar to find the Trusted Platform Module window, or by entering 'tpm.msc' in the Windows Run menu, which you can access by pressing the Windows key and the 'R' key at the same time. </p>



<p>This is what you're hoping to see when you open the menu:</p>



<figure><figcaption>If TPM is not ready to use, or you get a message that says 'Compatible TPM cannot be found,' you'll need to look to your motherboard's manufacturer for more help.</figcaption></figure>



<h3 id="h-step-2-check-your-windows-disk-partition-and-convert-it-from-mbr-to-gpt-if-necessary">Step 2 - Check your Windows Disk partition, and convert it from MBR to GPT if necessary</h3>



<p>Start by pressing the <strong>'X'</strong> key and the Windows key at the same time. That will open a menu where you can then select '<strong>Disk Management</strong>.'</p>



<p>You're looking for the disk where you installed Windows, which is generally marked <strong>(C:)</strong>. Right-click on the number on the left of the drive (which is usually '0') and then select '<strong>Properties</strong><em>'</em> in the resulting menu. You'll then navigate to '<strong>Volumes'</strong>, where you will hope to see the following:</p>



<figure><figcaption>If the partition is not GPT, you'll need to convert it.</figcaption></figure>



<p>If everything up until now has appeared as it should, then you can jump right ahead to the final step of enabling Secure Boot in your BIOS.</p>



<p>To convert the partition from MBR to GPT, start by pressing the '<strong>R</strong>' key and the Windows key at the same time. Type '<strong>powershell</strong>' and in the resulting window, press <strong>'Ctrl+Shift+Enter</strong>' to open a command prompt as an administrator. </p>



<p>Run this command to validate your disk and ensure that the number (which again, is usually '0') matches the number you found in the Disk Management menu: </p>



<ul>
<li><strong>mbr2gpt /validate /disk:X /allowFullOS</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>If it doesn't match, you'll need to replace it with the matching number. If/when the validation passes, to finally convert your disk partition from MBR to GPT, run this command: </p>



<ul>
<li><strong>mbr2gpt /convert /disk:X /allowFullOS</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Once that has completed, head back to your Disk Management menu, back into Properties and then Volumes to ensure that your disk partition has successfully converted to GPT.</p>



<h3 id="h-step-3-enable-secure-boot">Step 3 - Enable Secure Boot</h3>



<p>After all those checks to ensure that everything is as it should be (apart from Secure Boot already being enabled, of course) we're finally ready to enable Secure Boot.</p>



<p>It's at this point where you also might have to check with your motherboard's manufacturer on where to find Secure Boot in your computer's BIOS. It's worth keeping the official support page for your motherboard open on a separate device, if you have one available, to help you out with this part if you need it.</p>



<p>Start by restarting your computer and entering your BIOS. You get into the BIOS by constantly pressing either the '<strong>F12</strong>' key or the '<strong>Del</strong>' key while your computer is booting back up. It might be different depending on your specific computer, but you should launch into your BIOS by mashing either key.</p>



<p>Once in your BIOS, Secure Boot will usually be found either in your advanced settings or security settings. From there, it should be a simple change to 'Enable Secure Boot,' or to make Secure Boot 'Active' as opposed to 'Inactive.'</p>



<p>You can also potentially hit one last snag here, where you might not be able to adjust your Secure Boot settings. If that's the case, then you may need to find a setting named '<strong>Restore Factory Keys</strong>' or something similar. Selecting that will boot you back into the BIOS, where you should now be able to adjust your Secure Boot settings.</p>



<p>Restart your computer one last time, and then you should have no trouble launching the Battlefield 6 Open Beta. If you still have a problem, then you'll need to go to your motherboard's manufacturer to get a clearer idea of what's causing the issue.</p>

<p>Birdo is one of the primary unlockable characters in<i> Mario Kart World</i>. Being a relative mainstay in the <i>Super Mario</i> spinoffs since the Gamecube era, it’s a little surprising that she doesn’t show up in the game’s roster from the start. With icons like Donkey Kong and Daisy being unlocks too, though, I suppose it isn’t much of a surprise.</p> <p>On the bright side, uncovering her doesn’t take much effort: just four short races and she’ll be in your crew! Here’s what you need to know to get this unusual creature.</p> <h2><span id="the-best-karts-for-birdo"></span>The best karts for Birdo<span></span></h2> <p>As with many other characters, Reel Racer is hard to turn down as the best match for Birdo. That said, you may want to try your hand at the Biddybuggy given its improved acceleration and handling over the Reel Racer.</p> <h2><span id="how-to-unlock-birdo"></span>How to Unlock Birdo<span></span></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000617863" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000617863"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000617863">© © Screenshot: Nintendo</figcaption></figure> <p>If you want to unlock Birdo, you just need to complete the Banana Cup! Unfortunately, if you don’t want to unlock Birdo, she will still unlock after you complete the Banana Cup. Placement doesn’t matter. Whether you win every race or never get higher than 24th, Birdo will still join your crew when the Grand Prix is concluded.</p>

 <p>Birdo is a middleweight character, like her counterpart Yoshi. That means that she is a very well-rounded character, not excelling at anything in particular, but not lacking in anything either.</p> <h2><span id="all-outfits-for-birdo-in-mario-kart-world"></span>All Outfits for Birdo in <i>Mario Kart World</i><span></span></h2> <p>In total, Birdo has two outfits to select from at launch. If you’re mad at that fact, just know that you can’t be nearly as mad as I am that Donkey Kong got a quite short end of the stick with only one outfit. Anyways, here’s a list of foods to unlock those outfits:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">Pro racer: pancakes, donut, cake, burger, fruit salad, curry, ice cream</li> <li aria-level="1">Vacation: takoyaki, sushi, pizza, kebab, naan, fish and chips, popcorn</li> </ul> <p>Explore the open world in free roam, or travel the Mushroom Kingdom in modes like Knockout Tour to get access to a lot of different foods and increase your chances of finding what you need to unlock these costumes. Before long, you’ll find what you’re looking for and get these costumes for Birdo’s wardrobe!</p> <hr> <p><i>Mario Kart World </i>is available now on the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The first time I get a good view of <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>’s Night City is from the window of a private taxi. The driverless flying car departs from a portal high up in the side of my corporate employer’s headquarters and soars over a packed, four lane traffic circle. I sip champagne as neon towers slide past, megabuildings whose gargantuan size would make Denis Villeneuve blush.&nbsp;</p><p>The car is taking me to a bar to meet a friend. As the vehicle swoops down, the automation warns me that there is no suitable landing place for an aerial vehicle. In other words, there’s nowhere to park.</p><p>I override the warning. The cab parks illegally on a basketball court, upsetting the people currently shooting hoops. I punch them in the face, because this seems like the kind of thing a corpo like me would do.</p><p>Parking isn’t a big deal in Night City, because <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> is a game and nobody enjoys parking. You can leave your car, motorcycle or neo-militarist armoured SUV wherever you like and recall it later with the press of a button. Cars are almost always in motion, and it’s rare to see street parking or a parking lot. There aren’t even bike lanes; Night City is a place where the car is king.</p><p>Clearly the designers at CD Projekt Red understand what many real world urban planners are starting to grasp: parking sucks the life out of a city. This representation of a car-centric dystopia can’t actually be too car-centric. It’s fun to drive around, sure, but <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> isn’t a game about driving.&nbsp;</p><p>“We were creating a game, an experience that has to be super fun for the player to enjoy,” Kacper Niepokólczycki, environment art director at CD Projekt RED, told me. “You can explore the world in a vehicle, on foot, or swimming. We tried our best to make sure any of those methods gives you a fun and different experience.”</p><p>If only North American cities thought the same way.</p><figure><figcaption>Lots of cars, but no parking. CDPR</figcaption></figure><p>In-game, the meeting in the bar goes poorly, and afterwards I get dropped off by the Kabuki Roundabout. I head into a lively pedestrian market in the centre of the traffic circle. There are street food vendors and a place to buy guns and cyberware. It’s all open 24 hours a day, so you can pick up ramen and a revolver whenever you’re hungry for food or violence.</p><p>Night City is full of places like this: walkable public space with restaurants and retail.&nbsp;</p><p>“In some places we were able to close traffic and create denser crowds — so you can really feel like you’re in the tight streets of an Asian-inspired city,” said Niepokólczycki. “Just like the breathtaking vistas and interesting, layered environments, we wanted to make our crowds stand out just as much.”</p><p>One evening my companion Johnny Silverhand (played by Keanu Reeves) stops me as I pass a busker and compliments his playing. We agree to go check out an old club where Silverhand used to play gigs himself, and are led to a stall in a local market where a crusty old rocker is selling bootleg tapes of Silverhand’s band Samurai<em>. </em>This is often how subplots emerge in <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> – chance encounters and following leads.</p><p>The game needs places where the player can walk freely and have seemingly-random encounters like this. For Niepokólczycki, it doesn’t matter if a player only experiences one or two of these chunks of side content; it's about the discovery. “[Night City is] a living, breathing city with its own ecosystem, and you are just exploring part of it,” he said.&nbsp;</p><p>The same is true in real cities, though on a different scale. A store, venue or art installation doesn’t have to be for every single person in the city, but it can delight some people as they happen across it. One of the most joyous things you can do in a city is to explore and discover.</p><p>“Seeing the amount of YouTube videos of players exploring Night City for hours and hours straight on foot — which by the way, is amazing to see — it looks like we succeeded. I love to watch those videos!” said Niepokólczycki.</p><p>AppleTV’s upcoming adaptation of <em>Neuromancer,</em> William Gibson’s 1984 novel which defined the cyberpunk genre, is currently being filmed in Tokyo. Night City may be physically located on the west coast of North America, but it’s easy to see the influence of East Asian cities like Hong Kong and Tokyo in the bright neon lights and loud advertising. That influence is also there under the city’s skin. It’s in the way that land is used and regulated, known as “zoning” to urban planners.&nbsp;</p><p>CDPR had two urban planners on the development team for <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>.<em> </em>Niepokólczycki said there was push and pull between the game’s artists – who were excited to draft a flamboyant, futuristic sci-fi city –&nbsp; and CDPR’s urban planners, who “tried to do what they do best — build a believable, functional city that could actually exist. They acted as the voice of common sense.”</p><figure><figcaption>A walkable area in Night City. Jay Cockburn</figcaption></figure><p>If this were a truly North American city, then vast swathes of Night City would be zoned for residential use only. In my own city, Toronto, this is known as the “yellow belt,” because residential is marked in yellow on the city’s official land use map. You cannot open so much as a coffee shop or convenience store in the yellow belt. It’s all homes, most of which are detached single family houses. This type of zoning is known as “exclusionary zoning,” because it excludes most uses.&nbsp;</p><p>In real world cities like Toronto there have been attempts by urban planners and progressive politicians to do away with exclusionary zoning, but they’re often met with pushback from local homeowners who want to “preserve” or “protect” their neighbourhoods. This is ultimately futile: populations grow, leading to a shortage of housing, while children age out of their parents’ houses and move to the denser apartment-centric neighbourhoods they can afford. Eventually you have what we see in Toronto today: once-lively neighbourhoods where populations are falling and schools are under-attended. Meanwhile, the areas where development is allowed are experiencing massive growth, becoming densely populated with over-used amenities and services.&nbsp;</p><div><p>When you walk through these residential-only parts of Toronto, it’s hard to deny that they’re often attractive to look at but fundamentally boring to linger in. They’re places to come back to after spending the day at work or play elsewhere. They would be untenable in a video game; there wouldn’t be much point creating a yellow belt in Night City.</p><p>Instead, <em>Cyberpunk 2077 </em>has land uses much closer to that of Tokyo, called “inclusionary zoning.” In Japan, even the most restrictive zoning still allows for small shops on residential streets in the same building as a private residence. This has made Tokyo an eminently walkable city where residents can go about their days without hopping into a car. In fact, Tokyo has the lowest car use in the world. About 12% of trips are completed with a car, whereas 17% of trips are done with a bicycle, according to Daniel Knowles’ book <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/730724/carmageddon-by-daniel-knowles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Carmageddon</em></a>.</p></div><p>In Night City, there are vendors crammed into corners and in-between spaces. Apartment buildings have retail, boxing gyms (or in Megabuilding 8 it’s more of a baseball bat gym), and social spaces right outside your door. When you wander the city you are encouraged to interact with it. That’s true in Night City, as it's true in Tokyo.&nbsp;</p><p>In most games cities feel like they have sprung to life fully formed like a beautiful painting, but that’s not how real life cities are built. The collaboration between CDPR’s artists and urban planners created a city that feels like it has a genuine history. The liveliness of the streets and the chance interactions are a huge part of it, but the aesthetic is key, too.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>"Kitsch," one of Cyberpunk 2077's four architectural styles. Jay Cockburn</figcaption></figure><p>Let's step outside science fiction for a second and take a look at some fantasy cities in <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>: Rivendell, Osgiliath, Minas Tirith. They’re otherworldly expressions of stone and water, flowing beautifully from one arch to the next. They’re stunning to look at, and utterly unrealistic: No real city’s architecture remains that uniform. Even places like Paris or Vienna, with their great reconstructions of the 19th century, can’t maintain this level of coherence. Humans just don’t work that way; we’re messy creatures, subject to economic pressures and aesthetic disagreements.</p><p>Night City, on the other hand, is an architectural melting pot. Neon signs are everywhere, but the buildings are a chaotic assortment of styles, jumbled and squashed together. This doesn’t mean that the city feels incoherent as a whole. Neighbourhoods are still distinctive, with subtle stylistic variations that give the player a sense of place.</p><p>To achieve this, <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>’s designers created four architectural styles: Kitsch, Entropic, Neo-military and Neo-kitsch.&nbsp;</p><p>Niepokólczycki said that “Kitsch was trying to pretend it looks expensive, when in reality it was a cheap style that used materials and technology that would break or become damaged easily. It was a disposable style in that regard; when something breaks, you just make another one of the same quality.” To me that sounds a lot like the McMansion-style architecture you see in so much of middle America.&nbsp;</p><p>Entropism, on the other hand, is a style based on poverty and a severe lack of resources. In a nutshell, this style visually tells the story of the very poor social layer of our world. Its central motto is “Necessity Over Style.”</p><p>These architectural styles are not defined with great specificity; Niepokólczycki did not say that Heywood should have Mansard roofs and homes in Santo Domingo are built with yellow brick. Instead, the buildings reflect the people who occupy an area. In this hypercapitalist, gun-centric future, Neo-militarism is associated with corporate headquarters; think sleek lines, dark colours, armoured cars and imposing branding. Niepokólczycki told me that Neo-militarism is rooted in the wealth of corporations. “They could afford those corpo ‘castles’ over the Night City landscape that really brandished the Neo-militarism style like a weapon,” he said.</p><p>Neo-kitsch, meanwhile, represents the ultra-ultra rich who can afford such rarities as real wood and animal leather, natural materials that are exceedingly scarce and definitely not disposable in the climate-ravaged world of <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>.</p><figure><figcaption>"Entropism," one of Cyberpunk 2077's four architectural styles. Jay Cockburn</figcaption></figure><p>Heritage preservation in North America has historically focused on preserving buildings, not communities. Santa Fe, New Mexico is famous for its pueblo revival-style downtown where the buildings have rounded corners and stucco walls like something out of Star Wars’ Tatooine. It’s an impressive place to be as a tourist, but this stagnation has led to a city centre that feels like a theme park, a Mickey Mouse version of historic Santa Fe where the cost of living has forced locals to move away while rich out-of-towners stay in AirBnBs and gawp.&nbsp;</p><p>Perhaps we could learn something from <em>Cyberpunk</em> about codifying our architectural styles in ways that relate more to community than cornices. That’s not to say we should design cities like Night City and designate parts of them as entropic, but we should avoid attempting to freeze an area in time. To its credit, the city of Toronto is starting to recognise this. Heritage planner Tatum Taylor is working on the lively Kensington Market neighbourhood and told the Globe and Mail’s City Space podcast (for which I am a senior producer) that “If we were to freeze Kensington Market in time, we would actually be losing what's most important and unique about it.”</p><p>In the 1920s Kensington Market was a hub for the city’s Jewish community. Subsequent waves of immigration from all over the world created a layered and vibrant place bustling with stalls. “You can see the accumulated layers of history within the actual built fabric,” Taylor told City Space. “There are former residential buildings that still have little gables or even half gables peeking up over the roof line of a commercial addition, and that really tells the story within the streetscape of a community coming together in a part of the city to pursue a life for themselves.”</p><figure><figcaption>Neo-militarism, one of Cyberpunk 2077's four architectural styles. Jay Cockburn</figcaption></figure><p>When he wrote <em>Neuromancer</em>, William Gibson was living in Vancouver. He’s an American who ended up on Canada’s west coast after dodging the draft in Toronto. Most cyberpunk authors are American or British and were publishing between the 70s and 90s. Their idea of a dystopia is informed by that 20th century aversion to urban density.</p><p>Nowhere is that cultural context more apparent than in <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>’s the eastern neighbourhood of Santo Domingo, described in the game’s art book as</p><blockquote><p> a failed attempt to create a suburban utopia of single-family dwellings… verticality abuts sprawl, factories and power plants sit right next to supposedly idyllic residential neighborhoods and the whole urban planning concept of separate functional zones is flipped the bird.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>To Niepokólczycki Santo Domingo represents the fears that many North American city dwellers have about Japanese-style inclusionary zoning. “In Night City you see that clash of different zoning as a direct effect of corporations wanting to have more of the city for themselves. And if there’s no other space to put a power plant, then fitting one next to Rancho works — but it’s never going to be pretty.”</p><p>To the original creators of Night City, this mixed use zoning is a dystopia – and nobody really wants to live next to a high-polluting industrial plant. The single family homes are depicted as dilapidated, occupied by some of the city’s poorest. The cauldrons of industry dominate chunks of land with grey pipes and corroded silos.&nbsp;</p><p>“For the residents of [Santo Domingo sub-district] Rancho Coronado, consumerism is everywhere — with big adverts plastered all over, even in backyards,” Niepokólczycki told me. “That's partially the dystopia: there is no escape from the meat grinder that is Night City.”</p><p>Certainly the urban planning orthodoxy of real world cities in the 50s and 60s was that cities should have a central business district, or a meat grinder if you will, which could then be escaped by car to a perfect, protected home in a suburban development. But in reality, mixed use zoning isn’t a meat grinder.&nbsp;</p><p>There is only one type of Japanese zoning that is exclusively industrial. There’s also commercial zoning, which allows for small factories, and quasi-industrial zoning, which allows for homes and shops. These types of zoning don’t create artificial barriers against the construction of homes in places that might actually be nice places to live, and so housing in Japan is much more affordable than in Canada. This isn’t because Japanese urbanites are crammed into the space between smokestacks and tire factories – not all industries are high-polluting collections of smog-churning machinery. I grew up near Carlisle, a British city that is often blanketed with the rich smell of cooking chocolate from the cookie factory in its centre. Mixed-use zoning allows more where it's necessary and desirable, but under the exclusionary zoning of almost every city in today’s English-speaking world, the apartments and townhouses nearby could not be built.&nbsp;</p><p>If Night City were made reality, those dilapidated detached homes in Rancho Coronado would be multimillion dollar pieces of prime real estate, a rare opportunity to own a detached house with your own yard in a hyperdense metropolis. The real meat grinder would be the traffic on your commute if you lived elsewhere. In a city like Toronto industrial zones aren’t places you linger unless you’re working there. When I pass by a lubricant plant on one of my regular bike rides I speed up, trying to avoid breathing the air. The lubricant plant serves a purpose, but it's kept on the city’s outskirts for a reason.</p><figure><figcaption>Zoning in Santo Domingo. Jay Cockburn</figcaption></figure><p>In Night City there is one purpose: play. Industrial areas are open to the player, and often the site of a shootout or stealthy break-in. The surveillance cameras are tools to be hacked and turned upon their owners. The commute is immaterial: driving is fun in Night City. Traffic has been massaged into an entertaining obstacle to swerve around, and if you screw up and crash your car it’s no big deal.</p><p>We can’t let citizens loose with throwing knives and rocket-propelled grenades in the lubricant plants of Toronto, but we can ask how we could invite people to explore more of the city. Which spaces are underused, and how can we incentivise municipalities and private landowners to go further than just allowing public access, but encouraging it with places to sit and things to do? That could include allowing retail in more places, but it's broader than that. Cities are bad at allowing <em>life in general</em>. No loitering.&nbsp;</p><p>Why do I so often find myself wondering “am I allowed to be here?” when walking through open space in Toronto? Why do we have to check what <em>is</em> allowed, rather than assuming most things aren’t?</p><p>Many North American cities are actively hostile to street life. In 2024 the council in my own city of Toronto voted against allowing small business in residential neighbourhoods. A cafe on the corner of my street is apparently one step too close to the dystopian hellscape of <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>.</p><p>When I leave my Night City apartment in Megabuilding 10, it isn’t the presence of mixed retail on my floor that I find dystopian. It’s the smoke that chokes the view from my narrow window, the layers of highway that dominate the space between buildings, the elevator pumping out abrasive commercials selling sex, cyberware and sedatives. They remind me of the ad-laden screens in Toronto’s condo elevators, though those commercials are decidedly tamer.&nbsp;</p><p>Night City isn’t even immune to gentrification: that old club where Reeves’ character Johnny Silverhand used to play concerts has turned into a brightly-lit ramen chain by the time you get to check it out.</p><p>When I asked if there was anything that real cities can learn from Night City, Niepokólczycki was humble. “No, I would not go that far,” he said. “The only rules were the ones that we put on ourselves — which are totally different from the regulations a real, evolving city has to follow.”</p><p>I would argue that municipal regulations are also a set of rules made up by people. Many of them are sensible, and keep us safe – fire codes, for example. Others are more arbitrary, such as Ontario’s recently enacted law that stops cities installing bike lanes where a lane of car traffic would be removed.&nbsp;</p><p>If we want our cities to be more than just functional – if we want them to be <em>fun</em> – we should take a long hard look at the rules and regulations that govern how we build and evolve those cities. I think we would find many of them are getting in the way of creating places that we can truly live and play in.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/blizzard-union-story-franchise-cwa"><h3>Hell Yeah, Another Blizzard Union</h3></a><p>Members of Blizzard’s Story and Franchise Development team have unionized with the Communications Workers of America</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/cyberpunk-urban-design]]></content:encoded>

<p>We know very few details right now, except that the panel will be a 90-minute megaton "showcasing all of Capcom’s recent and upcoming releases." It all kicks off at <strong>3:45 pm EST on Friday 10th October</strong> — we've listed times for the showcase below, but note that these NYCC panels aren't often broadcast unless you pay for <a href="https://www.newyorkcomiccon.com/en-us/memberships.html">Popverse membership</a>.</p><div><figure data-videoid="-13CJKg9tJk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-13CJKg9tJk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-13CJKg9tJk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-13CJKg9tJk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5c0dc7jstzgr&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-13CJKg9tJk" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Now, this is far from the first time Capcom has been to Comic-Con — the company has attended multiple times over the years. But In terms of Switch and Switch 2 games, the only real new game appearance is likely to be <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection">Monster Hunter Stories 3</a>. But we may get a look at some new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> DLC too?</p>
<p>However, we'd recommend that you don't get your hopes up <em>too</em> much for any major announcements. But really, we'd love to see some <strong>Mega Man</strong>. C'mon, Capcom! <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/mega-man-is-one-of-capcoms-most-important-ips-despite-no-new-games-in-7plus-years">You said it was one of your "most-important IPs!"</a></p>

<p>One of the greatest racers in the Galaxy, Rosalina, has made her triumphant return to <i>Mario Kart </i>in <i>Mario Kart World</i>. However, she actually isn’t available to choose at the start. You’ll have to do a little bit of searching to find her.</p> <p>Luckily, it won’t take much. Here’s what you need to do to add Rosalina to your crew of playable drivers and which kart will see her speeding ahead of the rest.</p> <h2><span id="the-best-kart-for-rosalina"></span>The best kart for Rosalina<span></span></h2> <p>Luckily, your options for getting the most out of Rosalina are pretty simple: The Reel Racer offers excellent speed to keep you at the front of the pack. The Baby Blooper isn’t a bad second choice if the poorer handling of the Reel Racer doesn’t work for you.</p> <h2><span id="how-to-unlock-rosalina-in-mario-kart-world"></span>How to Unlock Rosalina in <em>Mario Kart World</em><span></span></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000617859" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000617859"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000617859">© Screenshot: Nintendo</figcaption></figure> <p>Rosalina is unlocked after you complete the Star Cup of the Grand Prix mode, a fitting place to find the de facto queen of the cosmos. It doesn’t matter how well you do in the races; whether you walk out with a gold trophy or participation ribbon, finishing the four tracks in the Star Cup is enough to add Rosalina to your playable roster of characters.</p>

 <p>Rosalina is a heavyweight character, meaning that she can knock other racers around easier and has a higher top speed. As a tradeoff, she has worse acceleration and handling.</p> <h2><span id="all-unlockable-rosalina-costumes"></span>All Unlockable Rosalina Costumes<span></span></h2> <p>Rosalina has four unlockable costumes to find: touring, aero, aurora, pro racer. Each of these costumes can be found by eating a few different foods. Here’s a list of some of those foods and the outfits that they can unlock:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">Touring: Burger, Fish and chips, pancakes, milk, chicken, kebab, pizza</li> <li aria-level="1">Aero: Donuts, curry</li> <li aria-level="1">Aurora: Ice cream, bread, popcorn</li> <li aria-level="1">Pro Racer: cake, fruit salad</li> </ul> <p>Explore the open world in free roam or during your races to find as many foods as possible to dig up each costume! Remember, once you find a costume, it will permanently be unlocked for you to choose on the character select screen to choose from the beginning of any race in the future.</p> <hr> <p><i>Mario Kart World </i>is available now on Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>MicroSD cards are tiny but slow; the M.2 storage sticks in your PC are blazing fast but bigger and fully enclosed. Now, a new type of SSD out of China could be the best of both worlds — and it’s already set to appear in two cutting-edge gaming portables.</p><p>Chinese storage manufacturer Biwin is calling it the “Mini SSD,” though another manufacturer refers to it as the “1517”; it measures just 15mm x 17mm x 1.4mm thick, smaller than a U.S. penny and just slightly larger than MicroSD. Despite that, it offers maximum sequential read speeds of 3,700 megabytes per second (or 3,400MB/s writes) over a PCIe 4x2 connection, and offers 512GB, 1TB and 2TB capacities.</p><p>To put that in context, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/676075/switch-2-microsd-express-cards-where-to-buy">the new MicroSD Express cards that work with the Nintendo Switch 2</a> top out at a theoretical 985MB/s, less than a third the speed. And while a full-size SD Express card could theoretically beat Mini SSD at 3,940MB/s, it would be nearly twice the size of Biwin’s creation.</p><p>The nano-SIMs used in recent smartphones are still smaller, though, and M.2 drives are <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23743546/pcie-gen-5-ssd-nvme-drive-speed-test-comparison-hands-on">still faster</a>. I whipped up a quick chart so you can easily compare various storage cards and SIMs:</p><div><table><thead><tr><th><h3>Type</h3></th><th><h3>Length</h3></th><th><h3>Width</h3></th><th><h3>Height</h3></th><th><h3>Theoretical max speed</h3></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Mini SSD</td><td>15mm</td><td>17mm</td><td>1.4mm</td><td>3,700MB/s</td></tr><tr><td>MicroSD</td><td>11mm</td><td>15mm</td><td>1mm</td><td>985MB/s</td></tr><tr><td>SD</td><td>24mm</td><td>32mm</td><td>~2mm (varies)</td><td>3,940MB/s</td></tr><tr><td>M.2 2230</td><td>22mm</td><td>30mm</td><td>~2mm (varies)</td><td>~8,000MB/s</td></tr><tr><td>M.2 2280</td><td>22mm</td><td>80mm</td><td>~2mm (varies)</td><td>~14,000MB/s</td></tr><tr><td>Nano-SIM</td><td>8.8mm</td><td>12.3mm</td><td>0.67mm</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Micro-SIM</td><td>12mm</td><td>15mm</td><td>0.76mm</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Mini-SIM</td><td>15mm</td><td>25mm</td><td>0.76mm</td><td>N/A</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>It’s not clear if Biwin’s Mini SSD is a true standard that other storage makers can easily adopt. But <a href="https://www.biwintechnology.com/press-release/biwin-mini-ssd/">the company’s marketing it</a> for laptops, tablets, phones, cameras and more, with its own dedicated slot that works exactly like smartphone SIM card slots: stick in a pin to remove the tray.</p><p>The company claims IP68 water and dust resistance, which could be handy for phones in particular, and three-meter drop resistance.</p><p>Two cutting-edge Chinese gaming portables already appear to be customers, both of which made announcements at ChinaJoy this past week. There’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/714294/gpd-win-5-strix-halo-specs-revealed">the GPD Win 5</a>, the monster battery backpack wielding Strix Halo handheld we told you about in July, which you can see with the new SSD in the video atop this story.</p><div><p>OneNetbook’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHYmUXOap4U">upcoming OneXPlayer Super X hybrid laptop/tablet</a>, which has the same Strix Halo chip, is also now advertising a dedicated “card slot” for a mini SSD.</p></div><p>We don’t have any idea of pricing on these new SSDs, and have seen no product listings for them yet.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MzQz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Sean Hollister</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/759624/china-is-about-to-launch-ssds-so-small-you-insert-them-like-a-sim-card]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>Fresh off the release of his <a href="https://kotaku.com/war-of-the-worlds-amazon-prime-review-2000616263">horrifically received sci-fi movie <em>War of the Worlds</em></a>, Ice Cube is now helping <em>Minecraft</em> players in a new social media campaign that is at least a lot shorter than his recent film. Weirdly, he’s once again sitting in an office chair looking at a computer in this new ad.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/war-of-the-worlds-amazon-ad-drone-scene-horrible-bad-review-2000614752">Released last month on Amazon Prime, <em>War of the Worlds</em></a> was developed and filmed during the height of the pandemic, and it is very bad! It stars Ice Cube as a high-ranking NSA security guy who has to deal with an alien invasion. That sounds exciting, but the movie is shown entirely via computer screens, with Ice Cube struggling to act in front of a webcam for most of the movie’s brief 80-minute runtime. Anyway, now Ice Cube has a new role: helping players who have suffered in <em>Minecraft</em>. I think..? I’ll be honest, I’m not really following what’s going on in Xbox’s new <em>Minecraft</em> ad featuring the rapper and actor.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Cube's not here for sympathy, just the story.</p> <p>Send your Minecraft claims to <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CubeClaim?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#CubeClaim</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/icecube?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@icecube</a> may decide what happens next. <a href="https://t.co/X5uhVtBoDh">pic.twitter.com/X5uhVtBoDh</a></p> <p>— Minecraft (@Minecraft) <a href="https://twitter.com/Minecraft/status/1956023050039910927?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 14, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>On August 14, <a href="https://x.com/Minecraft/status/1956023050039910927">Xbox posted a new social media ad</a> starring Ice Cube as an insurance claims adjuster for the game <em>Minecraft</em>. Are you laughing yet? Well, the rest of the ad probably won’t help induce any giggles. The idea is that players can send Ice Cube (or perhaps a social media employee at Xbox using Cube’s Twitter handle) clips of them dying or getting hurt in <em>Minecraft</em>, and then he’ll respond with…I don’t know. This whole social media campaign is odd. Does one of the biggest games in the world, that just <a href="https://kotaku.com/minecraft-movie-review-bad-jack-black-kids-movie-steve-1851775345">spawned a mega-popular movie starring Jack Black</a>, <em>really</em> need more exposure on a dying platform like Twitter? I guess Xbox marketing execs think so.</p> <p>It does make me wonder, though; this is now the second acting role Ice Cube has taken where he just sits in a chair in front of a computer for most of the runtime. Perhaps this is a new request he has for all future roles? Maybe it’s stipulated in his contract? I get it. I like sitting too. And hey, at least this <em>Minecraft</em> ad is shorter and more exciting than <em>War of the Worlds.</em></p>
