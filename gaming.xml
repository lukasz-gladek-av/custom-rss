<figure><a title="Kirby Air Riders" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/bc3ddbdd5622f/kirby-air-riders.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Masahiro Sakurai's detailed rundown of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> finally brought us the news that we wanted with a deep dive into the game's City Trial mode.</p>
<p>Yes, the best mode from the GameCube original is returning for the Switch 2 sequel, and it looks just as high-octane and bonkers as we would have hoped.</p>
<p>The Direct introduced us to Skyah, the new hub world for this mode, which you'll have to speed around to collect and build the best machine that you can. This sandbox area looks substantially bigger than the one we know from the early 2000s, with several different zones like caves, volcanoes, oceans and more.</p><div><figure data-videoid="WA6pqBIEskk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4035aelukwgx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA6pqBIEskk" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>With the machine built (and the five-minute time limit up), it's off to the races in the Stadium events, which will put your build through its paces. Much like in the original, these events range from agility tests, to long-jump competitions, so there's something for every build.</p>
<p>Honestly, this was how we spent most of our time with Air Ride on the GameCube, so it'll be interesting to see whether bigger really does mean better when this one arrives on Switch 2.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-halo-3-odst-warbond</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/helldivers-2-halo-3-odst-collaboration-confirmed-in-latest-warbond.1273704/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony and Xbox have confirmed that the teased&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2 Halo 3: ODST&nbsp;</em>crossover is indeed real, and it's taking the form of the game's latest Warbond, which also happens to be its first "Legendary Warbond".</p>

<p>The crossover was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-halo-crossover-seemingly-teased" rel="nofollow">first teased</a> as part of a&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>trailer promoting the game's Xbox release, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-xbox-series-xs-august" rel="nofollow">set for next Tuesday</a>. Rather than a new map or an in-game event,&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em>'s&nbsp;<em>Halo 3: ODST&nbsp;</em>crossover will instead take the form of a Warbond.</p>

<p>That means you can expect new weapons, new armor and capes, and all the other good stuff that usually comes with a&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>Warbond, but as the "Legendary" designation suggests, Sony and Arrowhead reckon they're kicking it up a notch with this one.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/helldivers-2-halo-3-odst-warbond-armor.jpg?itok=2ZatJhGW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/helldivers-2-halo-3-odst-warbond-armor.jpg?itok=JR7IMNeW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Helldivers 2</em>'s new&nbsp;<em>Halo 3: ODST&nbsp;</em>Warbond brings lots of new&nbsp;<em>Halo</em>-themed gear to collect.</figcaption></figure><p>This Warbond comes complete with four weapons, and they should all be pretty familiar to&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>fans. The MA5C assault rifle is an iconic weapon that packs an ammo counter and a compass, while the M6C pistol boasts <i>Helldivers 2</i>'s first suppressor.</p>

<p>The M90A shotgun has a flashlight attached to it to help you see what you're shooting in darker areas, and the M7S SMG includes a suppressor you can't remove, so it's perfect for sneakier engagements (although it'll still rip enemies to shreds in a loud firefight).</p>

<p>Of course, it wouldn't be a&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>Warbond if there wasn't some armor to enjoy as well, and the&nbsp;<em>Halo 3: ODST&nbsp;</em>Warbond features two sets: the A-9 Helljumper and the A-35 Recon, both modeled after iconic&nbsp;<em>Halo 3: ODST&nbsp;</em>characters.</p>

<p>There's plenty more included as part of this Warbond as well, so make sure you check out the full announcement over on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/19/helldivers-2-x-halo-odst-legendary-warbond-arrives-august-26/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation Blog</a> if you want to see everything that's included.</p>




<p>The&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2 Halo 3: ODST&nbsp;</em>Warbond will be available on August 26th, which is the same day the game launches on Xbox Series X|S. It's also currently available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/553850/HELLDIVERS_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/helldivers-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and you can read <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/helldivers-2-review-fighting-for-managed-democracy" rel="nofollow">our review of it right here</a>.</p>

The name "Swords Of Legends" does not exactly cultivate intrigue. File it alongside Legendary Sword, Sword Legends, Legend of Sword, and Sword: Legends under "game titles that would put me to sleep even if I were being steadily electrocuted". Having visited the official site for Swords and watched the Chinese announcement trailer, I have come up with some alternative, vastly superior English titles: 1) My House Is Unaccountably Peckish, 2) Can I Play Football With This Boss's Detachable Head, 3) A Kingdom For My Horsebro, and 4) Did That Mountain Just Sideeye Me.</p><!--more-->

<p>
Developed by Aurogon Shanghai with Wangyuan Shengtang publishing, Sword Of Legends is the fourth main game in the Gujian series, which I'm not familiar with. Occasional Rock Paper Shotgun contributor Khee Hoon Chan has <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gujian-3-comes-close-to-being-the-final-fantasy-of-chinese-rpgs/">a PCGamer write-up</a> of the third one in which they describe it as "close to being the Final Fantasy of Chinese RPGs". As with Final Fantasy, the devs insist that you don't need to have played the other Gujian games to enjoy this one.
</p>
<p>
The new game is a premium (i.e. not free-to-play) single player action-<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> with an obvious Soulslike flow to its boss battles. You are an underworld enforcer who must "guide the departed" by kicking their heads in, whether attached or not. It's ceremonially described on the official site as "wide linear" - a mixture of story-led fights and sidequests that is neither as sprawling as an open world game, nor as suffocating as many Soulslikes. It's set, like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/black-myth-wukong-walkthrough">Black Myth: Wukong</a> and the more recent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wuchang-fallen-feathers">Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</a>, in a realm inspired by Chinese mythology and folklore.
</p><p>
As the aforesaid Stygian copper, your combat abilities range from combos, dodges and parries to capturing the souls of munsters and unleashing them against the next wayward phantom you encounter. There's a neat bit in the trailer when the player uses a companion creature's out-thrust spear as a springboard. Horseguy, you're so dependable! Not like those horsegirls in that viral gacha game the top brass keep telling me to write about.
</p>
<p>
I'd say I'm weary of action-RPGs inspired by Chinese myth, after Wuchang and Wukong, but that would be outright hypocrisy, given that I still knock back Tolkien-esque fantasies by the flagon. Besides, I've always wanted to be eaten by a house. It's probably the nearest I'll ever come to owning one. Swards Of Legumes doesn't have a release date yet, but there's a Q&amp;A with more details on <a href="https://www.swordsoflegends.com/?language=EN">the offical site</a>.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/kirby-air-riders-switch-2-release-date-nintendo-direct-trailer-2000618410</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kirby-air-riders-looks-like-way-more-than-just-another-switch-2-racing-game.1273695/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>A 45-minute deep-dive into <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-reveal-nintendo-direct-mario-donkey-kong-1851774194"><em>Kirby Air Riders</em></a> revealed all the ways it’s setting itself apart from other kart racers. While director Masahiro Sakurai started <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-direct-switch-2-kirby-air-riders-smash-bros-sakurai-2000618190">the latest Nintendo Direct</a> out by joking that his new Switch 2 exclusive is basically <a href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-free-roam-open-world-burnout-paradise-1851776569">just <em>Mario Kart</em></a>, everything that followed built the case for why it’s actually much more. What essentially amounted to a<em> Kirby Air Riders</em> Let’s Play starring the <em>Smash Bros.</em> director himself revealed new modes, mechanics, and the game’s release date.</p> <p>Kirby Air Riders will come to Switch 2 on November 22. In addition to the main racing mode, it’ll also feature a series of other contests from time trials to a destruction mode that looks an awful lot like <em>Twisted Meta</em>l. The menus and sound-effects look <a href="https://kotaku.com/smash-bros-sakurai-youtube-sequel-switch-2-1851678195">straight out of <em>Smash Bros. Ultimate</em></a>, including the win screen that shows characters applauding. The entire showcase even ended with a surprise reveal for what seems to be a new Kirby character that looks like Meta Knight if he were dragged out of an alternate, post-apocalyptic dimension.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Kirby Air Riders Direct – 19/08/2025" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Gn5c4RkoYAc?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>The main attraction in <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> is the Air Riders mode. While it’s structured much like the original GameCube release back in 2003, a second button has been added to the control scheme. In addition to pressing a button to drift around corners and building up boost, characters also have access to a special ability that can be unleash to speed up or attack other players. The courses are also bigger this time around to accommodate more racers, with an updated roster and vehicle garage for players to mix-and-match with.</p>

 <p>But the new City Trials mode is what looked far more interesting. Like <em>Mario Kart World</em> it drops you into a big sandbox where you drive around exploring and collecting power-ups. Random events than spawn that you can join to compete in with your upgraded vehicle. The challenges range from battles to gobbling up as much food on the map as possible. There are also mini-games reminiscent of hitting the sand bag in Smash Bros. with players aiming and flinging themselves at a wall of different scoring cubes to rack up points.</p> <p>Whether that’s all enough to make <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> feel like the big November release the Switch 2 deserves remains to be seen. It’ll arrive just a month after <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em>, and we still don’t know when<em> Metroid Prime 4</em> is coming out. Sakurai ended his stream saying that there’s still more to reveal in <em>Kirby Air Riders</em>, hinting at another Nintendo Direct coming sometime in the fall. In the meantime, it would be great to get the GameCube version on Switch Online.</p>

<p>Lost Soul Aside is finally approaching its launch after being delayed earlier this year, and the full list of trophies is now available.</p>



<p>Initially set to launch in May, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sonys-lost-soul-aside-release-date-delayed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lost Soul Aside was delayed in April</a> and pushed back to the end of August. No further delays have occured, however, so it’s almost time to jump right in.</p>



<p>If you’re ready to embark on the quest for full completion by gathering all trophies, we’ve got the complete list for you.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-lost-soul-aside-trophies">All Lost Soul Aside Trophies</h2>

<p><strong>Unlocking all trophies in Lost Soul Aside requires completing the base game, as well as gathering collectables, learning all skins, and crafting all items.</strong></p>

Enhancing and expanding upon <em>Kirby Air Ride</em>, originally released for the Nintendo <a title="Platforms > GameCube" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/gamecube">GameCube</a> system in 2003, this new game will now give players a roster of riders to choose from, each with their own distinct characteristics and abilities. In addition, there are new Air Ride machines, returning game modes, and new Special moves! <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> is fast-paced mayhem from Sora Ltd. and Bandai Namco Studios, Inc.</p><p>Read below for more about the features and gameplay spotlighted by Mr. Sakurai:</p><ul><li><strong>Riding Techniques</strong> – Each Air Ride machine, or “machine” for short, has different forms and traits. They usually hover above the ground and move forward automatically—no need to press any buttons or tilt the left Joy-Con 2 control stick forward to accelerate. Use the left stick to change direction by tilting it left or right. So, what do the buttons do?</li><li><strong>Boost Charge</strong> – By pressing the B Button, your machine will hit the ground, and you’ll start a Boost Charge and brake. Releasing the button activates a Boost Dash. As Mr. Sakurai explained, this is more than just a speed boost—by tilting the left stick and holding the Boost Charge button through sharp corners, you can perform drift maneuvers, which help you gain even more of a speed advantage.</li><li><strong>Specials</strong> – It takes more than speed and deft maneuvering to get ahead of the competition, however. The Y Button is your “Special button,” and it activates your character’s unique Special move. Attack your rival riders and enemies to fill up your Special Gauge and, once full, unleash your Special! While most characters have one distinct Special, Kirby has four different Special moves—one for each color Kirby you can play as. Combine certain Specials with attack techniques like Quick Spin, which is activated by wiggling the control stick, and you’ll be on your way to victory!</li><li><strong>Riders</strong> – <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> adds a strategic element to its mayhem by adding more importance to your choice of rider. Each rider in the game has their own unique traits which can impact their machine’s performance, including weight, durability, Specials, close range attacks and more. These factors can either give them an advantage or cause more unpredictability during the action depending on the environment you’re in. In fact, this is why Air Ride mode has you select your course first, then the rider and machine you want to use. In addition to the well-balanced pink puff, your roster of riders includes familiar faces from the world of Kirby, like <a title="Platforms > Meta [148 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/meta">Meta</a> Knight, King Dedede, Bandana Waddle Dee, as well as enemies in the Kirby series like Cappy, Chef Kawasaki, Starman and… well, you’ll just have to play and see who else shows up, won’t you? And to keep you moving forward and keep your opponents on their toes, <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> also lets you mix and match riders and machines.</li><li><strong>Machines</strong> – Air Ride machines are built for more than just speed! Each machine, like the riders, can even sustain different amounts of damage. Most machines will also glide through the air if you jump from a ramp or other structure, and you can control your machine by tilting the left stick up or down to ascend or descend. Make a perfect landing and you’ll be rewarded with more speed. You can also perform rail grinds, drifts and other maneuvers.</li><li><strong>Copy Abilities</strong> – To level the playing field, <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> gives all the riders the ability to inhale or capture to copy an enemy’s abilities. Use these newly acquired abilities to temporarily gain additional ways to attack or increase your speed.</li></ul></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->
        <div id="carousel_985185"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p>Mr. Sakurai also unveiled the returning game modes and experiences that await players in <em>Kirby Air Riders</em>, including City Trial mode, which he described as “the main event.” The mode from the original <em>Kirby Air Ride</em> returns, this time expanded and enhanced with more room to explore:</p><ul><li><strong>Skyah</strong> – City Trial is now located on a huge floating island called Skyah! Here, you’ll drive around freely collecting power-ups, attacking opponents to damage (and steal) their machines or cause them to drop power-ups you can then scoop up for yourself, all with the objective of upgrading your machine as much as possible. You start out with a small, weak machine, but through finding power-ups, attacking opponents and swapping to other machines, you can upgrade your ride. There are also random Field Events that occur throughout this phase. Some of these events pop up unexpectedly somewhere on the Skyah map, and you’ll need to hustle to that location to participate. Events include challenges like Short Race, where you’ll race through a sectioned-off area of the map, with power-ups awarded based on how you finish. There is also Dustup Derby, where the goal is to battle your opponents to knock them out and earn more power-ups. Be warned, these events may also involve the appearance of familiar bosses from the world of Kirby, including Kracko and Dyna Blade! This is only the first phase of the City Trial experience, and you’ll have five minutes of intense vehicle action to secure your machine and as many power-ups as you can. After that, it’s on to phase two…</li><li><strong>Stadiums</strong> – Take your powered-up machine to a Stadium and compete to be crowned the winner. Each Stadium includes a different challenge that players will strategically select based on the power-ups you or your opponents have gathered. Some Stadiums will even be recommended for you based on your machine’s stats, in case you have any trouble deciding which one to take on. In <em>Kirby Air Riders</em>, you can also battle friends via local wireless with up to eight players, or online with up to 16 players. Use GameChat to connect with your friends via video or voice chat to enhance the fun!</li></ul><p>In addition to City Trial, <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> features other returning modes with updated features, including …</p><ul><li><strong>Air Ride Mode</strong> – In this mode, up to six riders can compete to cross the finish line first. Attack opposing riders and by hitting them you’ll gain small stars that increase your speed. What makes this experience unique is that you’ll compete by getting speed boosts via attacking! So go ahead and cut loose on your rivals! You can also follow the Star Slide—you speed up by following behind other riders and collecting the trail of stars in their wake. These extra speed boosts will help you leave your opponents in the (star) dust.</li><li><strong>Lessons</strong> – With all the different riders, machines, techniques and game modes—you may want a little time to practice. The Lessons mode allows you to learn the basics of the game and try out some of the more advanced gameplay mechanics.<br>Plus, if you have a <a title="Platforms > Switch [17,528 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Nintendo Switch</a> Online membership then you’re in luck! Seven tracks from the <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> soundtrack—including the main theme with English language vocals—will be released on the <em><a title="Games > Nintendo Music [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/nintendo-music">Nintendo Music</a></em> app later today!</li></ul><p>And this is all just the beginning. Now that you’re up to speed on what awaits in <em>Kirby Air Riders</em>, there’s more news waiting in the wings, so please stay tuned for further updates.</p></blockquote><p>Watch an archive of today’s <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> Direct below.

                <p dir="ltr">Today, Nintendo released its next Nintendo Direct presentation focused solely on Kirby Air Riders, the next project from Super Smash Bros. creator Masahiro Sakurai. Before diving into the details on Kirby's next adventure, Sakurai gave a peek behind the development curtain with a particularly interesting line--he was worried a new Kirby Air Riders would be too much like Nintendo's other racing franchise, Mario Kart.</p><p dir="ltr">Sakurai made the comment during the beginning of the presentation, as he mentioned to both Nintendo corporate president Shinya Takahashi and then-president of HAL Laboratory Satoshi Mitsuhara that there are similarities between Air Riders and Mario Kart. As Sakurai himself said in the presentation, "OK, so it is basically Mario Kart."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtkHiB7WKf4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/QtkHiB7WKf4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">"I even mentioned this when I received the request to make the game," Sakurai said. "I asked them if they still wanted to do it, but as fans of the original know, the appeal of the game is actually not the races!"</p><p dir="ltr">The 45-minute deep dive into Kirby Air Riders revealed many details about the upcoming racer, including the characters and vehicles players will be racing with, as well as the floating island of Skyah that serves as the game's setting. Multiple modes, including City Trial with up to 16 players, were also detailed during the presentation.</p><p dir="ltr">Kirby Air Riders will launch exclusively on Nintendo Switch 2 on November 20.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Facing mounting pressure from lawmakers and a newly filed lawsuit by the state of Louisiana, Roblox recently issued a lengthy statement addressing what it calls “erroneous claims and misconceptions.” But reports suggest the Louisiana lawsuit is just the tip of what will eventually be a very large legal iceberg, as the platform faces rampant allegations that it has failed to protect the young people who make up the majority of its playerbase.</p><p dir="ltr">Roblox is a wildly popular game creation platform that hosts user-made games like Dress to Impress (which recently launched a collaboration with pop icon Lady Gaga), Grow a Garden, and Brookhaven. It sees tens of millions of daily active users (reported numbers vary between 82 and 111 million), and almost 40% of its playerbase is children under the age of 13. As such, it has faced intense scrutiny amid several reports (including a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-roblox-pedophile-problem/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">massive one published by Bloomberg last year</a>) that allege the platform does not do enough to protect children.</p><p dir="ltr">On August 15, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/roblox-is-not-doing-enough-to-protect-kids-lawmaker-says/1100-6533929/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">just days after California Congressman Ro Khanna said</a>, "Roblox is simply not doing enough to protect our kids, to inform parents, and to go after child predators,” the <a href="https://www.ag.state.la.us/Article/322" rel="nofollow ">state of Louisiana filed a lawsuit against the company</a>. The lawsuit, which was brought in the 21st Judicial District of Louisiana, alleges that Roblox:</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><em>Has and continues to facilitate the distribution of child sexual abuse material and the sexual exploitation of Louisiana’s children.</em></li><li dir="ltr"><em>Knowingly and intentionally fails to implement basic safety controls to protect child users from predators.</em></li><li dir="ltr"><em>Knowingly and intentionally fails to provide notice to parents and child users of its dangers.</em></li></ul><p dir="ltr">In October of last year, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/23/24277992/roblox-pre-teen-children-parent-accounts-default-settings" rel="nofollow ">Roblox introduced “parent accounts”</a> to the platform, which allow parents to manage their child’s account, including blocking people on their friends list. However, a recent petition demanding Roblox do more, statements from politicians like Khanna, and the Louisiana lawsuit all suggest these steps are not enough.</p><p dir="ltr">An<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/is-roblox-getting-worse/" rel="nofollow "> August</a><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/is-roblox-getting-worse/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> 18 Wired </a><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/is-roblox-getting-worse/" rel="nofollow ">report</a> says a group of law firms across the United States plans to file "a flood of lawsuits" in the near future, "all for clients who accuse the platform of allegedly facilitating the sexual exploitation of and grooming of their kids." One lawyer who spoke to Wired, Matt Dolman from Dolman Law Group, said his firm has "about 300 of these cases," and expects there to be over 1,000 lawsuits filed "by this time next year." Dolman said the majority of his Roblox clients are under the age of 16, and more than half are young girls.</p><p dir="ltr">There are already several lawsuits that have been filed against Roblox, including <a href="https://www.anapolweiss.com/john-doe-v-roblox-and-discord-jury-trial-demanded.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">one in Alabama</a> filed this past July after a 14-year-old girl allegedly met a predator on Roblox, began chatting with him on the messaging app Discord, and was reportedly abducted and assaulted. The lawsuit names both Roblox and Discord as defendants.</p><p dir="ltr">“Due to Roblox’s lack of safety protocols, it endangers the safety of the children of Louisiana. Roblox is overrun with harmful content and child predators because it prioritizes user growth, revenue, and profits over child safety. Every parent should be aware of the clear and present danger posed to their children by Roblox so they can prevent the unthinkable from ever happening in their own home,” said Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill in a statement that accompanied the Louisiana lawsuit filing.</p><p dir="ltr">That same day, <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/08/roblox-responds-to-louisiana-ag-lawsuit" rel="nofollow ">Roblox issued a lengthy statement on its website</a>, which begins with the caveat that the company does not usually comment on pending litigation, but wanted to “address erroneous claims and misconceptions about our platform, our commitment to safety, and our overall safety track record.”</p><p dir="ltr">The statement cites Roblox’s safety tools, which the company says it is “constantly innovating,” its “industry-leading stance on age-based communication,” its “suite of easy-to-use parental controls,” and past collaborations with law enforcement, among other things, as examples of its dedication to child safety.</p><p dir="ltr">“We aim to create one of the safest online environments for users, a goal not only core to our founding values but contrary to certain assertions, one we believe is critical to our long-term vision and success. We understand there is always more work to be done, and we are committed to making Roblox a safe and positive environment for all users,” the statement reads.</p><p dir="ltr">Dolman told Wired there is "a working group" of lawyers from several law firms who have already spoken to several clients accusing Roblox of failing to protect their children.</p><p dir="ltr">GameSpot has reached out to Roblox for comment.</p>

            <p>Nintendo has announced that Kirby Air Riders will release on 20th November. The game is an exclusive for the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, and is a sort of follow-up to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/kirby-air-ride">Kirby Air Ride</a>, a GameCube game from 2003 that has gained a cult following in the years since. The new game is being developed by Bandai Namco and Sora.</p>

<p>The Air Riders release date news came during the special 45-minute Nintendo Direct focused on the game. Kirby Air Riders is directed by Masahiro Sakurai. If that name sounds familiar, it's probably because he was the director of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-smash-bros-ultimate">Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</a> on Switch, and he created Kirby.</p>
<p>The original Kirby Air Ride was notoriously not loved by everyone. Leading UK games magazine, Edge, awarded the game a less than positive 3/10 rating back in issue 127. <a href="http://ign.com/">IGN.com</a> scored the game a similarly disappointing 5.2/10.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> latest update has given players plenty of new things to do, from grinding for new talismans to trying not to die to the new 9-star boss fights. But players on PC are still struggling with poor performance optimization, and Capcom now says no major fixes will be ready until the winter.</p> <p><span>“To our hunters playing <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> </span><span>on PC, we’re committed to listening to your feedback and improving both performance and stability of the game,” an update posted on X on August 18 <a href="https://x.com/monsterhunter/status/1957473035885121806">reads</a>. “Although we will continue to implement gradual improvements in the weeks ahead, we are targeting Free Title Update 4 this winter to implement a multifaceted plan, including CPU and GPU related optimizations, followed by a second stage of mitigation measures afterwards. We’ll share more information on the specifics in the future.”</span></p> <p>The response from fans so far has been less than stellar. “It’s not normal to wait one year to get at least a small optimization for PC players,” wrote one. “We are paying for stability and performance as the same time free updates. I have a war machine and i have to play everything on LOW hoping it’s going well.” Another posted, “Love MHWilds I really do, but waiting almost a year for the game to run at least a little better is a bit crazy.”</p>

 <p>Similar sentiments have been echoed across the game’s subreddit and recent Steam reviews where <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> still sits at just 25 percent, up from an all-time low earlier in the summer, but still far from where the overwhelmingly positive ratings other recent entries in the series sit. While not everyone’s facing issues, people on a range of machines are still reporting crashes, ugly textures, and unstable framerates even at 30fps.</p> <p>There’s currently a new Title Update 3 scheduled for September to add a new monster and more balance adjustments to combat and progression, followed by Title Update 4 in the winter. There’s also the game’s first expansion, which new <em>Monster Hunter</em> entries tend to get 12-18 months after they ship. It’ll be a make-or-break moment for the players on PC who feel like the last six months have been closer to an Early Access experience.</p>

<p>The Helldivers 2 collaboration with Halo ODST is confirmed to arrive on the same day as the Xbox launch in the form of a Legendary Warbond.</p>



<p>Initially released as a PlayStation and PC exclusive in February 2024, Helldivers 2 finally launches on Xbox Series X|S on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-does-helldivers-2-release-on-xbox-exact-release-date-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">August 26</a>, alongside a Halo-themed Legendary Warbond.</p>



<p>This marks the first Legendary Warbond to release in Helldivers 2, and while Halo has previously been a Microsoft exclusive, the Legendary Warbond is available on all platforms.</p>



<h2 id="h-helldivers-2-halo-odst-legendary-warbond-launches-august-26">Helldivers 2 Halo ODST Legendary Warbond Launches August 26</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Dropping in hot. Image via Arrowhead</figcaption></figure>



<p>As announced in the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/19/helldivers-2-x-halo-odst-legendary-warbond-arrives-august-26/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation blog</a>, the Helldivers 2 x Halo: ODST Legendary Warbond lands on August 26 at 5am PT/1pm BST.</p>



<p>The Warbond is packed full of rewards, with a price of 1500 Super Credits. While Arrowhead notes this is “a step up” from previous Warbond prices, it is “packed with gear worthy of the legend.”</p>



<p>In the Warbond, players can unlock two Armor Sets, three primary weapons and a pistol that Halo fans will instantly recognise, and Mean Green patterns for the FRV, Exo Suit, Shuttle, and Hellpod to provide a true Master Chief-inspired look.</p>



<p>Arrowhead adds that the Legendary Warbond is not compatible with the new Premium Warbond Token launching August 26, included in the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1042063885789827083/1044696485985517638/1407350534578372649" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Super Citizen Edition</a>, and advise making sure your Super Credits are locked and loaded if you want to unlock the content.</p>



<p>The Helldivers 2 x Halo: ODST collab continues the growing relationship between PlayStation and Xbox, which has seen Microsoft release first-party exclusives on the rival console, while PlayStation has started to reciprocate with Helldivers 2 and Black Myth: Wukong.</p>

                <p>Earlier this week, Nintendo revealed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pokemon-legends-z-a/" data-ref-id="5000-619901">Pokemon Legends Z-A</a> is getting <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-is-getting-four-player-battles/1100-6534031/" data-ref-id="1100-6534031">four-player battles</a> when it launches later this year. But if you're looking for a throwback fighting-game experience, the fan-made Pokemon: Close Combat has an update of its own. Since its launch in 2023, Close Combat has gradually increased its roster of fighting-type Pokemon. And now, the latest fighter has been added to Pokemon: Close Combat with a reveal trailer.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsHSilysdDg" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/PsHSilysdDg" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Marshadow isn't just a fighter, but also a ghost-type mythical Pokemon.

Marshadow is also equipped with a number of distance and close-quarters attacks that can overpower unsuspecting enemies.</p><p>The team behind Pokemon: Close Combat has also shared <a href="https://wiki.gbl.gg/w/Pokemon:_Close_Combat/Patch_Notes" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the latest patch notes for this update</a>. The gameplay tweaks primarily include quality-of-life adjustments as well as bug fixes.

Developers like Supermassive Games and GenVid technologies have put money where their mouth is, developing methods for players to make collaborative choices in games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Quarry</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Silent Hill Ascension</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> (</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.polygon.com/24054911/silent-hill-ascension-its-trauma-mug-t-shirt/">your mileage may vary</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> on how effective these systems were).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In any case, despite </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/amy-hennig-sees-a-social-future-for-storytelling-games">predictions</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> from leaders like Skydance co-president of new media Amy Hennig, collaborative choice-driven storytelling hasn't taken off. But just when that dream seemed dead, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Road 96</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> developer Digixart revealed a new trailer for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tides of Tomorrow </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">at the PlayStation State of Play in June. The sci-fi action adventure game comes with a fascinating narrative twist: not only do players make branching narrative choices that shape their journey, the consequences of those choices will filter out into the game sessions of other players via an online connection.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The system captures the payoff of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Twitch Plays Pokémon</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">-style collective input without frustrating players who wanted to go in another direction. Those choices will shape the next players' choices, which will shape the next players' choices, and so on and so forth. &nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/what-makes-ambrosia-sky-so-unique-game-developer-podcast-ep-52" target="_self" data-discover="true">What Makes Ambrosia Sky So Unique? - Game Developer Podcast Ep. 52</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The game also features a "ghost" system where players get short glimpses of other players navigating the same environment, a system made popular by the Dark Souls series and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Elden Ring</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">What does it take to create a system like this? According to Digixart producer Kevin Bard and game director Adam Michel, the team only conceived of the idea because they made </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Road 96</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and executing it is only possible thanks to a very methodical pre-production process.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="To make good storytelling mechanics, you need a story worth telling">To make good storytelling mechanics, you need a story worth telling</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In an interview, Bard and Michel stressed that Digixart's mission isn't just necessarily to experiment with narrative mechanics, it's to tell stories about themes directly tied to real-world conflicts. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Road 96</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was about escaping a totalitarian state, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tides in Tomorrow</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is set in an oceanic post-apocalypse brought about by climate change.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We wanted to do something about the climate crisis," said Michel. "That's what led to the weird setting of the game." He then explained that the seed of the multiplayer choice system was actually in a single-player system from </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Road 96</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which was a procedurally-driven game where players run for the border multiple times. When players finished a run, they could leave unused money behind to benefit their next run.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/shuhei-yoshida-devs-in-emerging-markets-can-soar-with-authentically-crafted-titles" target="_self" data-discover="true">Shuhei Yoshida: Devs in emerging markets can soar with 'authentically crafted' titles</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It was all single-player, but it sparked an idea which was 'what if it was not just yourself, but several different players following each other and playing one after the other, doing stuff for the next person?'" he said. (Michel did clarify he joined the team after many of these choices were made).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That's where the pre-production process took over. The earliest version of this system was built in what Bard called a "prototext" (riffing on "prototype" in Unreal Engine). Digixart developers used this system to test choices and branching trees and how the consequences could filter to other game sessions, identifying what kind of choices were worth implementing, and others weren't.</span></p><p>Image via Digixart/THQ Nordic.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The prototext generated quantitative data how often asynchronous choices would trigger in another player's session, and the team asked players to assess if if their runs were "enjoyable" and "clearly understandable." The choices that ranked highest sailed into production, the ones that didn't sank to the bottom of the ocean.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bard said that Iterating on story choices, characters, and plot beats was "kind of the easiest" part. The trickiest part as production progressed was that players still to this day don't always understand how the asynchronous mechanics are impacting their games. "Some players never really understood. They were like 'okay, I see ghosts, I'm confused,'" he said, alluding to the "ghost" system showing brief snippets of of other players' game sessions."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/trump-funding-cuts-devastate-video-game-research-and-development" target="_self" data-discover="true">Trump funding cuts 'devastate' video game research and development</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Addressing that confusion required iterating on the UX design, like taking lessons from online role-playing games and having other players' names float over their heads when they appear in the game. "We're still iterating on that up until launch."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Another bit of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Road 96</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> inspiration that's also helped Digixart communicate the system to players: end-of-level choice rundowns. These were first made popular with Telltale Games' choice-driven adventure games that let players see what percentage of players made the same choices (before the company </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/game-platforms/telltale-games-initiates-majority-studio-closure-">went under</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, then </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/revived-telltale-games-nets-8-million-to-bring-first-titles-to-market">revived</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">). In </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tides of Tomorrow</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> those pages add in data about how other players' choices affected their run, and how their choices will impact other players.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Of course there's also old-fashioned marketing. The pair were transparent that the first trailer for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/yVjNGNZcqHQ?si=l4x1735CTl_lX9am">Tides of Tomorrow</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> didn't lay out that there was a multiplayer system at work—the ghosts look like they could appear in a single-player game too. The launch date trailer from June </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/43RMfZzY-M4?si=fqlbHU1nA-Ace64D">hammers that concept home</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The value of extensive pre-production">The value of extensive pre-production</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Do game developers invest enough in pre-production? Depends who you ask. So much time has to go into the vertical slice or demo that goes in front of investors and publishers that by the time production is greenlit, it's questionable how much time the studio's had to plan out what the next few years of their life will look like.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"A good pre-production process for me is one where you don't have any remaining questions [afterward]," said Bard. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tides of Tomorrow</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s pre-production was entirely focused on laying the groundwork for technical systems like first-person animation, boat physics, and online networking. It wasn't just a question of "does this work," it was also a question of "is this worth it?"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bard explained that Digixart successfully prototyped a system where players could seamlessly travel from island to island without any in-game loading screens. "But then it was like—why the effort?", said Bard. They ditched that plan and went back to an fashioned loading screen. "That's way simpler and we can focus on what really matters."</span></p><p>Image via Digixart/THQ Nordic.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The unique selling point of the game is clearly the asynchronous system and the asynchronous story, so of course we simplified some stuff during the production to be 100% focused on that," added Michel.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">All of this testing and iteration took place on one singular level, so that the team wouldn't rush into making too much content too fast that could be scrapped after production-led gameplay changes. Once the studio entered production, it immediately blocked out all the levels to act as a "skeleton" for the game. Now the team has a framework to anchor story elements—and asynchronous choices—around.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Michel and Bard were transparent that even after all this work, some playtesters don't fully understand or even want to engage in the asynchronous choice system. They also face one untestable hurdle: what will happen when this system is dropped in front of millions of players shaping the flow of choices across different sessions? That question may mean experimental multiplayer system won't be "done" until after the game launches.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bard said the best way to make sure the system works is to make sure the story on top of it is as compelling as possible."If you have a good story, if you have in the interesting characters [and] engaging stuff going on...no matter what crazy concept you have around it, they will still have a good time if the story is good."</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.

Ahead of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>'s arrival on Xbox Series X/S next week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/arrowhead-game-studios">Arrowhead Game Studios</a> has revealed a Halo-themed Legendary Warbond - featuring a range of familiar equipment - that's heading to PS5 and PC too.
</p>
<p>
Officially titled the Helldivers 2 x Halo: ODST Legendary Warbond (technically ODST stands for Orbital Drop Shock Troopers, but this is being jokingly reframed as Obedient Democracy Support Troopers in Helldivers 2), it launches alongside the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-is-coming-to-xbox-series-xs-in-august-as-first-sony-published-game-on-the-platform">game's Xbox release on 26th August</a>.

<p>
Legendary Warbonds cost 1,500 Super Credits (which can be found in-game or purchased with real money) and contain rewards gradually unlocked by playing. The crucial bit, though, is that Warbonds aren't time-limited, meaning players can unlock everything at their own pace. Here's what's included in the Halo: ODST Legendary Warbond, as per today's announcement:
</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>Helldivers 2 x Halo: ODST Weapons</strong>
<ul>
<li>MA5C Assault Rifle – An iconic rifle; the definition of reliable and having taken down countless aliens bent on wiping out humanity, it is time to turn its sights on enemies of Managed Democracy. It comes equipped with the convenient ammo counter and a built-in compass – let it guide you to victory.</li>
<li>M7S SMG – Silent and deadly, with caseless ammo and a non-removable suppressor; this weapon is ready to spread Freedom to every corner of the galaxy.</li>
<li>M90A Shotgun – This powerful shotgun carries a kick and has a handy flashlight mounted on it so you can see the fear in your enemies' eyes before you teach them a valuable lesson about Liberty.</li>
<li>M6C/SOCOM Pistol – They say keep your friends close and your sidearm closer. Well, we say that. The standard-issue ODST sidearm is your silent ally in the field – equipped with a built-in laser sight, flashlight, and, for the first time in Helldivers 2, a suppressor to support stealth gameplay. Because sometimes the best way to enforce Peace is quietly...</li>
</ul>
<strong>Helldivers 2 x Halo: ODST Armor</strong>
<ul>
<li>A-9 Helljumper – Debuted during the New Mombasa Armor Show, this sleek ensemble is sure to turn heads and blow minds.</li>
<li>A-35 Recon – Made famous by the Ministry of Intelligence's hide-and-seek-and-destroy champion of '52, this armor has been improved by removing excess shoulder protection.</li>
<li>Feet First Armor Passive – Applied to both the above armor sets, this passive allows your Helldiver Helljumper to make less noise when moving, become immune to leg injuries, and increases the range of discovering points of interest by 30 percent.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Helldivers 2 x Halo: ODST Capes and More</strong>
<ul>
<li>Honored Heirloom Cape – Should the wearer of this cape perish at the hands of Freedom’s enemies, it is customary to pass the cape on to their bravest child during the funeral, inspiring the next generation to take up arms.</li>
<li>Eye of the Clandestine Cape  – Those who serve Liberty from the shadows often elect to stay anonymous, moving like traceless spectres through the night. May they watch over us always.</li>
<li>More! – The Warbond will also include ODST-themed player cards, a new player title, "Rookie", and new vehicle pattern in a very familiar color known as Mean Green.</li>
</ul>

		<p>Manticore Games has released a new gameplay trailer for Out of Time, the anachronistic co-op roguelike shooter that is set to launch on 25th September, exclusively on the Epic Games Store for PC.</p>
<p><iframe title="Out of Time Official Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/S8Iisl6CU6k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Time and reality have been broken in Out of Time by an event known as The Shattering, blending anything and everything together in a mad mish-mash of periods, themes and technology. Depending on the different properties of each roguelike, you could be battling dragons, killer robots or mutant crabs, using medieval swords, plasma cannons, or riding dinosaurs.</p>
<p>There’s a whopping 24 characters to choose to play as, going from the Cyber Medic Yasmine, who features angel wings, to the purple skinned druid Talyndra, mobster Ming, and just a plain ol’ lumberjack named Freya. Each has specific starting abilities, weapons and skills, but comes without a defined class, so you’re free to customise beyond that. You will be pushed to co-operate though, as the game will push you to stay together beyond having complimentary abilities by a tethering system that shares healing and buffs between you.</p>

<p>There’s a shared space called Infinitopia before you head out on each run, with the game worlds taking you to various biomes and the promise that seasonal updates will evolve and change each space.</p>

<p>More specifically, <strong>22nd March 2026</strong> marks the 30th anniversary of the original Resident Evil on PS1. We're unsure what Capcom has in store for us to celebrate the milestone, but the website has a section marked 'Coming Soon' toward the bottom, so chances are the publisher has some big plans.</p>
<p>We do know one thing, however. 27th February 2026 will see the release of the latest mainline entry: <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/resident_evil_requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a>. Currently, the title is not scheduled to launch on Switch 2, but given how much Capcom has supported the Switch over the years, we're not prepared to completely rule it out.</p>
<p>Otherwise, that's about it for now! We'll leave you with a look at two logos for the upcoming 30th anniversary; one designed to look like an archway encompassing the Umbrella logo, and the other quite literally depicting a raccoon wearing 30th anniversary shades. Badass.</p>

<p>Capcom recently provided updated sales figures for its best-selling titles, with half of the top ten games being Resident Evil titles. The best-selling of all time is currently <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_2_-_cloud_version">Resident Evil 2</a> remake, which is available on Switch as a Cloud download.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-optimizations-winter</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-optimizations-coming-in-winter-capcom-promises.1273599/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Capcom has revealed that PC optimizations are on their way to&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>later this year, likely in an attempt to combat the negative feedback the game has been receiving for its PC version in recent months.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/monsterhunter/status/1957473035885121806" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> on social media, Capcom says that Title Update 4, which is on the way this winter (but which won't be the game's next major update, with Title Update 3 still yet to arrive), will bring "CPU and GPU related optimizations".</p>

<p>This round of improvements will be followed by "a second stage of mitigation measures afterwards". It's all part of what the developer and publisher calls a "multifaceted plan" to improve&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>' PC performance.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-optimizations-winter-birds.jpg?itok=Qa2QenZK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-optimizations-winter-birds.jpg?itok=-iLU-It7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Presumably because the PC port could give up at any minute.</figcaption></figure><p>Capcom says it'll share more specifics about the optimizations in question "in the future", and that "gradual improvements" will also be implemented in the weeks ahead as part of other updates.</p>

<p>Just in case you need a reminder,&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>&nbsp;launched back in February to a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-8m" rel="nofollow">pretty rapturous</a> (or perhaps that should be "raptor"ous) sales <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-steam-player-record" rel="nofollow">reception</a>, but players bemoaned its PC performance, with many reporting serious issues even on high-end machines.</p>

<p>In the last couple of months, those criticisms have become even louder, with&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>dipping to a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246340/Monster_Hunter_Wilds/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Mostly Negative rating</a> on Steam. A quick glance at the negative reviews accruing on the game's page shows that PC performance is still a huge point of contention.</p>

<p>Still, there's reason to be optimistic that Capcom will fix&nbsp;<em>Wilds</em>' PC problems. Another big problem players brought up was the game's lack of endgame content, and Capcom <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-update-1021-patch-notes" rel="nofollow">recently released an update</a> to address that issue, so hopefully, Title Update 4 will do the same for players' PC woes.</p>

Dubbed the Sega Villains Stage, details are still pretty light on the DLC, but Sonic the Hedgehog's Dr. Eggman is set to appear as a boss fight. Alongside that, protagonist Joe Musashi will have two other guest villains to take on, though they are yet to be revealed. If you're picking up the digital deluxe edition of Shinobi: Art of Vengeance, you'll automatically unlock it whenever the DLC does arrive next year.</p><p dir="ltr">Sega also announced that Young Dirty Bastard (YDB), i.e. the son of the late Ol' Dirty Bastard from Wu-Tang Clan, is releasing a song called The Path Has Just Begun inspired by the Shinobi series. It'll be released on streaming services this week, August 21, and you can expect a new trailer for the game on the same day.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Shinobi: Art of Vengeance - Announcement Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Shinobi: Art of Vengeance was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sega-announces-new-jet-set-radio-crazy-taxi-and-more-long-awaited-sequels/1100-6519798/" data-ref-id="1100-6519798">teased back at The Game Awards in 2023</a> before getting a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sega-reveals-new-shinobi-game-art-of-vengance-during-february-2025s-state-of-play/1100-6529458/" data-ref-id="1100-6529458">proper reveal earlier this year</a>, bringing the series back to its roots with 2D action-platforming. It's also the first new game in the series since 2011's Shinobi 3D, a 3DS title that received average reviews at the time. This new Shinobi game comes as part of a broader move by Sega to bring back some of its legacy titles that haven't received a new entry in many years, like Jet Set Radio and Crazy Taxi. A movie adaptation of the Shinobi series is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/classic-sega-arcade-game-lands-director-for-a-new-movie/1100-6527028/">also in the works</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">You'll be able to pick up Shinobi: Art of Vengeance on PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC when it launches on August 29.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 | Official Cinematic Teaser Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Another reputable insider, <a href="https://x.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/1957613059356217831" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">TheGhostOfHope</a>, said on social media that "it's not jetpacks lol." Instead, what's seen in the video is a "mega jump upgrade from the campaign," apparently.</p><p>The original video <a href="https://x.com/tu_nikal_/status/1957655348481012029" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">remains online if you know where to look.</a></p><p>More details about Black Ops 7 should be announced during Gamescom Opening Night Live today beginning at 11 AM PT / 2 PM ET. Some of the surprises may have been spoiled already, though, including this gameplay video and the game's reported price and release date. According to reliable source <a href="https://x.com/billbil_kun/status/1957017550044168449" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">billbil-kun</a>, the game will be priced at $70 for its standard edition and will launch on November 14.</p><p>The price being below $70 is not a surprise, as Microsoft <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-u-turns-on-80-xbox-games/1100-6533374/" data-ref-id="1100-6533374">already did a U-turn on its plans to charge $80 for games this year.</a> Like Black Ops 6 in 2024, Black Ops 7 will be available at launch on Xbox Game Pass.</p><p>Black Ops 7's development is being led by Raven Software and Treyarch, the same two co-lead developers on last year's Black Ops 6. This is the first time ever that Activision is releasing Black Ops games in consecutive years.</p><p>Recently, a report said Black Ops 7's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-will-blend-the-campaign-and-multiplayer-like-never-before-report/1100-6533962/" data-ref-id="1100-6533962">final campaign mission will morph into a 32-player extraction-style multiplayer mode.</a></p><p>If the rumored November 14 release date for Black Ops 7 is real, that's about a month after EA's highly anticipated Battlefield 6 is set to launch on October 10. The game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6526583/" data-ref-id="1100-6526583">just wrapped up its second and final open beta test</a>, and it was hugely popular.</p>

<p>Black Myth: Wukong is finally poised to make a debut on Xbox, which means there are a bunch of achievements to grind towards. Here, we’ve got details of them all.</p>



<p>Releasing on Xbox on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-wukong-coming-to-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">August 20</a>, albeit <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-black-myth-wukong-coming-to-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not on the Xbox Game Pass service</a>, it’s been a long year of waiting for the title that was previously a PlayStation console timed-exclusive, but there’s still every reason to be excited.</p>



<p>If you’re planning on working your way through Black Myth: Wukong to gather every achievement and secure all the Gamerscore available, we’ve got the complete list for you.</p>

<p><strong>Black Myth: Wukong’s list of achievements will have you ticking off challenges of every type, though the descriptions can be rather mysterious.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The majority of Black Myth: Wukong achievements are secret, and the description won’t show unless manually revealed. Therefore, spoilers follow here.</strong></p>



<p>Unlike many other games, however, revealing the description of the secret achievements doesn’t necessarily make them spoiled, as the riddles will keep you on your toes. </p>

                <p>In November, the Xbox Series X|S console will have been around for five years. Naturally, there has been talk about the next generation of Xbox consoles, and Microsoft recently spoke about what it envisions for its future hardware and its idea of a player-first environment that will follow players across multiple devices.</p><p>Speaking on the Official Xbox Podcast, Next Generation at Xbox VP Jason Ronald explained how the company is looking to evolve the Xbox ecosystem across multiple devices in the future. "When we think about the future of the Xbox, we're really focused on how do we put the player at the center of the experience, and when you really look at how modern players play games today, the vast majority play across multiple different devices," Ronald said.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biXDUvQByBw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/biXDUvQByBw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>According to the VP, Microsoft envisions players having options like the Xbox ROG Ally for when they're on the move, and dedicated hardware when they come home that'll allow them to pick up from right where they left off.</p><p>"So what we're really focused on is how do we evolve the Xbox ecosystem to allow players to play the games wherever you want to play them, while at the same time, we're continuing to build dedicated devices that are optimized for gaming, like the Xbox Ally or next-generation console," Ronald said. "So it's really just focused on how players like playing games in the current environment and just designing and building a platform with them at the center."</p><p>So far, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-president-shares-new-details-on-next-gen-xbox-console/1100-6532502/">what we do know about the next-gen Xbox</a> is that it'll be powered by AMD technology, which Microsoft says will be able to allow for a "deeper level of visual quality" with "immersive gameplay" that's "enhanced" with the power of AI. The company also hinted at games not being "locked to a single store" or only supported on a single device, and in February, Xbox president Sarah Bond said the in-development console will offer the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-talks-next-gen-hardware-teases-new-console-controller-for-this-fall/1100-6521133/">"largest technical leap you will have ever seen in a hardware generation."</a></p><p>On the handheld side, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rog-xbox-ally-x-impressions-green-with-envy/1100-6532506/">the Xbox ROG Ally will launch during the holiday season</a> and there'll be two models to choose from. The ROG Xbox Ally X has a black color scheme and is equipped with an AMD Ryzen AI Z2 Extreme chipset, 24GB RAM, and a 1TB SSD, while the base model ROG Xbox Ally is white and has an AMD Ryzen Z2A chipset, 16GB RAM, and a 512GB SSD. Pricing for these units haven't been officially revealed yet, but recent leaks claim that the premium "X" model could cost as much as $1,050, while the ROG Xbox Ally is rumored to be $699.</p>

It's been a busy couple of week in Nintendo presentation land. First we had that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-in-todays-nintendo-direct-partner-showcase">third-party-focused partner showcase</a>, then it was the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendos-indie-world-showcase-heres-everything-announced">turn of the indies</a>, leaving everyone to speculate that a proper Direct showcase much <em>surely</em> be on the way. And, well, here we are, sort of. Today's 45-minute Direct is apparently focused exclusively on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a>'s upcoming Kirby Air Riders - and if that appeals, here's where you'll be able to watch it unfold.
</p>
<p>
Nintendo's Kirby Air Riders Direct officially gets underway today, 19th August, at 2pm BST. That's 3pm CEST for our European chums, and 6am PDT/9am EDT/7am MDT/8am CDT for anyone over in the US. And, yes, you did read that right earlier; Nintendo has confirmed we're in for a full 45 minutes focused entirely on Kirby Air Riders - which seems like a lot considering it managed to squeeze its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> Direct into less than 18 minutes.

<p>
As you might expect, today's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn5c4RkoYAc">Kirby Air Riders Direct airs on YouTube</a> and promises an "in-depth look" at the game, as presented by its director, the legendary Masahiro Sakurai - who also created its underrated 2003 predecessor <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/kirby-air-ride">Kirby Air Ride</a>, alongside the considerably more fondly remembered Smash Bros. series.
</p>
<p>

And if you need a reminder, all we've seen of Kirby Air Riders so far is its announcement trailer from back in April, which you can watch below while we await today's full Direct reveal.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Gaming mental health charity Safe In Our World has launched the Mental Health Star Accreditation, an industry-first method to help gaming industry companies and studios shore up their efforts when it comes to employee mental health.</p>

<p>As revealed in a press release, the Mental Health Star Accreditation is "designed to provide companies with the opportunity to achieve a mark of excellence in workplace wellbeing", something that's sorely needed in today's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/spiders-layoffs" rel="nofollow">uncertain</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/supermassive-games-layoffs-directive-8020-delayed" rel="nofollow">volatile</a>, and often <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-revenue-up-microsoft-2025" rel="nofollow">seemingly cruel</a> industry.</p>

<p>If a company chooses to undergo the process of accreditation, it will first be audited by Safe In Our World; the charity says it'll carry out a "company-wide audit of mental health policies, practices, culture, and sentiment".</p>

<p>If a company successfully completes the accreditation, they'll be awarded with one of three tiers: Dedicated, Accomplished, or Outstanding, depending on how satisfied Safe In Our World is with the company's performance.</p>

<p>Each accreditation lasts three years and comes complete with "annual check-ins and support" from the charity, as well as badges and other media assets for companies to display on their platforms to show off their achievement.</p>

<p>Companies that don't succeed in attaining the accreditation will be provided with a "thorough and detailed report" regarding why they didn't make the cut, as well as "practical advice and resources to aid improvement". They'll also be able to re-apply whenever they like.</p>




<p>Mental health remains a serious issue when it comes to the gaming industry, especially when <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/latest-microsoft-layoff-wave-king-zenimax" rel="nofollow">even employees of massive gaming corporations</a> could find themselves in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/respawn-layoffs-ea-cuts-titanfall-game" rel="nofollow">layoff firing line</a> with very little warning.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see whether the Mental Health Star Accreditation is adopted en masse by the industry, but if you ask me, it's a much-needed step in the right direction for protecting employee mental health. Stay tuned for more.</p>
