<p>The reviews are now rolling in, and so we've put together this round up. If you're still not sure whether or not to upgrade your existing copy, or if it's worth finally taking a look at the latest entry, this might help you decide. So, first up, our review – we gave this upgraded package an "excellent" <strong>9/10</strong> stars:</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067wmuohp&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Super Mario Party Jamboree - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV gives an already fantastic party game a huge shot in the arm, with a bunch of brilliant Mouse Mode and mic-based games that also allow you to see your big silly face as you play. It's all very knockabout, very easy to use, and very easy to enjoy."</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:184958 @ 1753324204 -->
<p>What did other outlets have to say then? Starting the party with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-jamboree-tv-review">IGN</a>, this outlet awarded the Switch 2 package <strong>7/10</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Super Mario Party Jamboree itself is still fantastic, but the mixed new content of the Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV re-release adds frustrating limitations and strange design decisions to what was otherwise a polished, customizable experience."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/mario-party-jamboree-switch-2/">VGC</a> gave it <strong>4/5</strong> stars, noting how this upgrade elevates what's already one of the best series entries:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"By itself, then, Jamboree TV is a bit of an uneven expansion. However, Switch 2 does power some genuinely great new mini-games and, when it works (and if you own one), camera support does elevate the general experience, making this almost by default the definitive version of one of the best Mario Party games. Whether that’s worth the $20 / £17 upgrade, however, is very much dependent on your personal affection for the series."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.polygon.com/review/615084/super-mario-party-jamboree-tv-switch-2-edition">Polygon</a> labelled it the Switch 2's best tech demo yet, even though it labelled the upgrade as "falling on the inessential side":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The upgrade winds up falling on the inessential side – especially since it misses a chance to add some new maps or characters – but the full package is one of the Switch 2’s smartest value propositions at present. <em>Super Mario Party Jamboree</em> now stands as a robust party game that makes up for its shortcomings in sheer variety."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.vooks.net/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-jamboree-tv-review/">Vooks</a> scored it <strong>3/5</strong> stars, describing it as one for "superfans":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Mario Party superfans will enjoy the new modes for the main board games, but the Jamboree TV additions—aside from the mouse games—are a bit average. <em>Jamboree</em> was a solid and complete package, and this just splits it all up and breaks the flow."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And <a href="https://www.siliconera.com/review-super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-jamboree-tv-is-perfectly-fine/">Siliconera</a> said this update was "perfectly fine", awarding it <strong>8/10</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<em>Super</em> <em>Mario Party Jamboree</em> remains a solid game... <em>Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV</em> is a natural pick-up for families. If someone is in a home with multiple players who own both Switch or Switch 2 systems, it could be great for game nights. However, if you’re going to go with one Switch or Switch 2 system for a group session or plan to play only online... you might be fine sticking with the original game."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Super Mario Party Jamboree - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV will launch next week on <strong>24th July 2025</strong>.</p>

He spent 15 years editing the likes of CNET, Gizmodo, and Engadget.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/21578775/lego-nintendo-game-boy-fan-model-nick-lever-masters">We asked for the perfect Lego Nintendo Game Boy</a>… did Lego deliver? After <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/9/24339971/nintendo-game-boy-lego-release-date-october-2025">revealing this January</a> that it would take up the challenge, it has revealed a most impressive take on the 1989 classic that’ll cost a relatively reasonable $60 in the US. <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;mid=13923&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-us%2Fproduct%2Fgame-boy-72046" rel="sponsored">It’s already up for pre-order today</a> for an October 1st ship date. At 3.5 inches (14cm) wide and 5.5 inches (9cm) tall, it looks like it’ll have the same dimensions as the original.</p><p>As you’ll see in the many images below, this Game Boy doesn’t <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21578775/lego-nintendo-game-boy-fan-model-nick-lever-masters">rely on miniature hats</a> for its iconic fuchsia A and B buttons — Lego has seemingly created pitch-perfect buttons that appear to recess into the frame. The console’s curves are also captured remarkably well!</p><p>And unless I’m very much mistaken, it comes with <em>printed</em> tiles rather than sticker labels to help replicate the Game Boy’s many, many iconic labels for its buttons, volume dial, on-off switch, “Dot Matrix With Stereo Sound” highlight, as well as larger features like the Game Boy’s mono speaker grille, battery compartment latch, and serial number around back that have proven difficult to emulate in bricks. (That serial number has an easter egg, by the way.)</p><div><p><cite>GIF by The Verge / video by Nintendo</cite></p></div><p>But perhaps best of all, this Lego Game Boy can show off actual scenes from the classic games using swappable lenticular lenses that’ll show you different images when viewed from different angles. You can pop in a brick-built cartridge of <em>The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening </em>or <em>Super Mario Land</em>, and “watch” the classic Nintendo logo drop as you rotate the screen downwards (you’ll have to imagine <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hz2QPBkDkFc">the Game Boy’s da-DING beep</a>). Or, pop in a different lenticular lens to see Link cozy up to Marin on the beach in <em>Awakening</em>’s most bittersweet scene:</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/14/24073412/i-built-that-lego-game-boy-and-now-its-even-better">I built Nick Lever’s fan-designed Lego Game Boy myself</a>, and have the real deal that plays actual cartridges too, but I’m going to be mighty tempted to pick up the official Lego one as well. If those buttons move when you push them, I doubt I’ll resist! Do wish it came with <em>Tetris</em>, too, though.</p><div><p>Lego and Nintendo have also recreated part of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3eYc6dMOhw">the original US Game Boy commercial</a> using the set. It’s <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DMeI3BwtTje/">on Instagram</a>, and you may be able to play it (with a tap) in its embedded form below.</p></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MzQz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Sean Hollister</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/712786/here-is-legos-official-nintendo-game-boy-with-lenticular-display]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Are you curious about how long it takes to beat <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/wuchang-fallen-feathers/" data-ref-id="5000-538251"><strong>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</strong></a>? The campaign itself is long and arduous, filled with numerous challenges that serve to test your skills. If you're patient, then you might just reach the game's conclusion.</p><h2>How long to beat Wuchang: Fallen Feathers - Campaign length guide</h2><p>If you're ready to dive straight into a dark fantasy adventure in Ming Dynasty China, then you need to allot enough time for the campaign. On average, it should take you <strong>roughly 25 to 35 hours</strong> to beat Wuchang: Fallen Feathers on your first try. Granted, this is primarily if you just focus on the main objectives, but we also take character deaths into consideration given the challenge presented by numerous bosses.</p><p>If you want to tackle optional content, then you might spend anywhere from <strong>40 to 50 hours</strong> as you explore every nook and cranny. Of course, there's also New Game+ mode, a staple among soulslike games, which further increases your playtime.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4537178-wuchang-fallen-feathers-how-long-to-beat-campaign-length-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4537178" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4537178-wuchang-fallen-feathers-how-long-to-beat-campaign-length-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4537178"></a><figcaption>Bosses like Commander Honglan will probably kick your butt and put an end to your speedrunning goals.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4537178-wuchang-fallen-feathers-how-long-to-beat-campaign-length-1.jpg"></figure><h3>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers campaign structure</h3><p>As far as beating Wuchang: Fallen Feathers' campaign goes, you might be wondering about the structure or presentation itself. Here's a quick summary that's fairly light on spoilers:</p><ul><li>The initial area, Worship's Rise, consists of several sprawling areas. These include Reverent Temple, Shu Sanctum, Tang Palace, and various caverns and villages.</li><li>Upon finishing the key objectives, you can head to a junction point. One path leads to the snow-capped peaks of Cloudspire, while another takes you to the temples and pavilions of Mount Zhenwu.</li><li>Naturally, there are other locations, but we don't want to spoil you with all the details here.</li><li>All of these areas are crawling with insidious enemies and ferocious bosses. Needless to say, your speed of completion will depend on the viability of your build and weapons, as well as your overall skill when it comes to soulslike action.</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4537179-wuchang-fallen-feathers-how-long-to-beat-campaign-length-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4537179" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4537179-wuchang-fallen-feathers-how-long-to-beat-campaign-length-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4537179"></a><figcaption>There are various areas to explore and some have hidden secrets, too.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4537179-wuchang-fallen-feathers-how-long-to-beat-campaign-length-2.jpg"></figure><h3>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers additional objectives</h3><p>Generally speaking, progression normally entails defeating enemies/bosses, leveling up using Red Mercury, and buying/upgrading your gear. That said, there are other activities that you can tackle while you're exploring distant lands, such as:</p><ul><li><strong>Wu Gang items</strong> - You can gather valuables to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/wuchang-fallen-feathers-wu-gang-items-guide/2900-6788/" data-ref-id="2900-6788"><strong>unlock new items for Wu Gang</strong></a>, a vendor NPC in your hub.</li><li><strong>Echoes of the Past</strong> - There are points-of-interest that grant rewards if you <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/wuchang-fallen-feathers-emote-faces-of-the-past/2900-6787/" data-ref-id="2900-6787"><strong>pick the right emote</strong></a>.</li><li><strong>NPC quests</strong> - Some NPCs have quest chains, though they tend to be cryptic regarding clues. And, yes, you might be able to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wuchang-fallen-feathers-summon-companions-bone-whistle/1100-6533363/" data-ref-id="1100-6533363"><strong>summon companions</strong></a>, too.</li><li><strong>Giant Panda Bamboo Shoots</strong> - Little Bamboo Shoots run around when they spot you. Collect and exchange these with the Giant Panda NPC.</li><li><strong>Optional locations</strong> - There are certain areas that you won't visit as part of the main story, but you can reach them if you're keen on exploring.</li></ul><p>That does it for our guide on how long it takes to beat Wuchang: Fallen Feathers. Other activities are a given when playing soulslike games, such as obtaining all weapons, armors, and spells, so you can expect to add more hours if you're a completionist. Last but not least, completing the story lets you start New Game+ mode. You keep all sorts of goodies, and you get to experience the whole thing all over again.</p><p>Many dangers await you as you venture forth in Sichuan Province during the fall of the Ming Dynasty.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">A multiversal first look at five different versions of the famous webslinger.</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Back in March we got to reveal Magic: The Gathering's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/spider-man-magic-the-gathering-crossover-reveal-card-spoilers">very first Spider-man cards</a> as part of a special Scene Box outside of the main set. Well today, as part of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-to-watch-san-diego-comic-con-2025">San Diego Comic-Con 2025,</a> we're back with an exclusive look at some of the first cards that will actually be a part of that Standard-legal set – and this cast of five spideys will surely look familiar to any <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/spider-man-into-the-spider-verse">Spider-Verse</a> fans out there.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Flip through the slideshow below to see all five Spider-Man cards</strong>, as well as an alternate comic book art style for the titular webslinger himself.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Magic: The Gathering x Spider-Man - First Look at 5 New Cards</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Magic: The Gathering developer Wizards of the Coast <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/spider-man-magic-the-gathering-crossover-reveal-card-spoilers">previously told IGN</a> that it wasn't limiting this set to a single comic run, and that's made quite clear with this early look. All five cards are different versions of Spider-Man depicted as legendary creatures: at Uncommon you have Spider-Man Noir and the robotic SP//dr piloted by Peni Parker, at Rare are Spider-Man 2099 and the delightfully goofy Spider-Ham, and finally at Mythic Rare is the man himself, Peter Parker, who flips over to become the Amazing Spider-Man.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That last card is especially interesting as it is double-sided. The front is simply Peter Parker, while the back is his Amazing Spider-Man alter ego, and you have some flexibility in how to cast him. Magic has had what are called "modal double-faced cards" before that allow you to cast either side from your hand, but this is the first I know of that <em>also</em> allows you to pay a cost to flip it while the front side is already in play - in this case, you can play Peter Parker for two mana, and then pay four more on a later turn to have him transform. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you do, you get access to his very flavorful ability called web-slinging, which allows you to pay just three mana to cast Legendary spells if you also return a tapped creature to your hand. This card is sure to be a popular leader in Magic's most popular format, Commander, as it will let you cheat all sorts of big and expensive legendary creatures into play far earlier than expected. And because this card will also be legal across Magic's regular competitive formats, <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/lci/185/ghalta-stampede-tyrant" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">giant dinosaurs</a> and <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dsk/120/valgavoth-terror-eater" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">terrifying demons</a> alike could be swinging onto the table.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The rest of the cast here is a clear nod to Sony's excellent Into the Spider-Verse animated films, only missing a take on Peter B. Parker and Spider-Gwen to complete the first movie's main cast (though there's plenty of time for those to potentially be revealed themselves before the set launches in September). But before you get too excited, this was almost definitely just a nod to their reveal as part of this year's Comic-Con, as these cards and this set in general are not actually tied to that series in any direct way. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Marvel's Spider-Man x Magic: The Gathering - First Card and Packaging Reveal</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And while we may not have a second version of Peter to show here, we do have an alternate art treatment for this one – one that is sure to excite any comic book fans out there. This secondary version shows off what's called the "Iconic Moments" Booster Fun treatment for this set, and all of the cards that use it will feature art from the pages of Spider-Man's adventures. This first one is taken straight from the cover of 1963's The Amazing Spider-Man #1, complete with artist credits for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/prolific-marvel-creator-jack-kirby-honored-by-new-york-city-with-two-streets-named-for-him">Jack Kirby</a> and Steve Ditko. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you happen to be in the San Diego area yourself, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/magic.wizards.com/post/3lu6j5n5puv2g" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wizards of the Coast is hosting a Spider-Man event</a> at the Hard Rock Hotel where fans will be able to go hands-on with the set's Welcome Decks – smaller preconstructed decks themed around Spider-man that are meant to be an intro point for new players as they learn the ropes.

<p>How did the GameChat companion perform?</p>

<figure><a title="Nintendo Switch 2 Camera" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/80a6a2352b266/nintendo-switch-2-camera.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Ollie Reynolds / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>We've just heard how around "1 in 3" Switch 2 owners <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/around-1-in-3-switch-2-owners-bought-new-pro-controller-despite-high-price-point-us">bought a new Pro Controller</a>, but how did other accessories like the official camera perform?</p>
<p>Game File has now been able to <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/even-85-switch-2-controllers-just">provide some additional information</a>. Speaking to Circana's gaming analyst Mat Piscatella, it was noted how Nintendo's camera had a "mid-single digit percentage" attach rate with Switch 2.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The Switch 2’s $55 official camera had a “mid-single digit percentage” attach rate with the Switch 2, Circana gaming analyst Mat Piscatella told Game File."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>This was apparently "in line" with Piscatella expectations, but we don't know yet if it's matched Nintendo's forecast. As mentioned, though, third-party cameras are also compatible with the Switch 2 – so the official one isn't necessarily an essential purchase if you want to play games with this functionality, or participate in GameChat.</p>
<p>Nintendo launches <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-jamboree-tv">Super Mario Party Jamboree - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV</a> next week, which adds new minigames utilising features such as the camera as well as mouse mode. If we get an update about the sales figures of Nintendo's camera accessory in this region or elsewhere, or find out more about its performance in general, we'll let you know.</p>

Returning to his nation of birth, Remi is aiming to learn more about his past and find his parents, but that's easier said than done when the landscape around him is being torn apart by a phenomenon called the Calamity, which has introduced violent creatures to the country.</p><p>What sets Hell Is Us apart is that it refuses to hold your hand, as you'll need to pay attention during conversations, gather clues, and use that knowledge to chart your own path forward. "Some players will thrive on the level of player agency Hell is Us offers, while others will butt their heads against it and quit in frustration," Dan Ryckert wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hell-is-us-intriguingly-bold-design-decisions-refuse-to-give-you-a-hint/1100-6531798/" data-ref-id="1100-6531798">Hell Is Us preview</a>. "I'm leaning toward the former--this is a game filled with bold, confident, deliberate design decisions on the part of Rogue Factor, and it'll be interesting to see how players react when it releases September 4."</p><p>Several other games are available to preorder now, so if exploring a dystopian landscape while fighting for your life doesn't appeal to you, you can instead grab upcoming titles like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-pokemon-legends-z-a-console-bundle/1100-6533331/" data-ref-id="1100-6533331">Pokemon Legends: Z-A</a> or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/get-an-adorable-bluey-plush-with-this-amazon-exclusive-video-game-bundle/1100-6533134/" data-ref-id="1100-6533134">Bluey: The Video Game</a>.</p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rds-game-traveler-deluxe-nintendo-switch-2-carrying-cases/1100-6532022/">Amazon Restocks The $40 Licensed Alternative To Switch 2 All-In-One Case</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-nintendo-switch-2-console-and-game-restocks/1100-6532451/">Nintendo Switch 2 At Amazon - Console Restocks, Every Accessory You Can Buy, And More</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/god-of-war-20th-anniversary-retrospective-box-set-gets-nice-discount/1100-6530148/">God Of War 20th Anniversary Retrospective Box Set Gets Nice Discount</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lord-of-the-rings-tolkien-illustrated-book-is-only-30-at-amazon-right-now/1100-6533080/">Lord Of The Rings Tolkien Illustrated Book Is Only $30 At Amazon Right Now</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/berserk-anime-blu-ray-best-amazon-deals/1100-6524954/">Berserk's Best Anime Adaptation Gets Limited-Time Price Cut At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/adam-sandler-happy-gilmore-billy-madison-4k-blu-ray-editions-preorder-amazon/1100-6531820/">Happy Gilmore And Billy Madison 4K Blu-Ray Preorders Steeply Discounted At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/8bitdos-new-50-iphone-controller-is-officially-licensed-by-xbox/1100-6533127/">8BitDo's New $50 iPhone Controller Is Officially Licensed By Xbox</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/superman-2025-4k-blu-ray-steelbook-preorder-amazon/1100-6533111/">Superman 4K Blu-Ray Steelbook Edition Is Up For Preorder At Amazon</a></li>   </ul> </div>

The new capture card supports PC and all major consoles--including PS5, Xbox Series X, and Switch 2--and is capable of capturing gameplay in up to 4K resolution at 60fps. If you're considering upgrading your streaming or gameplay capture setup, the Elgato 4K S is available now for $160 at Amazon.</p><div title="6533379 - Elgato 4K S" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="3951" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6533379 - Elgato 4K S" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Elgato-4K-External-Passthrough-Near-Zero/dp/B0FFTFYGLV?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Elgato-4K-External-Passthrough-Near-Zero\/dp\/B0FFTFYGLV?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Elgato-4K-External-Passthrough-Near-Zero/dp/B0FFTFYGLV?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Elgato 4K S</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Elgato-4K-External-Passthrough-Near-Zero/dp/B0FFTFYGLV?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Elgato-4K-External-Passthrough-Near-Zero\/dp\/B0FFTFYGLV?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Elgato-4K-External-Passthrough-Near-Zero/dp/B0FFTFYGLV?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$160</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <p>As stated above, this new capture card records gameplay at up to 4K 60fps. For comparison, the company's previous HD60 X could only record at 60fps in 1080p, dropping to 30fps for 4K footage--that should make for an appreciable upgrade for those upgrading to this new capture card. The Elgato 4K S features a USB-C port (5Gbps) and two HDMI 2.0 ports. Setup is just as easy as Elgato's other gadgets, requiring little more a USB-C and two HDMI cables to connect the card to your display, gameplay output source, and PC or recording device.</p>                      </div><p>Early reviews of the Elgato 4K S are overwhelmingly positive, with users noting its portable form factor, minimal input lag, and capture quality. So if you're a creator looking to make the jump to 4K content without breaking the bank, the Elgato 4K S certainly seems like it's worth a closer look.</p><p>While this is a leap over the HD60 X, the Elgato 4K S is not a replacement for the premium <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Elgato-4K-Ultra-Low-Streaming-Recording/dp/B0CPFWXMBL?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Elgato 4K X</a> ($245), which is capable of capturing 4K footage at up to 144fps. The 4K X also offers a few additional bonuses, such as added HDR support, HDMI 2.1 ports, and 10Gbps USB-C ports. While most streamers will be just fine sticking with the 4K S's 4K 60fps capture quality, those who demand the highest quality will still find the 4K X the better option.</p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rds-game-traveler-deluxe-nintendo-switch-2-carrying-cases/1100-6532022/">Amazon Restocks The $40 Licensed Alternative To Switch 2 All-In-One Case</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-nintendo-switch-2-console-and-game-restocks/1100-6532451/">Nintendo Switch 2 At Amazon - Console Restocks, Every Accessory You Can Buy, And More</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/god-of-war-20th-anniversary-retrospective-box-set-gets-nice-discount/1100-6530148/">God Of War 20th Anniversary Retrospective Box Set Gets Nice Discount</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lord-of-the-rings-tolkien-illustrated-book-is-only-30-at-amazon-right-now/1100-6533080/">Lord Of The Rings Tolkien Illustrated Book Is Only $30 At Amazon Right Now</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/berserk-anime-blu-ray-best-amazon-deals/1100-6524954/">Berserk's Best Anime Adaptation Gets Limited-Time Price Cut At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/adam-sandler-happy-gilmore-billy-madison-4k-blu-ray-editions-preorder-amazon/1100-6531820/">Happy Gilmore And Billy Madison 4K Blu-Ray Preorders Steeply Discounted At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/8bitdos-new-50-iphone-controller-is-officially-licensed-by-xbox/1100-6533127/">8BitDo's New $50 iPhone Controller Is Officially Licensed By Xbox</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/superman-2025-4k-blu-ray-steelbook-preorder-amazon/1100-6533111/">Superman 4K Blu-Ray Steelbook Edition Is Up For Preorder At Amazon</a></li>   </ul> </div>

<p>This included the news about a new Switch 2 bundle and details about pre-order bonuses. Now, retailers in the US have shared some bonuses you can get if you decide to pre-order the physical copy ahead of the full release this October.</p>
<p>If you place a pre-order at Walmart, you can get an exclusive mystery pin pre-order bonus. As mentioned in the fine print, this offer begins this week and is available "while supplies last" and is limited to "one gift per purchase". The Switch 2 version here will set you back $69.00 and the Switch version is available for $59.88.</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fqyjxmt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLc1VHm8D80" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Apart from this offer, Best Buy is offering a "free gamer mat" with Pokémon Legends: Z–A pre-orders. According to the description, this mat can be used for playing the Pokémon Trading Card game or as a mouse pad.</p>
<p>This item will also be available in "limited quantities" and is available while supplies last. And if you've already pre-ordered, you'll also receive the gamer mat. The Switch 2 version here is $69.99 and the Switch version is priced at $59.99.</p>

<p>As already revealed by The Pokémon Company, trainers across the globe can also get an "early-purchase bonus" in the form of a Ralts holding a Gardevoirite stone as a gift. Additionally, the digital version early-purchase bonus includes "a gift of 100 Poké Balls" (both of these gifts are available to claim until <strong>February 28th, 2026</strong>).</p>

<p>Pre-orders for the new Nintendo Switch 2 + Pokémon Legends: Z-A – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Bundle have also gone live and will arrive on the same date as the new game on <strong>16th October 2025</strong>.</p>

Though Seagate doesn't list this one as an exclusive deal, the $250 deal price--$100 off--is $50 less than Best Buy's current deal. In any case, spending an extra $80 to jump from 26TB to 28GB doesn't offer good value. The same could be said about the 22TB edition, which is only 10 bucks less than the 26TB model.</p><p>The 6TB, 14TB, or 26TB models would be our picks from a value perspective.</p><ul><li><a

And in the investor Q&amp;A during the earnings call, Cox answered a question about how Final Fantasy's demand correlated to the company's expectations with the following quote (<a href="https://www.investing.com/news/transcripts/earnings-call-transcript-hasbro-beats-q2-2025-estimates-but-stock-dips-93CH-4148568" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">courtesy of Investing.com's transcript</a>):</p><blockquote>In terms of Final Fantasy and how it met expectations, I’ll give you a comparison between two of our biggest universe at the onsets. Lord of the Rings took six months to deliver $200,000,000 of revenue.</blockquote><blockquote>Final Fantasy took one day. And we left demand on the table. So we couldn’t produce enough. I think we increased production runs on it four times pre release. It was substantially, by many, many very high double digit percentages, ahead of any other production run we’ve ever done.</blockquote><blockquote>And we left the market wanting more. And our expectation is there’s going to be a nice long tail of backlist for the product. Likewise, we’re still selling Lord of the Rings product today. So, even though we hit $200,000,000 in December ’2 for Lord of the Rings, We sold a substantial percentage of that in the several years following. We expect Final Fantasy to be no different.</blockquote><blockquote>It’s partially what’s powering our backlist, which already in five and a half months in the year did more than we’ve ever done in any year prior. So, I think that’s a little bit on what our bullishness is on Final Fantasy. What drove success for it? I think it’s a couple of things. I think first and foremost, it’s finding the right IPs that are great adjacencies to what Magic fans might appeal to or what Magic might appeal to another fan base.</blockquote><blockquote>Lord of the Rings was fantastic because it’s kind of the granddaddy of fantasy. It invented the genre, major books, major movies, major animation and games. Final Fantasy, I think, is almost as strong as Lord of the Rings in terms of IP strength, if not stronger in some regions. I think it has stronger cross regional appeal, and it has probably more of a sweet spot in gaming than Lord of the Rings has, because it was kind of born from gaming. So, I think potentially the overlap of fan bases was stronger than you might have even seen for something like Lord of the Rings.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">In a follow-up question, Cox also noted that he feels "pretty good" about future collaborations and first-party sets coming next year "in terms of being Final Fantasy like in terms of the types of players, the size of community, and the adjacencies we have." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That last remark bodes well for fans of the Final Fantasy set. We just saw a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-the-hedgehog-magic-the-gathering-crossover-spoilers-secret-lair">Sonic: The Hedgehog Secret Lair crossover</a> debut, and already know about <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/spider-man-magic-the-gathering-crossover-reveal-card-spoilers">Spider-Man</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/avatar-aang-magic-the-gathering-cards-reveal-early-look-at-upcoming-the-last-airbender-set">Avatar: The Last Airbender themed sets in September</a> and November, respectively, so with success like this, more crossovers are likely to make sense to the folks at Hasbro. In the meantime, at least this means Hasbro will keep the Final Fantasy cards stocked for a good while, for those who haven't been able to get their hands on them yet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

But unlike <em>Half-Life, Abiotic Factor</em> is a survival game like <em>Minecraft </em>or <em>Rust</em>. Here, though, instead of harvesting trees and rocks, you scrounge for pencils and paper, breaking open closets and desks for resources. It’s a very interesting spin on survival, forcing you to build armor out of plastic binders and garbage cans and set up camp in offices and bathrooms. And as you get deeper into the game, you discover alternative dimensions filled with new loot, resources, and dangerous, creepy monsters.</p><p>Here’s the game’s official description courtesy of the Xbox store: </p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>After a catastrophic containment breach, your workplace has become a cosmic battle zone: anomalous entities are on the loose, enemies from other dimensions are invading via portals, and an arcane military sect - known as The Order - is targeting personnel and entities indiscriminately, aiming to seize artifacts and put an end to the chaos. Containment procedures have failed and help isn’t on the way.</p><p>Stranded miles beneath the surface, it’s up to you and your fellow scientists to band together, plan your escape, and make this underground complex your new home - for now.</p></blockquote><p>I’ve been playing <em>Abitoitc Factor</em> on and off for about a year now since it came out, and I’m so excited to check it out on console with my group of friends. And the fact that it’s on both Game Pass and PS Plus Extra makes it super easy for me to convince them to give it a spin. You should try it as well! <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/palworld-valheim-minecraft-punch-trees-survival-games-1851193458?_gl=1*use9eu*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTMyOTk5MjEkbzE4MyRnMSR0MTc1MzMwMDA3NCRqNjAkbDAkaDA.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/palworld-valheim-minecraft-punch-trees-survival-games-1851193458?_gl=1*use9eu*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTMyOTk5MjEkbzE4MyRnMSR0MTc1MzMwMDA3NCRqNjAkbDAkaDA.">I’ve made it clear on this site that I don’t like all the tree-punching</a></span> and cave-living that most survival games involve, and that’s still true.

In fact, the silicon that seems likely to power such a future device could put it on par with PS6 performance, or whatever the next Xbox is called (I’m hoping for NeXbox, personally).</p><p>The chip at the heart of all this speculation is the AMD “Magnus” APU, itself only rumored to exist for now. As <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.tomsguide.com/gaming/leaked-amd-magnus-apu-could-power-the-ps6-or-next-xbox-heres-what-weve-heard&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/gaming/leaked-amd-magnus-apu-could-power-the-ps6-or-next-xbox-heres-what-weve-heard" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">highlighted by <em>Tom’s Guide</em> last week</a></span>, various internal code names and AMD leaks point to Magnus being a likely candidate for powering next-generation consoles, which the Steam Deck “2” might be aiming to compete more directly with. </p><p>This is good news for those hoping for future Steam Decks to deliver cutting-edge processing power. The rumored Magnus chip might not arrive for another year or two, so we’ll still have to bide our time with the Steam Deck OLED as Valve’s “flagship” handheld for a while. But when we do get that upgrade, it sure sounds like it’s aiming to wow our eyeballs out of our skulls.</p><h2 id="h617545"><a id=""></a>Should the Steam Deck be bigger, better, faster, soon?</h2><p>Please don’t burn me at the stake for being the somewhat luddite-adjacent witch that I am, but I’m content with what the Steam Deck delivers presently.

It’s a machine I can use on the go to jump into some titles from the past that aren’t so old as to be something I’d fire up in RetroArch, but aren’t so new that I’m going to be left with 30 minutes worth of battery life after a single play session, either.</p><p>In other words, for now I’m okay with some experiences—<em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> and the like—not being at their absolute best on the handheld. I think it’s fine for there to be experiences that are better had on a PC or console that doesn’t need to offer a compromised version of the game in order to not devour all its battery life in minutes. Valve, I’ll wait for 2030 for a new Deck. My library is big enough and I’m patient.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/steam-deck-2-amd-magnus-apu-ps6-xbox-1851786832]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>Julian LeFay, the man often credited as "the father of The Elder Scrolls," has died at the age of 59, his creative partners announced this week.</p>
<p>"It is with profound sadness and heavy hearts that we inform our community of the passing of Julian LeFay, our beloved Technical Director and co-founder of Once Lost Games," his colleagues <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/oncelostgames.bsky.social/post/3lum4pyp3cs2e">wrote in a Bluesky post</a>.</p>
<p>LeFay spent most of the 1990s at Bethesda Softworks, culminating in his work on The Elder Scrolls series into the late '90s.</p>
<p>His career didn't start with The Elder Scrolls, though. Beginning in 1988, LeFay made music for the Amiga hack-and-slash game <em>Sword of Sodan</em> as well as the NES game <em>Where's Waldo</em>, and he did design and programming work on titles like&nbsp;<em>Wayne Gretzky Hockey</em>, the DOS version of <em>Dragon's Lair</em>, and two DOS games based on the Terminator movie franchise.</p>
<p>In the early '90s, he joined fellow Bethesda developers Ted Peterson and Vijay Lakshman on an Ultima Underworld-inspired RPG that would come to be called <em>The Elder Scrolls: Arena</em>. Though famed creative director Todd Howard has helmed the franchise since its third entry, <em>The Elder Scrolls: Arena</em> and <em>The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall</em> were chiefly spearheaded by LeFay. One of the gods of The Elder Scrolls universe was named after LeFay, and the setting was inspired by the literature and tabletop role-playing games LeFay and Peterson enjoyed.</p>

<figure><a title="Switch 2 Pro Controller" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0fbfc6e72db97/switch-2-pro-controller.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>We know the Switch 2 has sold incredibly well worldwide, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/switch-2-launch-helps-boost-us-video-game-spending-to-record-june-high">the console shifting 1.6 million units in June 2025 in the US alone</a>. Now we have an idea of just how well the pricey, but excellent, new Pro Controller has done, too.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/even-85-switch-2-controllers-just">Game File's Stephen Totilo</a> has shared Circana's estimated Switch 2 Pro Controller sales, and it's around 512,000 in the United States — that means around one in three people picking up a Switch 2 have also grabbed a shiny new controller to go with. That's around <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lun37t7z552k">a 32% attach rate</a>.</p>
<p>If you're a Nintendo fan, you'll know that the Pro Controller is one of the pricier controllers on the market right now, and is actually one of the accessories that went up in price in response to the Trump Administration's tariffs (or, as Nintendo put it, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/nintendo-switch-2-us-pre-orders-start-24th-april-system-and-launch-game-pricing-unchanged">"changes in market conditions"</a>) — from $80 to $85.</p>

<p>The original Switch 1 Pro Controller is also compatible with the console, and that, coupled with the price of the new controller, has put some people off rushing to grab one , as good as it is.</p>
<p>We're also still in the very early days of the console's life, so those sales are likely going to dip over the coming months. Still, 32% is an impressive number, and we'll be interested to see how other accessories — such as the Camera — have sold.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Sony has <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/07/23/new-ps5-system-update-beta-previews-dualsense-wireless-controller-pairing-across-multiple-devices/">announced</a> a new update coming to PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 5 Pro users who have opted into the PS5 Beta program, meant to make pairing your DualSense controller to multiple devices at a time a "<em>seamless</em>" process. The update, which is being pushed tomorrow for users in the beta program, will let you switch from using your DualSense controller wirelessly on one device to another, without having to re-pair it every time.</p>



<p>The PlayStation Blog post describes a process through which after you've initially paired your DualSense or DualSense Edge controller with your PS5, PC, and mobile device, through a combination of pressing the PS button and one of the face buttons, you can switch between devices.</p>



<p>"<em>With this update, you can now register up to four devices simultaneously, and easily switch between them directly from your controller,</em>" writes Shuzo Kikuchi, vice president of product management at Sony. "<em>For example, you can take your controller which you use with your PS5, then seamlessly switch connection to a PC to play PC games, or connect it to a smartphone to enjoy Remote Play from your PS5. With this enhanced flexibility, you can enjoy gaming more freely across multiple devices</em>.<em>"</em></p>



<p>Once you've properly paired your controller to a device the first time, going through the prescribed button presses in the example chart below should let you switch from one device to another, without skipping a beat. </p>



<p>Note that this chart doesn't mean you'll need to set up device switching in this exact way, it is just an example of how you can have up to four devices paired to one controller and switch between them.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Slot Number</strong></td><td><strong>Button Used</strong></td><td><strong>Player Indicator Lights</strong></td><td><strong>Connected Device</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Slot 1</td><td>PS button and Triangle button</td><td>One light on</td><td>PS5</td></tr><tr><td>Slot 2</td><td>PS button and Circle button</td><td>Two lights on</td><td>PS5 Pro</td></tr><tr><td>Slot 3</td><td>PS button and Cross button</td><td>Three lights on</td><td>Windows PC</td></tr><tr><td>Slot 4</td><td>PS button and Square button</td><td>Four lights on</td><td>iPhone</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>The other key element of the blog post announcing this update is a feature that won't be in tomorrow's update but will be in a future one. A power-saving mode is coming down the pipeline, which will reduce the amount of power your console is pulling while playing games that support the feature. </p>



<p>Meaning that if you're playing, say, Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart, and it supports this power saving feature, then with the feature enabled, your PS5/PS5 Pro device will draw less power to run the game. This will result in performance being scaled back, and it also disables features like VR support for games that have a VR mode. The intent of the mode is to reduce the environmental footprint caused by running your PS5/PS5 Pro at full power whenever you're using it.</p>



<p>If you're a player who cares about having a smooth framerate and/or being able to play with graphical features like ray-tracing, then it's doubtful you'll ever use a mode like this. But for games that don't require that much power to run them at a smooth framerate, and ones that don't even have higher-fidelity options in terms of graphics, like most pixel-art games, it's a solid option to reduce the environmental impact, and perhaps even your own electricity bill. </p>



<p>For now though, we're still waiting to see how many games will even support the feature, and the specifics around how it'll work. </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-made-200m-in-one-day.1251531/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Magic: The Gathering</em>&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy </em>was already known to be the best selling set of all time, but new statements from Hasbro in their financial reporting reveal the staggering degree of which this is the case.</p>

<p>During the earning call Hasbro CEO Chris Cocks opened up saying that&nbsp;<em>Magic: The Gathering</em>&nbsp;was up 23% year over year, and up 32% year to date, foreshadowing the crazy numbers yet to come. When answering a question, Cocks revealed that&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/ranking-all-of-magic-gathering-final-fantasy-legendary-creatures-part-1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Ranking ALL of Magic: The Gathering Final Fantasy Legendary Creatures Part 1"><em>Final Fantasy&nbsp;</em>(and its hoard of legendary creatures)</a> had sold as much in one day, as previous best selling set&nbsp;<em>Lord of the Rings - Tales of Middle-Earth</em>&nbsp;did in 6 months.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"In terms of Final Fantasy, and how it met expectations, I'll give you a comparison between two of our biggest Universes Beyond sets. Lord of the Rings took 6 months to deliver $200 million of revenue, Final Fantasy took 1 day, and we left demand on the table. So we couldn't produce enough. I think we increased production runs on it 4x pre release. It was substantially by many, many very high double-digit percentages ahead of any other production run we've ever done, and we left the market wanting more." (Transcript from <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4803536-hasbro-inc-has-q2-2025-earnings-call-transcript" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Hasbro, Inc. (HAS) Q2 2025 Earnings Call Transcript">Seeking Alpha</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Despite that huge sales, and increasing production of <em>Magic: The Gathering -&nbsp;</em><em>Final Fantasy&nbsp;</em>4 separate times, they still were unable to meet the demand that brought over $200m in sales on day 1. That $200m in revenue was a large part of the Wizards and Digital gaming revenue segment which was $522m.</p>

<h2><em>Magic: The Gathering Final Fantasy</em> Isn't the Only Set Doing Big Numbers</h2>

<p>Of course, if the only strong numbers were related to&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy</em>&nbsp;it would be somewhat concerning. That isn't the case, as in his prepared comments Cocks revealed that&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/tarkir-dragonstorm-commander-deck-reviews" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Tarkir: Dragonstorm Commander Deck Reviews - Roaring Fun!"><em>Tarkir - Dragonstorm</em>&nbsp;</a>is on pace to become the best selling in-universe premiere&nbsp;set (aka standard legal, and not a&nbsp;<em>Modern Horizons</em>&nbsp;type set) of all time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Player count in organized play was also up substantially, with a 40% increase in unique players taking part in events as Universes Beyond manages to attract both new and old players to the game. This was also buoyed by&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy&nbsp;</em>as it "set a record for new player growth, delivering more new players in its first 2 weeks than any prior set posted over an entire season," <a href="https://investor.hasbro.com/static-files/005be71f-0c3f-4e8a-800e-06ecd698c19c" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Hasbro Investor Prepared Remarks">according to Cocks</a>.</p>

<p>Older cards are selling too. Despite half the year left to go,&nbsp;<em>Magic</em>'s backlist of sets has already set an all-time annual record of sales as of the end of June. This is partially powered by sets like&nbsp;<em>Lord of the Rings - Tales of Middle-Earth</em>, but also by sets like&nbsp;<em>Modern Horizons 3</em>, and&nbsp;other in-universe sets that continue to sell even more to more players. As for Secret Lair, the controversial decision to go back to limited print runs has not harmed sales at all as it has just delivered its strongest sales quarter in its history, possibly powered by the&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/wizards-of-coast-releasing-three-secret-lair-x-final-fantasy-drops-this-summer" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Wizards of the Coast Releasing Three Secret Lair x Final Fantasy Drops This Summer"><em>Final Fantasy&nbsp;</em>Secret Lairs</a>.</p>

<p>All in all,&nbsp;<em>Magic: The Gathering</em>'s finances are booming right now, and it's good to be Hasbro, who is able to lean on Wizards of the Coast while various toys experience more difficulties with tariffs due to components coming from regions that are heavily tariffed often.</p>

            <link>https://aftermath.site/ozzy-osbourne-death-blizzcon-2009-world-of-warcraft</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ozzy-osbourne-played-a-video-game-convention-in-2009-and-it-ruled.1251519/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In 2009, I had been a journalist for, charitably, one year. I was in college, and most of the publications I’d written for paid in exposure rather than cash. Somehow, for reasons that have since been lost to time, I wound up with a press pass to BlizzCon, Blizzard’s official though still-nascent annual gathering in Anaheim, California. What I did not fully grasp the significance of back then – so starry-eyed was I at the prospect of interviewing people who’d worked on <em>StarCraft </em>– was that this meant I had also been handed a front-row ticket to an Ozzy Osbourne show.&nbsp;</p><p>It was a different era for games journalism – already removed from the glitz, glamor, and lavish review/preview trips of <a href="https://aftermath.site/games-journalism-game-development-ign-kotaku" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the ‘90s and early 2000s</a>, but nowhere near as far as we are today. Ozzy’s appearance wasn’t a walled-off press perk, though; this was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EP3c736bzYU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a show for everyone in attendance</a>, a flex of a tradition that would in subsequent years lead to closing ceremonies headlined by acts including Tenacious D, Foo Fighters, Blink 182, Metallica, Linkin Park, and Muse. At the time, though, only one rock band, The Offspring, had previously heralded BlizzCon’s conclusion, and no offense to The Offspring, but they weren’t Ozzy Osbourne.&nbsp;</p><p>Almost two decades later, I remember the 2009 show in bits and pieces. At the time, I marveled at how, despite gaining a reputation for unintelligible speech and half-lucidly shouting “Sharon,” Ozzy’s singing voice was still crystal clear – and strong as all hell. I also recall that even though I was only a burgeoning concert goer at that point in my life, I’d already learned to recognize what a dead crowd looked like. Ozzy repeatedly implored BlizzCon attendees to jump, clap, and move, but many of them were seated, and only during the biggest hits did it really <em>feel </em>like a metal show ought to. (This would continue to be an issue for BlizzConcerts; tired nerds at the end of a convention weekend do not a great crowd make, but that never stopped artists from trying.)&nbsp;</p><p>Ozzy did his best, though, and apparently he had a good time.</p><p>“I was thinking they'd all be wearing spectacles the size of f****** Coca-Cola bottles, like curly white hair and f****** rimmed glasses, you know, the scientist types,” Ozzy <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ozzy-osbourne-rides-crazy-train-into-blizzcon-2009/1100-6216112/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">told GameSpot</a> of the BlizzCon audience in an interview after the show (censorship theirs, not ours). “But they were f****** great, man. The vibe was there. The kids had a great time. That's the best part of my job: giving them the best time.”</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Ozzy Osbourne World of Warcraft AS AIRED then ACTUAL STORYBOARDS version Commercial TV ad WoW" width="710" height="533" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T6LpGBS-BUo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>There are a few pieces of cultural ephemera worth excavating here. Foremost, Ozzy’s presence at BlizzCon feels weirdly incongruous until you consider that he was fresh off a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6LpGBS-BUo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">popular 2008 commercial</a> for <em>World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King</em> in which he competed against the aforementioned in-game monarch to determine who was the real “Prince Of Darkness” and lost. Never mind that one was a prince and the other was a king, rendering the entire premise nonsensical; I remember enjoying this ad a lot when I first saw it – and then a little less each of the following one thousand times.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2009/08/23/blizzcon-09-ozzy-osbourne-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Speaking with IGN</a> after the BlizzCon show, Ozzy – who also voiced The Guardian Of Metal in Double Fine’s 2009 cult classic <em>Brütal Legend</em> – explained his relationship to video games.</p><p>"To be honest with you, I don't [play <em>World of Warcraft</em>],” Ozzy told IGN. “I'm very computer dumb. My son goes, 'Dad, check this out.' He plays those war games, my son, and I'm a World War II buff. But he sits up there in his room for f****** four days playing this thing going, 'Shhh! Don't get me going!' I'm very slow with the computers; I'm one of the old timers. But it's the future, you know. My kids now – when I was a kid, the big thing with my dad was learning how to work the remote, and I learned that, so I thought, 'I'll always know what's going on.' But now my kids are talking in f****** computer language – megabytes and gigabytes, whatever the f*** that means."</p><p>His perspective on <em>Brütal Legend</em> revealed a similarly begrudging open-mindedness that, as someone now being overtaken by the world in the great race we call life, I cannot help but respect.&nbsp;</p><p>“You know what, a lot of guys have been doing the things I do for a long time, but they don't get involved with [games],” he said to IGN. “It's the wave of the future – it's sink or swim. I'm very honored to be in the video game. Someone was telling me that the one I did for the rock thing: a billion kids, a billion kids played it! That's f****** unbelievable! That's a f****** tenth of the population of the world! If only that many bought the f****** album.”</p><figure><blockquote><p>It's the wave of the future – it's sink or swim.</p></blockquote></figure><p>Someone lied to Ozzy about <em>Brütal Legend</em>’s sales so boldly and shamelessly that they probably succumbed to spontaneous human combustion immediately afterward, but that’s not the point. What matters is, this is a man who did his best to keep up with what was going on around him because fuck it, whatever, I guess I have to in order to remain an interesting person, and we can all learn from that.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite goth-ed up appearances and <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/ozzy-osbourne-bites-head-off-bat-anniversary-1287867/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">eternally mistold tales of bat biting</a>, Ozzy’s biggest songs were about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lD5bfqzr6E" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">learning how to love, forgetting how to hate</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUT730G-xvA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revolting against a world obsessed with war</a>. You don’t write lyrics like that unless you believe in people and the idea that, with sufficient time and collaboration, they’ll become better than they are now. It’s easy to recede into the comforting arms of irrelevance as the world regresses into division and strife. It’s much harder to stay present, grounded, and accept that you’ll never stop going through changes.&nbsp;</p><p>How exactly Ozzy squared all of this with latter-day claims that he preferred to "stay away from politics" and his wife's increasingly <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/23/sharon-osbourne-calls-for-kneecap-rappers-us-visas-to-be-revoked-after-israel-criticism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fascist-friendly</a> <a href="https://www.newarab.com/news/dead-76-ozzy-osbourne-mourned-fierce-israel-ally" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">support of Israel</a> – which led Ozzy to play shows there in 2010 and 2018 – is a question to which we will never get a direct answer. There is no excusing even tacit approval of such a stance, one that could be chalked up to an admirable distaste for antisemitism – as evidenced by <a href="https://x.com/OzzyOsbourne/status/1756100047056564602" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ozzy's rejection of Ye's request to sample his music in 2024</a> – but which via his actions, if not his words, went further. Heroes and legends can still be hypocrites, and even as we laud their achievements, we must also grapple with their failings. This is a big one, a stain on Ozzy's legacy that should not be forgotten.</p><p>Open-mindedness, selective though it evidently was, ultimately led Ozzy to a reality TV career and, eventually, collaborations with modern artists – like the irritating but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJZmO5mByVY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">undeniably skilled</a> Yungblud – in his final days. He never stopped trying shit. This proclivity was on full display during the 2009 BlizzCon show, with Ozzy <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEnwWp70mJ8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bringing a then-nine-year-old guitarist named Yuto Miyazawa on stage</a> during “Crazy Train,” going so far as to heft Miyazawa on his shoulder midsong.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Crazy Train - Ozzy Osbourne with Yuto Miyazawa - Blizzcon 2009." width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WEnwWp70mJ8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Miyazawa was about as familiar with Blizzard's games as Ozzy, but up on stage, none of that mattered to him.</p><p>"I always admired [Ozzy's] first guitarist Randy Rhoads," Miyazawa, now 25, told Aftermath.

It also teased a devastated New York City. The plan is for this next entry to be a return to the tone and feel of older entries in the series, like <em>Battlefield 3</em>, and to move away from the future setting and changes found in 2021's less-than-stellar <em>Battlefield 2042.</em> And now we seemingly know more about <em>BF6</em> thanks to a reliable leaker.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/battlefield-6-date-de-sortie-editions-prix-precommande-on-vous-devoile-toutes-nos-infos-inedites-60267&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/battlefield-6-date-de-sortie-editions-prix-precommande-on-vous-devoile-toutes-nos-infos-inedites-60267" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On July 23, <em>Dealabs </em>writer Billbil-kun corroborated</a></span> information from a group of dataminers who found a possible release date for <em>Battlefield 6</em>. Reportedly, <em>BF6 </em>will arrive on October 10. The game will be available in two versions: A standard edition and a “Phantom Edition.” This Phantom Edition will be digital only and will include additional in-game content, likely cosmetics. Neither version will provide early access. Pre-orders will go live on July 31. </p><p><em>Battlefield 6</em>'s prices were also leaked, but they are in Euros, and it’s not clear yet how that will translate to the United States and other regions. At the very least, it appears the Phantom Edition will cost $30 more than the standard release. </p><p>Billbil-kun also reports that there will likely be an open beta for<em> Battlefield 6</em> available in August. This follows months and months of closed alpha testing. </p><p>We won’t have to wait long to find out how much of this report and its data-mined information is accurate. Tomorrow, on July 24, EA and its team of studios working on <em>Battlefield 6</em> will unveil the first trailer for the game, and we’ll likely be told its official release date and more. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/bf6-battlefield-6-leak-october-launch-early-access-beta-1851786824]]></content:encoded>
