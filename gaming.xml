With the launch of <em>Among Us 3D</em>, the VR version will be rebranded, and the new release will unite players across both PC and VR through cross-play.</p><p>The studio says that this “will allow Steam PC users to join cross-platform lobbies with VR players on Meta Quest, Steam VR, PlayStation VR 2, and PICO.”</p><p>It’s not clear yet when the 3D game will be launching, but the studio says that it’s coming soon on Steam. A demo will be available as part of Steam Next Fest on Monday. And while the original 2D version of <em>Among Us</em> will still exist, there will be no cross-play between it and the first-person edition.</p><p>As part of the announcement, Innersloth also revealed a new in-game currency called “stardust,” which will be used to buy cosmetics in <em>Among Us 3D</em>. The studio specified that the currency won’t be used for purchasing any actual game modes or features.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/chip-n-clawz-vs-the-brainioids-is-a-co-op-rts-with-chaotic-overcooked-energy-hands-on-preview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Brain vs. Claw-n</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Before you even play it, you can intuit a whole lot about the upcoming action-strategy game Chip ‘n Clawz vs. The Brainioids, just by its absolutely ridiculous name alone. Well, I’m pleased to report that after spending several hours with it, it’s exactly as goofy and over-the-top as the title suggests. This cartoonish co-op adventure gives off a distinct Saturday-morning cartoon vibe with its bright colors, absurd gags, and dorky aliens with wacky voices, and blends 3rd-person action with real-time strategy elements that have really piqued my interest. But don’t be fooled by its family friendly ornamentation! As one might expect from a strategy game with XCOM creator Julian Gollop at the helm, this thing already started to show just how deceptively challenging it can be during my short time with it, which has left me eager to see more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Chip ‘n Clawz vs. The Brainioids threw me right into the middle of the action without much context behind its completely bonkers premise – and I was extremely okay with that. I mean, what’s not to get about a reckless human named Chip and a robot kitten named Clawz, fighting against an alien race of brains inside jars called the Brainioids? My co-op friend and I worked our way through increasingly tricky levels filled with relentless alien baddies sent to kill us by someone named General Blobbius (who is not a military general, but the general manager of the Brainioids corporation, because of course he is). If you couldn’t tell already, Chip ‘N Clawz doesn’t exactly take itself seriously, to its enormous benefit. From the brightly-colored levels, dopey looking enemies, and ongoing childish banter, it immediately oozes a kid-friendly charm that lured me into a false sense of security that maybe this would be a pretty easy ride, even though I’d selected hard mode.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Chip ‘N Clawz vs. The Brainioids - First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Our objective was the same for most levels: battle our way through alien hordes and destroy the mothership at the far end of the map using a legion of robotic minions as our allies. To do so, we have to work together to collect Brainium (the resource used for building) and make decisions about what to spend it on, whether that be the construction of new factories or to power up individual units so they’re more effective in combat. But what started out as a fairly by-the-numbers action game with light RTS components became more complex with each level, until we found ourselves screaming at the screen and at each other in a panic, as we were overwhelmed by the enemy on multiple fronts. That’s because Chip ‘n Clawz definitely knows what it’s doing in the real-time strategy department, and in between the time I spent running around the map bonking aliens about with my melee weapon, I was toggling over to the build and command modes, which allowed me to construct new facilities or order my minions around, respectively.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are loads of things to consider, as Chip ‘n Clawz slowly introduces new factories to build, units to control, and upgrades to apply to your character’s loadout that modify your abilities. You might, for example, want to take a perk that upgrades all your mining units that gather resources for building so that they’re faster and can withstand more damage from the enemy, or you might instead prefer to just deal more damage with your own melee weapons if you prefer to do more of your own dirty work. Then, during a certain level you might decide to spend your resources on a new artillery depot that supplies your character with a long-range gun, or alternatively you could use that Brainium to construct some stationary turrets to fend off enemies in the area automatically.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The jokey tone combined with frantic levels overflowing with ruthless alien goons reminded me a lot of the Overcooked series.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">As you’re introduced to more and more things to consider, the enemy quickly levels up their tactics as well, which spirals into some surprisingly formidable encounters. One level had me defending our mobile base from enemy attack on three different fronts while controlling dozens of units, while another required me to construct vehicles and jetpacks to reach far away areas in search of resources I needed to win the day. The jokey tone combined with frantic levels overflowing with ruthless alien goons reminded me a lot of the Overcooked series, which uses its seemingly simple mechanics and cheery art to disguise the friendships it will surely ruin in the coming hours. Similarly, Chip ‘n Clawz cleverly disguises its difficulty by being one of the most immediately approachable RTS games I’ve played, luring you into a false sense of security with its third-person action mechanics, but then hilariously kicks you in the face with demanding levels that require you to lean more and more into its complicated RTS mechanics a short time later.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I feel like I’ve only seen the tip of the iceberg from this surprisingly deep strategy game, and am looking forward to seeing how crazy things can get in later levels.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Popular <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/08/amazon-not-google-reportedly-buying-twitch-for-1-billion/">Amazon-owned</a> game streaming platform Twitch <a href="https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/video-on-demand">announced Wednesday</a> that it will be imposing a 100-hour limit on the archived video highlights users can preserve permanently on the site. And while Twitch says that only 0.5 percent of users will be affected by these new limits, gamers are warning that the move threatens to eradicate large swaths of recent gaming history from the Internet.</p>
<p>Highlights, in Twitch's own words, are a way for Twitch streamers to "show off your best moments to new viewers who land on your channel page." Unlike VOD recordings of full Twitch broadcasts—which are deleted automatically after seven days (or 60 days for Twitch partners)—these highlights provide a more permanent way to maintain an archive of important moments for many Twitch streamers.</p>
<p>That seeming permanence is set to end on April 29, though, when Twitch says it will start to delete content from channels with more than 100 hours of highlights, starting with the least-viewed highlights.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/video-on-demand">announcing the change</a>, Twitch cited the "costly" indefinite storage of these highlights, which it says are responsible for "less than 0.1% of hours watched" across the site. These highlights "haven't been very effective in driving discovery or engagement with viewers," Twitch wrote, and limiting them will "help us manage resources more efficiently... and continue to invest in new features and improvements to more effective viewer engagement tools like Clips and the mobile feed."</p>
<h2>An “incalculable” loss</h2>
<p>On social media, though, many Twitch users are expressing outrage over what the loss of these clips will do to the shared history of their gaming communities. "Who the hell cares about discovery or engagement?" one streamer <a href="https://x.com/MrJimmysteel25/status/1892421085418643523">wrote</a>. "People use highlights to archive, and you're destroying YEARS of speedrunning and other communities' history."</p>
<p>The speedrunning community seems particularly likely to be negatively affected by Twitch's move. As <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VTuber">VTuber</a> VanityFox <a href="https://x.com/VanityyFox/status/1892588675306815995">points out</a>, "many speedrunners use highlights to document world records and important moments... the amount gaming history they are deleting to save money and shove short form content on your feed is incalculable."</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gta-v-on-pc-gets-the-ps5-xsx-s-upgrade-for-free-in-march.1114680/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/20/gta-v-on-pc-gets-the-ps5-xsxs-upgrade-for-free-in-march/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Rockstar has announced that Grand Theft Auto V on PC is getting a free upgrade, rolling in all the enhancements that were <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/02/04/gta-v-and-gta-online-ps5-and-xbox-series-xs-release-date-set-for-15th-march/">made for the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S back in 2022</a>. This includes new vehicles at Hao’s Special Works, animal encounters, improved graphics, faster load times and more.</p>
<p>The free upgrade will available from 4th March 2025.</p>


<p>Instead of just being a patch to download, this will be a new version of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/gta-v">GTA V</a>, and though it will be dished out for free, it will come with a one-time character migration for story and online, and will not be backward compatible for play between versions.</p>
<p>That’s… quite odd, though can be pinned on the increased system requirements for graphical changes. It’s also quite odd that Rockstar are getting round to this now, three years after the same upgrade came to consoles. At the very least, they’re not trying to double-dip on this for PC, considering <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/03/08/gta-5-online-ps5-cheap-upgrade-pre-load-character-save-migration-xbox-series-x/">the triple-dip that console players saw</a>!</p>
<p>Here’s the breakdown from Rockstar:</p>

<ul>
<li>Enjoy a range of new vehicles and upgrades at Hao’s Special Works (HSW) that push automotive performance to new heights, and test your driving skills with Premium Test Rides, HSW Races, and HSW Time Trials.</li>
<li>Encounter Ambient Animals all across Southern San Andreas and take pictures of them to participate in the daily Wildlife Photography Challenge for new rewards.</li>
<li>PC players can sign up for GTA+ Membership to get special benefits in the upgraded version of <em>GTA Online</em> and beyond.</li>
<li>Track your criminal movements across all of <em>GTA Online</em>’s updates with the Career Progress feature as you build your empire.</li>
<li>Navigate a refreshed Landing Page as your starting destination to get straight into the action. Plus, take advantage of an improved introductory flow for newer players with a GTA$4,000,000 windfall to buy property, vehicles, and other items as you start off as an Executive, Gunrunner, Nightclub Owner or Biker in the Career Builder.</li>
</ul>

<p>On the technical side of things, there’s also:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ray tracing features only available on PC such as ambient occlusion and global illumination — plus ray traced shadows and reflections first debuted on consoles</li>
<li>Support for AMD FSR1 and FSR3, and NVIDIA DLSS 3</li>
<li>Faster loading times using SSD and DirectStorage on supported devices and configurations</li>
<li>Enhanced support for higher resolutions, higher aspect ratios, and higher framerates</li>
<li>DualSense controller support, with adaptive triggers</li>
<li>Enhanced audio with support for Dolby Atmos and improved fidelity of speech, cinematics, and music</li>
</ul>
<p>The reason why this is an optional upgrade is that the minimum requirements have increased. In particular on the GPU side of things, you’re jumping forward to the GeForce 1630 and Radeon 6400, compared to the GeForce 9800 GT 1GB / AMD HD 4870 1GB. You also need to run the game from an SSD.</p>

<p>One final oddity, this is all happening less than a year before the expected launch of GTA 6. Take Two has repeatedly affirmed that GTA 6 is expected to launch in late 2025, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/17/gta-6-targets-late-2025-release-date-as-take-two-narrows-launch-window/">since stating this release window last May</a>. That release is only for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, though, with Rockstar always preferring to turn to the PC after the consoles. Recent reports have suggested that GTA 6 could come to PC in early 2026, but we’ll just have to wait and see on that.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/new-tony-hawks-pro-skater-game-gets-another-major-tease/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-tony-hawk%E2%80%99s-pro-skater-game-gets-another-major-tease.1114674/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/new-tony-hawks-pro-skater-game-gets-another-major-tease/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The signs pointing to the next Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater game continue to find their way out, this time via a tease in a different Activision game.  </p>



<p>Spotted in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6’s Grind map, there is a skateboard area with a logo similar to that of Tony Hawk’s Pro Skate 1 + 2. Within that logo reads a date: March 4, 2025.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Coincidently, if you go by month-date-year formatting, the month and day equates to 3-4, the expected next remaster from the classic skateboarding series. </p>



<p>The latest tease comes just days after pro skater&nbsp;Tyshawn Jones said <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/a-new-tony-hawks-pro-skater-remaster-is-coming-skater-leaks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">during an interview</a> that a new game was “about to come out”. It was then followed up with claims from eXtas1s that the game will <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-thps-remasters-will-shadow-drop-at-xbox-summer-showcase-its-claimed/">be shadow dropped</a> when it launches.</p>



<p>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1+2—a remaster of the first two games—launched in 2020. That game was developed by Vicarious Visions, which has since been rebranded as Blizzard Albany after becoming fully merged into Blizzard Entertainment in 2022. There were talks that the follow up remaster was in development, but that it had been cancelled sometime in 2021-2022. In September 2024, however, Hawk himself said that there would be a future for the franchise as it celebrated its 25th Anniversary and that it was something <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tony-hawk-is-talking-to-activision-about-tony-hawk-pro-skater-series/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">he was excited about</a>.</p>



<p>“I’m not supposed to tease anything else about the future of the series, but there will be a future,” Hawk said <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tony-hawk-continues-to-tease-future-pro-skater-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via an Instagram post</a>.</p>



<p>Do you think the announcement of the next Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater game will happen on March 4? Or do you think it’s something different? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums.</a></p>

            <p>
One of my <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-rps-selection-box-edwins-bonus-games-of-the-year-2024">Xmas selection box games</a> last year was <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/withering-rooms">Withering Rooms</a>, a delightfully frightful haunted house action-RPG that balances mazey Metroidvania level design with the ability to be a witch who can supersize herself and gallop around on suits of magic armour. With a quick glance over my shoulder at our dear friend Sir Eugene Optimisation, I dare to describe it as a bit like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bloodborne">Bloodborne</a>, if Bloodborne had been made by a tiny independent developer. 
</p>
<p>
Also rather Bloodborney: the recently revealed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/withering-realms">Withering Realms</a>, a sequel of sorts in which you play a ghost girl clinging to the back of a customisable combat doll. Sir Eugene Optimisation requests I add here that the doll conceit reminds him of well-received Soulslike <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lies-of-p">Lies Of P</a>. Which is a fair observation, I think, though I would also say the doll’s lipless, one-eyed grimace reminds me of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mouthwashing">Mouthwashing</a>. How’s that, Eugene – three for three? Anyway, here’s a trailer.

<p>
As the title suggests, the key change here from Withering Rooms is that you’re no longer confined to a single house and grounds. Instead, you’ll get to “explore the mysterious town of Penwyll and the sprawling graveyards, tombs, caves and rotting estates that surround it”, with combat now unfolding on a full 3D plane. The year is 1926, but not as you may recall it if you happen to be 100 years old. In Withering Realms, the first World War was interrupted by an occult event which has caused the dead to walk and spirits to roam. It’s also given certain people the ability to cast spells.
</p>
<p>
The ghost girl is Clover, who died during the above occult event. She’s able to interact with the world only through the doll, which can thankfully be outfitted with a range of bludgeoning, carving or shooting implements, including a “pivoting greatsword” and a “chain rock”. The doll aside, Clover has an ally in “daring freelance investigator” Althea - one of the few other characters who can see her.
</p>
<p>
I still need to finish Withering Rooms but this looks like more of what I enjoyed about that game. There are some involved-sounding overworld mechanics: you can “expand the world map by defeating massive perimeter guardians”, and return to areas at night “to encounter new, horrifying creatures and secrets”.
</p>
<p>
Read more on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3441990/Withering_Realms/">Steam</a>. It’s slated to release in Q4 2025.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/new-details-on-nascar-25-career-mode-released/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>IRacing is deep in development of its first NASCAR console game, NASCAR  25, and it has released a new developer diary going over some of the features of the game’s career mode.</p>



<p>The diary first talks about the previous announcement that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nascar-25-to-feature-four-official-series-including-arca/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arca series is coming</a> to a console game for the first time. The series will  be available in career and other modes throughout NASCAR 25.</p>



<p>“So, why having Arca, Trucks, Xfinity and Cup is so important, especially from a design perspective, is we finally get to do what is a realistic career mode that somebody would actually follow in real life,” Director of Development and Production John Schneider said. </p>



<p>Elsewhere in the NASCAR 25 career mode, there will be opportunities to grow your driver’s brand off the track and spend your time. Players will be able to build their reputation by helping clean up a park, helping around the shop, or even have a part in a movie. Your sponsors might also have tasks for you that will help keep you in their good graces. </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="NASCAR '25 Dev Diary: Ep 03" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HKZeypm3tIA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>“You’ll have to balance between building your reputation and your brand, and being successful on the race track,” Dale Earnhardt Jr. said.</p>



<p>There will even be decisions on how you spend your money to improve your team and become a top contender in every series you enter. According to Mike Devault, the game’s UX lead, designing the career mode was a “herculean effort”.</p>



<p>“You want to make sure that you have all the right details in there about what makes a NASCAR career really authentic,” he said. “At the same time, you don’t want to make everybody have to go through all the minutia of managing a race team and the finances and the employees.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>“It’s a nice balance, and I think we’ve pulled this off really well in NASCAR 25 where if you want to just concentrate as being a driver, you can do that while mildly being involved in some of the decision making. But, if you want to go in there and manage every last little detail, you’re going to be able to do that as well.”</p>



<p>Devault added that throughout the career, interactions between driver, crew chief, and team will feel more authentic as opposed to being too much “like a UI screen.”</p>



<p>NASCAR 25 launches this fall for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, PC, and Nintendo Switch.</p>

			<p>Today, Arc Games and Snapshot Games (the creators of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/phoenix-point-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Phoenix Point</a>) have announced a new title from XCOM creator Julian Gollop. The game is called Chip ‘n Clawz vs. The Brainioids and it's a hybrid of action and strategy. Played from third-person view, it also offers the strategic depth of an RTS game, all set in a colorful, comic book-style world.</p>
<p>In Chip ‘n Clawz vs. The Brainioids, players must&nbsp; take the role of the heroes Chip or Clawz (or both characters in coop gameplay) to stop the Brainioid invasion. They will gather resources and collectibles, build bases, boost hero abilities, command minions, and fight alongside them in large-scale battles. The humorous story campaign features both normal and hard difficulty modes. There are also fast-paced, pick-up-and-play missions that, according to Snapshot, bring a modern twist to classic strategy games. There are even boss battles against the most powerful Brainioids.</p>
<p>In multiplayer, Chip ‘n Clawz vs. The Brainioids supports army battles with or against your friends, including two-player couch co-op. There are also various online modes, from the classic online 1v1 to 2v2. Online multiplayer also supports cross-platform play on PC and consoles.</p>
<p>Julian Gollop, CEO of Snapshot Games, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>At Snapshot Games, we recognize how much players really enjoy challenging real time strategy games but from our experience, we know that some players like a strategy game that’s easier to pick up and play, that’s a bit more action-packed and that’s fun to play with friends. With Chip ‘n Clawz vs. The Brainioids, we set out to create a dynamic and accessible action RTS experience that players can dive into together. We can’t wait for players to jump into the action, meet the game’s unique characters and enjoy the heroic adventures that await – starting with the demo in just a couple of days!</em></p>
<p><iframe title="Chip 'N Clawz vs. the Brainioids | Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VCdO-C0kpVM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The game will be <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1332430/Chip_N_Clawz_vs_The_Brainioids/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">playable</a> on PC in just four days during the upcoming Steam Next Fest. The demo will give players plenty of Chip n' Clawz action, between online and local campaign co-op and PvP multiplayer support, four mission levels, two challenge levels, two PvP maps, and plenty of weapons, mods, collectibles, and base building options.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/delta-force-console-versions-delayed-beyond-q1-to-ensure-input-fairness.1114593/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/delta-force-console-versions-delayed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Team Jade and publisher TiMi Studio Group have announced that the console versions of tactical shooter&nbsp;<em>Delta Force&nbsp;</em>will be delayed beyond 2025's first quarter.</p>

<p>During the sixth volume of the developer's "Ask Shadow Anything" Q&amp;A sessions, game director Shadow Guo provides an update on the PlayStation and Xbox versions of the game, which were originally scheduled to launch sometime early this year.</p>

<p>According to Shadow, although development on&nbsp;<em>Delta Force</em>'s console versions is "going well", the release date has been postponed so that the developer can ensure "input fairness" for players of "different skill levels".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/delta-force-console-delayed-q1-aiming.jpg?itok=iX32dv97 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/delta-force-console-delayed-q1-aiming.jpg?itok=kpkRLXl4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Delta Force&nbsp;</em>isn't coming to consoles in the first quarter of this year.</figcaption></figure><p>Shadow says one of the main challenges of making a tactical shooter for consoles is making sure that players can "have a fair and balanced aiming experience", and that this is a "key issue" the team is currently hoping to solve.</p>

<p>It's not all that's holding the console versions of&nbsp;<em>Delta Force&nbsp;</em>back, though. Shadow also says the team is currently working on "optimizing the UI and overall interactions in the Operations mode", going on to say that adapting the UI for consoles in this regard is "complex".</p>

<p>If you're disappointed in the delay, Shadow says that a detailed roadmap regarding console development for&nbsp;<em>Delta Force&nbsp;</em>will soon be released, giving you a glimpse into "the progress and tasks we complete periodically".</p>

<p>As for the rest of the video, Shadow provides updates on hot-button issues like a kill cam, addressing performance issues, and progression wipes for the Operations mode. You can check out the full Q&amp;A session (don't worry, it's pretty short!) right here.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Delta Force</em>, it's a free-to-play tactical shooter based on the long-running shooter series of the same name.</p>

<p>The game comes complete with a range of multiplayer modes, as well as a campaign that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/delta-force-campaign-january" rel="nofollow">retells the events also depicted in the 2001 movie&nbsp;<em>Black Hawk Down</em></a>. Said campaign launches tomorrow, having been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/delta-force-campaign-delayed" rel="nofollow">delayed from its original release window</a>.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Delta Force&nbsp;</em>right now <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2507950/Delta_Force/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">for free on PC</a>. Console versions are also on the way, but as today's Q&amp;A revealed, we don't quite know when yet. Stay tuned for more.</p>

Sandworm-bothering MMO <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a> will release on 20th May, developers Funcom have announced, and you can start tailoring your very own Arrakish (I swear it's a canonical term) adventurer by means of the just-released character creator. Any desert delver you produce with said creator can be imported to the full game at launch. 
</p>
<p>
Inspired by Monster Hunter's Hunting Horn, I've recently gotten into the habit of making characters who look like Jethro Tull's Ian Anderson. I'm not sure Dune: Awakening has sufficiently puckish hair to support this - not many big frizzy gingers in the Dune universe, in my experience. But I'm willing to give it a shot, for science. Anyway, here's a trailer.

<a aria-label="Dune: Awakening — Release Date Reveal Trailer" data-lightbox="false" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gl6Wi20fSp0?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">

</a>
</p>

<p>
And here's some blurb about that character creator: "Fine-tune every aspect of your looks, then choose your home planet, caste, and mentor, be it Swordmaster, Bene Gesserit, Mentat, or Trooper. The final choice determines your starting abilities, but you will gain access to every School eventually, and can even mix and match abilities from any of them."
</p>
<p>
The character creator accompanies a benchmark mode, which "lets you check your hardware performance and system compatibility while being treated to some epic scenes from the game, including soaring with an ornithopter and a dramatic encounter with a colossal sandworm." 
</p>
<p>
In the full game, sandworms are a persistent threat that roam the world and are drawn to the sound of players using thumpers, mining spice melange or just walking around on the bare sand. As I discussed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sandworms-are-the-spice-in-dune-awakenings-otherwise-quite-familiar-survival-simming">in my preview last year</a>, you can lure the worm into attacking rival spice miners. I think this is the part of Dune: Awakening that most has my interest. The idea of building another base and levelling up doesn't really grip me, as much as I like the setting.
</p>
<p>

            <p>Chirpy cockney urchin Strauss Zelnick recently hailed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-publishers-think-pc-is-of-increasing-importance-in-2025-but-still-wont-announce-the-magic-date">the "increasing" importance of the PC market</a> in the lead up to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">Grand Theft Auto 6</a>'s release this autumn. Could it mean we're getting the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world</a> crimeathon the same time as consoles? Buddy, we don't even get <em>updates</em> the same time as consoles. Things might be speeding up on that front at least, based on an email Colin Rockstar sent us earlier. On March 4th, they're giving us some nice gubbins for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a> that they previously saw fit to exclusively roll out on machines that don't even have the original <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/minesweeper">Minesweeper</a>.</p>
<p>The upgrade is free "with a one-time Character Migration flow to bring over your Story Mode and Online progress", and offers new vehicles and vehicle performance upgrades, animal encounters, new graphics options, and faster loading time. There's also a "and much more" in there but Colin loves saying that. You can find the full details on <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/akk98a4o755825/free-upgrade-for-grand-theft-auto-v-on-pc-coming-march-4">Rockstar's website here</a>.</p>

<p>I gave up on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/red-dead-online">Red Dead Online</a> once it became apparent that Rockstar sneered so hard they tasted their own nostrils every time someone mentioned it, but animal photography feels like a direct transplant from there, no? I haven't touched GTA 5 for years, mind, so I'm not sure if it was already in the game. The update will also feature "recent player experience improvements for GTA Online, including kernel-based anti-cheat protections, and proactive voice chat moderation to help keep GTA Online safe, secure and fun for everyone". Thanks Colin!</p>
<p>In other crime news, Rockstar Games have been reportedly been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-may-let-you-modify-its-own-map-using-roblox-style-user-creation-features-claims-report">thinking about letting GTA 6 players modify the game’s map</a> with Roblox and Fortnite-style creation mechanics.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Facebook changed its name to Meta, invested billions in virtual reality tech nobody seems to want, and then quickly pivoted to the next investor craze: generative AI. “This year likely determines whether this entire effort will go down as the work of visionaries or a legendary misadventure,” Meta chief technology officer Andrew “Boz” Bosworth wrote in an <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-cto-metaverse-reality-labs-legendary-misadventure-memo-2025-2&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-cto-metaverse-reality-labs-legendary-misadventure-memo-2025-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">internal memo earlier this month</a></span>. </p><figure id="" data-id="e82e74fbf556ebf8e7d1f2a9df86fa27" data-recommend-id="image://e82e74fbf556ebf8e7d1f2a9df86fa27" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A fire appears in front of a snowy forest.

The upcoming Steam game is essentially a first-person walking sim in an 8x8km open world where you try to get across a map from the cabin you spawn in to a weather tower somewhere off in the distance. You need to worry about food, warmth, and surviving environmental hazards like lightning and snow storms caused by a dynamic weather system.</p><p>So, yes, <em>Prologue</em>’s emergent sandbox is far from the bullet-flying drama of <em>PUBG</em>. Having spent a little time with the beta version, I would even say it’s kind of boring. Imagine the narrative-driven first-person adventure <em>Firewatch</em> but without any of the story, characters, and intrigue. Greene joked that some staff consider <em>Prologue</em> a bit of a horror game because they think they’re hearing noises that aren’t really there. There is certainly plenty of room for more authored mystery in <em>Prologue</em>, but right now it mostly seems like a wilderness sim aimed at self-directed exploration and player-generated anecdotes. </p><p>“Kim [Nordstrom], our CEO, in one of the early builds, he spawned in a broken cabin with no clothing, and it was snowing, and he was like, ‘Damn, I’m going to die,’” Greene recalled. “And there was not much he could do at that point, like he tried to light a fire, but the snow came in and he died of hypothermia, just because that’s the type of the game it is.” He continued, “I’ve heard a bunch of, like, people waiting overnight on top of a mountain, then getting a vista as the sun comes up and not realizing they were there and and these kind of lovely moments, because the worlds are new every time. So every time you play, you get a slightly different experience.”</p><p>Like <em>No Man’s Sky</em>, <em>Prologue </em>uses procedural generation to create billions of possible open-world maps. Machine learning agents trained on satellite data and other sources of real-world terrain info create <em>Prologue</em>’s worlds, and then PlayerUnknown Productions developers go in and fine-tune the results to try to maximize the potential for interesting emergent scenarios as players try to cross rivers and mountains to get to their destination. Currently, a successful playthrough might take one to two hours, but the team is currently looking at ramping up the difficulty to make each hike more of a challenge. </p><p>While <em>Prologue</em> conducted player tests throughout the second half of last year, it’s clear Greene is excited to finally get the game into more people’s hands. He said he wants to build the game “with players,” and all of the new feedback and experimentation will no doubt be invaluable for proving if the map generation tech powering the <em>PUBG</em> creator’s vision, an engine called Project Melba, is robust enough to scale into massively multiplayer games and beyond. </p><p>That includes a second game consisting of millions of square kilometers of open world and millions of players to fill it. Think MMO survival sim <em>Rust </em>but on a completely different scale, the same way battle royale games turned traditional 6v6 deathmatches into sprawling 100-player affairs. And if that ends up working, the ultimate goal is <em>Artemis</em>, a sort of open-source, high-fidelity <em>Roblox</em> in which players build all different kinds of worlds and can move between them seamlessly. This metaverse, a 3D version of the internet as Greene calls it, is the long-term goal, potentially 10-15 years away, guiding <em>Prologue</em>’s development like a north star. </p><p>Even that might be overly ambitious. PlayerUnknown Productions is currently just 60 people split between the game and engine sides. Although Greene announced the team in 2021 (which remains independent), it took years to get anything out the door, like December’s <em>Preface</em>, essentially a demo for <em>Prologue</em>’s map generation tech. Though Greene is a visionary game designer (he was making battle royales long before PUBG blew up), he might not actually be that great at running a game studio.</p><p>“I’ve been trying to get this survival game made for about three and a half years, and I thought it was a simple premise, right?” he said. “It’s a new world every time, and then just a simple survival loop, I’m not asking for a moon and the stars here.” Greene said the core team was great but the leadership level, which he was responsible for, wasn’t working out. </p><p>A couple of years ago, though, a new executive team came in, including CEO Nordstrom (former chief strategy officer at Paradox Interactive), CTO Laurent Gorga (former tech director at Hangar 13), executive producer Petter Sydow (former producer at Massive Entertainment) and creative director Scott Davidson (former art director at Facepunch Studios). Gorga told Greene he wanted something released within a year when he joined, and things finally started moving. “Before was a little bit sort of siloed, and people were working on different things,” Greene said. “Now we’re fully integrated.”</p><p><em>Prologue</em> is being built with Unreal Engine but the goal for future installments, or “stepping stones over a pond” as Greene calls them, is to transition away from proprietary technology and tools to exclusively relying on in-house tech like Melba and open-source solutions. After all, you can’t create the future of the internet with player connection and creativity shackled by licensing agreements. Greene’s vision flies in the face of what Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney is currently doing with <em>Fortnite</em>, whose battle royale mode was once sued by <em>PUBG</em>’s publisher for copying it, and which has also recently tried to become more of a platform for <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/lego-fortnite-free-minecraft-review-epic-games-1851140950&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/lego-fortnite-free-minecraft-review-epic-games-1851140950">world building than just a single game</a></span>. </p><figure id="" data-id="ce03d2039ece13c4360c10c4e92c164b" data-recommend-id="image://ce03d2039ece13c4360c10c4e92c164b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A sun rises over a mountain range.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>“What I’m trying to build  is like trying to build the internet again, but in 3D so Melba, our engine, will be HTTP, essentially, it’ll be a protocol level that will generate whole worlds that just are all interoperable because they all share the same engine which is open source so everyone can build on it,” he said. “And that’s what I hope the metaverse should be, right? That it shouldn’t be controlled by large corporations that are essentially IP bubbles, hoping you’ll come and, you know, look at their IP, and then maybe sometime in the future, these two companies, or 10 companies, will talk to each other, and you’ll have interoperability. I don’t get that. I don’t see that as a metaverse.”</p><p>The machine learning powering Melba will be the key to achieving this, which is why <em>Prologue</em> itself doesn’t need to be a great game to succeed. If it proves out the tech, it will still have been worth it. “We want to give you access to the API or to the code so if you want to build your own tools in a different way, you should be free to do that,” Greene said. “But at least at our layer, I want it very much like a holodeck  where you can tell it what you want and [Melba] generates it. Or you can easily draw a map on an in-game mini-map to draw the track for a motocross race you want, because you found a cool location in the world, and the game will do the rest. But that’s why I’m saying 10 to 15, years, because I think that level of tech and ease, it’s still some time off.”</p><p>For now, however, the focus is on Prologue. An Early Access rollout on Steam this year will begin building it into a more fully-fledged game, with new content and mechanics added along the way of the team responding to feedback, bugs, and balancing issues. A current river spawning issue can make it look like the seas parting for Moses on some maps, and one of the jackets players can currently find in the game is overpowered at the moment. But <em>Prologue</em>’s strict survival sim systems and austere presentation are likely to remain at its core. </p><p>“There was originally an idea I had of having a training mode where it sort of highlights all the objects, makes it more like a very basic training mode of ‘this is the world,’” Greene said. “We’ll see if we can add it during early access. But at the moment, I mean, my games are just, as I saw on Reddit, just ‘well fuck you get better,’ right? And I feel it should be continued in this game. It’s like, look, if you like it, great, otherwise, there’s 1,000s of other games out there.”</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>After the launch of Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 last year, it looks like developer Saber Interactive will be working on another game based on a famous IP.

project. The Warhammer 40K sequel was developed by Saber St. Petersburg, which is one of several subsidiaries owned by the company. As for the IP that Saber will be adapting, that remains a mystery for now, as Hasbro owns multiple brands like Transformers, GI Joe, Dungeons &amp; Dragons, Magic the Gathering, My Little Pony, and Peppa Pig.</p><p>This is also one of several video game projects in development, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-magic-the-gathering-and-dungeons-dragons-video-games-are-on-the-way/1100-6527911/">Invoke Studios is working on a new Dungeons &amp; Dragons game</a>, Atomic Arcade is handling a GI Joe spin-off starring Snake Eyes, and Austin-based studio Skeleton Key is working on a mystery project. A Transformers game would likely be a good fit for Saber, as this is one IP that fans of the franchise have been requesting to see more of.</p><p>While Transformers hasn't been dormant in the video game space, recent releases like Galactic Trials and Earthspark Expedition haven't quite managed to scratch the itch for Autobot action in the same way that games like War for Cybertron or Transformers: Devastation did when they were released back in the 2010s.</p><p>Sadly, one promising Transformers game, Transformers: Reactivate, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/transformers-reactivate-canceled/1100-6528693/">was canceled earlier this year</a> after having been in development at British studio Splash Damage.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/space-marine-2-devs-working-on-new-aaa-game-using-tentpole-hasbro-ip.1114551/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/space-marine-2-devs-hasbro-tentpole-ip<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hasbro has announced that the&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k: Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>development team is currently working on an AAA game based on one of the tabletop giant's "tentpole" IPs.</p>

<p>The news comes courtesy of an earnings call to mark Hasbro revealing its fourth-quarter financials earlier today (thanks, <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/02/saber-interactive-developing-aaa-game-based-on-tentpole-hasbro-ip" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Gematsu</a>). In that call, CEO Chris Cocks said the new game, which will be developed by&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>studio Saber, will combine "high-octane single-player action and amazing multiplayer".</p>

<p>Cocks went on to say that the game will utilize Saber's Swarm technology, presumably referring to the Swarm Engine on which&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>runs, alongside games like&nbsp;<em>SnowRunner&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>World War Z</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/space-marine-2-devs-hasbro-tentpole-ip-shooting.jpg?itok=-4Dr23Sw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/space-marine-2-devs-hasbro-tentpole-ip-shooting.jpg?itok=V0ZNWTKF 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Space Marine 2</em>'s development studio will be working with Hasbro on one of the latter's "tentpole" IPs.</figcaption></figure><p>It's worth noting that the Swarm tech to which Cocks refers doesn't necessarily mean we'll be seeing the same kind of massive hordes of enemies present in both&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>World War Z</em>; it's the name for the engine, after all, rather than just that one feature.</p>

<p>As for which IP Cocks is referring to, Hasbro is naturally playing those cards very close to its chest, and I use those words advisedly.</p>

<p>IPs the company controls include&nbsp;<em>Magic: The Gathering</em>, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/magic-gathering-movie-is-coming-courtesy-of-hasbro-and-legendary-pictures" rel="nofollow">getting a Legendary Pictures-produced movie</a>, potentially making it a solid candidate for a new AAA video game.</p>

<p>Other potential IPs might include&nbsp;<em>Transformers</em>, although the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/transformers-reactivate-canceled-as-splash-damage-staff-at-risk-of-redundancy" rel="nofollow">cancellation of Splash Damage's&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/transformers-reactivate-canceled-as-splash-damage-staff-at-risk-of-redundancy" rel="nofollow">Transformers: Reactivate</a>&nbsp;</em>might put a dent in that theory, as well as&nbsp;<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>,&nbsp;<em>Power Rangers</em>, and, uh,&nbsp;<em>Peppa Pig</em>. Yeah, it's probably that last one.</p>

<p>Of course, if it is&nbsp;<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>-related, Saber and Hasbro will have to make sure they don't repeat the mistakes of the genuinely awful&nbsp;<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Dark Alliance</em>, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dungeons-dragons-dark-alliance-delisted-february" rel="nofollow">being delisted next week</a>.</p>

<p>It is, however, probably safe to assume that we're not about to see a major AAA game based on&nbsp;<em>Monopoly&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>Cluedo</em>, as sad as I am about that. It's also unlikely we'll hear anything more about this one for quite a while, so stay tuned.</p>
