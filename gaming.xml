            <p><strong>Warning</strong>: Spoilers for Cyberpunk 2077 lie ahead.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>'s narrative really kicks into gear when, after a job gone wrong, metal-infused merc protagonist V realises they're now living in the shadow of a Keanu Reeves-shaped clock. Despite this, you're free to while away hours doing a million things other than confronting your urgent mortality problem. It's something even CD Projekt themselves have <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/cyberpunk.net/post/3m7sfrres7s2l">joked about</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Prior to the heist going askew, however, there's an opening section in which V's working their way up through the ranks of Night City's underworld alongside Jackie Welles. This bit can last a while if you're happy to run after every side quest right out of the gate, but a lot of folks breeze through it, keen to be whisked into exploring all of the game's metropolis as rapidly as the action plays out in the cutscene which fast-forwards through most of the time Jackie and V spend making a name for themselves. So, in hindsight, would CD Projekt have benefitted from having this section of the main narrative run a bit longer? In the eyes of Cyberpunk 2 creative director Igor Sarzynski, the answer's a firm no, a view he's explained in a flurry of posts.</p>
<p>Writing on BlueSky (as spotted by <a href="https://frvr.com/blog/cyberpunk-2-director-says-extending-2077s-opening-act-makes-no-sense/">FRVR</a>), Sarzynski addressed the question of extending the pre-heist act head on, arguing that it wouldn't make for a better experience and is "like saying we should spend more time on Tatooine with farmer Luke before he got involved with all this Jedi stuff". Random shade thrown at uncle Owen and aunt Beru aside, Sarzynski's argument for this section working better as is revolves around the idea that the main perceived benefit of giving folks more time to bond with Jackie before, er, that thing happens to him at Konpeki Plaza wouldn't outweigh the drawbacks of a more drawn-out arc prior to the fatal twist in V's tale.</p>
<blockquote data-bluesky-cid="bafyreifv6rfa5ld57n7bcs76xz3qvtgxvouymheiga6sninoay3s5zuvza" data-bluesky-embed-color-mode="system" data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:nkkdls4c67lfagg735y7ywpq/app.bsky.feed.post/3mbokwdsals27"><div lang="en"><p>So would extending Act 1 (before the heist) in CP77 make the game better?

1. No it wouldn't. It's like saying we should spend more time on Tatooine with farmer Luke before he got involved with all this Jedi stuff.

</span></p><p>"The motivation/goal in this section of the game is pretty vague - 'get to the top' - which, prolonged and without stakes or pressure would result in meandering, unfocused experience," the developer argued, acknowledging that it is possible at current to spend up to 20 hours or so just exploring Watson during the pre-heist arc. As to whether the section as is offers enough time to grow close to Jackie and make what happens to him bear the emotional weight it's designed to, Sarzynski admitted that'll vary from player to player, but added: "All things considered, I think we struck a good balance."</p><p>The start of Cyberpunk sometimes feeling like a bit of a rush to get everything in position for the main narrative arc to really kick off with the introduction of Silverhand and the relic's long been an aspect of it that I've seen not necessarily as bad, but certainly something that could potentially have been improved. The cutscene montage of early jobs definitely made it harder initially for me to fully buy into the elements of the story surrounding clawing your way to Night City legend status. Ostensibly watching someone else blast through the start of that path in sped up fashion takes you out of it a bit, and you don't get as full a picture of day-to-day life with Jackie as you otherwise might.</p>
<p>There's also the matter of the game unfolding in a manner which inundates you with side stuff which essentially feels like pushing snooz on a threat of death which is supposed to feel inescapable and crushing from act two onwards. Sarzynski <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/srznsk.bsky.social/post/3mboxdpmils2f">acknowledged that here</a>, writing: "If I were to do it again, I'd contextualize gigs and sidequests as escaping death in a different way - by creating your own legend. And maybe gate a specific ending behind doing enough side content." So, possibly a lesson which could be applied in some fashion to Cyberpunk 2 there.</p>
<p>On the other hand, as someone who feels <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/red-dead-redemption-2">Red Dead Redemption 2</a> - a game which also draws plenty of good from its general commitment to taking the lengthy and massively detailed route - start to drag a bit as its Western epic tale trots from the mid-game towards the end, I can very much see Sarzynski's point about act one.</p>
<p>Both approaches can make for great games. In my book, a bigger issue in the base version of Cyberpunk arguably suffers due to is Johnny Silverhand's regular presence and commentary sometimes feeling like it can undercut that game's ability not to fill moments of silence that'd be perfect for Bladerunner-style broody contemplation with chatter that may not add much to proceedings. That's a balance I felt was nailed a lot better in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-review">Phantom Liberty</a>, simply by having Songbird cut in as a second voice in your head and offer some variety in outside perspective on events.</p>
<p>As for Jackie, it's a bit of a cold way to put it given his fate, but I think he's got just enough of a presence to fulfil his narrative role of early-game buddy cut down in his prime.</p>

              <p>Things get so busy during day-to-day life because there’s always something new to tackle. A great computer or tablet can make juggling it all a little less frustrating.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a single 2-in-1 device that provides the ability to perform real-world work and has the qualities of a tablet, the Microsoft Surface Pro 2-in-1 Laptop/ Tablet (2024) is that choice. This 13-inch Copilot+ PC comes with a very clear, interactive touch-screen that converts to a canvas, notebook and full laptop upon attaching a keyboard. With the Surface Pro 2-in-1 Laptop/Tablet (2024), you can replace an old laptop and a tablet with one light weight device that is highly versatile.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6668/">You can purchase the Microsoft Surface Pro 2-in-1 Laptop/Tablet (2024) on Amazon today for $989.99 which is $510 less than the original price of $1,499.99 or 34% off.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6668/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A flexible laptop and tablet hybrid for plenty of use cases</h2>
<p>Your first impression of the device will be of the 13-inch touch-screen display. The large 13 inch screen allows for ample amounts of viewing area for multiple applications open at the same time, viewing high definition images and reading comfortably. The clarity of the text is excellent, colors appear vibrant for creative professionals, and the aspect ratio of the display offers a wide viewable area for viewing web pages and documents; even watching movies. Additionally, you can use all the normal gestures of a tablet such as tapping, swiping, and pinching, and, when you need to utilize the Surface Pro 2-in-1 Laptop/Tablet as a more conventional laptop, simply place it upright using the built-in kick stand. When paired with a Surface keyboard and Surface Pen, you create a perfect combination for writing and sketching that still makes for a convenient and portable solution to pack in a backpack.</p>



<p>It’s super easy to change form factors if you’re looking to use the Surface Pro 2-in-1 to its full potential. You can use it flat as a tablet to read books, annotate PDF files, or draw pictures. But you can also tilt the Surface Pro 2-in-1 upright with the the kick stand to watch videos, join online meeting/video conferencing sessions, etc., and attach the Surface keyboard when you need to type.</p>
<p>All told, the Surface Pro 2-in-1 Laptop/Tablet (2024) has everything most users need to be a super flexible device. It’s the perfect alternative to an iPad or other on-the-go laptop and tablet, and you won’t have to go broke picking one up if you need that kind of versatility. We suggest picking it up now before it’s all sold out, because you might not see this Surface at such a price point again for some time.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Embark Studios is enjoying a rampant run through the extraction space since releasing ARC Raiders on October 30. The transformative, disruptive title has shaken up the genre and emerged as a stellar, best-selling game that has taken the world by storm. But it might not end with it being <strong>just a game</strong>.</p>



<p>The CEO of Embark Studios, Patrick Söderlund, recently revealed that multiple companies have reached out to pitch an ARC Raiders television show or movie. While he believes the IP would align quite nicely with alternate media, the studio is reluctant to do anything until they’re <strong>doing it right</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-would-arc-raiders-work-as-a-tv-show">Would ARC Raiders Work as a TV Show?</h2>



<p>In a recent interview with GamesBeat, which was hosted while <strong>playing ARC Raiders</strong>, Patrick Söderlund&nbsp;and Nexon CEO Owen Mahoney spoke about all things extraction. They touched on the future of the game, how it came to be, and even offered some insider tips on dominating the game’s multiple maps.</p>



<p>During the interview, the topic of an ARC Raiders TV show or movie came up, and Söderlund&nbsp;explained that Embark Studios has been approached numerous times.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I can’t tell you how many companies have reached out wanting to make a TV series and movie out of this IP.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He then stressed that it ‘needs to be done in the right way’ and suggested it would ‘be fun to see’ ARC Raiders represented in that medium.</p>



<p>Here’s the full interview:</p>

</p></figure>







<p>ARC Raiders is nothing short of a cinematic marvel. The world-building is unparalleled, and each raid topside goes hand-in-hand with a sense of unpredictability that few games can truly capitalize on.</p>



<p>Live-action adaptations of video games are exploding these days. From the success of The Minecraft Movie and Super Mario Bros. to the ongoing unravelling of Fallout and The Last of Us in television form, fans of these games are lapping up every adaptation that hits the market.</p>



<p>ARC Raiders would likely do phenomenally well as a television series written to tell the backstory of the ARC invasion and how the survivors make their way into and ultimately dwell within the relatively safe walls of Speranza.</p>

			<p>Today, Japanese publisher <strong>Square Enix</strong> has revealed that a demo of <strong>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</strong> will be available tomorrow (<strong>January 7, 2026</strong>) on all platforms. Data from the demo's save file can be transferred to the full game, allowing players to continue where they left off. Moreover, everyone who plays the demo will receive the 'Day Off Dress' costume for Maribel to use in the final game.</p>



<p>We first heard about a Dragon Quest VII remake in July 2025, when a rumor <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-quest-vii-remake-in-the-works/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suggested</a> a potential 2026 or early 2027 launch</strong>. <span>The official confirmation came just a couple of months later, in September 2025, when, during a Nintendo Direct</span>, Square Enix&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-annuounced-for-an-early-2026-release-on-pc-and-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a>&nbsp;the planned release date of&nbsp;<strong>February 5, 2026</strong>,&nbsp;for PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S and X, and Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>With this remake, the publisher has gone in an entirely different direction than with the recent <strong>HD-2D</strong> style featured in the <strong>Dragon Quest I–III remakes</strong>. Square Enix collaborated with developer <strong>HEXADRIVE</strong> (<strong>Monkey King: Hero Is Back</strong>, <strong>Voidcrisis</strong>) to craft a <strong>hand-painted diorama aesthetic</strong> that treats the game world as a miniature landscape populated by three-dimensional, doll-like characters. The character models themselves derive from actual physical dolls created during development, a deliberate choice to evoke <strong>Akira Toriyama</strong>'s original character designs.</p>



<p>In a slightly controversial move, Square Enix <strong>deliberately cut three entire islands</strong> and converted four others to optional sidequests, directly addressing <strong>the original's bloated 100+ hour structure</strong>. However, new content compensates: expanded character backstories, a new Kiefer scenario, and hints at an alternative ending absent from prior versions. The game now also supports non-linear progression, allowing players to tackle episodic arcs in varying order once the tablet fragments have been collected.</p>



<p>The signature vocation system also received a comprehensive redesign in Dragon Quest VII Reimagined. The 50+ vocation roster is now streamlined to 20 per character, with "Moonlighting" enabling dual-vocation equipping and simultaneous progression. Most critically, the Career Sphere menu eliminates the dreaded mandatory backtracking to Alltrades Abbey. Monster vocations are now Monster Hearts (accessories), while a new Monster Master vocation consolidates scattered abilities. Lastly, the producer <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-will-feature-a-brand-new-ending-producer-confirms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that <strong>there is a new ending in the remake</strong>.</p>



<p>Starting tomorrow with the demo, everyone will be able to experience some of these changes firsthand and judge for themselves. By the way, Square Enix has also just released the opening movie of Dragon Quest VII Reimagined. Check it out in the embedded video below.</p>

            <p>In what has become <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/amds-ryzen-9000x3d-processors-with-their-fancy-pants-cache-are-launching-november-7th">CPU tradition</a>, AMD have announced a new fastest-ever gaming processor to replace their last fastest-ever gaming processor. The newcomer, detailed at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/events/ces-2026">CES 2026</a>, is the Ryzen 7 9850X3D, which actually shares the same architecture, socket, core and thread counts, and power usage rating as the erstwhile big dog, the Ryzen 7 9800X3D. It’s mainly a quicker maximum boost clock, up from 5.2GHz to 5.6GHz, that grants it a performance edge.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>And cor, what a fine edge it is. By AMD’s reckoning, the Ryzen 7 9850X3D averages 27% better framerate results in games than Intel’s best offering, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/intel-bets-on-efficiency-with-the-power-sipping-core-ultra-200s-series">Core Ultra 9 285K</a>. The Ryzen 7 9800X3D? 24% better. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tep42MpeD_Y&amp;list=PLTU_E21aX_rgRFQRrnvYySBt24dQUTXQC">Destroyed in seconds</a>.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>The 9850X3D is out in Q1 2026, i.e. between January and March. There’s no pricing info yet, so we don’t know much extra that 3% will cost ya, though it’s probably worth noting that CPUs have seemingly been spared from the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/one-of-pc-gamings-key-ram-manufacturers-arent-selling-to-regular-humans-anymore-so-they-can-peddle-more-kit-to-ai-companies">stock disaster currently engulfing RAM and SSDs</a> (and threatening to drag in graphics cards while it’s at it). As such, any big bump over the Ryzen 7 9800X3D’s $479 launch price would be, at best, extremely cheeky. Here be specs, in any case:</p>
<h3>AMD Ryzen 7 9850X3D specs</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Architecture:</strong> Zen 5</li>
<li><strong>Socket:</strong> AM5</li>
<li><strong>Cores:</strong> 8</li>
<li><strong>Threads:</strong> 16</li>
<li><strong>Base clock:</strong> 4.7GHz</li>
<li><strong>Max boost clock:</strong> 5.6GHz</li>
<li><strong>L1 cache:</strong> 640KB</li>
<li><strong>L2 cache:</strong> 8MB</li>
<li><strong>L3 cache:</strong> 96MB</li>
<li><strong>TDP:</strong> 120W</li>
<li><strong>Max temp:</strong> 95°c</li>
</ul>
<p>Speaking of the 9800X3D, any healthy computer-owning mind should keep a guard up around superlatives, but I’ve got one in the RPS Test Rig and it kinda <em>is</em> the fastest gaming CPU. Or, at least, it was. Now that there’s a newer version, I’ve naturally had to spend the morning berating it for its idleness and incompetence, which is why this post is only going live several hours after AMD’s announcement.</p>

            <p>An <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> player calling for help while playing the game had their door kicked in by a concerned neighbour, who thought their wails were a sign of real-world distress.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ARC_Raiders/comments/1q35psm/neighbor_heard_me_yelling_help_in_arc_raiders/">User Dreamthorp on the Arc Raiders Reddit</a> was house-sitting for a friend and decided to boot up some Arc Raiders. While playing ,they claim to have been calling to their squadmates for help when a nearby neighbour heard the commotion. Fearing the worst, they came to the rescue, kicking the door.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the door didn't break thanks to the two deadbolts keeping it locked and secure. Dreamthorp claims that the friend they were house-sitting finds the whole situation funny, and the whole story has a happy ending, with Dreamthorp posting a picture of a six-pack of Shiners left at the neighbour's door as thanks.</p>

<p>As revealed in a post from the game's <a href="https://x.com/FFT_TIC/status/2008358164459102588">Twitter account</a>, The Ivalice Chronicles has surpassed 1 million copies sold across all platforms in just three months, which isn't bad going for a remake of a '90s tactical RPG.</p>
<p>"We'd like to express our sincere gratitude to everyone who has supported us," the announcement post reads (translated via Google), "We hope you continue to enjoy the game".</p><div><figure data-videoid="KK3nTYgZ9yY" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KK3nTYgZ9yY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytKK3nTYgZ9yY" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/KK3nTYgZ9yY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KK3nTYgZ9yY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed6205b9iqszko&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

The studio has its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined">Dragon Quest VII: Reimagined</a> demo launching on Switch and Switch 2 tomorrow, ahead of the <strong>5th February</strong> release date. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a> arrives later this month, and we're still waiting on more news about the catchily-titled <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/adventures-of-elliot-the-millennium-tales">The Adventures of Elliot: The Millennium Tales</a>.

                <p>Asus has hit the Consumer Electronics Show show floor with a brand-new set of Extended Reality glasses. Developed in partnership with Xreal, the Asus ROG Xreal R1 packs an impressive amount of technology into a slim frame for your face, allowing you to stream video directly to your eyes via a USB-C connection.</p><p>Internally, the Asus ROG Xreal R1 features 240Hz micro-OLED 1080p lenses, and it comes with an ROG Control Dock for HDMI and DisplayPort connectivity. You can also connect it to an ROG Ally via a single USB-C cable for a seamless experience. Asus says the lenses can create a 57-degree field of view and a 171-inch virtual screen at a distance of four virtual meters, covering 95% of the focused viewing area.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbIIPM7Lsrg" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mbIIPM7Lsrg" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>As you'd expect from Asus, these glasses also match the company's Republic of Gamers aesthetic, with RGB lighting on the sides. Weighing just 91 grams, the glasses also have built-in Bose speakers, and electrochromic technology allows the lenses to tint automatically or on demand to suit varying lighting conditions. Pricing has yet to be announced, but Asus aims to launch the glasses in the first half of 2026.</p><p>This is one of several major announcements from Asus at CES 2026. Fans of the ROG gaming laptops can also expect several new models to arrive throughout the year, including a massively updated version of the Asus ROG Zephyrus Duo. This new version features <em>two</em> 120Hz OLED HDR 1displays, each 16 inches, and a detachable wireless keyboard.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/06/our-most-wanted-games-of-2026-30-to-26/</link>
            <guid>1398058</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>We are now in the top 30 of our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/most-wanted-2026">Most Wanted Games of 2026</a> and here we’re hitting a mix of sequels, prequels, a much anticipated horror, and what could prove to be the ultimate mashup that will dominate 2026. Scroll down to find out what games have got into our top 30.</p>
<h2>30 – Slay The Spire II</h2>
<p><em>PC – “A secret Thursday in March 2026”</em></p>
<p>It was in early 2024 when we learned that smash-hit rogulike deckbuilder <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/slay-the-spire">Slay The Spire</a> would be <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/04/15/slay-the-spire-2-announced-with-early-access-in-2025/">getting a sequel</a>, and it’s safe to say it has big shoes to fill. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/slay-the-spire-2">Slay The Spire II</a> is separated by 1000 years from the original game, which means new slayers, new cards, and new potions to use in the challenge to beat the Spire, which will contain new challenges.</p>
<p><iframe title="Slay the Spire 2 - Official Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ttVtllHkb4E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Slay The Spire II was meant to be released into early access in 2025, with Mega Crit envisioning a year to 18 months before a full release. However, development delays meant early access did not take place when initially planned, instead now penned in for March 2026. We can only hope that Slay The Spire II is more worthy successor rather than the difficult second album.</p>

<h2>29 – Resonance: A Plague Tale Legacy</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – 2026</em></p>
<p>It was in mid-2025 when Asobo Studio revealed <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/08/resonance-a-plague-tale-legacy-revealed-as-a-prequel-spin-off/">Resonance: A Plague Tale Legacy</a>, giving us a new game in the A Plague Tale universe, though setting it 15 years before the events of the main games. This spin-off sees a new main character in Sophia, a plunderer who finds herself on Minotaur Island fighting and trying to evade an army that is chasing her, with the possibility that the Minotaur will also make an appearance.</p>
<p><iframe title="Resonance: A Plague Tale Legacy - Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lroYak-ryyM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The description for Resonance: A Plague Tale Legacy references two heroes as players will switch between the ancient Minoan civilisation and Sophia’s time. The gameplay will consist of fighting various enemies as they come for Sophia and solving the puzzles across Minotaur Island to discover answers to why Sophia is there.</p>
<h2>28 – Pokémon Pokopia</h2>
<p><em>NSW2 – 5th March 2026</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/pokemon-pokopia">Pokémon Pokopia</a> could easily end up as one of the most popular and best selling games of 2026 when it comes out in March. Take the popularity of Pokemon and blend it with the life sim vibes of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/games/animal-crossing-new-horizons">Animal Crossing</a>, and you have something that very few fans of both franchises would be able to resist.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Pokémon Pokopia | Extended Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SDh6COB0Nqk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In Pokémon Pokopia, you play as a Ditto that has taken on human form who has decided to create a little slice of paradise for fellow Pokemon. Just like any other Ditto, Pokopia’s Ditto can learn moves and abilities from other Pokemon allowing it to find ways to craft the cosy little getaway. For example, Ditto can transform into Lapras to swim around the world or sprout Bulbasaur vines for some bush slashing. Ditto will have friends to help with the crafting of paradise with the likes of Professor Tangrowth, and as more spaces are created more Pokemon will be attracted to join your little commune.</p>
<h2>27 – Reanimal</h2>
<p>PS5, XSX|S, NSW2, PC – 13th February 2026</p>
<p>There is a lot of expectation behind <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/reanimal">Reanimal</a>. Coming from Tarsier Studios, the original developers of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/04/26/little-nightmares-review/">Little Nightmares</a> and with a good long wait for their latest game since <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/02/09/little-nightmares-2-review/">Little Nightmares II</a> (<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/08/little-nightmares-3-review/">Little Nightmares III</a> was not developed by Tarsier but Supermassive Games), and Reanimal looks like it could scratch that horror adventure vibe that made Little Nightmares so popular.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="REANIMAL Trailer #2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ACZL7VziLS8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Reanimal looks familiar to Little Nightmares but this a new universe, a new story, and an emphasis on partnership as a brother and sister search for their friends and look for a way off the island that was once their home. The pair explore the remnants of their home by land and sea, going to once familiar locations that have been twisted and have their own horrifying stories. Reanimal has been designed to have the siblings experience things together, which means it is fully playable either solo or in co-op. We don’t have too long to wait as Reanimal is out in just over a month.</p>
<h2>26 – Gears of War: E-Day</h2>
<p><em>XSX|S, PC – 2026</em></p>
<p>Since <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/09/gears-of-war-e-day-revealed-prequel-to-the-original-series/">its reveal in 2024</a> we have not heard much about Gears of War: E-Day, the prequel to the entire Gears of War franchise that will take us to the very start of the war with the Locust on Emergence Day. The game is being <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/28/people-can-fly-confirmed-as-gears-of-war-e-day-co-developers/">co-developed by The Coalition and People Can Fly</a>, with the teams putting players in the boots of young Marcus Phoenix and Dominic Santiago.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Gears of War: E-Day | Official Announce Trailer (In-Engine) - Xbox Games Showcase 2024" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EC20gLfUHeA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>All we really know is that will see a Sera in the immediate aftermath of invasion rather than a fallen planet suffering from years of conflict. It’s also currently only announced for Xbox Series X|S and PC, even if last year’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/26/gears-of-war-reloaded-ps5-review/">Gears of War Reloaded remaster brought the series to PS5 for the first time</a> with a day and date release. Anyway, for now, enjoy looking back at the reveal and its Mad World trailer above.</p>
<p><em>Did any of these games resonate with you? Come back tomorrow and we’ll have five more as we break into the top half of our list.</em></p>

            <p>The team over at Xbox has added two previously unannounced games to its Game Pass subscription service.</p>
<p>Game Pass subscribers can now play <strong>Little Nightmares Enhanced Edition</strong> and <strong>Brews and Bastards</strong> through the service. These two titles were not previously said to be coming when Microsoft laid out its most recent Game Pass line-up plans.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/little-nightmares">Little Nightmares</a> Enhanced Edition and Brews and Bastards <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/here-are-our-xbox-game-pass-games-for-december">join the likes of Dome Keeper and other recent Xbox Game Pass additions</a>.</p>

<p>Little Nightmares Enhanced Edition is a remaster of the unsettling puzzle platformer, which tells the tale of a yellow-raincoated girl named Six, as she attempts to escape The Maw. That is to say, a strange underwater vessel inhabited by a multitude of bizarre residents.</p>
<p>The adventure was warmly received on release, with Edwin Evans-Thirlwell calling it a "masterpiece of meat and malice" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/little-nightmares-review">Eurogamer's Little Nightmares review</a>.</p>
<p>Brews and Bastards, meanwhile, is described as an "intoxicating" dungeon crawler, which developer Mune Studio says is "overflowing with action-packed combat, potent brews and outlandish bosses". Players will need to choose an "inebriated" hero to then make their way through "hordes of drunken demons" as they try to search for the stolen Brew Stone.</p><p>As well as these two new Game Pass additions, Xbox has also detailed five games that will be leaving the service in the coming weeks. These are <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/neon-white">Neon White</a>, Road 96, Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn, The Grinch: Christmas Adventures - Merry and Mischievous Edition and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-ascent">The Ascent</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hi-fi-rush">Hi-Fi Rush</a>, the most recent game from Tango Gameworks, is getting a special re-release in collaboration with Limited Run Games.</p>
<p>With pre-orders set to open from 16th January up until the 1st March, Hi-Fi Rush Rhythm Edition will feature the deluxe version of the game alongside three special DLC costumes. These costumes are the Bossplay, Traditional Garb, and Teamplay outfits. It'll be available for the Xbox Series X/S and PS5.</p>
<p>Extra keen fans go opt for an even grander package with the Hi-Fi Rush Smidge Edition. This features the same Deluxe version of the game and DLC costumes, alongside a special three disc soundtrack, developer notes, and a custom box designed after the tutorial robot present in the game. There's also a bunch of in-game skins and gears for gameplay upgrades.</p>

<p>Then there's an even bolder option, the Project Armstrong Edition. This contains everything in the Smidge Edition alongside an 808 plush, a small replica of Chai's guitar, a Chai Project Armstrong pass, a glow-in-the-dark MP3 player pin, an hard cover art book, and an individually numbered certificate of authenticity.</p><p>Both the Smidge and Project Armstrong Edition will be going up for pre-order during the same period as the regular Rhythm Edition, <a href="https://limitedrungames.com/collections/hi-fi-RUSH">and prices for each are viewable on the Limited Run website</a>. The Rhythm Edition will sell for $39.99, the Smidge Edition for $69.99, and the Project Armstrong Edition for $174.99.</p>
<p>Hi-Fi Rush has been through something of a journey over the past few years. Dropping suddenly back in 2023, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hi-fi-rush-review-an-unrepentant-riot-of-rhythm-action">the game proved an exceptional release, receiving ample critical praise</a>. Its developer, Tango Gameworks, was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-shuts-slew-of-bethesda-studios-including-redfall-hi-fi-rush-developers">later shut down by Microsoft as part of widespread cuts</a>, which Xbox executive Matt Booty stated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/matt-booty-implies-tango-gameworks-closure-was-partly-due-to-leadership-change">was partly due to the studio's leadership change</a>, as Shinji Mikami left shortly after Hi-Fi Rush's release.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/krafton-acquired-tango-gameworks-to-maintain-its-legacy-rather-than-cash-in">The studio would then be saved by Krafton</a>, who acquired the team shortly after. Late last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pubg-and-inzoi-publisher-krafton-declares-itself-an-ai-first-company-placing-ai-at-the-centre-of-problem-solving">Krafton would then declare itself an "AI-first company"</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Ahead of the release of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/styx-blades-of-greed">Styx: Blades of Greed</a> on 19th February, Nacon and developer Cyanide have released a 9 minute gameplay video to showcase various elements of its stealth action shenanigans.</p>
<p><iframe title="Styx: Blades of Greed | Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/609Oad5kwCE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Styx provides the narration through the video, using a bunch of new and returning gadgets and abilities to scale a vertical fortress and reach the next preserve of Quartz. Key new abilities that are shown off include using a gappling hook and floating up hot air streams with a glider, but there’s also returning elements like poisoning barrels, possessing enemies and creating gloopy clones. Add to that genre classics of dousing flames, skulking through vents and just observing and listening for new opportunities, and you’ve got the broadest stealth game in this series to date.</p>
<p>This is the fourth game Styx has appeared in, making his debut in Of Orcs and Men which led to a spin off series of games starring the goblin assassin. In this new adventure, Styx is after the new mystical powers provided by quartz, which give him abilities like mind control, but he’ll have to build a team of allies (reluctant and otherwise) to do so, while making his way through the domains of humans, elves and orcs alike, the gang flying back and forth in a Zeppelin as their base of operations.</p>
<p>The trailer ends with this base under attack, as another fleet of airships catches up to Styx and his crew!</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/15/styx-blades-of-greed-preview-may-the-quartz-be-with-you/">our preview of Styx: Blades of Greed</a> from Gamescom last year, I said, “It’s genuinely great to see Styx: Blades of Greed bringing the mouthy goblin assassin back for a new generation. The previous games had a scrappy upstart kind of charm to them, and that’s continuing through here, with Cyanide getting more ambitious in how they construct the game into a stealthy playground. Styx might never be a truly revolutionary series, but it’s still plenty of fun.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Square Enix has a nice surprise for Dragon Quest fans, <a href="https://xcancel.com/DragonQuest/status/2008298591597850979">announcing a demo for Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</a> that will be available from tomorrow, Wednesday 7th January.</p>
<p>The free demo will be released across all platforms: <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a>, Xbox Series X|S, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> and Switch, and PC via Steam.</p>


<p>Oh, and you’ll be able to carry over your progress into the full game when it releases on 5th February.</p>
<p><iframe title="Opening Movie | DRAGON QUEST VII Reimagined" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GL2-tty-p4M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It’s great to see demos released for games, and especially for remakes where you kind of just want to see if it catches the right vibes and tone when reviving a classic.</p>

<p>Square Enix have taken an awful lot of contrasting approaches to their remakes and remasters. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined">Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</a> is sitting somewhere between the HD-2D remakes of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/29/dragon-quest-i-ii-hd-2d-remake-review/">the original Dragon Quest trilogy</a> and the wholesale reinvention of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/22/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review/">Final Fantasy VII Remake</a> trilogy.</p>
<p>One of the most striking things here is the art style, with Square Enix creating all of the characters as real-life dolls and then 3D scanning them into the game to capture the look that they want. However, there’s plenty of other modernising touches, from doing away with the tiresome random battles, to full embracing party automation and battle speed settings, and then there’s some parts of the story that are being reconsidered too.</p>
<p>We went hands on with the game last year, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/19/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-preview/">I said in our preview</a>, “Dragon Quest VII Reimagined is shaping up to be another fantastic remake from Square Enix. It’s a bit bewildering just how many different styles and approaches they’ve taken to revisiting their classics, but this takes a wonderful art direction and combines it with a great set of quality-of-life improvements while tweaking it to address the biggest criticisms. All in all, it should be the best way to revisit this adventure when it arrives [in 2026].”</p>

<p>Developers Square Enix and HexaDrive have announced that this demo'll arrive for PC on January 7th, putting out the news alongside the game's intro movie. <strong>WARNING</strong>: Do not make the same mistake I did and go top watch the intro movie without making sure your headphones are at a suitably reasonable volume. Anyway, the movie shows off the loveably cartoonly 3D facelift Reimagined gives Dragon Quest 7: Fragments of the Forgotten Past, just in case you missed that being revealed during last September's Nintendo Direct.</p>
<p>While I have zero Dragon Quest credentials with which to offer in-depth judgement, there's an undeniable charm to the new diorama-heavy style in which Akira Toyama's designs have been rendered this time, even if some of the facial expressions occasionally get very weird. Though, this being a cutscene, it seemingly doesn't offer much in the way of showing off the revamped battle mechanics and "significantly streamlined" story Square Enix <a href="https://www.square-enix-games.com/en_GB/news/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined">have promised</a>, with both of those changes aimed at making things more accessible to newbies and veterans.</p><p>Going back to the demo, in addition to the handy save data carryover, Square Enix revealed that everyone who dips their toe into the demo will be given an outfit dubbed the “Day Off Dress” which Maribel can wear in the full game.</p>
<p>That full release is still penned in for February 5th, 2026. You can wishlist Dragon Quest VII Reimagined on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2499860/DRAGON_QUEST_VII_Reimagined/">Steam</a> if you're so inclined, and/or check out <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake">our review of Dragon Quest III's HD-2D Remake</a> if you're keen to inject more words about revamped lizard adventures into your brain.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>CES 2026 is underway in Las Vegas, and while Nvidia have passed on the opportunity to announce any new RTX 50 Super <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-graphics-card">graphics cards</a> – perhaps in the knowledge that they’d be hurled directly into the raging vortex of an ongoing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/predicting-steam-machine-prices-would-be-a-lot-easier-if-ram-costs-hadnt-gone-horribly-wrong">component pricing snafu</a> – the tech show has yielded some interesting GeForce news. Namely, there’s a new version of Nvidia DLSS, 4.5, launching today, that promises to sharpen up and boost performance on any RTX GPU.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Its Super Resolution component is a second-generation upgrade to the 'Transformer' upscaling model introduced with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-dlss-4-explained">DLSS 4</a>, and on top of the improvements that version made over ye olde Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) of dee-ell-ess-esses past, it supposedly benefits from "greater contextual awareness" of the image it’s upscaling at any given moment. Nvidia say this produces higher-res frames with sharper detailing, less ghosting on moving images – a DLSS classic, that one – and generally cleaner, smoother anti-aliasing.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Nvidia</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Yah, like that.</p>
<p>No details on performance yet; DLSS 4’s Transfomer model was slightly less effective than CNN at jacking up framerates, but then the picture quality upgrade was arguably worth it, so you won’t catch me sobbing into my keyboard so long as DLSS 4.5 keeps the pace. Compatibility doesn’t sound like it’ll be much of a problem, either, as over 400 games will be compatible with DLSS 4.5 via the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-new-nvidia-app-is-out-now-justly-banishing-geforce-experience-to-history">Nvidia App</a>’s DLSS Override tool. The new Transformer model works on all current RTX-branded graphics cards, too – not just the latest RTX 50 series.</p><p>What you <em>will</em> need a 50 series card for is DLSS 4.5’s other major feature, Dynamic Multi Frame Generation. This won’t be out until Spring 2026, so it’s even less of an issue if you just want the new upscaler right this second, but in short, this builds on DLSS 4’s Multi Frame Generation (MFG) by allowing you to set a target FPS – likely one that syncs with the max refresh rate of your monitor – and only producing enough AI-hewn frames to meet that target. Instead of, as in DLSS 4 MFG, sticking to a flat 2x, 3x, or 4x multiplier, though Dynamic MFG can apparently stretch as high as 6x.</p>
<p>While the more widely known (if still Nvidia-supported) flavour of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-need-to-reclaim-softwares-wishing-well-from-the-cruelty-of-generative-ai">generative AI</a> has thus far been a litany of unfulfilled promise, intellectual property theft, and weirdly, RAM prices going haywire, the very specific application of artificial intelligence and/or machine learning in DLSS – and its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/amd-fsr-redstone-explained">AMD rival, FSR</a> – is relatively benign. Instead of sending a prompt to a power-hungry data centre, where images or text are aggregated from potentially stolen original works, DLSS is trained on a single supercomputer, and its actual generation work is done entirely on your own, probably sub-1000W PC, merely to create frames from data provided by the game it’s currently rendering. Which, obviously, requires the developers’ permission, given they’re the one who integrated DLSS in the first place. I don’t know how widespread confusion between the two genAI styles actually is, but there’s my reckoning, in case you ever wonder why I’m moaning about one while accepting the other.</p>
<p>Still, as a performance tool per se, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dlss-3-how-it-works-how-it-performs-and-when-you-should-use-it">frame generation has issues</a>, including ones I fear may be exacerbated by a 6x multiplier. MFG has already shown us that the more generated frames your GPU shoves out, the lower your supply of 'real', traditionally rendered frames. These are the ones you want to truly keep high, as they determine how fluid and responsive a fast-paced game feels in your mousing hand – generated frames only add visual smoothness, not tactile improvements, and in fact increase input lag. I’m not sure I’d ever want to engage 4x, 5x, or 6x frame gen unless I was already getting at least 70-80fps in normal frames to compensate for the reduced responsiveness, at which point, even a 240Hz monitor wouldn’t need such hefty multipliers to max out.</p>
<p>The new upscaler sounds good, though.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[NYT Connections Hints Today (#940)—Clues and Answers for Tuesday, January 6]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nyt-connections-hints-solutions-january-6-940/</link>
            <guid>1398016</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>We’re getting our heads into January, and by association, into 2026. What’s ahead are hundreds of NYT Connections puzzles for you to solve before we get into <strong>the next year</strong>, but that’s far too long into the distance to be concerning right now. All that matters today is that you decimate the NYT Connections puzzle presented <strong>right now</strong>.</p>



<p>With that being said, I’ve got the NYT Connections hints and solutions you need below. Have fun!</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-january-6">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (January 6)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will prompt your brain to take action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #940:</p>



<ul>
<li>DIGS</li>



<li>CLEAR</li>



<li>FLAT</li>



<li>DEEP</li>



<li>PAD</li>



<li>FULL</li>



<li>RICH</li>



<li>QUARTERS</li>



<li>BOAT</li>



<li>BALLOON</li>



<li>FLUSH</li>



<li>PACK</li>



<li>QUADS</li>



<li>PARTY</li>



<li>STUFFED</li>



<li>STRAIGHT</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>Slang or casual terms for where you live.</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em>Think about how something might sound.</em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>THands you might make at a card table.</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>Add “animal” after each</em> <em>word</em>.</li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, January 6:</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-explained-for-today-january-6-940">NYT Connections Answers Explained for Today, January 6 (#940)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– DIGS, FLAT, PAD, QUARTERS</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – CLEAR, DEEP, FULL, RICH</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – BOAT, FLUSH, QUADS, STRAIGHT</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – BALLOON, PACK, PARTY, STUFFED</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Escape from Tarkov’s Ending Was ‘Changed’, But Not How Players Were Expecting]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-ending-change-unexpected/</link>
            <guid>1398010</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlestate Games pulled a bit of a sneaky on players looking for an easier ending in Escape from Tarkov following the arrival of the 1.0 release midway through November. In the closing chapter of the game, players must navigate the Terminal map, slaying hundreds of AI enemies, to make it to a boat that marks their ultimate escape from Tarkov.</p>



<p>However, a trickery in the design meant that, in a group, not <strong>everyone </strong>could get a seat on the boat. In a post on social media, one streamer asked to alter the number of seats available on the boat to get out of Tarkov, to which Battlestate said, ‘It’s changed already.’</p>



<p>But the nature of that change has players perplexed.</p>







<h2 id="h-solo-or-no-go">Solo or No Go</h2>



<p>Under <a href="https://x.com/Velion/status/2007488455002206273" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Velion’s post</a> asking for ‘everyone’ to be able to escape together, Battlestate Games’ Nikita Buyanov wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Its changed already</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This prompted many to believe that, as a group, all comers could escape from Tarkov together, no longer needing to sacrifice themselves or kill their friends at the ultimate exfiltration point.</p>



<p>However, the change that Battlestate Games implemented was something pretty drastic and <strong>not </strong>what fans were anticipating. Instead of allowing a group to escape from Tarkov, Battlestate has ensured that just <strong>one seat </strong>is available on the ZUBR boat, regardless of squad size.</p>



<p>That means if you make it through Terminal as a five-man squad, you’ll be left choosing which solo player gets to complete the game at the final post.</p>



<p>This was <a href="https://x.com/Pestily/status/2008264876163228137" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">detailed by Pestily</a>, arguably the most recognizable Escape from Tarkov streamer, in a post on social media:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Hey I watched multiple runs of Terminal yesterday and even with 5 people getting to the end it’s always 1 seat now? I understand “changed” can mean multiple things but only 1? Bruh…</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Fans were quick to comment on the change, and as always, feedback was dramatically mixed and divisive. One user wrote, ‘If this isn’t fixed soon, I’m done with this game.’ Another wrote, “I like the 1-seat change – it forces an actual decision instead of defaulting to the 5-man safety net.”</p>



<p>One Tarkov player suggested a dynamic seating structure that changes according to the ending the players have. The ‘nicer’ their ending, the more seats are available on their boat.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a recent <span>social media release, VR-first developer Cloudhead Games announced a massive restructuring that will result in the&nbsp;<strong>layoff of 70% of its employee base,</strong>&nbsp;effective</span> January 7th. The post, penned by the company’s CEO, Denny Unger, revealed a series of issues that had landed the studio in an <strong>impossible position</strong>.</p>



<p>These included a lack of platform funding in the VR space, ‘still nascent challenges’ preventing the widespread success of VR, and the ‘general downturn of the gaming industry.’</p>







<h2 id="h-cloudhead-still-wants-to-transform-humanity">Cloudhead Still Wants to ‘Transform Humanity’</h2>



<p>The post on <a href="https://x.com/CloudheadGames/status/2008316673774715195" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a> from Cloudhead’s CEO was an emotional one:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The team leaving us are consummate professionals and wonderful people in general. We took great collective pride in creating a culture that was as caring about VR content as they were working to support each other.</p>



<p>Each and every one of them shared a true sense of ‘give a damn’ as we worked through still unseen projects, and they will be deeply missed at our studio. And although we have done our best to pad the landing with supports, if you have room on your team, please see the link below to our ‘Reverse Recruiting’ spreadsheet and contact them directly.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The release went on to explain that the studio can’t achieve immense things alone, and referenced a drop in investment in VR technology and software as a leading contributor to mass redundancies.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Cloudhead has weathered many storms in our 14 years in Virtual Reality. Our belief remains in the power of VR as a medium, as a shared dream machine that will one day <strong>transform humanity</strong>. We have no doubt VR’s mainstream relevance is predestined, with future devices that do ‘everything’, but it will take studios like ours to be there when that time comes.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Cloudhead is working on an unannounced game, but previously produced Pistol Whip, Aperture Hand Lab (in collaboration with Valve), and The Gallery series.</p>



<p>Cloudhead Games is one of the earliest studios to announce a wave of mass layoffs in 2026. As the studio points out, there’s still a general downturn and a global restructuring across the gaming industry, so it likely won’t be the last.</p>

<p>That isn’t some fictional, dystopian headline; this is where we’re at right now in gaming peripheral technology. At CES 2026, HyperX and Neurable revealed a collaboration that has given way to an AI-powered, sensor-fitted <strong>neurotechnological gaming headset.</strong> It uses ‘non-invasive sensors’ to read brainwaves and encourage gamers to boost their performance.</p>



<p>The combination of HyperX’s peripheral technology and Neurable’s cognitive monitoring solutions endeavours to give players insights into their real-time brain performance and reduce their reaction times.</p>







<h2 id="h-would-you-let-a-headset-monitor-your-brain">Would You Let a Headset Monitor Your Brain?</h2>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20260105973259/en/Neurable-Introduces-Neurotechnology-Powered-Gaming-Wearable-Headset-With-HyperX?utm_source=neurable&amp;utm_medium=newsroom" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">press release</a> detailing everything you’d want to know about the HyperX x Neurable gaming headset, some telling tidbits of data were handed out. It was claimed that testing participants resulted in an ‘improved reaction time’ of around 43 milliseconds on average, a number that was made ‘even more pronounced’ by testing the headset with pro esports players.</p>



<p>The CEO of Neurable, Ramses Alcaide, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>HyperX allows us to bring neurotechnology to gamers at a scale we’ve never been able to reach before.</p>



<p>We look forward to the excitement of this strategic relationship, which represents a promising future of gaming, one where understanding your mind becomes as natural as understanding your mechanics. By making brain-computer interfaces (BCI) intuitive and invisible inside the tools players already use, we’re proving that neuroscience can meaningfully elevate performance and transform the way people play.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>HP’s Josephine Tan echoed the sentiment:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We’ve always been about empowering power players with the best technology to play, and now with our strategic collaboration with Neurable, we look forward to giving more insight into how one’s cognitive skills and focus impacts their gameplay to ultimately make them as competitive as possible.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s not clear when the HyperX x Neurable headset will make it to market, and it hasn’t been suggested how much such a device would cost.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Creative Assembly's</strong> <strong>Total War: PHARAOH</strong>, the latest game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/total-war-pharaoh-sands-of-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released over two years ago</a> in the iconic real-time strategy series, will soon feature <strong>an in-game AI advisor powered by <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-ace-kairos-npc-demo-shown-in-exclusive-ces-24-video/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NVIDIA ACE</a> technology</strong>.</p>



<p>The news was <a href="https://wccftech.com/watch-nvidia-ces-2026-ceo-jensen-huang-live-here/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unveiled by NVIDIA at <strong>CES 2026</strong></a> today. This updated version of the in-game advisor reimagines the traditional strategy game guide by using on-device AI to provide real-time, context-aware assistance.</p>



<p>Total War: PHARAOH players <strong>can engage with the advisor via natural language prompts</strong> (voice or text), rather than searching through menus or FAQs. The advisor has been trained on the specific mechanics of Total War: PHARAOH and has game-state awareness (as well as using a historically appropriate tone and lore-driven mindset). For example, <strong>it can analyze why a settlement revolted</strong> or offer strategic advice based on the player's current campaign situation. The AI processes player prompts, the current game state, and data retrieved from the game's complex database, which contains up-to-date information on units, the economy, resource management, faction traits, buildings, and status effects.</p>



<p>Behind the scenes, the Total War: PHARAOH AI advisor <strong>is powered by a small language model that runs locally on the user's GPU</strong>. The studio used NVIDIA ACE developer tools to build the pipeline connecting Total War's extensive game data to the model.</p>



<p>This new feature is part of a program to <strong>investigate how Creative Assembly can make Total War more approachable, dynamic, and ultimately more accessible</strong> to players of all skill levels, without compromising any of the depth that has defined the franchise over the past 25 years. The CES 2026 announcement also included confirmation that an upcoming playtest program for this AI advisor is scheduled to launch for select community members in 2026. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>During the CES 2026 NVIDIA ACE update, we also received an update on the <strong>PUBG Ally</strong> in-game companion that was <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-ace-to-power-dynamic-ai-characters-companions-and-bosses-in-pubg-naraka-bladepoint-inzoi-and-mir5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">originally announced at last year's Consumer Electronics Show</a>. PUBG Ally will initially be tested in the first half of 2026 via a limited-time event in <strong>PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS Arcade</strong>, and will be available for players using English, Chinese, and Korean. These <strong>CPC</strong> (<strong>Co-Playable Characters</strong>) are powered by small language and speech models via <strong>efficient on-device inference</strong>. An automatic speech recognition model understands the player's voice, while a small language model (SLM) combines these instructions with PUBG Ally's perception of the game state for strategic planning and real-time reactions. A text-to-speech model then generates dynamic voice lines to communicate with the player.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>At CES 2026, it was also confirmed that PUBG Ally will include a <strong>long-term memory system</strong> that lets Co-Playable Characters recall previous performances and gameplay interactions, allowing the AI to draw on these memories while interacting with the player. This definitely opens up to more immersive interactions, although it will be interesting to see how the gaming community reacts to it, given the growing anti-AI sentiment.</p>



<p>In other Total War news, Creative Assembly is working on two big games: <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/total-war-medieval-iii-is-in-early-development-warcore-engine-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Total War Medieval III</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/total-war-warhammer-40000-announced-the-game-awards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Total War: Warhammer 40,000</a></strong>.</p>

<p>Nintendo is regularly renewing its video game trademarks, and with this in mind, some trademarks have apparently been spotted for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/legend_of_zelda_tri_force_heroes">The Legend of Zelda: Tri Force Heroes</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/mario_tennis_ultra_smash">Mario Tennis: Ultra Smash</a>.</p>
<p>The multiplayer Zelda title originally made its debut on the 3DS in 2015. We found it to be a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/3ds/legend_of_zelda_tri_force_heroes">"mixed bag" compared to its illustrious predecessors</a>. As for Mario Tennis: Ultra Smash, this game arrived on the Wii U in 2015. It featured <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/wiiu/mario_tennis_ultra_smash">some enjoyable gameplay</a>, but there wasn't quite enough there to keep us interested.</p><div><figure data-videoid="SFfvavDRTdA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SFfvavDRTdA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytSFfvavDRTdA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SFfvavDRTdA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SFfvavDRTdA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed405340uomsvw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>Here's a look at these trademarks <a href="https://x.com/MikeOdysseyYT/status/2007002500906279007">courtesy of Mike Odyssey on social media</a> (<a href="https://gonintendo.com/contents/56376-nintendo-renews-for-trademarks-zelda-tri-force-heroes-and-mario-tennis-ultra-smash">thanks, GoNintendo</a>):</p>

<p>When it comes to video game trademarks, there is no guarantee games and filings spotted will neccessarily lead to an announcement or reveal.</p>
<p>For Nintendo, renewals are often just part of everyday business operations to protect its intellectual properties. In saying this, some trademark renewals from publishers in recent years have led to the revival of certain games and series, such as Bandai Namco's IP <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/klonoa_phantasy_reverie_series">Klonoa</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/once_upon_a_katamari">Katamari</a>.</p>
<p>If we hear anything related to these renewals, we will provide an update. Although there's no sign of Nintendo's multiplayer-focused Zelda series returning, you can always get a co-op fix in the recently released title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a>. A new Mario Tennis game called <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-tennis-fever">Mario Tennis Fever</a> is also coming to the Switch 2 next month.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/nvidia-rtx-remix-logic-soon-add-dynamic-fx-responds-to-in-game-events/</link>
            <guid>1397980</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Today at <strong>CES 2026</strong>, <strong>NVIDIA </strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/watch-nvidia-ces-2026-ceo-jensen-huang-live-here/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> <strong>RTX Remix Logic</strong>, a new feature that will soon (later this month via an update available through the <strong>NVIDIA app</strong>) introduce dynamic visual effects capable of responding to in-game events.</p>



<p>The RTX Remix Logic system identifies <strong>over 30 common in-game events</strong> and offers <strong>more than 900 triggers</strong> that modders can use to transform visuals in their remastered classic PC games mods. The visual aspects of those games, such as lighting, materials, and volumetric effects, can now respond to gameplay. For example, opening a door might trigger changes in weather or light properties.</p>



<p>The modders can even inject dynamic particles or post-processing effects, such as chromatic aberration or vignettes, as stress signals when a player is in danger. Large-scale effects like snow or rain can be selectively applied so they appear only in specific environments and are automatically excluded from indoor areas.</p>



<p>RTX Remix Logic features an <strong>intuitive, no-code, node-based user interface</strong> that enables easy connection of various (900+) triggers. According to NVIDIA, the system is highly versatile and can be used in a multitude of ways. It is also extensible, enabling the RTX Remix community to add more game event triggers and actions over time. In a demonstration, NVIDIA showed that a door in Half-Life 2 RTX could open up to very different looking Ravenholms, as if the door connected to a multiverse. </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="NVIDIA RTX Remix | Remix Logic: Dynamic Lighting &amp; Weather" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Wl4wSU1S9us?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Modders can even use RTX Remix Logic to <strong>introduce new gameplay systems</strong> to old PC games. For example, modder <strong>xoxor4d</strong> (the same one who's behind the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-4-rtx-remix-compatibility-mod-publicly-available-enjoy-path-tracing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stunning GTA 4 path traced remaster</a></strong>) came up with the idea of adding a night vision effect to Half-Life 2 RTX that is automatically triggered when the user has equipped the crossbow and activated the zoom. You can check a showcase below.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="NVIDIA RTX Remix | Remix Logic: Crossbow Night-Vision" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4ABCXS4P-_8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The RTX Remix Logic system is compatible with <strong>over 165 classic games</strong> supported by NVIDIA's remastering, but that's not all that NVIDIA plans to add with the update slated for later this month. Modder xoxor4d has contributed a new look for the <strong>Remix Runtime menu</strong> and also made further customization possible, allowing users to resize it, retheme it, and change its transparency.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Overall, NVIDIA boasted that 2025 was <strong>a breakthrough year for RTX Remix</strong>, with over 50 new mods released and more than 20 community tools, including open-source contributions and plugins, now available to help expand compatibility.</p>

And while you certainly can't refer to a $150 controller as "budget-friendly," it is priced lower most of the controllers listed above.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4629882-8bitdoultimate3emodular.png" data-ref-id="1300-4629882" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4629882-8bitdoultimate3emodular.png" data-ref-id="1300-4629882"></a><figcaption>8BitDo Ultimate 3E Controller</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4629882-8bitdoultimate3emodular.png"></figure><p>The Ultimate 3E is only the second wireless 8BitDo controller for Xbox, following last year's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FHQ6P7TQ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" data-mce-href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FHQ6P7TQ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Ultimate 3-Mode 40th Anniversary Edition</a>, which is on sale for $80 (was $90) at Amazon.</p><p>The Ultimate 3E has numerous features that are brand-new to 8BitDo's popular controller line. It's slightly wider than the Ultimate 2 and has textured, silicone handles to improve comfort and control. Like the Elite Series 2 and other officially licensed third-party gamepads, the Ultimate 3E comes with a hardshell carrying case and a set of swappable components.</p><p>Modular components include the right and left joysticks, D-pad, ABXY buttons, and the front faceplate. Two magnetic ABXY button modules--one standard, one microswitch--are included with the controller. This is the first time we've seen swappable face buttons utilized to switch between traditional membrane inputs and rapid, clicky microswitches. The magnetic faceplate needs to be removed before switching the ABXY modules.</p><p>Like the Ultimate 2 and Pro 3, the Ultimate 3E has TMR anti-drift joysticks with customizable RGB light rings. Stick movements are registered by electromagnetic sensors and offer a smoother, more precise feel than Hall Effect sticks. In addition to a pair of traditional sticks, the accessory kit comes with four alternative options: two tall, one dome, and one with a thicker metal ring to increase resistance.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4630224-8bitdoultimate3e.png" data-ref-id="1300-4630224" data-ratio="0.534" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4630224-8bitdoultimate3e.png" data-ref-id="1300-4630224"></a><figcaption>The Ultimate 3E is the second wireless 8BitDo controller for Xbox.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4630224-8bitdoultimate3e.png"></figure><p>You can also quickly swap between two styles of directional pads. The default is a newly designed eight-way D-pad with a circular shape. If you prefer the classic style, the alternative is a four-way D-pad similar to the ones found on other 8BitDo controllers. Both D-pad modules have magnetic connectors.</p><p>The modular design doesn't extend to the extra remappable buttons. Like the Ultimate 2, the Ultimate 3E has two built-in back buttons and two extra shoulder buttons (R4 and L4). The shoulder buttons can be remapped on the fly on the controller itself, while the back buttons and other inputs are remapped using 8BitDo's free Ultimate Software app. Other settings such as RGB lighting effects and stick/trigger sensitivity can be adjusted using the app. Just like other editions of the Ultimate, you can create and store up to three custom control layouts that can be cycled through by pressing the Profile button on the controller.</p><p>The Ultimate 3E is 8BitDo's first licensed Xbox controller with trigger stops. It has Hall Effect Impulse Triggers with the haptic feedback found in official Xbox Wireless Controllers. You can toggle the switches on the back of the Ultimate 3E to actuate the triggers faster. If they work like the Ultimate 2, the trigger stops essentially turn RT and LT into shoulder buttons.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4630242-8bitdoultimate3ebumpers.png" data-ref-id="1300-4630242" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4630242-8bitdoultimate3ebumpers.png" data-ref-id="1300-4630242"></a><figcaption>R4 and L4 shoulder buttons can be remapped without Ultimate Software X.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4630242-8bitdoultimate3ebumpers.png"></figure><p>8BitDo says the 1400mAh battery offers up to 18 hours of play and takes 4-5 hours to fully charge. The controller is bundled with a wireless charging dock that has "zero contact points." Outside of the charging pins/contacts, no part of the controller touches the charging stand. The 2.4GHz USB-C dongle is stored inside the charging dock's bottom compartment.</p><p>Though the Ultimate 3E is an Xbox controller, it has a couple of PC-only features. Competitive players will be interested to hear the Ultimate 3E is rated for up to 1,000Hz polling rates in wireless and wired modes. PC players can also use customizable 6-axis motion controls when synced to the wireless dongle.</p><p>The Ultimate 3E is the latest entry in 8<a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FHQ6P7TQ,B0DMTLLSBN,B0DP9B2WYY,B0DP991SPL,B0DMVLD2HC,B0DZ6CRSFC,B0F18T675W,B0D1VHH4C5,B0D1VHT3S6,B0F9L7L7CJ,B0F9L7Q3VG,B0929K9W4N,B0C4YRJHGB,B0C4YKQ7ZF,B0F7XFH9V1,B0F7RMB4RH,B0CNPST9GY,B0D7P5M1Q3,B0D1T96W4L,B0D3HHZK8D,B0D1TV3HGB,B0D3HJ8T3C,B0D1TDYNPS,B0CX52RYR4,B0CSPFFVRT,B0CX4YP82L,B0CYZKNSS1,B0D3HHCK4F,B0CYZH52ZY,B0DNQ9FXJW,B0DNQBQNG7,B0DNQD9HPS,B0DNZFCJ5S,B0BXSV78R6,B09B2R2GRM,B0CX44F4QJ,B0CMH7DR3Y,B0D5LPJ2NN,B0BGPX25FP,B0BGPTPSCM,B0BGPQSCMM,B0BGNYXKBK,B0FM7V4T31,B0FLDC4TBQ&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" data-mce-href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FHQ6P7TQ,B0DMTLLSBN,B0DP9B2WYY,B0DP991SPL,B0DMVLD2HC,B0DZ6CRSFC,B0F18T675W,B0D1VHH4C5,B0D1VHT3S6,B0F9L7L7CJ,B0F9L7Q3VG,B0929K9W4N,B0C4YRJHGB,B0C4YKQ7ZF,B0F7XFH9V1,B0F7RMB4RH,B0CNPST9GY,B0D7P5M1Q3,B0D1T96W4L,B0D3HHZK8D,B0D1TV3HGB,B0D3HJ8T3C,B0D1TDYNPS,B0CX52RYR4,B0CSPFFVRT,B0CX4YP82L,B0CYZKNSS1,B0D3HHCK4F,B0CYZH52ZY,B0DNQ9FXJW,B0DNQBQNG7,B0DNQD9HPS,B0DNZFCJ5S,B0BXSV78R6,B09B2R2GRM,B0CX44F4QJ,B0CMH7DR3Y,B0D5LPJ2NN,B0BGPX25FP,B0BGPTPSCM,B0BGPQSCMM,B0BGNYXKBK,B0FM7V4T31,B0FLDC4TBQ&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">BitDo's impressive collection of controllers and other peripherals licensed by Xbox</a>.

<p>The Hundred Line team says it will "consider" it</p>

<figure data-uuid="52b23e2f21658"><a title="The Hundred Line" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/52b23e2f21658/the-hundred-line.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Aniplex / XSEED Games</em></figcaption></figure><p>One Switch release we didn't think enough people spoke about in 2025 was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hundred_line_-_last_defense_academy">The Hundred Line - Last Defense Academy</a>. Fortunately, there might be a chance of it returning to the spotlight in the future.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.rpgsite.net/interview/19255-the-hundred-line-interview-kodaka-dlc-new-characters-routes-uchikoshi-switch-2">recent interview with RPG Site</a>, the title's co-director Kazutaka Kodaka mentioned how the team at Too Kyo Games would definitely consider a Switch 2 Edition upgrade, similar to what fans saw with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/shuten_order">SHUTEN ORDER</a> in November. Here's the full exchange:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>RPG Site:</strong> It made sense to prioritize Switch and Steam for this one. Are there any plans for a Nintendo Switch 2 Edition upgrade like we just saw for Shuten Order? I ask this because the game is a bit rough on Switch compared to PC and it would benefit a lot from faster loading with better visuals and performance on Switch 2.</p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067ohtvjw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p><strong>Kazutaka Kodaka:</strong> We’d like to consider that as well.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, while there's nothing concrete just yet, there appears to be a serious chance a Switch 2 upgrade could be considered for the future.</p>
<p>When The Hundred Line originally arrived in April last year, we gave it an "excellent" nine out of ten stars and praised it for its blend of tactical RPG and visual novel gameplay. We also gave it a spot in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/games-of-the-year-2025-nintendo-life-staff-picks">our Nintendo Life 2025 Games of the Year list</a>. The success it had also seemingly helped <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/the-hundred-line-dev-no-longer-sees-bankruptcy-as-a-serious-future">Too Kyo Games avoid bankruptcy</a>.</p>
<p>In case you missed it, the paid upgrade for Shuten Order on Switch 2 included a performance update and mouse controls.</p>

Much like a modern laptop, these new monitors have a built-in light sensor that measures the brightness and color temperature of an environment to enable a screen to automatically adapt to different times of day.</p><p>“In bright daylight conditions it increases brightness and shifts to a color that’s cooler in temperature,” says Michael McSorley, product marketing manager at Nvidia, in a briefing with <em>The Verge</em>. “At night, or in darker rooms, it reduces brightness and uses warmer tones to minimize glare and eyestrain.”</p><p>While the process is automatic, much like a laptop display, you’ll still be able to fully control how this feature works so you can fine-tune it or disable it altogether directly through the monitor’s onscreen display.</p><p>The first displays that include G-Sync Ambient Adaptive Technology will be available on January 7th, starting at $599. Acer, AOC, Asus, and MSI all have new G-Sync Pulsar monitors with this automatic brightness feature, and they’re all designed more for professional esports players. Each model is a 27-inch IPS display running at 1440p and up to 360Hz refresh rate.</p><p>Nvidia first introduced its G-Sync Pulsar monitors last year, as part of a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/20/24224270/nvidia-g-sync-module-mediatek-partnership">partnership with MediaTek</a> to integrate its current and future G-Sync features into MediaTek scalers and eliminate the need for dedicated G-Sync modules. G-Sync originally required a <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/introducing-nvidia-g-sync-revolutionary-ultra-smooth-stutter-free-gaming/">dedicated module in 2013</a> to allow it to synchronize display refresh rates to a GPU, eliminate screen tearing, and reduce display stutter and input lag.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTY0"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Tom Warren</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/854662/nvidia-g-sync-pulsar-monitors-abmient-adaptive-technology-auto-brightness]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Nvidia is announcing its next major update to its Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) feature at CES today. DLSS 4.5 includes Nvidia’s second-generation Super Resolution transformer model and a new 6x Multi Frame Generation mode for RTX 50-series GPUs that uses AI to generate up to five additional frames for every single rendered one.</p><p>DLSS 4.5 will be available for all RTX GPUs today, but will run the fastest on Nvidia’s latest RTX 40- and 50-series cards. The latest transformer model is designed to improve image quality overall and reduce some of the artifacting that we saw with DLSS 4.</p><p>“This second-generation model is our most sophisticated yet,” says Henry Lin, director of product management at Nvidia, in a briefing with <em>The Verge</em>. “It utilizes 5x the compute power over the original transformer model, it’s trained on a significantly expanded high-fidelity dataset, and it also takes full advantage of our GeForce RTX 40- and 50-series GPUs, which benefit from faster and more advanced Tensor Cores.”</p><p>Nvidia has updated its DLSS model to better understand scenes in games so it can use game engine data to improve lighting, finer edges, and motion clarity. In a briefing, Nvidia demonstrated improvements to DLSS 4.5 in a variety of games. Ghosting is reduced in <em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</em>, anti-aliasing is improved in <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em>, and there is less shimmering in certain scenes in <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</em>.</p><p>While the AI model improvements to DLSS 4.5 will benefit all RTX owners today, Nvidia is also launching a new 6x Multi Frame Generation mode for RTX 50-series owners in spring. Targeted at 240Hz 4K gaming, the 6x mode will generate five additional fake frames for every single rendered one, instead of the maximum of three additional in DLSS 4.</p><p>Nvidia is also launching a Dynamic Multi Frame Generation mode that automatically switches between different Multi Frame Generation levels depending on when you need more or less fake frames. “When things are really graphically intense, it upshifts and increases the Frame Generation required to bridge the performance dips, ensuring that your high refresh rate monitor remains buttery smooth,” explains Lin. “When the workload lightens, it seamlessly shifts the multiplier down to compute only what’s needed.”</p><p>DLSS 4.5 will be available for more than 400 games and apps through Nvidia’s app today, allowing RTX owners to force 4.5 on in games that haven’t been updated yet. Nvidia is only committing to a vague “spring 2026” timeframe for its 6x Multi Frame Generation and Dynamic Frame Generation modes for RTX 50-series owners.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTY0"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Tom Warren</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/854610/nvidia-dlss-4-5-announcement-multi-frame-generation-6x-specs]]></content:encoded>
