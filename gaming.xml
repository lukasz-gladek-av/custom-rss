            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/video-game-sales-in-july-are-up-in-europe-despite-no-major-releases/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>As the title suggests, video game sales increased in July across Europe, which may seem quite bizarre. This month hasn't seen any major releases across any platform, but 2.4 million video games were sold in July, a <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/video-game-sales-up-in-europe-during-july-despite-a-lack-of-major-releases-european-monthly-charts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">3.4% rise year-on-year</a>.</p>
<p>Considering the huge lack of major releases on any platform this July, it's impressive that video game sales have increased. Looking at the Top Ten for July, Luigi's Mansion 2 HD is the only game on the list released this year, with every other game being from last year, including top seller EA Sports FC 24.</p>
<p>While to some, the sudden rise of sales for EA Sports FC 24 may come as a shock, it's no surprise considering the European Championships took place in July. Because of this, EA Sports FC 24 sold 69% more copies this July than FIFA 23 did last year.</p>
<p>Looking further into the facts, July saw many gaming promotions that helped boost the sales of specific games. For example, Hitman Absolution, a game initially released in 2012, had a free game promotion on Amazon Prime, boosting the game significantly. Because of the promotion, Hitman Absolution was number eight on the list.</p>
<p>Games like Grand Theft Auto V remain on top, coming in second on the list, with Elden Ring sliding into third position. In the tenth position, It Takes Two is on the list, which is a surprise considering the game's release was in 2022.</p>
<p>Regarding new releases, EA Sports College Football 25 was highly successful in the UK but made it onto the European charts at number 39.</p>
<p>While game sales were up across Europe in July, the same cannot be said about console sales. 263,000 console units were sold across specific markets, <a href="https://wccftech.com/video-game-sales-in-the-uk-dropped-by-30-in-first-half-of-the-year/">excluding the UK</a> and Germany. Compared to last year, this is a massive 46% drop. For the month of July, PlayStation 5 took the lead in sales but still proceeded to see a drop of 56% since last year. Nintendo Switch is second on the list, and we also see a drop. However, the drop for Nintendo Switch is significantly smaller and comes in at 29% year-on-year.</p>
<p>In third place, the Xbox Series sold the least consoles this year but continued to experience a rather heavy deficit from the year before. Compared to last July, they had a decrease of 42% in all Xbox Series sales.</p>
<p>This month, there was no major news about new consoles or new major launches. People are still waiting restlessly for the Nintendo Switch 2, but it doesn't seem to be coming for a while.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-version-50-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>HoYoverse has announced the&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>Version 5.0 release date, and it's bringing a brand new nation, three new characters, and much more later this month.</p>
<p>Version 5.0, also known as "Flowers Resplendent on the Sun-Scorched Sojourn", launches on August 28th, and its main new addition to the free-to-play gacha RPG is the nation of Natlan, whose warriors will become your allies.</p>
<p>All you need to do in order to visit Natlan is to complete the Prologue of Mondstadt's Archon Quest. Once you've done this, a Teleport Waypoint will become available, even for "beginners and intermediates", per HoYoverse.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/genshin-impact-version-5.0-release-date-yumkasaurus.jpg?itok=F-5ieSyC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/genshin-impact-version-5.0-release-date-yumkasaurus.jpg?itok=-oNdn0HY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>Version 5.0 has some adorable little critters for you to meet.</figcaption></figure><p>In the nation of Natlan, you'll encounter six tribes, although only three of them will be available in this first update: the Children of Echoes, the Scions of the Canopy, and the People of the Springs.</p>
<p>Each of them has a beast companion you'll also meet, and you'll be able to transform into said beast companions as well, making traversal across Natlan easier.</p>
<p>Of course, you can also look forward to new fighters for your team in&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>Version 5.0. This time around, three new characters are making their debut, two of whom are five-star characters and all of whom reflect the cultures of the tribes from which they hail.</p>
<p>The first five-star character is Kinich, a Dendro claymore user who can use a grappling hook. You'll also be able to recruit Mualani, a catalyst-wielding Hydro character who's got her very own signature surfboard. They're joined by four-star Geo polearm user Kachina.</p>

<p>In the first phase of Version 5.0, Event Wishes for Mualani and Kachina will run, alongside a rerun for Kaedehara Kazuha. The second phase of the update will see Kinich making his debut, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/genshin-impact-raiden-shogun-baal-build-guide">Raiden Shogun</a> will get a rerun during this phase as well.</p>
<p>As ever, several codes giving you the chance to nab some free stuff have also arrived alongside this update's reveal, and here they are.</p>
<ul><li>2SMTYV59TLFD - 100 Primogems, 10 Mystic Enhancement Ore</li>
<li>7SMTGV59BLXH - 100 Primogems, 5 Hero's Wit</li>
<li>8T4TGDLRA5E5 - 100 Primogems, 50,000 Mora</li>
</ul><p><em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>Version 5.0 arrives across all platforms on August 28th. You can <a href="https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">download and play the game for free right now</a> on PC, PlayStation, and mobile devices. Stay tuned for more.</p>

<p>In a new <a href="https://www.irongalaxystudios.com/blog-posts/my-next-adventure" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blog post</a>, Adam Boyes announced that they are stepping down as co-CEO of developer Iron Galaxy, with Chelsea Blasko continuing as the sole CEO.</p>



<p>Boyes thanked Iron Galaxy and its team and explained that they will “remain on as a member of this team until the end of the year.” </p>



<p>They also mentioned their plans moving forward, emphasizing the current state of the gaming industry. Boyes stated that “my new inspirations are to find ways to help people who make games solve their biggest problems.” </p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Iron Galaxy’s co-CEO Boyes closed the new blog by reassuring readers that “you haven’t heard the last from me, and neither has IG.” They did not confirm their exact plans nor when fans should expect another update, but they will “talk about that later.”</p>



<p>Iron Galaxy is a developer that works on both original ideas and collaborative projects, and sometimes provide support as consultants. Some of their original titles include Extinction and the short-lived battle royale brawler Rumbleverse. </p>



<p>Fans may recognize Iron Galaxy for their collaborations on games like Uncharted Legacy of Thieves or Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy. The developer worked on bringing those iconic games to PC.</p>



<p>The Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-reveals-crash-bandicoot-n-sane-trilogy-more-coming-to-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">joined the Xbox Game Pass</a> this month, and Uncharted continues to thrive, building even more fans with another <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-uncharted-movie-confirms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">live-action movie under way</a>. </p>

Now, Meta has said that GTA: San Andreas VR is "indefinitely delayed."</p><p>In response to a comment on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAmNSjF9Big&amp;lc=UgwielXvTo--EHoQY7x4AaABAg.A77ZzS0z8DOA7A-RrmuyA-" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">its official YouTube channel</a>, a Meta Quest VR representative stated that "GTA: San Andreas is on hold indefinitely while we both focus on other projects. We look forward to working with our friends at Rockstar in the future." Meta confirmed the news to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-san-andreas-vr-delayed-indefinitely-as-meta-focuses-on-other-projects" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> shortly thereafter.</p><p>There are some questions about how far along the project was, since Meta never shared any screenshots or video of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas VR. Rockstar's original version of the game was ambitious even when it was released in 2004. San Andreas had a much larger open world than either Grand Theft Auto III or Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, as well as an enthralling story.</p><p>Thanks to the game's enduring popularity, San Andreas was included alongside GTA III and Vice City on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/grand-theft-auto-the-trilogy-definitive-edition-review-wasted/1900-6417791/" data-ref-id="1900-6417791">Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition</a>. That remastered compilation was released in 2021 for all of the modern consoles and PC. If Meta's GTA: San Andreas VR port remains on indefinite hold, then The Definitive Edition may be the only way to revisit the title going forward.</p>

                <p>Between May 2022 and November 2023, WWE wrestler <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wwe-star-randy-orton-auditioned-for-major-deadpool-2-role/1100-6525847/" data-ref-id="1100-6525847">Randy Orton</a> was forced to take a lengthy injury hiatus. And apparently, Orton spent much of that time playing From Software's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/elden-ring-review-death-of-the-wild/1900-6417832/" data-ref-id="1900-6417832">Elden Ring</a> and exploring the Lands Between. Orton may be back in action now, but he's logged 600 hours in Elden Ring since he first started playing.</p><p>Via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/wwe-superstar-randy-orton-says-hes-put-600-hours-into-elden-ring/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a>, Orton revealed his devotion to Elden Ring during Undisputed WWE Champion Cody Rhodes' What Do You Wanna Talk About video series. Orton recalled teasing Rhodes for being a gamer, but now he's become even more of a gamer than Rhodes.</p><p>"I f***ing love Elden Ring," said Orton. "Let me preface this next statement with saying that I was out with spinal fusion surgery, so I had a lot of time on my hands. I got, like, 600 hours on the game... I love that game. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/shadow-of-the-erdtree-renews-the-awe-and-adventure-of-elden-ring/1100-6523901/" data-ref-id="1100-6523901">DLC just came out</a>."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqgcnX9MvNY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/VqgcnX9MvNY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Since becoming the face of WWE, Rhodes doesn't have the same free time he used to. That's one of the reasons why he hasn't played Elden Ring yet. But Orton would still like to share that experience with his friend.</p><p>"You're killing it and you don't got the time, and I understand why," said Orton. "I would love to chop it up about some Elden Ring with you, trust me. I wish you were a fellow Tarnished, but you're not."</p><p>Orton recently signed a new five-year deal with WWE, which would presumably allow him to buy <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/this-elden-ring-book-is-going-to-cost-you-a-fortune/1100-6524860/" data-ref-id="1100-6524860">this upcoming Elden Ring book</a> that is extremely expensive. Even if he doesn't, it sounds like he intends to keep playing the game for a long time to come.</p>

            <p>The Elder Scrolls mobile game, The Elder Scrolls: Castles, is set to launch on 10th September.</p>
<p>The Elder Scrolls: Castles - which was quietly released into <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elder-scrolls-just-got-a-fallout-shelter-style-mobile-game-on-google-play">early access</a> in September 2023 - is now open for pre-registration on both <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/the-elder-scrolls-castles/id1594657136">Apple</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bethsoft.stronghold&amp;hl=en_US">Android</a>.</p>

<p>From the same "award-winning team" behind Fallout Shelter, The Elder Scrolls: Castles lets you reign supreme over your very own castle and dynasty within The Elder Scrolls universe.</p>
<p>"Oversee your subjects and make rulings as the years come and go, families grow, and new rulers take the throne," the team teases.</p>
<p>In related news, Bethesda boss <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/todd-howard">Todd Howard</a> recently confirmed there's no Elder Scrolls TV adaptation in the works.</p>
<p>Despite Amazon's Fallout adaptation getting a very positive reception, it doesn't seem likely that other Bethesda properties will be getting the same treatment. During the Fallout premiere in Los Angeles, Howard was asked if fans could expect TV adaptations from other Bethesda franchises, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/despite-fallout-tv-success-an-elder-scrolls-series-seems-unlikely">such as Elder Scrolls</a>.</p>
<p>"There's nothing in the works," Howard said at the time, before adding: "Everybody asks, like, about Elder Scrolls, and I keep saying no also. And I would approach those - I'll probably say no."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Epic Games announced today that Fortnite will be playable on iOS devices in the European Union and Android devices worldwide. Read more to learn how to download Fortnite on iOS, launch bonuses, and more.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-how-to-install-fortnite-on-ios-devices">How to Install Fortnite on iOS Devices?</h2>



<ul>
<li>To download Fortnite on iOS devices, players should first pass Apple’s region check for European Union customers.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Ensure your device runs iOS 17.4 or higher and use Safari or Brave browser.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Then, visit the Epic Games Store <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/download/android?p=fortnite" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">website</a> and click the “Get it on iPhone” button.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Players will then receive a pop-up on their iOS device that will prevent them from allowing marketplaces by Epic Games. At that time, you need to press OK and head to the Settings app. There, players will find a banner under their iCloud profile that says, “Allow Marketplace From Epic Games.” Click on this banner and then press ‘Allow.’</li>



<li>Then, return to the browser and click ‘install’. You will receive another pop-up where you must select ‘Install App Marketplace’.&nbsp;</li>



<li>You will then have Epic Games Store installed on your iOS device. Launch the app from the homepage, sign in with your Epic Games Store ID and install the games you want to play. You can download Fortnite and other Epic titles, including Rocket League, Fall Guys, and more.&nbsp;</li>



<li>After that, launch the game, and you will be ready to play Fortnite on your iPhone again. Moreover, you can try all the modes, including Creator Made Islands, LEGO Fortnite, Rocket Racing, Fortnite Festival, and Battle Royale.</li>

			<p>The Epic Games Store has finally <a href="http://epic.download/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> on mobile platforms. Users will find it worldwide on Android and in Europe on iOS, allowing Fortnite to again be available to play on Apple's ecosystem. The date is no coincidence, as today marks the launch of Fortnite Battle Royale Chapter 5 Season 4: Absolute Doom, which is centered on Marvel heroes with Doctor Doom as the main villain.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/apple-to-bring-app-store-changes-thanks-to-digital-markets-act/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Markets Act</a> allowed the European launch, but Apple still blocks Fortnite and the Epic Games Store elsewhere. Tim Sweeney, CEO and Founder of Epic Games, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>The tide is turning, and the mobile ecosystem is finally opening up to competition. We are grateful to the European Commission for making it possible to launch the Epic Games Store and offer our games to iOS users in the European Union. Now European iOS users and all Android users can access our store and games, as they've always been able to do on open platforms like PC and Mac. The fight is far from over, but this is tangible progress for developers and consumers who can begin to benefit from competition and choice.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/epic-apple-google-fortnite-eu-tim-sweeney?utm_source=post-email-title&amp;publication_id=66124&amp;post_id=147768702" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Speaking</a> to Game File, Sweeney said that the fight against Apple and Google cost Epic around $1 billion, but added that it was a 'small' price to pay for the freedom of the company and anyone else interested in a free market.</p>
<p>Epic warned users that the process of installing the Epic Games Store on both Android and iOS is currently pretty convoluted. However, they prepared tutorial videos for each platform.</p>

<p>The Epic Games Store on mobile includes not only Fortnite but also Rocket League: Sideswipe and the brand new Fall Guys for mobile. There's a promotional offer valid until November 2 that rewards gamers who install and play the games on the new store and then complete in-game challenges to unlock a few outfits.</p>
<p>Moreover, Epic is partnering with third party mobile app stores to bring its games to every marketplace. This begins today with the launch of Epic's games on AltStore PAL for iOS users in the European Union. Epic also plans to bring the games to Aptoide's iOS store in the EU and the ONE store on Android.</p>

            <p>Following the news Krafton was saving Hi-Fi Rush developer Tango Gameworks from being shut down for good, the PUBG publisher has confirmed its plans to "transfer approximately 50 development staff" from the studio to its Japan subsidiary.</p>
<p>This is roughly half the number of the studio's initial development staff, which was over 100. <a href="https://gameranx.com/updates/id/505790/article/half-of-tango-gameworks-is-joining-krafton-because-the-other-half-already-found-new-jobs/">Gameranx</a> reports this is because others have since found employment elsewhere, and as such there are a number of <a href="https://tangogameworks.com/recruitment/animator.html?l=en">job openings</a> at the studio.</p>

</figure>
<p>In an update on social media platform X by Game File's Stephen Totilo, the reporter shared a statement from Krafton's PR, which said those 50 staff who are part of the transfer will "continue to work on new projects, including the expansion of the Hi-Fi Rush IP, at Krafton".</p>
<p>In a separate email shared earlier this week, Totilo said the deal to purchase the Tokyo-based team had been in effect since 1st August, despite it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tango-gameworks-and-hi-fi-rush-acquired-by-pubgs-krafton-following-microsofts-studio-closure-in-may">only becoming public knowledge on Monday</a>.</p>
<p>Krafton's chief financial officer Dongkeun Bae called the deal an "acqui-hire" - a portmanteau of 'acquisition' and 'hiring' - during an earnings call held this week.</p>
<p>As shared within Totilo's newsletter, Bae said Krafton "wanted to inherit the entire development team", and a more traditional acquisition wasn't possible because <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-shuts-slew-of-bethesda-studios-including-redfall-hi-fi-rush-developers">Tango Gameworks had been closed down by Microsoft</a>.</p> <div>

<p>Tango Gameworks, which is also known for the likes of the Evil Within series, was founded by Shinji Mikami in 2010. In 2012, Bethesda parent company <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resi-evil-creator-mikami-joins-zenimax">ZeniMax Media purchased Tango</a>, before it was then itself <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-buying-zenimax-parent-company-of-bethesda-id-software-and-more-report">acquired by Microsoft</a> years later.</p>
<p>Under Microsoft, Tango surprise launched Hi-Fi Rush last year to wide acclaim. Our Ed called it both "vibrant and self-assured" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hi-fi-rush-review-an-unrepentant-riot-of-rhythm-action">Eurogamer's own Hi-Fi Rush review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 may not be released during the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-miss-early-2025-launch/">current fiscal year ending in March 2025</a>, but it may still launch in the first half of the year, according to a new report.</p>
<p>Tokyo Security analyst Hideki Yasuda said in a <a href="https://kabutan.jp/news/marketnews/?b=n202408150860" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new report</a> that the console should be released in the first half of the year for $499. As such, if the console won't indeed launch in the current fiscal year, it should become available between April and June.</p>
<p>As far as official information goes, very little is currently known about the Nintendo Switch 2, not even its official name. The system will deliver a level of performance <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-software-impact/">not too different from the Steam Deck</a>, although the console's stronger GPU and weaker CPU, compared to Valve's system, will make it run games at <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-higher-resolution-steam-deck/">a higher resolution but lower framerate</a>. The console is also said to support NVIDIA DLSS and Ray Reconstruction, which should give it an edge in a variety of situations, potentially making it superior to the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X when it comes to ray tracing.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 has yet to be officially revealed. We will let you know more about the system as soon as possible, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/16/24221361/fortnite-iphone-epic-games-app-store<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Fortnite</em> is finally back on iOS, just over four years after Apple booted it from the iOS App Store — but it’s only available in the EU. The game is launching today on both a new iPhone version of the Epic Games Store and through AltStore PAL, another third-party app store. The Epic Games Store is also launching today for Android users worldwide.</p><p>The launch follows years of litigation between Epic and Apple, as well as regulatory changes ushered in by the EU’s Digital Markets Act, which forced Apple to allow <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/25/24050200/apple-third-party-app-stores-allowed-iphone-ios-europe-digital-markets-act">alternate app stores</a>. Epic plans to eventually bring its games to Aptoide’s iOS store in the EU and the ONE Store on Android and says<strong> </strong>in <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.epicgames.com%2Fsite%2Fen-US%2Fnews%2Fthe-epic-games-store-launches-on-mobile">a blog post</a> that “we look forward to bringing our games to other stores around the world.”</p><p>“We’re really excited and grateful for the European DMA law,” Epic Games founder and CEO Tim Sweeney said in a briefing with reporters. “<em>Fortnite</em> is finally returning to iOS in Europe.”</p><p>There is a catch: after scanning the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/mobile">QR code from Epic’s website</a>, a popup appears saying “to install the Epic Games Store on your iPhone, update to iOS 17.6 or later.” This conflicts with <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/mobile/ios">Epic’s own FAQ</a> that says the Games Store can be installed on “iPhones running iOS 17.4 or later.”</p><p>Nevertheless, the revived iOS version of <em>Fortnite</em> is launching just in time for the new<strong> </strong><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/15/24221374/fortnite-marvel-absolute-doctor-doom">Marvel-themed season</a>, giving EU players a potentially major reason to come back to the game on Apple’s mobile platform. Sweeney said that Epic foresees “absolutely no trouble of being able to update <em>Fortnite</em> simultaneously, worldwide.” In addition to <em>Fortnite, </em>European iPhone owners and global Android users will be able to download Epic’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/24/22345184/rocket-league-sideswipe-android-ios-announced"><em>Rocket League Sideswipe</em></a> and a new title, a mobile version of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21355586/fall-guys-ultimate-knockout-pc-ps4-game"><em>Fall Guys</em></a>, from the Epic Games Store.&nbsp;</p><div><figcaption>Fall Guys<em> is now available on mobile for the first time.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Epic Games</cite></p></div><div><p>Since Epic announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/25/24050800/epic-games-store-fortnite-apple-ios-launch-eu-dma">its plans</a> for an iOS store, Apple has repeatedly slowed the process down. In March, Apple <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/6/24092158/epic-apple-developer-account-terminated-digital-markets-act-alternative-ios-app-store">shut down an Epic developer account</a> and called the company “verifiably untrustworthy,” perhaps alluding to Epic knowingly breaking Apple’s rules with a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366259/epic-fortnite-vbucks-mega-drop-discount-iphone-android"><em>Fortnite </em>in-app payment system</a> that got it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366438/apple-fortnite-ios-app-store-violations-epic-payments">kicked off iOS</a>. Apple reinstated Epic’s account <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/8/24094543/epic-games-ios-developer-license-apple-dma">after an inquiry from the European Commission</a>, but it later took issue with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/6/24193182/apple-approved-epic-games-store-notarized-eu-dma-fortnite">the Epic Games Store’s buttons</a>.&nbsp;</p></div><p>While the mobile Epic Games Store currently has just three first-party games, the company is already in discussions with third-party mobile developers. Epic aims to have a “curated” selection of third-party games on the mobile store in December, VP and Epic Games Store GM Steve Allison said, with self-publishing (which <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/9/23630864/epic-games-store-self-publish-tools-ratings">is already possible on PC</a>) set to arrive in early 2025. Epic also plans to bring over “everything” it offers on PC, like its 88 percent revenue share for developers, free games for players, and the option for developers to use their own payment platforms. It’s aiming for 100 million net new Epic Games Store mobile installations by the end of the year, Allison said, though that could be hampered by hurdles in Apple’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24100979/altstore-europe-app-marketplace-price-games">third-party installation process</a>.</p><p>To succeed, Epic will need developers to brave Apple’s fees for venturing outside the App Store. If a developer wants to list their app on a third-party store, they must pay Apple a “<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/26/24051823/apple-third-party-app-stores-50-cent-fee">Core Technology Fee</a>” of €0.50 per year for each install after the first million. This fee applies to app installs on both third-party app stores <em>and</em> the App Store, which could add up quickly if you have a successful app on the App Store and want to offer your app through an outside marketplace. “The effect of that is to dissuade any developer of a current, successful game from putting their game on any store that competes with the iOS App Store,” Sweeney said.</p><p>Apple also announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/9/24216181/apple-eu-app-store-services-fee-external-links">additional new fees</a> last week. “We’d like to use the walled garden terminology, but these core tech fees and the new things introduced last week made the wall a little bit higher, and maybe [Apple] put some barbed wire on top,” Allison said.</p><p>For Epic, it’s worth scaling that wall. According to court documents, <em>Fortnite</em> on iOS made <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/28/22407939/fortnite-biggest-platform-revenue-playstation-not-ios-iphone">more than $700 million</a> over the two years before Apple yanked it from the store. While <em>Fortnite</em> will certainly have a much smaller audience on an EU-only third-party store, Epic will get 100 percent of the revenues from in-app purchases instead of paying Apple’s usual 30 percent App Store cut. Some of that revenue will go toward Apple’s fees, but Epic is big enough to weather them. And if regulation, competitive pressures, or public sentiment force Apple to soften its byzantine rules for third-party app stores, Epic will be one of the biggest, earliest players in the field.</p><p>But so far, many third-party developers seem leery. Allison said that Epic is in active discussions with “just about every single one” of the top 250 mobile developers. And while the developers are “very enthusiastic” about the Epic Games Store on Android, “almost all of them” said they can’t make it work on iOS.</p><p>Epic knows it’s got a long way to go. The company has already spent hundreds of millions in its fight with Apple, according to Sweeney. And Allison acknowledged there’s still a huge amount of friction for players and developers. “But our vision for the future is we’re going to keep fighting,” Allison said. “We’re going to make progress. We are confident that over time, we will get these things eradicated. But we don’t know if it’s going to be two months or two years or longer, but we certainly hope it’s one of the shorter ones.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<h2 id="h-fortnite-chapter-5-season-4-pois">Fortnite Chapter 5 Season 4 POIs</h2>



<p>In the latest season of Fortnite, Dr. Doom and his army are the main villains. Dr. Doom has introduced new points of interest (POIs) in Chapter 5, Season 4, to strengthen his control over the island. The first addition is Castle Doom, a towering structure casting a massive shadow over the island. Next is The Raft, a maximum security prison that Doom has brought to the island to recruit more evil characters. Lastly, there’s Doomstadt, a Latverian Village run by Doom. Players will also find a Fantastic Four easter egg in this area.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-marvel-weapons">Marvel Weapons</h2>



<p>Fortnite Chapter 5 Season 4 has unvaulted old Marvel weapons and introduced new ones. First is the return of Dr Doom’s Gauntlets and Captain America’s shield; both weapons have been updated with new capabilities. Then we see new additions to the Marvel weapons pool, which include Gwenpool’s Dual Micro SMGs and War Machine’s Arsenal, Auto Turret and Hover Jets.&nbsp;Moreover, we also saw Black Panther’s claws as a new melee weapon in the latest trailer.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-fortnite-chapter-5-season-4-medallions-and-mythics">Fortnite Chapter 5 Season 4 Medallions and Mythics</h2>



<p>Three new medallions and mythics in the latest Fortnite season can be claimed by defeating three bosses. First is Doombot in Castle Doom; defeating him will grant you the Siphon Medallion and the Monarch Pistol. Then we have Emma Frost at The Raft, who players can defeat to acquire the Reveal Medallion and the Striker Burst Rifle. Third, Mysterio at Doomstadt can be defeated for the Stealth Medallion and the Sovereign Shotgun.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-absolute-doom-battle-pass">Absolute Doom Battle Pass</h2>



<p>Fortnite Chapter 5 Season 4’s Battle Pass will cost players 950 V Bucks and let players earn up to 1,500 V Bucks as they level up. Players can earn XP across Battle Royale, Creator-Made Islands, LEGO Fortnite, Rocket Racing and Fortnite Festival. Levelling up through the latest battle pass will grant you skins like Gwenpool, War Machine, Peelverine, Emma Frost, Captain Jonesy, Mysterio and Shuri. Dr Doom will also be available later in the season through special Battle Pass Quests in September. The last day for progressing through the Absolute Doom Battle Pass is&nbsp; November 1 at 11 PM PT / November 2 at 2 AM ET.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>
Two Legacy of Kain games are being re-released, but for the Evercade retro handheld console.
</p>
<p>
The Legacy of Kain Collection will include both Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain and Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver on one giga cart priced £22.49.
</p>
<p>
The collection will release next month and will be <a href="https://evercade.co.uk/cartridges/legacy-of-kain-collection/">available to pre-order</a> from 30th August. It's compatible with all Evercade and Super Pocket devices.

<p>

The two games mark the first entries in the Legacy of Kain saga, which began with Blood Omen in 1996. The follow-up, Soul Reaver, was helmed by Amy Hennig and has become a cult classic, with fans desperate for a re-release or remake.
</p>
<p>
Indeed, at last month's Comic-Con San Diego, logos for an unannounced "<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/legacy-of-kain-soul-reaver-1-2-remaster-hints-surface-at-comic-con">Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver 1 &amp; 2 Remastered</a>" were included on display plaques accompanying statues of characters from the games, leading to much speculation.

</p>
<p>
The games' developer Crystal Dynamics also released a survey to fans in 2022 to gauge interest in a potential revival of the series. It <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/crystal-dynamics-hears-legacy-of-kain-fans-loudly-and-clearly-following-huge-survey-response">received a huge response</a>.
</p>
<p>
"Rest assured," said Crystal Dynamics and Eidos CEO Phil Rogers, "we hear you loudly and clearly, and we'll continue to update you on the 'what if' possibilities ahead for Legacy of Kain in the future."

</p>
<p>
This Evercade re-release of the original games may not be the full remake fans were hoping for, but it's at least some movement in the right direction. Eurogamer's Ian Higton has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-weve-been-playing-fitness-games-old-classics-and-dungeons-dragons">already got his hands on the Evercade versions</a>: "I know exactly what I'll be doing on my flight to Gamescom next week," he said. "Imagine it: playing a PS1 game on a plane on a handheld device. The future is now - the future is retro!"

</p>
<p>
The collection is the second release from Blaze Entertainment and Crystal Dynamics, following Tomb Raider Collection 1, which includes the first three of Lara Croft's adventures.

            <p>
Epic Games boss Tim Sweeney has said he has "no regrets" over his company's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-adds-cheaper-mobile-payment-option-to-circumvent-apple-google-fees">decision to break Apple and Google's terms of service back in August 2020</a> - something that saw the hugely-popular <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> booted off both iPhone and Android storefronts.
</p>
<p>
The carefully choreographed stunt sparked four years of legal wrangling over Apple and Google's app store policies - and has ultimately led to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-secures-ios-developer-account-europe-mobile-store-and-fortnite-launch-this-year">Epic Games launching its own mobile store today</a> on Android worldwide and on iPhone in mainland Europe, thanks to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-returning-to-ios-says-epic-as-apple-agrees-to-alternative-app-marketplaces-in-eu">policy changes demanded of Apple by the EU</a>.
</p>
<p>
"We've probably lost a billion dollars not having Fortnite on iOS the past four years," Sweeney said, in a briefing to press ahead of the Epic Games Store on mobile going live. "But what's the price of freedom?"
</p>
<p>
Today, Fortnite, Rocket League Sideswipe and a new <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fall-guys">Fall Guys</a> mobile version (cross-compatible with the existing PC and console editions) will be the first games available in the Epic Game Store on smartphones. Other, non-Epic Games titles will then become available later this year.
</p>
<p>
"We've set a goal of 100m new installs across Android and iOS before the end of the year," explained Steve Allison, Epic Game Store's VP, General Manager. "We think we could do that in a world where everything was a level playing field, and we're still trying to drive at that number. The only thing standing in our way is the friction Apple and Google are putting in front of us - and it's pretty significant."
</p>
<p>
Epic Games is still unhappy about a variety of things - including a fiddly process to install its alternative storefront on iPhone that it says requires 15 steps. This is in comparison to the handful of taps necessary to download a game from the in-built App Store. 
</p>
<p>
First, you'll need to head to Epic Games' website (again, this is if you're on Android, or on an iOS device in the EU - apologies, UK readers) and hit the install Epic Games Store button. On iPhone, this will bring up the first of several "scare screens" - ominous-looking warnings that tell you the process requires you to go change your device settings. It's not a difficult process, but it's fair to say Apple could make it more straightforward - and the warnings seem deliberately worded to dissuade casual users from continuing. 
</p>
<p>
Epic Games' hope, it seems, is that Fortnite (and also Rocket League and Fall Guys) are big enough draws that people push through the above 15 steps to get playing the company's games again on their phones. And, once again, there's more careful choreography at play - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-and-marvel-confirm-new-crossover-season-starring-doctor-doom-as-disney-integration-deepens">today also being the big launch of Fortnite's new Marvel-infused season</a>.
</p>
<p>
"We're going to invest in getting hundreds of millions of players through the gate," Allison continued, "and we're working super hard across the board to get third-party developers to join us". 
</p>
<p>
But, on iPhone especially, Epic Games faces an uphill battle still. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-returning-to-ios-says-epic-as-apple-agrees-to-alternative-app-marketplaces-in-eu">Sweeney has previously railed against Apple's "junk fees on downloads and new Apple taxes"</a> that are currently set to penalise any developers who want to launch an app on the Epic Games Store for mobile as well as on the App Store. (Memorably, Sweeney dubbed these fees as "hot garbage".) 
</p>
<p>
"Of the top 250 developers we've been targeting to bring their apps to the Epic Game Store, everybody's excited about coming to our store on Android because there's no imposition of 'junk fees' just for the purpose of going to a competing store," Sweeney told press this week. "Zero of them have expressed a willingness to come to the Epic Game Store on iOS - it's just uneconomical. 
</p>
<p>
"Apple has set these fees in order to make it vastly more expensive, not just to do business on the Epic Game Store, but if you come to the Epic Game Store you're penalised on the iOS App Store. They make their store terms worse for the privilege of trying to compete with them. Obviously it makes no competitive sense, its anti-competitive."
</p>
<p>Exactly how much further Apple will change its policies remains to be seen, but the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eu-opens-fresh-investigation-into-apple-following-further-non-compliance-claims">EU continues to take a close interest in how the mobile maker is implementing the changes it has been required to make</a> as a result of the bloc's Digital Markets Act (DMA). Today's launch gives Epic Games a foot in the door, for now, an the company says it is hopeful of further markets opening up next year, including the UK and Japan.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/1_cSMjsqI.jpg?width=1200&amp;height=1200&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=70&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Epic Games</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
In the meantime, Apple has behaved "dishonestly and maliciously", Sweeney continued. "If you give Apple the arbitary power to block competitors' access to the platform, of course they can block whoever they want. That power needs to be taken away from them."
</p>
<p>
Today also sees Fortnite, Rocket League Sideswipe and Fall Guys also become available on the first of several other, smaller third-party mobile stores (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-is-pulling-fortnite-from-rent-collector-mobile-stores-as-it-readies-own-eu-shop">though no longer major player Samsung</a>), as Epic Games seeks to demonstrate it is fighting for wider change, rather than just its own slice of the app store market.
</p>
<p>
So, you can also now nab the above three games from indie app store Altstore, an enterprise co-founded by Riley Testut, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-game-emulator-currently-top-free-download-on-iphone-app-store">creator of the Delta emulator</a>, which Apple initially blocked. Other apps from Altstore include a mobile Torrent app.
</p>
<p>
"I've no regrets, Apple had to be challenged," Sweeney concluded, reflecting on the past four years. "Before we directly challenged Apple and pointed out to the world exactly what their practices were, a lot of people just read Apple's marketing and thought the App Store was a normal store like any other. They didn't realise that it was, in effect, banning any other competition. And because all app developers passed on their 30 percent fees to their customers, no one understood the App Store inflated prices for anything users come into contact with. 
</p>
<p>"The way we challenged Apple and Google - we introduced Epic Direct Payment and passed on 20 percent savings to all our customers - immediately turned the conversation to these 'junk fees' increasing the cost of software and the monopoly nature of its App Store. By Apple blocking Fortnite from a billion devices they proved to the world they do have a monopoly to access to software for a billion users. Similarly by Google blocking Fortnite they established they did have a monopoly. 
</p>
<p>
"When you look at everything that's happened since, you can trace a lot of it back - not only to regulators, but also consumers coming to a really clear realisation of the insidious nature of what [Apple/Google] call 'walled gardens' but we should just simply call monopolies in the fields of software distribution and payment processing, and how they've really corrupted the whole digital ecosystem compared to the days of really open platforms, such as Windows and the open web."
</p>
<p>
  Epic Games isn't the only company launching a new mobile storefront. While delayed beyond its expected launch date, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-to-open-web-based-mobile-game-store-this-summer">Microsoft is still working on its own store for smartphones</a> - and it will be interesting to see if Fortnite will end up on there. "The standard for us is - great terms for all developers," Allison said, when asked. "We don't know their terms yet."
</p>
<p>"If [the terms] are great, we'll come," concluded Sweeney. "If they're not great, we won't come."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>When Telltale Games collapsed in 2018, four developers stepped in to acquire the rights to Sam &amp; Max. Skunkape Games, as they are known, set about rereleasing the Sam &amp; Max series — three seasons each of which was originally released in episodic form, following the sitular dog detective and his&nbsp;lagomorph pal. Now the third and final season has been rereleased, asking once again: “if any one of us could unlock the power of the mind, would we use it to unlock the powers of the infinite… or would we use it to destroy?”</p>
<p><iframe title="Sam &amp; Max: The Devil's Playhouse Remastered! Now available!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RzXbwm0P65E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>If you have played either of the two previous seasons —&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/01/20/sam-max-save-the-world-remastered-switch-review/">Sam &amp; Max Save the World</a> or Sam &amp; Max Beyond Time and Space, you can very quickly guess which one plays out.</p>


<p>If you haven’t had the pleasure, Sam &amp; Max are freelance police. Sam is a cool, calm and collected bipedal dog in a suit. Max is the embodiment of chaos, a hyperkinetic rabbity thing, and — naturally — the President of the US. The have relatively little regard for the law, and pretty much just stroll around performing an overly elaborate and complex set of point-and-click tasks in order to achieve their goals.</p>


<p>At the beginning of Chapter 1 of The Devil’s Playhouse, The Penal Zone, Max picks up a kid’s toy that allows him to see into the future. Little did he know that the Eyes of Yog Sogoth that he just grabbed would also unlock his psychic powers. As the game progresses, he picks up playing cards that grant mindreading, a telephone that transports them to another phone and a rhinoplasty toy that lets them shapeshift — all amusing little plays on what the item does for everyone else, and an insight into the playfulness of Sam &amp; Max creator Steve Purcell’s brain.</p>
<p>The problem is that these Toys of Power are being sought by an evil and powerful space gorilla, General Skun-ka’pe. He lands on your street, tries to claim the toys and even steal Max’s brain so that he can wield the Toys of Power for himself.</p>

<p>What follows is a joyous campaign of puerile humour and anarchistic problem solving. Case in point: when Skun-ka’pe brags to his queen that after locking Sam and Max in an intergalactic prison and blowing it up with an antimatter bomb, “I took care of the&nbsp;Penal Zone in one stroke”. Max walks past and snidely comments on the unfortunate choice of words.</p>
<p>But all of this was true when the game was first released in 2010. So how does 2024’s remaster shape up?</p>
<p>The answer is incredibly well. As with the previous remasters, most of the changes are technical, bringing the graphics from 1024×768 4:3 to high-res 16:9. The lighting, lip sync and audio have all been drastically improved, with the audio in particular shining through. That said, it’s not all just higher resolutions. Character models have been tweaked, new credits and menus have been added and the whole thing feels a little more connected as a result, and closer to Steve Purcell’s original vision. We know this because Skunkape said they had Purcell’s input along the way.</p>

<p>On top of this, a ‘new’ Toy of Power that didn’t make it to the original PC version is now available in the Nutri-Specs, along with a bunch of more spoiler-y additions that we won’t go into.</p>
<p>There’s not really much to complain about here. The intros are still unskippable, and the run button feels like it’s in the wrong place – I still don’t understand why running isn’t the default. Beyond that, there’s minor gripes with trophies not popping on the PS5, but that’s not the end of the world.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Sam and Max: The Devil’s Playhouse is exactly what you want from a remaster. It has been faithfully rebuilt, adding improvements and things that make sense, and tightening the things that were a little leaky. I loved stepping back into Sam’s (lack of) shoes and holding the world to rights as a newly psychic Max. If you don’t mind a bit of juvenile humour, this is still one of the funniest point-and-click adventures I’ve ever played, but a little prettier than I remember.	</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/castaway-review-delightful-little-adventure<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Castaway </em>is a game that wears its inspirations on its sleeve and knows exactly what it wants to be. Developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/lunark">Canari Games</a> markets it as a short but sweet experience you can complete in a few hours, but those few hours are packed full of wonderful fun.</p>
<p>Washing up on a beach of some forlorn planet, players take control of a nameless protagonist out to rescue his dog from a group of pesky pterodactyls. That's really the gist of the story, but it's all the background info you need to enjoy this experience.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/castaway-pterodactyls.png?itok=BgsQz19E 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/png"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/castaway-pterodactyls.png?itok=vw_KTQ6Q 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/png"></picture><figcaption>Man, don't you hate it when pterodactyls kidnap your dog?</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Castaway</em>'s Island of Adventure.</h2>
<p>Developer Johan Vinet explains <em>Castaway</em> as two mini-games in one, and that's a great descriptor. <em>Castaway</em> is split into two segments, the first of which is a brief island adventure, and the second acting as a subdued roguelite dungeon crawl through a perilous 50-floor dungeon.</p>
<p>The first portion of this adventure tasks players with rescuing their kidnapped companion. The island you explore is pretty small but very dense, meaning no enemy or obstacle is there to waste your time. Over the course of an hour or so, players gather new equipment to aid in their adventure, like a pickaxe and a grappling hook device.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/castaway-hook.png?itok=pozsp_aA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/png"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/castaway-hook.png?itok=IoYj4Iba 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/png"></picture><figcaption>Hook onto that rock and a gap is no longer perilous!</figcaption></figure><p>Along with your sword, these items work exactly as you'd expect. Both the overworld and the three dungeons players explore take advantage of these tools to the fullest, often involving simple sokoban puzzles (aka moving blocks around). These are largely easy to understand and shouldn't inhibit your progress, but it's still gratifying when you solve a puzzle.</p>
<p>Venturing from the overworld into a dungeon will put your equipment to the test. Using your pickaxe can crack open rocks and the hook shot allows you to travel across gaps. Of course, <em>Castawa</em><em>y</em>'s overworld and dungeons feature a few enemy types as well, and the combat is your standard one-button sword slash a la <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/legend-of-zelda-links-awakening"><em>Link</em>'s <em>Awakening</em></a>.</p>
<p>At the end of each dungeon is a boss battle to shake things up a bit. On the base difficulty, even bosses will pose no threat to players with even a moderate amount of experience in 2D, dungeon-crawling games. Nonetheless, you can take things up a notch by increasing the difficulty to Unfair, which gives you one heart and that's it -- get hit, you're dead for good.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/castaway-dungeon-1.png?itok=yLn9GMsv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/png"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/castaway-dungeon-1.png?itok=d0sO_E0N 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/png"></picture><figcaption>One of those rocks is not like the others.</figcaption></figure><p>Conversely, you can test your skills with the Speedrun mode and, if you're finding things difficult, Invincible and Pacifist modes. The former is exactly as it sounds, making you impervious to damage, while the latter removes enemies altogether.</p>
<p>These modes are a really neat inclusion because the audience for <em>Castaway</em> is meant for all ages and by including such modes, you could hand the controller to a child and they would have a blast. It's such an endearing notion that this may be a kid's first game, and I'm sure they'd love it.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/castaway-tower.png?itok=DCC8JkJr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/png"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/castaway-tower.png?itok=g87q02XC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/png"></picture><figcaption>The tower's rooms are small, but they can be densely packed.</figcaption></figure><h2>A Towering Challenge in <em>Castaway</em></h2>
<p>Of course, if things seem a little too easy in the island adventure, there's also a 50-floor dungeon to power through. This doesn't have a difficulty mode, so you're more likely to be challenged here than anywhere else. The goal is to get to the top and beat the final boss battle, but that's easier said than done: die and you're back to the foot of the tower.</p>
<p>You're still equipped with the usual equipment for the tower, but it does strip you of two of your four hearts, making the stakes a bit higher. Thankfully, there's a level-up system in place that allows players to improve as they climb.</p>
<p>Killing enemies on floors of the tower drops gold, and that's used to fund your new upgrades. Upgrades range from increasing your sword or pickaxe's damage to adding more health. Survivability was a priority for me, so I opted for more hearts as well as armor that would take a hit without taking actual damage -- it would remove my armor, but that'd replenish on the next floor.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/castaway-upgrades.png?itok=4mAlhLSG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/png"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/castaway-upgrades.png?itok=qf2gfN1x 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/png"></picture><figcaption>Upgrades are simple, and they'll make your life easier.</figcaption></figure><p>The first few times you climb the tower, things can get a little tricky. Spike traps and cleverly placed enemies are in the way and you might even get overwhelmed by foes if you're not careful. I constantly weighed my options as I lost more health -- all level-ups offer the ability to heal, but the trade-off is not getting an upgrade to your equipment. Hard choices must be made!</p>
<p>This mode is purely combat-based, though, which might not be as fun for some. I would have preferred to see a few puzzles thrown into the mix since the island adventure ends so soon. Though it'll probably take two or so hours after a few attempts of climbing, it can feel a tad repetitive seeing the same floors and having it be 100 percent combat.</p>
<p>Floors are also bite-sized, though, so it's not a terrible burden at the end of the day. However, I did get soft-locked a few times by getting stuck on a tile and some enemies bugged into the wall, causing me to reset. That repetition can get frustrating, but it isn't a dealbreaker when the rest of the experience is pleasurable.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/castaway-spikes.png?itok=l6v8P3J4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/png"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/castaway-spikes.png?itok=mYmaE6FA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/png"></picture><figcaption>Watch your step!</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Castaway </em>Review | Final Thoughts</h2>
<p><em>Castaway</em> is one of 2024's most charming games. The passion from Canari Games is quite evident in the final product, and though it's a short experience with only a few slight frustrations near the end, it's an adventure anyone can enjoy. Whether you're nostalgic for the past or want something to distract you for the weekend, <em>Castaway</em>'s got you covered.</p>
<hr><p><em><strong>Castaway </strong>was reviewed on PC with a code provided by the developer over roughly 4 hours of gameplay. All screenshots in this review were taken by the reviewer during gameplay. </em></p>

<h2>Review Summary</h2>

<p>
Castaway doesn't reinvent the wheel, nor does it intend to. What Canari Games set out to do is to create a rock solid, short-but-sweet experience, and this endearing adventure game achieves just that. (<a href="https://techraptor.net/review-score-policy">Review Policy</a>)

            <p>Any gags I could make about an update that lets <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-warhammer-iii">Total War: Warhammer </a>3’s dawi play tall are far too obvious for the discerning comedic palette that brought you such bangers as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/overkills-the-walking-dead-review">that time I just wrote “(penis)” a bunch</a> so the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/overkills-the-walking-dead">Overkill’s Walking Dead</a> page wouldn’t quote me out of context, so let’s just dive right in to the details. The strategy game’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/total-war-warhammer-3-teases-new-content-this-month-and-a-hotfix-ensures-goblins-will-now-get-dismembered-correctly">5.2 update is on the horizon</a>, and tagging along with it are the first of the “extra bits” the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/colossal-squigs-all-but-confirmed-for-next-total-war-warhammer-3-dlc-plus-big-new-toys-for-ogres-and-khorne">team teased in June</a>. I’m very excited about them. They sit somewhere between the usual patch fare of stat tweaks and errata, and the weightier faction facelifts that come alongside paid DLC. They’re also focused right where <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-warhammer-iii-immortal-empires">Immortal Empires</a> needs them the most: depth, rather than width. In the dawi’s case, quite literally.</p>

<p>You can find the full breakdown of the three headline features <a href="https://community.creative-assembly.com/total-war/total-war-warhammer/blogs/29-total-war-warhammer-iii-patch-5-2-dev-blog">here</a>. But, broadly, there are updates for both chaos and the dwarves, plus “unusual locations”  - a sort of fleshed-out set of landmarks which you’ll discover as you explore the map. One of the examples given is a Bretonnian holy site called “Grail Knight’s Grave”. Initially, owning the settlement gives a small bonus to control and corruption, as well as some holy horse-fanciers for your garrison. When control is over 75, any characters in the region have a chance to gain a tantalising <em>mystery trait. </em> The blog doesn’t reveal this trait, but I hope it’s <a href="https://youtu.be/onxTQx8aPZA">cow-buchet</a> related.</p>
<p>There are a few more teasers shown off, but I’m mainly enthusiastic about what design director Mitchell Heastie has to say here. He’s “a huge fan of worldbuilding content in games,” and says that he’s “always wanted to make the world feel a bit more alive - this is hopefully a start to doing more for both of those things.” Again, Immortal Empires is already irresponsibly massive and stuffed with more units than any reasonable person can keep track of. It’s these fertile embellishments that elevate it from a map to a world.</p>

<p>Next up is a rework to chaos cults, long maligned for feeling far too flat and lifeless to represent the hives of corrupted activity they’re intended to be. “Ultimately the fantasy is that Cults create the corruption, not the other way around,” says Heastie. They’ll no longer spring up in corrupted areas - it’ll now be the task of cultists belonging to all four monogods to set them up, which was previously just a Slaanesh thing. The cult magus is a new campaign-only character that specialises in setting up unique cults that offer more options. You’ll get access to the magus through upgrading standard chaos cults.</p>
<p>I’m not initially sold on the idea of stripping away an entire method of spreading cults, but Slaanesh’s exponential cult play is really engaging, so I can see this working well. The cults themselves look much more interactive and varied, too. They’ll now be a version of the skaven undercity archetype, with various resource-sapping buildings and a few devastating rituals. Khorne’s leader teleportation is now available to each of the four gods, for example.</p>
<p>And finally, there’s a new Dwarf feature named ‘the deeps’, for dawi fans that want to play tall. After shelling out a pile of cash, you’ll be able to expand your settlements into the earth, giving you unique buildings and more slots to play with. There’s some lovely flavour you’ll discover as you dig(gy diggy hole), too, like blocked tunnels and “some stranger things you can discover in the Deeps.” Here’s a nifty one from the new ‘guild foundries’ building: “+5% settlement income per turn count”. I’ve not seen that one before across the whole game. So that’s 500% (<strong>Future Ed Nic:</strong> No. No. Try again) income on turn 50, presumably? Say short again. Go on.</p>
<p>The blog also mentions an update to Cathay’s ivory road, although doesn’t go into detail just yet. I’m really into the deeps specifically, but the real prize here is knowing the team have reached a place where they’re ready to start experimenting with these smaller, flavourful additions between paid expansions. Heastie described this as “pushing our own expectations for what new content for the game could be, to always be on the lookout for what special idea we could do next.” There’s obviously an incentive with these things to sound passionate, but this feels genuine to me.  If so, I’m chuffed that the team feel they’re in a good spot. Fair warning, though, the dawi are going to be unbearably smug fuckers about all this.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The mountain biking of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lonely-mountains-downhill">Lonely Mountains: Downhill</a> was sometimes a relaxing ride down gentle slopes, and at other times a hairy hurtle down declivitous cliffs. Alongside the likes of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/descenders">Descenders</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/riders-republic">Riders Republic</a>, it offered a more laid-back game, open to furious time trialling but always remembering to let you stop and appreciate the view. Both the stakes and the poly count were low. Happy news then, that it is getting a snowy sequel. In <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lonely-mountains-snow-riders">Lonely Mountains: Snow Riders</a> you'll be swapping your bike for a pair of skis, and you'll be able to barrel down the mountainside with friends in co-op.</p>

<p>That looks just right. I seem to remember the camera in the first game always following the action from the front, but it looks like this time the view will sometimes let you look ahead. Probably for the best. I've broken enough bones in life already, thank you. </p>
<p>"Lonely Mountains: Snow Riders is a game about skiing down gorgeous mountain vistas. Slice through deep snow, skitter over ice lakes, and leap into the air in spectacular jumps," say developers Megagon Industries on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2545360/Lonely_Mountains_Snow_Riders/">the Steam page</a>. The other big change is that the game will allow for up to 8 players to race one another online, or tackle a mountain together in a chill-sounding co-op mode, "adding save points as you go". </p>
<p>That latter feature sounds quite tranquil. At least one screenshot shows eight players sitting together on the snowy banks of a cold lake, which suggests the hidden "resting places" of the original game are returning. As much as I enjoy a good <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-racing-games">racing game</a>, it'd be sweet to stop and enjoy these vistas with pals. It may also make Alice O happy - she thought these resting spots were pretty darn pleasant.</p>
<p>"Yet the greatest reward of exploration isn't speed, it's outright stopping," she said as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lonely-mountains-downhill-goes-murderously-fast-but-appreciates-a-beautiful-view">part of her tour of cycling games</a>. "At hidden 'resting places', you can press Y to have your character dismount for a nice sit-down. They pick somewhere scenic to stretch their legs, shake out their arms, and take in the view. It is wonderful."</p>
<p>An exact release date hasn't been shared yet, but Lonely Mountains: Snow Riders is due out sometime in 2024, we're told.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
