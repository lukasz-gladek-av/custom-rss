			<p>A new Cyberpunk 2077 patch is now live, introducing NVIDIA DLSS 4 support to the game which brings, with its Transformer model, significant image quality improvements over DLSS 3.8.</p>
<p>The<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1091500/view/538843836072329454?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 2.21 patch</a>, which went live earlier today, introduces, among different things, new Photo Mode features, vehicle color customization fixes, randomizer settings in Character Creation, and a slew of other general fixes. The biggest addition, however, is the introduction of NVIDIA DLSS 4 support, including support for <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-rtx-5080-path-tracing-120-fps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Multi Frame Generation</a> for the upcoming RTX 50 series graphics cards. Following the patch, it is possible to choose between the old CNN model or the Transformer model for DLSS Super Resolution, DLAA, and Ray Reconstruction on all RTX graphics cards.</p>
<p>As highlighted by NVIDIA <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-8x-faster-dlss-3-multi-frame-generation-enhanced-upscaling-rtx-20-above/">earlier this month</a>, the new NVIDIA DLSS 4 Transformer model does bring significant image quality improvements, as highlighted in a new comparison video put together by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MxBenchmarkPC" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MxBenchmarkPC</a>. In Cyberpunk 2077, the new model comes with a small performance cost, but image quality benefits greatly from it, as ghosting is considerably reduced, and the image looks more detailed than before in motion. Anti-aliasing for distant objects is improved as well.</p>

            <p>The scenario for the third part of the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-review-a-faithful-remake-with-a-few-missteps-along-the-way">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a> trilogy is now complete.</p>
<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202501/30815">Famitsu</a> ahead of the PC release of Rebirth alongside game director Naoki Hamaguchi, series producer Yoshinori Kitase confirmed the status of the next game, adding he's "very satisfied with it".</p>
<p>Hamaguchi stated development on the third game began right after Rebirth ended and is progressing without delay from the team's schedule, though it's still publicly unknown when the planned release date will be.</p>

<p>Kitase added Rebirth creative director Tetsuya Nomura was given "homework" to give the remake project a conclusion that both respected the original <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy 7</a> and provided a new sense of satisfaction not felt in the original. This was completed by the end of 2024.</p>
<p>"I'm very satisfied with it, so I'm sure the fans will be satisfied with the final chapter," he said.</p>
<p>Earlier in the interview, the pair discussed the increased importance of the PC platform as player numbers increase.</p>
<p>Kitase noted how development costs are rising, so "we need to deliver [the game] to a wider market". This is in-line with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-aggressively-pursuing-new-multiplatform-strategy-after-reports-ff7-rebirth-underperformed-on-playstation">Square Enix's current multiplatform strategy</a>.</p>
<p>He even joked the PC version is convenient to play in window mode to look up strategies online.</p>
<p>Hamaguchi added there's been interest from fans to add PC features to the PS5 version, specifically the option to fast-forward cutscenes, which the development team would like to include within the limits of the PS5's capabilities. He also mentioned the possibility of adding a New Game Plus mode to the forthcoming third game.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/final-fantasy-7-remake-option-to-speed-up-cutscenes-led-to-an-increase-in-players-says-director/">separate interview with Automaton</a>, Hamaguchi stated the option to speed up cutscenes in Final Fantasy 7 Remake led to an increased interest in the game.</p>
<p>"Nowadays, many people watch videos and movies at double speed. I myself have little time, so I often use the speed-up function," he said. "I think we are in an age where we should let the user decide what kind of experience they have. Rather than letting (long cutscenes) become an obstacle that prevents people playing the game, I think we should incorporate such (time-saving) functions more and more."</p>
<p>Lastly, Hamaguchi also clarified with <a href="https://automaton-media.com/articles/newsjp/20250123-326211/">Automaton</a> the relationship between Cloud and Aerith. In a previous interview with <a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-game-awards-interview-aerith">Inverse</a>, Hamaguchi described their relationship as "sisterly".</p>
<p>Hamaguchi has now gone back on this comment, claiming it was a "misunderstanding". Instead, he will communicate the relationships between characters solely through game content. "No one will officially say anything about who Cloud likes," he said.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/23/ea-cuts-financial-forecasts-as-ea-sports-fc-25-dragon-age-the-veilguard-underperform/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>EA has cut its financial forecasts for the current fiscal year after <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ea-sports-fc-25">EA Sports FC 25</a>, its biggest moneyspinner by far, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/dragon-age-the-veilguard">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> both underperformed at the end of 2024.</p>
<p>While the company had been expecting a single-digit growth in “mid-single-digit growth in live services net bookings” – these encapsulate everything from game sales to DLC and microtransactions – the end result is that there will instead be a “mid-single-digit decline”. The majority of this is to blame on a slowdown with EA Sports FC 25.</p>


<p>While FC 25 will be the most to blame for the dip in financials, the underperformance of Dragon Age: The Veilguard will be more worrying for the company’s future direction.</p>
<p>EA say that Dragon Age: The Veilguard “engaged” with around 1.5 million players during its release quarter, but this is down nearly 50 percent on the company’s expectations, and isn’t even an accurate description of total game sales. This is a real shame after the game was generally well received by critics, and a long-awaited return to what BioWare is best known for. Coming a decade on from Dragon Age: Inquisition, a game which won numerous Game of the Year awards in 2014, and which sold 12 million copies over its lifetime, The Veilguard is a big step back from that. That said, it could certainly reach a wider audience through the first half of 2025, if EA push it through subscription services and with targeted promotional discounts.</p>
<p>This naturally causes fresh concerns for the future of BioWare, and puts more pressure on their next game to succeed, with the studios focus having already shifted over to the next Mass Effect game.</p>

<p>We had a good time with Dragon Age: The Veilguard, with Jason saying in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/10/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review/">our review</a>, “The Veilguard is a beautiful-looking and highly enjoyable game, and a nice return to a more focused feeling RPG that does justice to both Dragon Age as a series and also to Bioware. It’s fun to play in the moment-to-moment, the big decisions feel impactful and worthwhile, and fans of the series will be happy to be running around chasing after that lamentable egg of an Elf once more.”</p>

<p>According to a new interview with Insomniac, Marvel’s Wolverine may or may not be released in 2025.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During a conversation with <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/insomniac-games-ceo-ted-price-exits-ryan-schneider-chad-dezern-jen-huang-playstation-1236281913/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Variety</a> (via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-have-to-be-like-logan-today-and-remain-very-stoic-insomniac-quiet-on-whether-wolverine-will-make-2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>), the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/insomniac-games-founder-and-president-ted-price-is-retiring/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new co-heads</a> of Insomniac, Ryan Schneider, Chad Dezern and Jen Huang, were asked whether Marvel’s Wolverine is still slated to release in 2025. Dezern didn’t confirm or deny the release window but stated they would “love to talk more about Wolverine”, as the title has already been announced. Still, they must “be like Logan today and remain very stoic until it’s time to pop the claws down the road”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dezern added that they will have to hold on to their “pent-up excitement” for Marvel’s Wolverine, and that’s all they could speak about their upcoming projects during the conversation. Marvel’s Wolverine was announced during a PlayStation Showcase in 2021, where a small snippet showcased the character’s iconic claws. Since then, we have yet to hear any official announcements for the game; however, much has been revealed through the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/major-wolverine-leaks-appear-online-spoilers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaks</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During the same interview, the Insomniac heads also expressed interest in “game-to-screen adaptations.” Ryan Schneider spoke about the Ratchet &amp; Clank film and how they “got an early start on that.” Schneider added that they are “interested in that kind of thing,” and the team loves Ratchet &amp; Clank in particular.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Marvel’s Wolverine’s creative director has joined <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wolverine-creative-director-leaves-to-join-xboxs-perfect-dark/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox’s Perfect Dark team</a>. Also, Insomniac confirmed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/spider-man-2-additional-story-dlc-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">no additional story content is coming</a> for Marvel’s Spider-Man 2.

<p>PockerPair Publishing and Tales of Kenzera: Zau developers Surgent Studios have announced that they’ll be joining forces, with PocketPair supporting the development of a new horror game at Surgent.</p>



<p>Taking to X (formerly Twitter), the publisher said, “We’re pleased to announce that our first project as Pocketpair Publishing will be supporting a brand new horror game from Surgent Studios. SURGENT STUDIOS is a studio with an original approach, and Pocketpair is excited to support them to the fullest extent. Please look forward to future announcements for details of specific projects!“</p>



<p>Insider Gaming reached out to Abubakar Salim, the Founder of Surgent Studios, about the deal. Salim said, “I think it’s wonderful that PocketPair Inc. is taking their successes and channeling them into artists and supporting the medium of making games. It’s an incredible honour to be a part of their journey, and there’s a lot more to share over time.”</p>

</p></figure>



<p><br>PockerPair found its success last year with the launch of Palworld, which saw the player battling Pokemon-like creatures but with guns. </p>



<p>PocketPair Publishing said on the deal with Surgent Studios, “We understand the challenges of creating your dream game.&nbsp;At Pocketpair , we’ve been fortunate to find success. Now, more than anything, we want to use that success to help other developers achieve theirs.“</p>



<p>The game hit a peak concurrent player count of 2,101,867, making it one of Steam’s highest-ever concurrent player counts. As of February 22, 2024, the company announced that the game sold 15 million copies on Steam and had reached 10 million players on Xbox.</p>

Now I think about, you could probably eat quite a lot of custard creams in five months, although less so if you were using your hands to build model robots. Have a trailer. It's got robots in it.</p>

<p>A very nice, digital press release with zero custard cream crumbs on it tells me that Mashina is based around "positive verbs" like 'build', 'nurture', 'discover', 'mend', and 'bomb'. It uses traditional stop motion capture with digital techniques, and the music is a tribute to Gamecube-era soundtracks, with the same synth used in Metroid Prime. "Warm and crunchy digital baths" is the phrased used, which I enjoy immensely. Track below. Jack's games always have such fantastic music.</p>

<p>Here are some <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3395930/Mashina/">Steam</a> features:</p>

<p>The Kickstarter is very close to its £12,000 goal already, but still has around 3 weeks to go. If you've got a spare £500, you can even get yourself your own robot. They are very nice robots but I reckon I could probably draw a face on a dustbin lid and spend the rest on chips and Ric Flair action figures and a utility bill or two and be roughly as content. Again though, very nice robots.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The developer of the GTA 6 parody game Grand Taking Ages is launching on Steam after a revamp. &nbsp;</p>



<p>A little over a month ago, a title called <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-iv-grand-taking-ages-ps-store/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grand Taking Ages VI </a>popped up on the PlayStation Store, and it felt eerily similar to Rockstar’s highly anticipated 2025 release, GTA 6, with both games even having the same acronym (GTA VI). After a closer look, it was revealed that Grand Taking Ages VI was a game development simulator where the player manages a studio while tackling obstacles that developers encounter while creating the game. The title was recently pulled from the PlayStation Store due to its controversial appearance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, a report from <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-pulled-gta-6-parody-game-grand-taking-ages-from-the-playstation-store-but-its-now-cleared-for-release-on-steam" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a> reveals that Grand Taking Ages, the GTA 6 parody game, is now launching on Steam while remaining pulled from the PlayStation Store. The developer, Violarte, stated that their approach towards Steam differed, as they “engaged with the team” early on with the game’s concept before the official submission. For its approval, the game underwent a “thorough” review process to be listed on the platform.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After arriving on Steam, you can spot key differences in the GTA 6 parody game’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3464800/Grand_Taking_Ages/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">listing</a>. Grand Taking Ages has dropped the number ‘VI’ from the title. Additionally, they have new screenshots, a fresh trailer, and a revamped description. These changes were made to “clearly differentiate Grand Taking Ages from the original inspiration, GTA 6, and to emphasize its unique direction.”</p>



<p>Grand Taking Ages developer also addressed the PlayStation Store listing, stating they “strongly believe” that the new changes should be enough for the game to return to the platform. The game is slated to release in July 2025; check out its new description:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Coming Soon Since Forever! Start your game dev journey in Mom’s garage! Battle angry fans, dodge ruthless journalists, and perfect the art of “creative” deadlines. Survive on pizza and energy drinks while building your dream studio into… a slightly better garage!</p>
</blockquote>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/23/insomniac-founder-ted-price-announces-his-retirement-after-30-years/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Insomniac founder and president Ted Price has announced his retirement from the games industry, having led the company for the past 30 years. He will step down at the end of March 2025 and will be replaced by three studio co-heads.</p>
<p>Ted Price has been integral to Insomniac throughout its history, the creative director behind Spyro the Dragon, Ratchet &amp; Clank, and Resistance: Fall of Man. All of them are PlayStation icons for their respective generations, with Ratchet &amp; Clank continuing to be a family friendly favourite to this day.</p>


<p><a href="https://sonyinteractive.com/en/news/blog/ted-price-announces-retirement/">In his retirement blog post</a>, and after initially addressing the hardship facing many in the wake of the wildfires in California, Price said:</p>
<p>Another aspect of our culture I hold dear is the Insomniacs’ ability to pull together and successfully overcome what often seem like insurmountable obstacles.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, despite a challenging 2024, Insomniacs stayed fully focused on building games for our fans. As a result of the team’s persistence and collaboration, we’re in one of the strongest positions we’ve experienced in years, with each game in development looking beautiful and playing fantastic.</p>

<p>Therefore, last week, I felt comfortable announcing to the Insomniac team that after having been incredibly fortunate to enjoy such a fulfilling career in games, I’ll be retiring from the industry at the end of March. Today, I’m sharing this news more broadly.</p>
<p>I actually made this decision last year. For me, after over 30 years of leading Insomniac, I felt it was simply time to step aside and let others pave the way for our team.</p>
<p>Filling the space that Price is vacating will be three co-heads for the studio: Chad Dezern, Ryan Schneider and Jen Huang.</p>
<p>Schneider joined Insomniac during the PS2 era on the marketing and comms side, and has most recently been Head of Brand and Leadership Strategy. Huang joined eight years ago as CFO and Head of Finance, having previously been a finance exec elsewhere. Lastly, Dezern started at Insomniac back in 1998 as part of the creative team working in various roles as&nbsp;Environment Artist, Art Director, Studio Director for the Durham studio, and as the Head of Creative since 2017.</p>
<p>Of the trio, Price writes:</p>
<p>For many years, Chad, Jen and Ryan have been instrumental in making Insomniac what we are today. I’ve seen each lead major initiatives here which have positively changed Insomniacs’ lives. Plus, they’ve consistently demonstrated the kind of collaboration and transparency that’s part of our DNA. And just as important, their skillsets are truly complementary.</p>
<p>There is no way that I would ever consider handing the reins to a team I didn’t trust to take care of Insomniacs and lead us to even greater heights. Chad, Jen and Ryan are that team. For those who may not be familiar, please take a moment to get to know them here.</p>

            <p>Wolverine is going to be Insomniac's next big game, but despite the project being announced several years ago, the studio is still keeping a release date under wraps.</p>

<p>Our latest morsel on the game comes gollowing Insomniac co-founder <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvels-spider-man-studio-boss-ted-price-announces-retirement-from-games-industry">Ted Price's retirement announcement yesterday</a>. The Wolverine studio now has three new co-heads - Chad Dezern, Ryan Schneider, and Jen Huang - and the trio sat down to chat with <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/insomniac-games-ceo-ted-price-exits-ryan-schneider-chad-dezern-jen-huang-playstation-1236281913/">Variety</a> about what this means for Insomniac, and naturally the topic of Wolverine came up.</p>
<p>The studio execs would not confirm or deny a 2025 release window when questioned, but did Dezern did say this:</p>
<p>"We've announced Wolverine, and we'd love to talk more about Wolverine, but we have to be like Logan today, and remain very stoic until it's time to pop the claws down the road. As much as we're as much as we have pent up excitement, we got to hold on to it. So that's, that's about as much as we could say about our upcoming projects today."</p>

</figure>
<p>Other than that brief teaser from 2021, any official word on Wolverine has been slimmer than slim.</p>
<p>In 2023, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-investigating-insomniac-hack-which-reportedly-leaked-wolverine-files-and-employees-personal-data">files were stolen from Insomniac Games by ransomware hackers</a>. Following this attack, people began playing - and uploading footage - of an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/people-are-posting-footage-of-marvels-wolverine-from-stolen-early-version">incomplete early development build of Wolverine</a>, which was found within the stolen files.</p>
<p>Then, in October of last year, it was revealed the game's creative director had moved across to Xbox, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstations-wolverine-creative-director-now-leading-xboxs-perfect-dark-reboot">joined the team working on the Perfect Dark reboot</a>, meaning Wolverine would now be led by Marcus Smith. Meanwhile, Mike Daly became Wolverine's game director, while the game's previously announced game director Camerson Christain would remain with Insomniac, but in a different role.</p>
<p>At one point, there were rumours <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/insomniacs-wolverine-could-reportedly-launch-as-early-as-autumn-2024">Wolverine could release in 2024</a>, which clearly did not happen. More recently, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/insomniacs-wolverine-reportedly-due-2025-darker-than-spider-man">there was word of a 2025 release</a>, which of course could still happen, so stay tuned.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Legendary video game composer Grant Kirkhope has said he has "zero hope" of seeing a new Banjo-Kazooie game.
</p>
<p>
Writing on social media last night, Kirkhope went on to <a href="https://x.com/grantkirkhope/status/1882247865357209894">suggest</a> that any new attempt at reviving the dormant platforming franchise was doomed to failure, as "diehard fans would instantly hate it" regardless of "how good it was".
</p>
<p>
Kirkhope is famous for having scored a swathe of classic titles from the heyday of British development powerhouse Rare. He penned the scores of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/goldeneye-007-review">GoldenEye 007</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-64">Donkey Kong 64</a> and Perfect Dark, as well as Banjo-Kazooie, Banjo-Tooie and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/banjo-kazooie-nuts-bolts">Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts &amp; Bolts</a>.

<p>
More recently, Kirkhope's fame has been revived with work on more modern platformers, including the distinctly Banjo-esque <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/yooka-laylee">Yooka-Laylee</a>, as well as Ubisoft's Mario + Rabbids games.
</p>
<p>
"I hope that last tweet didn't come across as mean," Kirkhope <a href="https://x.com/grantkirkhope/status/1882298146971410457">added</a>, several hours later. "The Banjo fanverse is a wonderful thing, the reaction when Banjo got into Smash Bros. is something I'll remember for the rest of my life ❤️"
</p>
<p>
Fans of the classic Banjo-Kazooie games have long called for a new installment from developer Rare, but to date there's been no suggestion that one is in the works. 
</p>
<p>
Rare itself is busy maintaining hit pirate live-service <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sea-of-thieves">Sea of Thieves</a>, and has the long-in-development fantasy game Everwild next on its docket.
</p>
<p>
Still, Banjo-Kazooie's popularity endures. Classic games in the franchise have been re-released over the years, including via Xbox's Rare game compilation Rare Replay, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/banjo-tooie-is-coming-to-nintendo-switch-later-this-month">as well as on Nintendo Switch Online</a>. And, as Kirkhope mentioned, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/banjo-kazooie-joins-super-smash-bros-ultimate-line-up">Microsoft gave the nod for the characters to turn up in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</a>. Could there still be hope for Banjo and Kazooie yet?

            <p>Surgent Studios, the developer behind Afrofuturist metroidvania <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tales-of-kenzera-zau">Tales of Kenzera</a>: Zau, has teamed up with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a> publisher Pocketpair to release its next game.</p>
<p>Set for release in 2025, it will be a horror game but not part of the Tales of Kenzera universe.</p>
<p>Last year's Tales of Kenzera: Zau, published by EA, was the first in the series, with more games planned to continue that world. However, this next game will be a shorter and separate project.</p>

<p>"Both Surgent and Pocketpair are well-versed in taking risks. We noticed a pattern in the entertainment industry, and Pocketpair has given us the opportunity to make a horror game about it. It will be short and weird, and we think players will be interested in what we have to say," said Surgent Studios CEO Abubakar Salim.</p>
<p>"We're still in earnest conversation about further projects set in the Tales of Kenzera universe, but this will be a standalone piece: a mile marker between where we've come from and where we're going."</p>
<p>Pocketpair Publishing is the company's new publishing wing.</p>
<p>"As the games industry continues to grow, more and more games find themselves struggling to get funded or greenlit," said head of Pocketpair Publishing John Buckley. "We think this is a real shame, because there are so many incredible creators and ideas out there that just need a little help to become incredible games.</p><p>"We were instantly fascinated by Abubakar's creative vision for a horror game on a topic he's uniquely qualified to explore. The ultimate goal of Pocketpair Publishing is to find creators with a genuine passion for games and enable them to create fun, new experiences for gamers all over the world."</p>
<p>Last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tales-of-kenzera-developers-next-game-will-be-an-afrofuturist-gothic-horror-rpg-as-the-studio-fights-to-survive">Eurogamer was shown a prototype for a new gothic horror game called Project Uso</a>, where players take the role of a vampiric android bearing the soul of Eshu, the god of chaos.</p>
<p>However, Surgent Studios has confirmed to Eurogamer today's announcement is a separate project, while Project Uso will be the continuation of the Tales of Kenzera world.</p>
<p>As a result, details on this new small project are largely unknown. It's set to release later this year.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>This is the energy I want to see driving games in 2025—developers lifting each other up, creating together, and pushing the industry forward.</p><p>Massive love to the Pocketpair team! It’s an incredible honor to be the first partnership announced with <a href="https://twitter.com/PocketpairPBLSH?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@PocketpairPBLSH</a> We’ve been… <a href="https://t.co/DM8Z7Lp4oK">https://t.co/DM8Z7Lp4oK</a></p></div>— Abubakar Salim (@Abzybabzy) <a href="https://twitter.com/Abzybabzy/status/1882353922582450360?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 23, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

</p></div>
<p>Following Tales of Kenzera: Zau, staff from Surgent Studios faced redundancy as the developer sought funding for its next project.</p>
<p>"There is this idea of constantly being pushed to grow, to be bigger, to do more, to spend more," Salim previously told Eurogamer. "And within an industry that is, rightfully, so artistic in its nature, that isn't necessarily always the answer."</p>
<p>That consideration may point to the decision to work with Pocketpair on this new, smaller game.</p>
<p>Salim has also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/abubakar-salim-addresses-fever-pitch-of-racism-received-after-launch-of-tales-of-kenzera-zau">received a torrent of racist abuse online</a>, in the midst of openness about the development of Tales of Kenzera.</p>
<p>"I'm happy that we've been really open with as much as we can," he said. "Whatever feedback you have, send it through. Racism isn't feedback."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Back in December, a bunch of cool games had the extreme impoliteness to sneak onto digital shelves while we were losing our hair, souls and marbles covering various gaming award shows. One of those games was Escape From Castle Matsumoto - which can be excused, admittedly, because it's a game about ninjas, and we expect ninjas to be sneaky.</p> <!--more-->
<p>It's a free splitscreen pixelart heist oddity in which two ninjas race to be the first to loot a daimyo's castle. While scouring the mansion in your half of the screen, you can lay traps and obstacles for the rival shinobi. If push comes to shove comes to roundhouse kick, you can also fight them directly.</p>
<p>It's kind of nifty. It looks like it's from the 80s. Here's a video.</p>

<p>I had a play just now and can (re)confirm that I suck at being a ninja. In my defence, I Narutoed straight into <a href="https://mausimus.itch.io/efcm">the Itch.io browser edition</a> without even glancing at the control scheme. Impetuosity is not one of the ninja virtues, I gather. There's probably an ancient ninja proverb about always reading the manual. Still, it was calming to watch my bot opponent gracefully case the joint while I loitered menacingly in a hallway, trying to find the smoke bomb button.</p><p>You may fare better. Perhaps you'd like to up the stakes and challenge a friend, even - there's online, LAN and same-computer multiplayer, according to the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2490030/Escape_From_Castle_Matsumoto/">Steam page</a>. The developers are <a href="https://mausimus.net/">mausimus</a> and Chris "Joker" Femo. Good for them, I say. We can always do with more ninja games.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The game, titled <em>Lili</em>, is a “screen life thriller video game” where you’ll have access to a modern-day Lady Macbeth’s personal devices, according to a press release.</p><p>“Players will be immersed in a stylized, neo-noir vision of modern Iran, where surveillance and authoritarianism are part of daily life,” the release says. “The gameplay will feature a blend of live-action cinema within an interactive game format, giving players the chance to immerse themselves in the world of Lady Macbeth and make choices that influence her destiny.” It sounds kind of like a version of <em>Macbeth</em> inspired by Sam Barlow’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/23/20828666/telling-lies-review-steam-iphone-sam-barlow-interactive-thriller-her-story">interactive</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/9/24031558/immortality-is-coming-to-ps5">thrillers</a>.</p><p>The Royal Shakespeare Company is making the game in collaboration with iNK Stories, a New York-based indie studio and publisher that also made <em>1979 Revolution: Black Friday</em>. It stars Zar Amir as “Lady Macbeth (Lili),” per the press release.</p><p><em>Lili</em> is set to release “later in 2025.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The creators of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/all-will-fall">All Will Fall</a> are pariahs, as far as I'm concerned. You should warn your children to avoid them. If you encounter them in the street, you should jerk away with a muttered oath, making a sign to avert evil spirits - for these are the scumbags who've decided to develop a city-building game in which all the buildings and building materials are subject to realworld physics. A city-building game that takes place on small, post-apocalyptic islands, where the only way to expand is upward.</p><p>"Playing Jenga with human lives" is how they summarise it, the wastrels. Here's a trailer.</p><!--more-->

<iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0RnYpIqxnkA?autoplay=1" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0RnYpIqxnkA?autoplay=1">

<p>The premise is that the world is being swallowed by the ocean. You lead a small boatload of wild-eyed survivors, searching for the last few scraps of land to found a civilisation on. Having located a few sparse tiles of solid footing, you must wrestle with a physics-based building system that "challenges you to consider real-world construction aspects when building your intricate multi-level city in all three dimensions".</p><p>Everything you build may collapse, pancaking the civvies inside, unless it's delicately stacked and balanced. Do not construct your city like you're absent-mindedly filling a shopping trolley at Tescos, with soft fruits carefully placed in the bottom and 20 family-sized tins of bratwurst heaped on top. Exercise discretion. "There is a high-risk, high-reward aspect to it," the Steam page adds. "For example, you can find various ways to reach much-needed resource nodes by building elaborate bridges or ladders. Or - save some space for more production by stacking the housing quarters on top of each other."</p>
<p>All this, and you still have to tackle the traditional post-apocalytic mayoral dilemma of whether to be a kindly custodian who causes everybody to perish of malnutrition, or a ruthless tyrant who secures overall survival at the cost of being universally despised. There are three survivor factions, each with different skills - Engineers can operate cranes, Sailors can sail boats, and Workers handle anything that isn't a boat or a crane, I guess. Factions have wants and needs: you likely won't be able to satisfy them all, so it's a good thing you can impose martial law to shut up the moaners.</p>
<p>I'm not clear on how complex All Will Fall <em>really</em> is when you discount the risk of towns accidentally flattening themselves, but the social and story elements sound quite labyrinthine. "Each colony you build will deal with unique challenges, foundation layouts, circumstances and random events - like storms, mysterious structures emerging from the ocean, political coups, unexpected newcomers, food shortages, and more," the developers hint. "Learn from your mistakes, unlock new locations on the global map, and embark on the next dangerous adventure once the inevitable calamity comes to destroy the city."</p>
<p>All mock-outrage aside, this sounds brilliant. I'm absurdly bad at Jenga and look forward to making a very short-lived Tower of Babel out of driftwood. All Will Fall is out this year, and you can sign up to a public playtest on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2706020/ALL_WILL_FALL_PhysicsBased_Survival_City_Builder/">Steam</a>.</p>

            <p>Celeste and Towerfall creators Extremely OK Games have announced the cancellation of their pixelart exploration platformer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/earthblade">Earthblade</a>, in what studio director Maddy Thorson calls a "huge, heartbreaking, and yet relieving failure". The decision to call it quits follows a bust-up within the development team, though this isn't, apparently, why they pulled the plug. Thorson and programmer Noel Berry have found making something "bigger and better" than Celeste exhausting, and have decided to work on smaller projects in future.</p><!--more-->
<p>Extremely OK <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/celeste-developers-next-game-is-called-earthblade">announced Earthblade back in 2021</a> with Celeste composer Lena Raine handling the soundtrack. A proper reveal <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/celeste-devs-announce-gorgeous-new-platformer-earthblade">followed in 2022</a> with a smidgeon of plot information: the game would have seen you playing a "child of Fate", exploring a ruined planet. In March last year, Thorson <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/celeste-creators-next-game-earthblade-wont-be-out-this-year-but-studio-assure-development-is-not-stagnant">blogged about development difficulties</a> but assured readers that the team were making progress. That brings us to today. It sounds like last year has been more complicated than she originally divulged.</p>
<p>Posting on Extremely OK's <a href="https://exok.com/posts/2025-01-22-earthblade-final-update/">website</a>, Thorson writes that a "fracture" formed last year between herself and Berry and co-founder Pedro Medeiros, who was Earthblade's art director and pixel/UI artist for Celeste and Towerfall.</p>
<p>"The conflict centered around a disagreement about the IP rights of Celeste, which we won't be detailing publicly - this was obviously a very difficult and heartbreaking process," she explains. "We eventually reached a resolution, but both parties also agreed in the end that we should go our separate ways. Pedro is now working on his game <a href="https://saint11.art/games/neverway/">Neverway</a>, which you should check out - we've played it and it's very promising."</p><p>Pedro's departure prompted Berry and Thorson to think hard about the status of Earthblade as a whole. "The project had a lot going for it but, frustratingly, it was also not as far along as one would expect after such a protracted development process," Thorson continues. "I do believe that if we soldiered on despite it all, that Earthblade could still be a great game.</p>
<p>"But would it be worth the pain? Noel and I also began to reflect on how the game has felt for us to work on day-to-day, and realized that it has been a struggle for a long time. Sure, working on one project for so long is bound to become a slog, but this feels like a deeper problem. Celeste's success applied pressure on us to deliver something bigger and better with Earthblade, and that pressure is a large part of why working on it has become so exhausting."</p>
<p>Thorson is careful to spell out that Medeiros is not to blame for all this - his leaving simply created "the clarity to see that we have lost our way". She adds that "if you were excited about Earthblade and angry about its cancelling, Pedro and the Neverway team aren't the enemy and anyone who treats them as such isn't welcome in any EXOK community."</p>
<p>As part of the cancellation, Thorson and Berry have parted ways with the other members of the Earthblade team - that's <a href="https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@amora">Amora</a>, <a href="http://kylepulver.com/">Kyle Pulver</a>, <a href="http://ikenfell.com/">Chevy Ray</a>, <a href="https://lena.fyi/">Raine</a> and sound design company <a href="https://powerupaudio.com/">Power-Up Audio</a> - though they hope to collaborate with them again.</p><p>"Noel &amp; I now want to take all of the (many!) lessons we've learned from Earthblade, wipe the slate clean, and refocus ourselves back to smaller-scale projects," Thorson goes on. "We're prototyping again and exploring at our own pace, and trying to rediscover game development in a manner closer to how we approached it at Celeste's or TowerFall's inception." </p>
<p>She concludes that "scaling the core team up post-Celeste has ultimately been a failure, and that's okay. We gave it all we've got, and life goes on. We are happy to return to our roots and reclaim some joy in our creative process, and see where that takes us."</p>
<p>I confess, I still haven't found time to play the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/celeste-review">magnificent-sounding</a> Celeste, but the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wot-i-think-towerfall-ascension">same-screen archery frenzy</a> of Towerfall was an office lunchbreak favourite when I worked at Future London. We'd gather round a monitor and mostly fall victim to our own arrows while hooting like baby elephants. Clearly the people who made that game are geniuses. I wish Extremely OK and the departing Earthblade team members better luck with their future creations.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/how-much-do-you-think-it-would-cost-to-hire-agent-47.1089522/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/agent-47-hitman-assassin-cost-hire<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Hitman</em>'s Agent 47 is the world's premier assassin, a man able to blend in with his surroundings at will, to get within arm's reach of the most secure and often most <em>dangerous </em>people on the planet. For much of his career he's been a man on a mission, but I have recently been wondering how much it would cost to hire him for a single job.</p><p>Me being able to entertain this possibility is canon! At the end of <em>Hitman 3</em> he and Diana essentially go off grid, leaving Providence behind to continue their work together as <a href="https://aftermath.site/hitman-freelancer-the-best-kind-of-hitman-is-more-hitman" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">freelancers</a>.<a href="https://aftermath.site/freelance-video-game-journalism-rates" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Which I'm assuming doesn't pay as well as a staff job</a>, but if the gig economy has come for <em>us</em>, then it has come for Agent 47 as well.</p><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-business-lessons-learned-tips" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Like us</a>–and this is one of the only times I can make such a comparison, at least until I get balder–Agent 47 now has to worry about doing his own taxes, quoting for jobs and just generally living the small business hustle. His work pays (presumably) a lot more than ours does, so I’m sure he’ll be fine, but still, the leap from Providence employee to small business owner will be a challenge for him.</p><p>Which also means Agent 47's loss could be our gain. Prior to the events of <em>Hitman 3</em> he only worked in the shadows, the most lethal puppet on a string on the planet, a plaything of the powerful in their struggles against the...also powerful, but slightly more evil. If anyone else<em> </em>needed work done back then we'd have had to hire an assassin out of the phonebook, or Facebook Marketplace, or the dark web, or know a guy who knew a guy, all of which were just as likely to see us end up in prison as the target whacked.</p><p>These days though, Agent 47 is just out there for hire! He could, and presumably <em>would </em>(after repeated quicksaves and reloads, anyway) be able to do any job on the planet provided the pay was right.</p><p>Which leads me to wonder: <em>hypothetically speaking</em>, how much would a contract cost? Would Agent 47 charge per kill? Would he charge according to the complexity of the job? Would he scout out the target and present them with a series of quotes, escalating in cost owing to factors like difficulty and comedic value? Would the prospective clients get a certain number of "body in a storage closet" dumps for free, and exceeding that value would result in a surcharge per body?</p><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HiTMAN/comments/19bp6yz/how_much_do_you_think_it_costs_to_hire_47/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I’ve seen people ask this before</a>, pointing to contract values from previous games and coming up with ballpark figures. <em>Silent Assassin</em>, released in 2002, has Agent 47 saying his standard rate is $100,000, while 2006’s <em>Blood Money</em> paid between $100,000 and $600,000 per job. That’s a while ago though, and Providence probably took a substantial cut of that, so it doesn’t really help with what his rates would be in 2025, particularly given the inflationary and cost-of-living crisis we’re all currently living through.&nbsp;</p><p>And while<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/uruno4/how_expensive_is_a_hitman/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> there are publicly available rates for actual hitmen</a>, I suspect that many of those are based on hitmen who were caught, and who also appear to be at the entry level of this particular market. The mafia hiring a guy to whack another guy outside a deli would not cost the same as a single career professional infiltrating an 18th century mansion, sneaking past 72 guards, hacking a security network and executing a renegade tech mogul.&nbsp;</p><p>So yeah, I have no idea how much it would cost to hire Agent 47! I just wonder sometimes, that's all.

<p>The Shopify Rebellion Game Changers roster, the reigning two-time champions, have made history. The women became the first GC team to qualify for a VALORANT Challengers event, after years of attempts.</p>



<p>The roster core that has dominated the women’s VALORANT scene has finally overcome their greatest obstacle on the path to their ultimate goal: the international VCT leagues.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-shopify-rebellion-makes-history">Shopify Rebellion Makes History</h2>



<p>While the Shopify Rebellion Game Changers team has dominated the GC circuit, they had always fallen short of advancing past qualifiers into Challengers. For VALORANT teams, the Challengers leagues are the path to the Ascension event, a regional tournament that determines who is promoted to the international VCT leagues.</p>



<p>After <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/shopify-rebellion-game-changers-vct-win/">winning their second Game Changers Championship in December</a>, Shopify were dealt a huge blow when their star Ava “florescent” Eugene signed with VCT EMEA team Apeks. In doing so, flor became the first Game Changers player to compete in VCT, but it left a big hole in the roster for Shopify to fill.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just prior to the North American Challengers closed qualifier, Shopify found their replacement in Karnthida “dodonut” Chaisrakeo. In the closed qualifier, Shopify overcame dodonut’s former team, FlyQuest RED, before beating Funhaver to secure the third and final qualifier spot in NA Challengers.</p>







<p>For the Shopify Rebellion organization, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/shopify-rebellion-merges-with-ludwig-and-cr1tikals-esports-organization/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fresh off their merger with content creator stars Cr1TiKaL and Ludwig’s Moist Esports</a>, they will field two roster in NA Challengers, as their men’s roster returns after competing in the league last year. Organizations are permitted by Riot to field two teams in the same ecosystem, provided one of them is eligible to compete in Game Changers. The Shopify GC roster is the two-time champion of Game Changers, so they should be permitted to compete when the NA Challengers League stage one begins later this month.</p>

        <p>Our <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,007 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a> takes place in the distant continent of Noahtun, a region rich in land and sea with various seasons.

Find out for yourself by traveling to every corner of the land.</p><p><strong>Puzzles</strong></p><p>Restoration Puzzles are a mission exclusive to the Restorer.

Extremely OK Games - the studio behind beloved 2018 platformer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/celeste">Celeste</a> - has announced the cancellation of its "2D explor-action" project Earthblade, calling the news a "huge, heartbreaking, and yet relieving failure".
</p>
<p>
Extremely OK <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/celeste-dev-announces-new-game-earthblade-with-vibe-revealing-teaser-art-and-music">unveiled Earthblade back in 2021</a>, sharing some mood-setting teaser art and a musical snippet. A full reveal <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/celeste-devs-show-first-look-at-earthblade">arrived a year and a half later</a>, offering an early glimpse of a side-scrolling platformer - blending elements of combat and exploration - that would see an "enigmatic child of Fate returning at long last to Earth".
</p>
<p>
At the time, the project was expected to arrive in 2024, but Extremely OK <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/celeste-developers-next-game-wont-be-out-this-year">confirmed a delay last March</a>. And while it didn't commit to a new release window, it moved to assure fans progress was not "stagnant" and that the team was "still excited to work on it".

Today, however, the studio has announced Earthblade is no more. In a <a href="https://exok.com/posts/2025-01-22-earthblade-final-update/">lengthy post shared on the Extremely OK website</a>, studio director Maddy Thorson went into some of the factors leading to the project's cancellation. These include a "disagreement about the IP rights of Celeste" which, as painted in today's announcement, saw Thorson and Noel Berry on one side and studio "founding member" Pedro Medeiros on the other.
</p><p>
Thorson says the issue was eventually resolved following a "very difficult and heartbreaking process", but noted the outcome resulted in Medeiros' departure from the Earthblade project after "both parties... agreed in the end that we should go our separate way".
</p>
<p>
This, in turn, prompted the remaining members of Extremely OK to "take a serious look at whether fighting through to finish Earthblade was the right path forward". And while the project "had a lot going for it", according to Thorson, "it was also not as far along as one would expect after such a protracted development process."
</p>
<p>
"Noel and I also began to reflect on how the game has felt for us to work on day-to-day," Thorson continued, "and realised that it has been a struggle for a long time. Sure, working on one project for so long is bound to become a slog, but this feels like a deeper problem. Celeste's success applied pressure on us to deliver something bigger and better with Earthblade, and that pressure is a large part of why working on it has become so exhausting."
</p>
<p>
"Pedro isn't to blame for this," Thorson stressed. "In fact the split with him has given us the clarity to see that we have lost our way, and the opportunity to admit defeat. I feel many ways about it, but one big feeling is undoubtedly relief."
</p><p>
With Earthblade officially no more, other members of the team have also "moved on". However, Thorson and Berry now plan to "take all of the (many!) lessons we've learned... wipe the slate clean, and refocus ourselves back to smaller-scale projects." As a result, the duo are "prototyping again and exploring at our own pace, and trying to rediscover game development in a manner closer to how we approached it at Celeste's or <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/towerfall">TowerFall</a>'s inception."
</p>
<p>
"We are happy to return to our roots," Thorson concluded, "and reclaim some joy in our creative process, and see where that takes us."

In the post, EXOK Director of R&amp;D Maddy Thorson detailed the reasoning behind the decision, and what's next for the studio.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Lat last month, Noel [Berry, EXOK Computer Programmer] made the difficult decision to cancel Earthblade...

Thorson declined to detail the dispute other than to say that there was a resolution reached and Medeiros parted ways with the team and is now developing a separate game titled Neverway.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, this dispute gave Thorson and Berry a chance to examine where they were at with Earthblade and discovered that the project was not coming along the way they had hoped.
