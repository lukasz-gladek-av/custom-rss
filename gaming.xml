<p>Back in August, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/gallery-nintendo-shows-off-its-new-my-mario-product-line">Nintendo announced</a> a line of child-friendly products under the 'My Mario' banner, including a free <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hello_mario">Hello, Mario!</a> app for Switch and mobile, cute sets of wooden block amiibo, and assorted merch aimed at babies and toddlers.</p>
<p>It was only a matter of time before it all found its way out of Japan and the company has now confirmed that the line will be launching in the US from <strong>19th February</strong>.</p>
<p>Designed "to offer fun ways for young children and their parents to explore, imagine and play side-by-side," according to the official blurb, the collection will be coming to the Nintendo New York and San Francisco stores in February and appearing at "select retail stores" in the spring. There's no word on a UK or European release just yet, but we'll update this article when we get confirmation on this side of the pond.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067qvhgkm&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>In Japan, a bunch of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/gallery-nintendo-updates-its-my-mario-product-line-with-multiple-new-yoshi-items-heres-a-look">Yoshi-themed products</a> launched alongside a similar <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hello_yoshi">Hello, Yoshi!</a> app in November, and with the line "continu[ing] to expand throughout the year", you can expect that to arrive at some point, too.</p>

            <p>Microlandia deserves a much longer article, preferably written by our resident virtual metropolis judger Sin Vega. For the moment, I will only say that it’s a work-in-progress city-builder fuelled by a poetical mixture of admiration and terror for cities. </p><!--more-->
<p>This is the impression given by the developer’s changelogs, anyway. Here, for example, is <a href="https://explodi.itch.io/microlandia/devlog/1309434/microlandia-14-the-money-edition">how they describe</a> Microlandia update 1.4 on Itch.io, which makes adjustments to the game’s economy, company management and public transport simulation: “A city is a beautiful, but insane machine that survives always in homeostasis and always in chaos. In 1.4 you get a little less narrative, a little more reality, the structures of everyday life exposed, greed companies, economy that doesn't forgive, even the broke. The night mode is a pleasant anesthesia; use it, but do not confuse ambience with robustness.”</p>
<p>I will try not to, Information Superhighway Games. I will try not to confuse ambience with robustness.</p>

<p>Microlandia hit 1.0 release over December, so yes, we are playing Jenny Catch-Up here. In general, it looks to deliver a “brutally honest” rendition of city life and management. It executes the chemistry and causality of the urban human experience with chilly exactitude. Citizens are capable of falling not just into, but out of love. Imagine that. Imagine making it possible for your pops to undergo heartbreak. They also risk being fired if they show up late for work, perhaps because you've screwed up the bus timetables, and if they can’t find a job, they’ll turn to crime. </p><p>The mechanics go beyond pegging out residences, workplaces and leisure facilities while staying in budget. This is a mean town indeed. Landlords are greedy and will raise the rent when accommodation is scarce. Rich folk will embrace their opportunities without qualm: as an older Itch.io update <a href="https://explodi.itch.io/microlandia/devlog/1131465/microlandia-10-the-city-shaken-awake">explains</a>, “high-net-worth citizens will rent only low-density housing, and along with the upper class get NIMBY vibes and avoid buildings with disapproval aura.”</p>
<p>You’ll have to worry about pandemics, heatwaves, and compensating people for rezoning. There’s a local newspaper that tracks your decisions and does not spare the lash; if you reap some bad headlines, your budget may be reduced.</p>
<p>As developer explodi <a href="https://explodi.itch.io/microlandia/devlog/1029279/welcome-to-microlandia-the-brutally-honest-city-builder">explains in last year’s announcement post</a>, Microlandia is both a homage to and a critique of the classic <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/simcity">SimCity</a>. “I always wondered what will happen in simcity if citizens live or die because of the many real reasons that determine the length of our lives here on earth,” they write. “Life expectancy, accidents, bad health system, or the lack of access to it. This statistics exist [sic], and we can use the power of new technology [to] create more realistic simulations.” </p>
<p>The game’s mechanics draw on study of research shared by the World Bank, US Bureau of Labor Statistics, the US Environmental Protection Agency, National Equity Atlas and the Center for Urban Future, among others. They’re keeping track of all these sources in a colossal <a href="https://microlandia.city/simulation_parameters">live document</a>, auto-generated from the game’s code. If you’re proper nerdy about this stuff, I imagine you will have Opinions on the facts and figures therein. Do tell. You can also find Microlandia on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4094120/Microlandia/">Steam</a>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/jackass-5-is-happening-later-this-year-2000658174</link>
            <guid>1400698</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>There is still some good left in this world. We’re getting a new, still officially untitled, <a href="https://kotaku.com/goat-trailer-fart-joke-jackass-sony-zootopia-funny-teaser-2000656133"><em>Jackass</em></a>, and we don’t have to wait a decade like last time. The new comedy is set to arrive in June.</p> <p>On January 8, <em>Jackass</em> ringleader Johnny Knoxville <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DTPFikrEXfX/?img_index=1">posted the iconic skull and crutches logo</a> for the franchise on Instagram, with the date June 26 below it. In the text for the post, he confirmed that, yes, a new <em>Jackass</em> movie is a go. Expect lots of wild stunts, gross moments, and of course, some injuries.</p>   <p>“Well, a wang dang and hot damn doodle, we are starting the year off with a bang,” said Knoxville on Instagram. “We wanted to let you know that this summer, Jackass is back!! We will see you in theatres June 26th. More to come, but wanted you to hear it from us first!”</p> <p>That’s all the official information we have at the moment. We don’t know who is returning or which guest stars will be making an appearance in the upcoming comedy flick. In the last movie, 2022’s<em> Jackass Forever</em>, most of the original <em>Jackass</em> crew from the 2000s era TV show on MTV returned, with the notable exceptions of Bam Margera and Ryan Dunn. Margera has struggled with substance abuse issues for years, and while sober now, has had a rocky relationship with the <em>Jackass</em> crew and is likely not returning in the next film. Dunn sadly died in 2011. His last <em>Jackass</em> movie was 2010’s <em>Jackass 3. </em>For <em>Jackass Forever, </em>the crew also added some younger talent to help out. No word if they will be returning this time around.</p>

 <p>The <em>Jackass</em> franchise is a big success for Paramount, with the four main films, and the <em>Bad Grandpa</em> spin-off, bringing in over $560 million worldwide at the box office on relatively tiny budgets. <a href="https://kotaku.com/jackass-forever-the-game-ps2-review-psp-mtv-knoxville-1848487592">There was even a <em>Jackass</em> video game released in 2007. It was bad. Don’t play it.&nbsp;</a></p> <p><iframe title="jackass forever | Final Trailer (2022 Movie)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/p74bzf-beGc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ugreens-usb-c-hub-drops-below-10-this-5-in-1-adapter-is-selling-out-fast-on-amazon-2000657275</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Do you find yourself routinely trying to improve your computer setup, but you have too many cables to make it feasible? You might want to think about getting a multiport. They’re affordable, and thanks to the deal we’ve located, you can get one even cheaper than usual. Plus, you can set up your workstation using just a single USB-C port.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6707/">Get the UGREEN USB C Hub 5 in 1 Multiport at Amazon for only $9.99 (from $15.99), which is a $6 discount and approximately 38% in savings</a>. For this price, you can buy a few and change up all your computer stations just for the sake of keeping things consistent.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6707/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>An affordable way to improve your compact PC setup</h2>
<p>Here’s how it works. This multi-port adapter instantly adds additional ports to your existing device’s USB-C port when plugged in. When connected via USB-C you can add peripherals like a keyboard, a mouse, a flash drive or external hard drive to your central device, all without needing to swap cables every few minutes. It can essential help turn thin laptops and tablets into more powerful desktop setups when needed. For example, it’s useful whether you’re moving between a home office, a classroom or coffee shop.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can connect your device to a monitor, television or projector for a better viewing experience on a larger screen. This is beneficial for watching movies on a larger screen, displaying slides in a professional environment or extending your display to keep multiple windows open simultaneously.</p>



<p>As compact as they are, most hubs are designed to direct cable flow away from your hands to maintain a clean and organized workspace. The small and lightweight design of the UGREEN USB C Hub 5 in 1 Multiport makes it easy to fit into a laptop case or backpack pocket and allows you to take it wherever you go without giving it a second thought. Most importantly, this is the type of accessory you’ll likely forget about until you truly need a USB port or an external display, and then you’ll be happy it is available.</p>
<p>We’ve lined out the reasons why, so it’s probably obvious by now, but this USB-C hub can make for a super useful gift or addition to anyone’s PC setup. It’s a practical and affordable upgrade that gives you plenty of space to work with when it comes to compact setups. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6707/">And perhaps most importantly, it’s just $9.99</a>. That’s super affordable, and well worth picking up whether you shop for yourself or others as a gift.

<p>A new report reveals that the Nintendo Switch 2 failed to match the original console’s sales during the first holiday period. </p>



<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 has been going strong in sales since its release, helping boost hardware sales across multiple months. The new console also reached a sales milestone of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-10-million-sales-units/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">10 million units</a> in November 2025; however, it seems things have been declining since then. </p>



<h2 id="h-switch-2-sales-fall-over-first-holiday-period">Switch 2 Sales Fall Over First Holiday Period</h2>



<p>A report by <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/nintendo-switch-2-sales-stumble-over" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Business</a> reveals that Switch 2 sales have slowed during the holiday period, with the change more evident in Western markets. The Switch 2 fell short by 35% in the United States when compared to the original Switch in the same period in 2017. The situation is somewhat similar in Europe, with sales of the new console 16% lower than those of the previous one in the same period in the UK. However, overall Switch 2 sales in the UK were 6% higher than Switch 1’s. </p>



<p>A senior Nintendo employee revealed that a “complicated economic landscape” and “the absence of a major Western game” make it tough to compare the Switch to the original Switch; however, the team is happy with the overall performance. Moreover, sales were down in Japan during the holiday period as well, with the Switch 1 selling 1.39 million units during its first holiday period and the Switch 2 selling 1.32 million. When taking the whole year into account in Japan, Switch 2 sales were up 11% compared to the original console. </p>

            <guid>1400674</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>From the rush to find Merry and Pippin to Frodo and Sam’s trek through the Dead Marshes through the clash of forces at Helm’s Deep, <em>The Two Towers</em> goes pretty non-stop in <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>. Which is why I was <em>so</em> excited for this chapter of the story to get its “Trick Taking Game” treatment. But is it a worthy successor to the incredible <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/fellowship-of-ring-trick-taking-game-review-tricksy" rel="nofollow"><em>Fellowship of the Ring: Trick Taking Game</em></a>? Asmodee USA sent me a copy to find out, so follow my trail as I review the newly-released <em>The Two Towers: Trick Taking Game</em>.</p><p><em>The Two Towers: Trick Taking Game</em> is a sort of sequel to last year’s hit <em>Fellowship of the Ring: Trick Taking Game</em>, continuing on the story of the novel at Boromir’s fall. You do not need to own or have played the original game to play <em>The Two Towers: Trick Taking Game</em>, though having played the original will make this one a quick and easy teach.</p><p>A Trick Taking game enters on a series of hands, called tricks, with a player winning (or taking) the trick. The rules differ from game to game (and some famous games include Hearts, Spades, and Pinochle), but usually one player will lead the trick by playing a card, and other players have to follow that same card’s suit if possible. In <em>The Two Towers: Trick Taking Game</em>, players play cards value one to eight, in suits like Hills, Forest, Mountains, and Shadows.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2><strong>How Do You Play </strong><em><strong>The Two Towers: Trick Taking Game</strong></em><strong>?</strong></h2><p>In essence, this is a cooperative Trick Taking game ala <em>The Crew</em>, where you and your teammates will take on roles of different heroes and villains from <em>LOTR</em> in a series of chapters. Each chapter represents a moment from the story, and each offers its own unique difficulties and complexities.</p><p>In each chapter, you’ll need to fulfill the goals of your hero. If any hero doesn’t successfully fulfill their goal by the end of the hand, you lose the chapter and need to try again. Goals range from needing to win a set amount of tricks, needing to win the lowest amount of tricks (thanks a lot, Pippin), and other fun surprises I won’t spoil here.</p><picture>

              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-two-towers-trick-taking-game-cards.jpeg?itok=uh82yJRA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="900">
                  

  </picture><p>In the first chapter, you’ll play as Boromir, Aragorn, and your choice between Gimli and Legolas. As you progress through the chapters, you’ll open up more twists, turns, and new characters that come and go from the game. You <em>can</em> play these chapters in any order, but the rulebook suggests you play them in order, as do I!</p><h2><strong>How Is </strong><em><strong>The Two Towers: Trick Taking Game</strong></em><strong> different from </strong><em><strong>The Fellowship of the Ring: Trick Taking Game</strong></em><strong>?</strong></h2><p>The chief difference, along with an entirely new batch of chapters to work through, is the inclusion of new cards - namely The White Tower, Black Tower, and Orc cards.</p><p>Gone (at least in the beginning of the game) are the Ring suit, as the story focuses on the action happening away from Frodo and Sam (and their precious). Instead are the White and Black tower cards, which automatically win a trick if only <em>one</em> of the two towers is played.</p><p>The Orc cards are another nasty addition, they don’t have a value, and if you ever have to lead a trick with an Orc card… you lose the entire chapter! This created many a nasty, desperate moment in my play testing, where the optimal play had to be interrupted to make sure I wasn’t stuck with an Orc as my last card in hand.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2><strong>How Does It Feel To Play </strong><em><strong>The Two Towers: Trick Taking Game</strong></em><strong>?</strong></h2><p><em>The Two Towers: Trick Taking Game</em> feels very similar to playing the original game… which is a great accomplishment! As I wrote in my original review, “This is, by far, one of the best experiences I've had playing a trick-taking game.” Well… guess what? The same can be said for <em>The Two Towers: Trick Taking Game</em>.</p><p>The difficulty in this game ramps up right from the jump, assuming that many players would have already played through at least some of the original <em>Fellowship</em> game. Because of this, every single chapter, from first to last, is a satisfying head-scratcher, where you’ll balance hitting your goal with making sure every other player on the field is hitting theirs, as well.</p><p>The pressure of working through a trick is, as in the first game, augmented by the fact that each chapter can be played in about ten minutes, so failing a chapter is no biggie. Maybe you’ll want to switch up your heroes, or try to come to the challenge from a new angle.&nbsp;</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-two-towers-trick-taking-box.jpeg?itok=nTYW6rZ_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="800" height="800">

  </picture><p>Maybe you’ll get a bit lucky the next time you try a chapter, or maybe your luck will be even worse! That’s the beauty of the game, with a simple set of guidelines to work around, each chapter is a Hobbit-sized meal of clever design.</p><h2><em>The Two Towers: Trick Taking Game </em>- Final Thoughts</h2><p><em>The Two Towers: Trick Taking Game</em> does exactly what I hoped it would as a sort of sequel. It expands upon the groundwork laid by the original game without requiring players to have completed that game, and it tweaks without completely overhauling the design of the original game.</p><p>The inclusion of the Orc cards add a fun new wrinkle to the game flow, and new heroes that come across your path will completely switch up how you approach the game. This is high-quality, thoughtful game design from top to bottom.</p><p>Whether you’re a fan of Tolkien’s world, or just love a good Trick Taking game, I cannot recommend <em>The Two Towers: Trick Taking Game</em> highly enough!

<p>Products <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/my-mario/products/" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">shown off</a> on the My Mario website include the likes of toy playsets, <em>Mario</em>-themed pop-up books, and clothing, as well as other items themed around Mario and his friends.</p><p>You can also watch a new series of <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/my-mario/videos/" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">stop-motion animation shorts</a> that feature some adorable and simplistic stories revolving around Mario, Yoshi, and other familiar elements from the franchise.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>It’s harder than ever for a new video game to crack the top of the most-played list. According to the Circana Player Engagement Tracker and video game market analyst Mat Piscatella, in 2025, the top five most-played games on PS5 and Xbox… <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3mbraw2dcfc2s">were the same in 2024</a>. And they likely won’t be changing anytime soon.</p><p>Any gaming enthusiast could probably easily name the top five: <em>Fortnite, Roblox, Call of Duty, Minecraft, and Grand Theft Auto V</em>. These aren’t just the most-played games of ’24 and ’25, but have hovered at or around the top of the most-played list for several years now. Though they vary wildly in genre and gameplay, they have a handful of shared characteristics that inform some of their success. All of them are established games, around for eight years or more. They all are multiplatform and have multiplayer capabilities, numerous gameplay modes, and are constantly updated with new content. With the exception of<em> Call of Duty</em>, all the games extensively feature user-generated content while <em>Fortnite </em>and<em> Roblox </em>are free to play.</p><p>Eager to replicate the financial success of the top five and using those shared characteristics as a guideline, studios and publishers have spent years trying to build their own live-service hits. <em>Overwatch</em>, <em>Apex Legends</em>, <em>Valorant,</em> and the <em>Destiny 2</em> expansions enjoyed decent success, inspiring even more studios to make yet more live-service games. Square Enix, a developer not known for premium multiplayer experiences (<a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/the-critically-acclaimed-mmorpg">with one well-memed exception</a>), released <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/24/23736525/this-sure-looks-like-splatoon"><em>Foamstars</em></a>. Rocksteady and BioWare, studios celebrated for their single-player narrative games, announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22826586/suicide-squad-video-game-gameplay-trailer-the-game-awards"><em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/5/17536926/bioware-anthem-gameplay-trailer-ps4-xbox-pc"><em>Anthem</em></a>. In 2022, Sony announced that it was working to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/2/22914016/sony-playstation-live-service-games-launch-march-2026">launch 10 live-service games before March 2026</a>. But a year later, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/9/23953640/sony-pushes-back-its-live-service-game-ambitions">Sony scaled back those plans</a> — nearly every studio did.</p><div><p>Numerous games launched then failed for lack of quality or players. Square Enix announced that it would <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/foamstars-final-seasonal-update-party-goes-on-confirms-the-party-is-very-much-over">cease updates for <em>Foamstars</em></a> less than a year post-launch<em>. </em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/9/24317407/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-final-season-offline-mode"><em>Kill the Justice League</em> also didn’t make it to a year</a> when Rocksteady released its final content update. <em>Anthem</em> will be a few weeks shy of its seventh anniversary <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/698360/the-end-of-an-anthem">when it shuts down on January 12th</a>, and after spending eight years in development, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/3/24234909/sony-concord-ps5-shutdown-poor-sales-launch-pc"><em>Concord</em> was taken down in weeks</a>. Developers learned too late that the characteristics that make the power five so successful are stopping other games from reaching the top.</p></div><p>The newest game of the bunch, <em>Fortnite</em>, has been around since 2017. It’s hard to ask a player that’s racked up eight years worth of Victory Royales, currency, battle pass progression, and skins to start over somewhere new. People also want to play games with their friends. If everyone you know is playing <em>Call of Duty</em>, guess what you’re gonna play? Meanwhile, as prices increase both <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/782532/game-console-price-hikes-xbox-ps5-switch">in gaming</a> and globally, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/video-game-physical-software-and-hardware-sales-just-had-the-worst-november-in-the-us-since-1995">players are buying fewer new titles or consoles</a>. Why spend money on a premium title like <em>Concord </em>and the fancy, expensive PS5 needed to play it, when <em>Fortnite </em>and<em> Roblox </em>are free and work on hardware you already have. It’s similar on PC. While the top of the Steam charts fluctuate more often than PlayStation or Xbox, new live-service games there are always competing against the usual PC suspects — <em>PUBG</em>, <em>Counter-Strike 2</em>, and <em>Dota 2</em>.</p><p>But for all the carnage of games released to little fanfare or killed before they could even launch, it’s not impossible for new live-service games to find success — just not at the same scale as a <em>Fortnite</em> or <em>GTA</em>. Games like <em>Helldivers 2, Marvel Rivals,</em> and (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-review">for better</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/827650/indie-developers-gen-ai-nexon-arc-raiders">or worse</a><em>) Arc Raiders </em>have been able to punch through the seeming inexhaustible noise of the top five, topping player-count charts not only on Xbox and PS5 but PC as well. Gaming in 2025 was also defined by games like <em>Ghost of Yotei, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, Hades II,</em> and <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>, possibly signaling that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24325371/2024s-best-games-classic-genres-astro-bot-balatro-metaphor">developing single-player narrative experiences might be a safer bet</a>. These five games aren’t going anywhere and will likely top the charts again, but in 2026, they’ll definitely have to make room for at least one new addition: <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em> — that is if it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/660057/grand-theft-auto-6-release-date-delay-may-2026">isn’t</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/816005/grand-theft-auto-vi-gta-g-delayed-november-2026">delayed</a>.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTAy"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Ash Parrish</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/858127/top-five-most-played-games-xbox-ps5-2025]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Grabbing a new laptop does not have to blow your budget if you know where to look. If your current machine isn’t offering the performance it once did, or your needs have grown, and you want something with a bit more muscle, Amazon is making the upgrade easy.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6705/">The retailer is currently offering a massive 65% discount on the 16-inch HP EliteBook 6 G1, which brings its price down to $900 from $2,600.</a> You’re saving a whopping $1,700 on a device that’s made to handle both work and entertainment well, but the deal wraps up soon. Snag the drop before that happens!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6705/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Efficient Performance for All Your Tasks</h2>
<p>The HP EliteBook 6 G1a is the successor to the top-rated EliteBook 665. This machine runs on the fast and efficient AMD Ryzen 5&nbsp;220 processor with a 3.2GHz base clock, boost speeds up to 4.9GHz, six cores, and 16MB of L3 cache. It’s made to handle everyday workloads, plus some resource-intensive tasks with ease. The processor is paired with a modest 16GB DDR5 SDRAM memory, which makes it easy to juggle multiple tasks at once without experiencing noticeable slowdowns. You will be able to use multiple tabs, work on a few different programs, take quick work calls, and more – with ease. Storage-wise, you’re covered with a spacious 512GB SSD, which offers enough space to keep all your important documents, media files, applications, and even games in a single place.</p>
<p>The display here is a stunning 16-inch diagonal WUXGA (1920×1200) UWVA IPS screen that delivers impressive visuals consistently. Expect vivid details, vibrant colors, and a sharp picture clarity, whether you’re working on a creative project or just catching up with friends on a video call. Speaking of video calls, the built-in 5MP camera paired with Poly Studio tuned speakers with AI Noise Reduction makes those a breeze. You will look your best, plus be heard properly as well. What’s more, 400 nits of brightness, paired with the anti-glare coating, ensure visibility in all lighting conditions, whether you’re streaming a movie at night or working on a school assignment while soaking up some sun. Additionally, low blue light emission makes it easy to use the screen for extended periods without compromising your eye health.</p>



<p>Port selection is wide. We’re talking one HDMI port, one stereo headphone/microphone combo jack, one RJ-45, 1 security lock slot, two USB Type-A 5Gbps signaling rate (powered), two Thunderbolt 4 with USB Type-C 40Gbps signaling rate (USB Power Delivery 3.0, DisplayPort 2.1, HP Sleep and Charge). Wireless connectivity options include Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3.</p>
<p>Battery life is just as solid, and recharging doesn’t take forever, either. Those who often need to work on long documents will also appreciate the spill-resistant, backlit HP Standard Keyboard with numeric keypad that’s designed keeping comfort in mind. There’s also a fingerprint reader on the keyboard for secure logins.</p>
<p>Windows 11 Pro comes pre-installed, so there’s no need to worry about installing an operating system from scratch to get started, either. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6705/">You can now grab this efficient mid-range laptop for just $900, after a whopping 65% discount at Amazon</a>. It comes packed with a wide range of features that make it perfect for students, work professionals, and even casual users. Just be sure to grab yours before the price shoots back up to $2,600.</p>

<p>Netflix’s new post has confirmed that 2026 is the year in which The Witcher series comes to an end. </p>



<p>We were <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-witcher-final-season/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">informed</a> back in 2024 that Netflix’s The Witcher series would be renewed for its fifth and final season. Now that the fourth season has aired and the fifth season has been filmed, all we need to wait for is the last season to air. Netflix has confirmed that the fifth season will end its run in 2026. </p>







<h2 id="h-the-witcher-s-season-5-will-end-in-2026-bringing-the-series-to-a-close">The Witcher’s Season 5 Will End in 2026, Bringing the Series to a Close</h2>



<p>The confirmation that The Witcher series will end in 2026 comes from a <a href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/new-shows-on-netflix-2026" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Tudum</a> post by Netflix, which talks about all the content releasing this year. The summary states that “the time of the end is nigh,” and that dark forces will be coming together across the continent to target Ciri. If Geralt and Yennefer wish to save their daughter and reunite as a family, they will have to face never-before-seen obstacles and enemies. The fifth and final season of the show will air in 2026.</p>



<p>The Witcher series is highly revered in the fan base, even after going through a major recasting with Henry Cavill exiting for Liam Hemsworth to take his place. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-witchers-ciri-had-considered-leaving-with-henry-cavill/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">actress</a> who plays Ciri in the series also recently stated that she had considered leaving, along with Cavill. Still, she ultimately decided to return and take Henry’s role as “knowledgeable and loyal to the books,” as well as pushing for “certain lines to be included.” Even amid these twists and turns, the series has remained strong, and now fans are eagerly awaiting its epic conclusion. </p>

            <guid>1400644</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">When a series such as Trails lasts as long as it has, sometimes things start to get <em>weird</em>. We’ve seen giant mechs, supernatural beings, and even multiversal time travel. After all of that, where else is there to go? Oh yeah, outer space! The vast, unknown territory of the final frontier is filled with possibilities, and The Legend of Heroes: Trails beyond the Horizon breaks through the atmosphere in order to tell a compelling sci-fi fantasy story filled with deception and intrigue. It also continues to refine the Daybreak saga’s hybrid action/turn-based combat system, with battles that are more engaging than ever before. The cliffhanger ending could make for a rocky re-entry for some, but when the dust settles, Trails beyond the Horizon manages to safely touch down as another enthralling RPG.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Picking up where <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-heroes-trails-through-daybreak-2-review"><u>Trails through Daybreak 2</u></a> left off, Trails beyond the Horizon sees the nation of Calvard attempt humanity’s first manned spaceflight, called Project Startaker. Like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-heroes-trails-into-reverie-review"><u>Trails into Reverie</u></a>, the roughly 60 to 70-hour campaign is split between the perspectives of three characters: Rean Schwarzer, the Trails of Cold Steel saga’s protagonist, Kevin Graham, the lead of Trails in the Sky the 3rd, and Daybreak’s mercenary hero Van Arkride. Trails beyond the Horizon manages this balance well, but (unsurprisingly) it does mean this isn’t a good starting point for new fans – Van is the star, but it treats each of the three as a “main” character in their own way, so you’ll need to have played the two previous Daybreak games <em>and</em> be familiar with the Cold Steel saga, Reverie, and the third entry in the Sky trilogy to really get everything that’s going on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, this story is still good on its own merits. Rean’s route kept me glued to the screen as he uncovered the real objective of Project Startaker and the conspiracy surrounding it. Kevin’s storyline is just as captivating as he picks up the mantle of “Heretic Hunter” once again,learning more about who his assassination target is and how to come to grips with it. Surprisingly, Van’s section is the most boring of the three (at least at first) as he and his crew fight off a mysterious new faction called the Vestiges. Van’s path is as long as the other two combined, and while that makes sense since Trails beyond the Horizon is <em>his</em> story, the first half of his route takes too long to build up, making the faster pacing of the other protagonists’ tales much more exciting by comparison. However, the way their stories tie in with Van’s towards the finale ultimately redeems it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Trails beyond the Horizon also successfully manages the character bloat that plagued some previous Trails crossovers. It only includes a few key cast members from Rean’s Thors Academy days as both student and instructor, such as the lively student council president Towa Herschel and the calm but calculated Altina Orion. Kevin has Reverie’s Rufus, Nadia, Swin, and Lapis in tow, and new additions to both his and Van’s casts are smartly kept to a minimum as well. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Don’t fix what ain’t broken</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">If you played Daybreak 2, this review might sound familiar in spots, as Trails beyond the Horizon sticks quite close to that formula outside of combat. For instance, the Marchen Garten roguelite dungeon returns in the form of Grim Garten, and it’s the same drill as usual. You navigate it by playing a minigame, moving across a board and fighting monsters until you reach a floor’s boss. Only the first half of the dungeon is required for story purposes, with the second being entirely optional, but it’s a shame that Grim Garten isn’t available to continue playing through after the credits roll like Marchen Garten was.  That’s a slight downgrade, as Marchen Garten gave a satisfying “post-game” feeling to Daybreak 2, letting me clean up other tasks as I prepared to jump into New Game Plus, that’s now missing. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Thankfully, Grim Garten still has the same worthwhile incentives to explore it periodically throughout the story. You can earn valuable skill points to level up your party’s attacks, as well as unlock cosmetics and useful items (all of which are earned in game, with no microtransactions involved whatsoever), and even learn more about the backstories of certain characters, which was particularly interesting for some of the antagonists.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Optional activities like this have always been an important part of previous Trails games, and deep side quests and fun bonding events make a return to Trails beyond the Horizon as well. Not only do they reward you with useful and rare items, they also provide a vast amount of insight into the world and the people who inhabit it. It was fun to see how Rean contacted Van, asking if he could accept requests from the city bulletin on his behalf in order to experience the mercenary life. One of my favorite quests involved busting an illegal casino chip trade, with the culprit behind it being a recurring character who has been cooking up schemes since the Crossbell games, Trails from Zero and Trails to Azure, 16 years ago. It’s a nostalgic touch that showcases how expansive this series is.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The LGC morality system from the first two Daybreak games makes a return, too: Sometimes when Rean, Van, and Kevin finish quests, they have the option to decide the outcome, which increases their affinity to either Law, Gray, or Chaos. In the first Daybreak game, your affinity determined which allies joined Van towards one of the later chapters. Disappointingly, like Daybreak 2, there’s no such impact in Trails beyond the Horizon, which made me once again question why the LGC system still exists in its current iteration at all. It was initially a standout feature that separated Van from other Trails heroes, so it’s disheartening to see the mechanic has actually regressed instead of evolved in any meaningful way, especially since it’s now tied to other protagonists as well. For example, what would a “chaos” aligned Rean look like, similar to his berserk <a href="https://kiseki.fandom.com/wiki/Sacrifice" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>“ogre” form</u></a> from Cold Steel III and IV? Ideas like this could’ve been cool to explore. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">At least the bonding events, called Connections, remain consistently delightful and charming, letting you hang out with other party members during major story beats. Not only do they offer fantastic character development, but they can also increase a character’s parameters, such as their attacking stats or chance that they’ll initiate a follow-up attack in battle. A favorite bonding event of mine was when Rufus reflected with Kevin about where he’s at in life – introduced all the way back in the first Cold Steel game, Rufus was a high-tier noble at the upper echelon of society, being recognized and revered wherever he went. A fall from grace and several (in-game) years later, he now spends his days in the shadows with his hair down looking after kids, but is content with himself. It’s a satisfying full-circle moment that had me reminiscing about my college days when I started playing the Trails series on my PlayStation Vita.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Teaching a new dog old tricks</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Like the previous Daybreak games, Trails beyond the Horizon uses a hybrid turn-based/real-time action combat system. Out in the field, you can wail on enemies in real time in order to stun them. After successfully doing so, you can then transition to the turn-based battle system with an advantage, dealing extra damage right out of the gate. This was an imperfect but exciting system I liked when it was first introduced, and further refinements here make the field battles feel more fleshed out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are now ZOC abilities that let you temporarily stop time and get a few extra hits in, but the biggest game changer is the Awakening mechanic. Van, Rean, and Kevin can power themselves up to dish out more damage before going into turn-based combat. These Awakenings include Rean’s Spirit Unification, Van’s Grendal, and Kevin’s Stigma, which are clever ways of marrying a story-based power up and a previously turn-based exclusive-mechanic into a real-time action one. Even if the turn-based combat will always be where Trails thrives the most, it’s admirable that developer Falcom is continually iterating on the real-time elements to make them equally engaging.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Further refinements make the field battles feel more fleshed out.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The bulk of the turn-based combat is the same as previous Daybreak and Trails games at large. At the top of your screen sits a turn order timeline that you can plan around and manipulate. There are several bonus icons that will randomly align with either an ally or enemy on the timeline, which can range from bursts of healing or bypassing the casting time for magic to let a character fire off a spell right away. It’s important to pay attention to the timeline order as these bonuses can change the flow of battle, which makes for a compelling combat puzzle. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While “stealing” bonuses was possible in Daybreak 2, you could only do so when enemies were stunned or unconscious, and Trails beyond the Horizon slightly revised this mechanic to make it more accessible. If you activate a Shard Boost from your Boost Gauge to power up your next attack and then strike an enemy, you’ll grab whatever bonus was aligned with it and transform it into a more powerful “Plus” version, increasing the effectiveness of it for yourself. Steal a Zero Arts bonus? Not only will your next spell be cast immediately, but its power jumps up by 50%! This adds an extra layer of clever planning to an already well-thought out battle system.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Alternatively, you can still use skills that can inflict Delay on an enemy, pushing a bonus further down the timeline to hopefully land on an ally. In fact, this tactic has even gotten an update in Trails beyond the Horizon as successfully delaying an enemy while under a Shard Boost will also spawn a “Plus” version of that same bonus on the timeline during the next turn. These minor yet impactful boons make the combat more strategic and engaging. They can mean the difference between victory and defeat, especially against the hardest enemies later on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Positioning, once again, is also crucial to combat. Each skill has a certain attack pattern, whether it’s a circle, cross, or a straight line. Maneuvering your characters so that you can hit as many enemies as possible ensures you get the most out of each action you take. Skills also have secondary effects. For example, Rean’s Sixfold Gales skill inflicts Delay, but also gets a damage buff if the enemy is struck from behind. Even if Rean can’t get behind an enemy, the skill is still useful as the Delay effect can help push a timeline bonus away from it. Trails has always had these mechanics, but the consistent quality and improvements between all of the entries is impressive, and a big part of what makes this combat system unique.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Best Game Order to Play the Trails Series</h3><p>This is the best order to play the Trails games in to best understand the events taking place in the Zemuria saga.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The biggest addition to Trails beyond the Horizon’s turn-based combat is the introduction of Shard Commands. These are basically upgraded versions of Brave Orders from Cold Steel III, IV, and Reverie. By consuming portions of your Boost Gauge, you can apply party-wide buffs that last for a limited number of turns. They can drastically turn the tide of battle, with effects like reducing incoming damage down to 30% or decreasing casting time for spells. Shard Commands are also more flexible than Brave Orders. In previous Trails games, bosses could enact their Brave Orders, called “Disorders,” to overwrite your own, but you couldn’t do the same thing back. You’re now able to overwrite boss Anti-Shard Commands with your own, but it’ll consume an extra bar in your Boost Gauge on top of the normal cost. It’s a smartly implemented trade-off that levels the playing field and feels fair.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Additionally, using two bars of your Boost Gauge activates ZOC and lets characters act twice in a row. In previous Daybreak games, you were incentivized to mainly conserve your Boost Gauge to fire off a character’s S-Crafts (ultimate attacks), so between Shard Commands and ZOC, as well as the aforementioned new bonus stealing mechanics, you have exciting new choices for how to spend it. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, the customization options remain largely unchanged from the two previous Daybreak games, but that’s not a bad thing since it provides the same kind of fun as tinkering in a toybox and getting lost for hours while optimizing your party’s full potential. Slotting elemental gems, called Quartz, into one of four available lines for a variety of perks is still a clever system. It’s fun to experiment with different elemental combinations and values in order to unlock more potent Shard Abilities, including ones that can help outside of battle – like Golden Eye, which marks every treasure chest on your map in the area, ensuring that you’ll never miss any useful items. The Quartz system has been polished over the past two decades and has become one of the most flexible in any modern RPG. </p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">After its predecessor took a detour from advancing the Calvard saga in favor of a more interpersonal story, The Legend of Heroes: Trails beyond the Horizon almost feels like an overcorrection as it weaves the plot-heavy stories of three different protagonists into a single adventure. However, splitting it into three distinct routes makes it all much easier to digest. While our main hero is overshadowed by the other protagonists early on, the story eventually finds a satisfying way to weave its paths together, and ultimately sticks the landing. The new mechanics in both the turn-based and real-time combat are welcome additions that continue to refine a battle system that was already a lot of fun. And while its cliffhanger ending will likely be divisive, Trails beyond the Horizon has certainly built an exciting launchpad for what comes next.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-heroes-trails-beyond-the-horizon-review]]></content:encoded>

Like most things in life, these accessories saw their price increase last year.

In this quest, you'll have to find any signs that raiders have survived topside near the Abandoned Highway Camp in Buried City. We'll tell you everything you need to know about this quest and how to complete it in this guide.</p><p>You don't need to extract to complete A Warm Place to Rest, but you will be trekking across the entire Buried City map to complete the objectives. With this in mind, a free loadout may not be your best bet, as you're rather likely to encounter raiders or ARC, which means you'll probably need extra healing items. It's your choice, of course, but we'd recommend bringing a decent gun or two, and enough heals to keep you trucking along safely.</p><p>When you're ready to finish A Warm Place to Rest, follow the steps below.</p><h2 id="Locate_the_Abandoned_Highway_Camp">Locate the Abandoned Highway Camp</h2><p>The Abandoned Highway Camp is located on the Buried City map just southeast of the Grandioso Apartments. Head onto the highway and look for a collection of buses.</p><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4632179-share_20260107_0930372.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4632180-share_20260107_0930180.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4632179,1300-4632180" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/679/6794662/4632179-share_20260107_0930372.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/679/6794662/4632180-share_20260107_0930180.jpeg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4632179-share_20260107_0930372.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4632180-share_20260107_0930180.jpeg"></figure><p>When you arrive at the Abandoned Highway Camp, you'll be prompted to find any signs of survivors.</p><h2 id="Search_for_any_signs_of_survivors">Search for any signs of survivors</h2><p>Approach one of the buses to find a pack on the ground beside it.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4632181-share_20260107_0930350.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4632181" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4632181-share_20260107_0930350.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4632181"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4632181-share_20260107_0930350.jpeg"></figure><p>Interact with this pack to trigger an objective that asks you to follow red markers.</p><h2 id="Follow_the_red_markers">Follow the red markers</h2><p>These red markers in the sand can lead you across the entire map to the final objective of the quest.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Nintendo revealed <a href="https://gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2025/09/12/nintendo-reveals-mario-tennis-fever-launches-on-switch-2-in-february">Mario Tennis Fever, a Switch 2 exclusive, during a Direct</a> that aired last September. Now, with roughly a month to go until <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/mario-tennis-fever">the game's February 12 release date</a>, the company has released a new overview trailer highlighting nearly 6 minutes of gameplay, including a look at the series' largest roster of playable characters.&nbsp;</p><p>That's because Mario Tennis Fever features 38 different characters, ranging from fan-favorites like Mario and Luigi to more mischievous players like Dry Bones and Baby Waluigi. Alongside those 38 characters, Mario Tennis Fever features 30 Fever Rackets, which are all-new to the series and allow you to equip your character with unique abilities. The Ice Racket, for example, turns parts of the court into a slippery tundra, while the Mini Mushroom Racket shrinks your opponent to bite size.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Just fill up your Fever Gauge to unleash a Fever Shot," a press release reads. "And if you're on the receiving end of one, don't worry – you can try and send it back at your opponent before the shot hits the court, so they feel the effects instead." That's an especially useful skill to learn when up against rackets like the Shadow Racket, which causes the receiving player to see double as it duplicates the player using the racket.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Check all this out and more in the Mario Tennis Fever overview trailer for yourself below:&nbsp;</strong></p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RSyoMsWRL9I"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RSyoMsWRL9I" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Mario Tennis Fever will feature a single-player Adventure Mode, a campaign in which mysterious monsters turn Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, Wario, and Waluigi into babies, forcing them to re-master their tennis skills and overcome challenges to return to normal. Elsewhere in the game, the Trial Towers mode forces players to take on a series of challenges as they climb their way to the top of a tower, and Mix It Up mode allows you to play matches with unconventional rules, like Ring Shot, where you have to hit balls with precision through rings to earn points and Forest Court Match, where you can expand the court's size by feeding Piranha Plants tennis balls.&nbsp;</p><p>Returning modes include Tournament, with play-by-play commentary from <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/super-mario-bros-wonder/getting-its-flowers">Super Mario Bros.

            <title><![CDATA[Not Even A Video Game Can Convince Me To Read The Directions First]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/uncle-chops-rocket-shop-impressions-review/</link>
            <guid>1400626</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>We had these report cards in elementary school that, in addition to grading us on school subjects, also evaluated how we were doing on general life skills. I did pretty well in classes besides math, but the two skills I repeatedly failed were “penmanship” and “following directions.” I am simply not very good at reading and understanding explanations before I begin a task, and it’s this tendency that’s making the game <em>Uncle Chop’s Rocket Shop</em> a bit of a nightmare for me, but also really fun.</p><p><em>Uncle Chop’s Rocket Shop</em> came out in 2024, and it’s been sitting in my Epic store library for a while before I finally decided to check it out this week. You play as Wilbur, a fox-headed dude who inherits an intergalactic mechanic’s shop and has to fix enough spaceships to make growing rent payments. There’s more plot than this– I’m only a few in-game days in, and I’ve already encountered mystical beings, thieves, meteor showers, and other hints that this isn’t just a job simulator. It’s possible to die, but the game is also a roguelike, with upgrades to your mechanic’s shop persisting between runs. But the bulk of your day is taken up by choosing from a number of repair jobs and getting them done to the customer’s satisfaction.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hr1FwsDDbzY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Uncle Chop's Rocket Shop - Launch Trailer | PS5 Games"></iframe></figure><p>There are two modes to choose from: one with time pressure, where customers will get angry if you don’t fix their ships fast enough, and one that does away with the clock but makes the repairs harder and more exacting. I hate time pressure in games so opted for this more chill mode. This seems like a good way to learn the game, and especially how to come to grips with its giant, weird <a href="https://www.unclechops.com/?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">manual</a>.</p><p>When you go to refill a customer’s fuel pump, for instance, you’ll see a symbol that will tell you which tab in the manual to go to, which you do by physically pulling the book out of your inventory and clicking through its pages. There, you’ll get a variety of images, brisk instructions, and references to other parts of the manual that will help you troubleshoot and solve the problem. My fuel jobs have been pretty basic–remove the fuel cell, refill it at my fuel station without filling it too far and exploding it, putting it back in. Oil is a little more complicated–in addition to the oil levels, there’s the oil quality to consider, as well as a pump, heat gauge, and other gadgets that could be busted. A recent job included both of these tasks and two new complications. There was an alarm that wouldn’t stop timing out and locking me out of the other ship modules, which had to be disarmed with a series of puzzles, and a “tomfoolery” module that required buying a new repair station to fix and then playing a whole <em>other</em> video game to calibrate.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Beard Envy</span></figcaption></figure><p>The actual fixing is wonderfully tactile, with lots of <a href="https://aftermath.site/pacific-drive-star-trucker-buttons-steam/"><u>buttons</u></a> to press and levers to pull and bolts to unscrew. Just like in real life, you have to make sure you do all these things–I’ve lost money for forgetting to close a panel back up, or gotten stuck because I was flipping switches in the wrong order. The manual tells you all this, but it’s written like a real professional manual that assumes a certain familiarity with the objects at hand. Everything you need to know is in there, but it can be a little baffling to get your head around, especially if you’re not a great visual learner or are me, who cannot help himself from skimming the instructions before diving into a ship’s guts. In the game’s time-pressure mode, I imagine learning a new task for the first time requires an overwhelming amount of speedreading and making good choices, but in my chill mode I have no justification for not taking the time to look everything over first besides being a dumbass. I find it hard to understand the manual without experiencing the thing it’s describing, but going step-by-step often gets me stumped if a problem is deeper in the book. I’ll plunge ahead with unearned confidence, run into problems, give the manual the most cursory glance, dive back in, and get stumped again, in an absurd loop I have no one to blame for but myself.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Beard Envy</span></figcaption></figure><p>I hate reading directions, but I <em>do</em> like research, so I enjoy looking stuff up in the manual even if I’m not fully digesting it. It’s hard not to get impatient to fiddle with all the strange machines, which give me some great <a href="https://spaceteam.ca/?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Spaceteam</u></em></a><em> </em>vibes. The computer I’m playing <em>Uncle Chop’s</em> on sits next to an Ikea bookshelf I put together myself <em>also</em> without reading the instructions in full, and which is now listing to one side because I didn’t pay enough attention to the importance of rigorously attaching its shitty plywood back. Looking up from a game that reminds me I apparently haven’t grown at all as a person since third grade to real-world proof of the fact that I haven’t grown at all as a person since third grade is a <em>lot</em>, and the in-game consequences for my bad habit feel like a reminder that there will also be real-world consequences when my bookshelf inevitably collapses. At least in the game I’ll get a chance to start again, unlike my bookshelf, which will destroy everything around it when it forces me to pay for my hubris.</p><p><em>Uncle Chop’s Rocket Shop</em> is available on PC and consoles. </p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/xbox-developer-direct-2026-fable-forza-horizon-6-game-freak-playground-games/</link>
            <guid>1400611</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Xbox has <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2026/01/08/xbox-developer-direct-2026/">announced the return</a> of its <strong>Xbox Developer Direct</strong> event on <strong>January 22, 2026</strong>, which so far looks to be a Playground Games-focused event with a look at both Forza Horizon 6 and Fable, though tagging along and not to be outdone is Pokémon developer <strong>Game Freak</strong>, which will be showcasing its upcoming non-Pokémon game, <a href="https://wccftech.com/beast-of-reincarnation-is-a-game-you-wouldnt-expect-from-pokemon-series-developer-game-freak-launches-in-2026-on-pc-and-consoles/">Beast of Reincarnation</a>.</p>



<p>That's what we know will be there, but there will likely be more shown at the event; every year that Xbox has hosted its Developer Direct to start off the new year, it has led with a few titles that it confirms will be shown ahead of time, and held back one or two surprises to be revealed at the show. </p>



<p><a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/01/09/xbox-developer-direct-2025/">2025's Developer Direct,</a> for example, announced that we'd get a look at <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/south-of-midnight-boring-combat-drags-down-a-beautiful-and-emotional-story/">South of Midnight</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/doom-the-dark-ages-review/">DOOM: The Dark Ages</a> ahead of the show. The surprise was the reveal of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ninja-gaiden-4-bathed-in-blood/">Ninja Gaiden 4</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ninja-gaiden-2-black-the-edge-of-the-dragon-sword/">Ninja Gaiden 2: Black</a>, to round out the show.</p>



<p>As for what we know Xbox will show at the event, according to the Xbox Wire blog post, we'll get to see gameplay for all three of the aforementioned titles, with the Forza Horizon 6 segment being "<em>a deep-dive</em>" on the coming racer.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>What's more interesting to note, however, is that Xbox Developer Direct events have a history of revealing release dates for the games shown. It's not a surefire thing, of course, but if Xbox keeps that tradition for this year, then we can expect release dates for Fable, Forza Horizon 6, and Beast of Reincarnation.</p>



<p>We could have anticipated a release date for Forza Horizon 6, as we've known that <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-6-targeting-h1-2026-launch-window-says-insider/">it is targeting a first-half of 2026 release window</a>. Beast of Reincarnation is a surprise and a bit of a wildcard, since we don't know too much about the upcoming action RPG from Game Freak, who seem to be stepping far outside their comfort zone by making something totally separate from the most well-known franchise in the world.</p>



<p>Fable is the most intriguing of the bunch to get a release date for. The last we heard, <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-delayed-technical-issues-ps5-2026/">after it was delayed out of 2025 and into 2026</a>, was that <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-rumored-missing-2026-launch-window/">it might not even hit its proposed 2026 release window</a>. Hopefully, its presence at the Developer Direct means we will get a release date and that the game's development isn't as troubled as it has seemed from the outside looking in. </p>



<p>Beyond that, who knows what will be shown at the event. We could get another look at <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-shooter-games-2026-the-year-of-xbox-studios/">Gears of War: E-Day</a>, or something that's not yet on anyone's radar. This year is Xbox's 25th anniversary year, so we ought to expect Team Green to go all-out right from the beginning. We'll find out when the show premieres on <strong>January 22, 2026, at 10am PT / 1pm ET / 6pm BT</strong>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The personal computer has remained surprisingly resilient to change over the past 15 years. Apple promised a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/8/9/9115503/post-pc-is-just-pc">“post-PC” era with the iPad</a> in 2010 and failed to deliver one. Smartphones even overtook laptops as the most popular device to connect to the internet a decade ago, but millions of people still kept buying PCs every year. But this PC resiliency is going to be tested even further this year.</p><p>RAM and NAND / SSD prices have surged in recent months due to shortages created by AI data center demand. Some stores have had to sell memory <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/828337/ram-memory-shortage-crunch-market-prices-central-micro-center">like it’s lobster</a>, prebuilt PC costs <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/831032/cyberpowerpc-maingear-ram-price-increases-pc-gaming">have risen</a>, and some assemblers are even <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/find-your-own-memory-this-system-builder-now-sells-pcs-without-ram">selling PCs without RAM</a>.</p><p>Now, we’re about to see how the shortage hits regular laptops and PCs from the likes of Lenovo, Dell, HP, Asus, and Acer. <a href="https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/news/20251211-12831.html">TrendForce predicts</a> that memory prices are projected to “rise sharply again in the first quarter of 2026.” More price rises will only put further pressure on laptop and PC pricing, and we’re seeing early signs that PC makers are adjusting prices at CES this week.</p><p>Asus <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/asus-officially-announces-price-hikes-from-january-5-right-before-ces-2026">announced</a> to its channel partners this week that it’s implementing price hikes across its products as a result of the memory market conditions. Dell also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/851047/dell-xps-14-16-13-laptops-brand-return-ces-2026">adjusted the launch pricing</a> of its XPS 14 and XPS 16 just hours before they were announced this week, in a sign that laptop pricing is going to become increasingly fluid. Lenovo has been <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-24/lenovo-stockpiling-pc-memory-due-to-unprecedented-ai-squeeze?embedded-checkout=true">stockpiling PC memory</a> to try and weather the storm throughout 2026, and HP has warned it will have to increase prices and offer lower RAM configurations later this year. Like Lenovo, HP also has a stockpile of memory, but it expects the continued rise in costs will begin eating into PC product margins by May.</p><p>There’s no quick fix for PC makers, either. Offering less RAM on laptops will be difficult for manufacturers, particularly below the 8GB threshold. Windows 11 has a minimum RAM requirement of 4GB, but it doesn’t run particularly well in those conditions. While TrendForce predicts some smartphones are likely to return to just 4GB this year, “for budget notebooks, DRAM cannot be reduced quickly due to processor pairing needs and operating system limitations.”</p><p>The timing of this memory shortage couldn’t be any worse for Microsoft and its PC partners. Windows 10 just hit end of life in October, and many businesses are in the process of migrating to Windows 11. That often involves a PC refresh cycle, and there were strong signs throughout 2025 that PC <a href="https://my.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS53855725">shipments were accelerating</a> thanks to a refresh of the existing install base. That momentum could be derailed later this year once RAM stockpiles are depleted.</p><p>Timing isn’t the only problem for the PC market, as the increased prices of RAM and SSDs could be permanent instead of a temporary supply constraint. “This is not just a cyclical shortage driven by a mismatch in supply and demand, but a potentially permanent, strategic reallocation of the world’s silicon wafer capacity,” <a href="https://www.idc.com/resource-center/blog/global-memory-shortage-crisis-market-analysis-and-the-potential-impact-on-the-smartphone-and-pc-markets-in-2026/">warns IDC</a>. “For decades, the production of DRAM and NAND Flash for smartphones and PCs was the primary driver for production. Today, that dynamic has inverted.”</p><p>The demand from hyperscalers like Microsoft, Google, Meta, and Amazon has pushed Samsung, SK Hynix, and Micron to pivot toward building high-bandwidth (HBM) and high-capacity DDR5 memory. “Every wafer allocated to an HBM stack for an Nvidia GPU is a wafer denied to the LPDDR5X module of a mid-range smartphone or the SSD of a consumer laptop,” says IDC.</p><p>This is going to have a big impact on the DIY market and PC gaming, too. “PC gaming is thriving at a time when overall consumer PC shipments have declined by 14 percent in the last five years… annual gaming PC shipments are up 50 percent,” said Henry Lin, director of product management at Nvidia, in a briefing with <em>The Verge</em> last week.</p><p>The popularity of PC gaming has allowed smaller assemblers to offer custom prebuilt systems at competitive prices. These smaller builders can’t stockpile RAM or SSDs, and “will bear the greatest burden of the shortage,” warns IDC. “That in turn represents an opportunity for large OEMs to gain share from smaller assemblers in the gaming space by positioning prebuilt systems as offering higher value.”</p><p>Demand for memory looks set to impact GPU prices too. <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/board-channels-amd-and-nvidia-gpu-price-hikes-may-reach-aib-cards-in-jan-feb-2026">Rumors have suggested</a> that Nvidia could force GPU partners to adjust pricing to factor in increased memory costs. “The demand for memory in the market is at record levels, and this does mean supply will be tight,” admitted Ben Berraondo, director of global PR for Nvidia GeForce, in a briefing with <em>The Verge</em> last week. “There have been no major changes in how we manage memory with our customers. There are no major supply chain changes to GeForce,” says Berraondo.</p><p>Despite a lack of major memory changes to GeForce, pricing is already starting to increase. <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;mid=44583&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fp%2Fpl%3Fd%3DRTX%2B5090" rel="sponsored">Newegg</a> has started listing a variety of RTX 5090 cards at well above $4,000. It’s becoming increasingly difficult to find an RTX 5090 for under $3,000, after prices were <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-finally-drops-to-1999-in-us-rtx-5080-dips-7-below-msrp">close to</a> the $1,999 retail price in September.</p><p>Berraondo didn’t comment directly on the rumors of $5,000 pricing for the RTX 5090, but he did point to Nvidia’s Founders Edition model still being listed at $1,999 at <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Fnvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-32gb-gddr7-founders-edition-graphics-card-dark-gun-metal%2FJ3GWYHGPCP" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a>. That’s great, but it’s constantly out of stock so it’s not representative of the true retail pricing of the RTX 5090.</p><p>If the costs of building a gaming PC don’t stabilize in 2026, Microsoft will also feel increased pressure on its next-gen Xbox plans. Microsoft is aggressively pivoting toward PC for the future of Xbox consoles, with the handheld Xbox Ally devices just the beginning of its plans. Component costs could force the price of the next-gen Xbox even higher and also impact Sony’s plans with the PS6 and Valve’s upcoming Steam Machine.</p><p>The memory shortage also threatens to impact Microsoft’s AI PC push. Microsoft set a surprising minimum of 16GB of RAM for its Copilot Plus PCs, in order to handle local small language models. Qualcomm has been pushing to bring Windows on Arm (Copilot Plus PCs) down to the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24334870/qualcomm-snapdragon-x-laptops-mini-pcs-ces-2025">$600 price range</a>, but that effort looks set to reverse due to memory costs.</p><p>It increasingly feels like we’re witnessing a battle over the future of the PC, where component prices and AI features are having a big impact on computing. If AI demand wins the battle then more traditional computing tasks will increasingly be performed in the cloud. That could force businesses to increasingly move to virtual machines instead of refreshing laptops and gamers to look at cloud streaming services instead of buying an expensive gaming PC.</p><p>I don’t think this battle means the end of the PC anytime soon. It just feels like another step in Big Tech marching us toward an unproven AI future. I have faith the PC will survive and evolve and prove <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22225356/pc-sales-shipments-2020-growth-idc-canalys-remote-work">once again</a> how important it truly is.</p><div><p id="the-pad"><h2>The pad</h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span><strong>Satya Nadella is now blogging about AI slop. </strong>Microsoft CEO <strong>Satya Nadella</strong> created his very own “sn scratchpad” blog over the holidays, generating social media outrage in the process. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/852630/microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-scratchpad-blog-ai-slop-comments">Nadella’s first blog entry</a> argues that everyone needs to move “beyond the arguments of [AI] slop vs sophistication.” It’s an argument that has gone viral on social media networks, with “Microslop” trending on X this week. That’s not too surprising, given the backlash to Microsoft’s big AI push. The Microslop moniker is particularly popular among gamers, who aren’t happy with the changes Microsoft has been making to Windows and Xbox.</span></li><li><span><strong>LG forced a Copilot web app onto its TVs, but will let you delete it. </strong>LG is letting users delete a Microsoft Copilot shortcut that it i<a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/847685/lg-copilot-web-app-delete">nstalled on newer TVs</a> after a backlash over the unremovable icon. The icon was simply a shortcut to the web version of Copilot, but the response from Reddit users shows just how unpopular Copilot is among consumers.</span></li><li><span><strong>Microsoft isn’t rewriting Windows in Rust with AI</strong>. Continuing the backlash trend over Microsoft’s AI moves, distinguished engineer <strong>Galen Hunt</strong> announced that Microsoft was <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7407863239289729024/">planning to eliminate</a> “every line of C and C++ from Microsoft by 2030” and use AI to rewrite Microsoft’s largest codebases. The post led to headlines about Microsoft rewriting Windows in Rust with AI and plenty of concern over potential reliability issues for Windows. Hunt was forced to update his original post and clarify that Windows is not being rewritten in Rust with AI.</span></li><li><span><strong>Microsoft “Project Strong ARMed” is all about moving to ARM64. </strong>Over the holidays, Microsoft posted a new <a href="https://careerhub.microsoft.com/careers/job/1970393556627382">job listing</a> that revealed the company has a “Project Strong ARMed” team that’s part of a strategic initiative meant to “transition to ARM64 architecture across the E+D (Experiences &amp; Devices) division.” With Microsoft’s focus on AI features in Windows, its close partnership with Qualcomm, and Intel’s struggles, this all makes sense. Interestingly, part of the job is about driving adoption of Microsoft’s own Cobalt Arm-powered CPUs over traditional Intel and AMD chips.</span></li><li><span><strong>Three big Microsoft employee departures for 2026. </strong>Microsoft is losing veteran employees <strong>Steve Clayton</strong> and <strong>Louis Kahn</strong>. Clayton <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7406380693200715776/">is leaving</a> to become Cisco’s chief communications officer after 28 years at Microsoft, and Kahn is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/louiskahn_nvidialife-activity-7406707966801952770-TuKZ/">joining Nvidia</a> after 32 years at Microsoft working closely on Xbox engineering. <strong>Manik Gupta</strong>, who was responsible for Microsoft Teams consumer, Skype, and GroupMe at Microsoft, is <a href="https://x.com/manikgupta/status/2008630046945407219">also leaving</a> after nearly five years. Gupta first joined Microsoft in 2021, bringing a wealth of consumer app knowledge that Microsoft desperately needed at the time. It must have been a tough gig trying to turn around Skype and get consumers to care about Microsoft Teams.</span></li><li><span><strong>Dell admits consumers don’t care about AI PCs. </strong>In a surprisingly honest interview, Dell’s head of product, <strong>Kevin Terwilliger</strong>, told <em>PC Gamer</em> that consumers simply aren’t buying PCs for AI features right now and they <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/857723/dell-consumers-ai-pcs-comments">could even be confusing people</a>. “What we’ve learned over the course of this year, especially from a consumer perspective, is they’re not buying based on AI,” said Terwilliger. The biggest benefits of a Qualcomm-powered Copilot Plus PC is the performance and battery life improvements instead of the AI features alone, and Dell is now starting 2026 by moving beyond being “all about” AI PCs.</span></li><li><span><strong>The first Xbox Game Pass drop of 2026 is a good one. </strong>Microsoft is adding <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> to Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass on January 13th, followed by <em>Resident Evil Village</em> for Ultimate, Premium, and PC Game Pass subscribers a week later on January 20th. Other titles<a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2026/01/06/xbox-game-pass-january-2026-wave-1/"> coming to Game Pass this month</a> include <em>Brews &amp; Bastards</em>, <em>Little Nightmares Enhanced Edition</em>, <em>Final Fantasy</em>, <em>My Little Pony: A Zephyr Heights Mystery</em>, and <em>Mio: Memories in Orbit</em>. That’s a good start to the year for Game Pass, after a quiet end to 2025.</span></li><li><span><strong>No, Microsoft didn’t rebrand Office to Microsoft 365 Copilot. </strong>Microsoft has had big parts of the internet confused this week, again. Posts on Reddit, Hacker News, and X have all claimed that Microsoft has rebranded Office to Microsoft 365 Copilot. It’s all down to some confusing text on Microsoft’s <a href="http://office.com/">Office.com</a> website that makes it seem like Microsoft 365 Copilot app is the new name for Office. Microsoft renamed its Microsoft 365 hub app a year ago, but the internet only just found out about this change recently. Either way, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/856149/microsoft-365-office-rebrand-copilot">Microsoft has clarified it hasn’t made any branding changes to Office</a>. I’m hoping Microsoft updates its Office website to make things clearer, but I won’t hold my breath.</span></li><li><span><strong>Xbox Cloud Gaming is coming to Hisense TVs.</strong> Microsoft’s first<a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2026/01/05/xbox-bring-cloud-gaming-select-hisense-homeos-powered-smart-tvs/"> Xbox announcement</a> of 2026 is the launch of Xbox Cloud Gaming on select Hisense and V homeOS-powered smart TVs. The Xbox app first launched on Samsung TVs, followed by Amazon Fire TV devices, then select LG TVs, and now Hisense TVs. We don’t have an exact date for when the Xbox app will be available on the Hisense TVs, but Microsoft says it’s coming at some point in 2026.</span></li><li><span><strong>Qualcomm hints at Arm-powered Windows gaming handhelds. </strong>We haven’t seen any Arm-powered handheld gaming PCs at CES this year, but that might change in the coming months. Qualcomm <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/855222/qualcomm-hints-we-might-see-windows-gaming-handhelds-at-gdc-in-march">has hinted to <em>The Verge</em></a> that we should be “keeping an eye” on GDC in March for possible Arm-powered Windows handhelds. That timing lines up with Microsoft’s plans to launch Windows 11 version 26H1 exclusively on Snapdragon X2 devices in the spring and would line up well with some upcoming Xbox PC features. All of this is coming on top of another <a href="https://www.theverge.com/gadgets/850074/2025-windows-arm-laptops-qualcomm-intel-amd-nvidia">great year for Windows on Arm</a>.</span></li><li><span><strong>Microsoft Edge is getting a Copilot-inspired redesign. </strong>Microsoft is preparing to launch a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/854832/microsoft-edge-copilot-redesign-ui-features">major UI refresh of its Edge browser soon</a>. The software maker has started bringing the design language from Copilot to early Canary and Dev test versions of its Microsoft Edge browser. The design changes include a settings section that looks identical to the Copilot app, updated context menus, and an updated new tab page. I don’t actually mind the Copilot UI itself, but I do wonder what this all means for the Fluent design language and whether we’ll see similar changes in Windows itself.</span></li><li><span><strong>Microsoft has removed phone activation from Windows. </strong>Microsoft has started changing the activation experience for perpetual Windows licenses. The traditional telephone-based product activation process was <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/activate-microsoft-perpetual-products-using-the-product-activation-portal-64fdc7f5-ce38-42a9-aea8-393020149983">quietly removed on December 3rd</a>, in favor of a fully online process. “Customers will instead use the Product Activation Portal,” says Katharine Holdsworth, partner group product manager at Microsoft, in a statement to <em>Notepad</em>. “Internet connection is not required for the device being activated; however, customers will require a secondary device, such as smartphone, tablet, or computer with internet connection to access the online portal.”</span></li><li><span><strong>Xbox’s Developer Direct returns on January 22nd. </strong>Microsoft’s annual Xbox Developer Direct event is<a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/858471/xbox-developer-direct-forza-horizon-6-fable-beast-of-reincarnation-stream"> taking place on January 22nd</a> this year. The fourth Developer Direct will provide a closer look at two of Microsoft’s biggest Xbox games this year, <em>Forza Horizon 6</em> and <em>Fable</em>, as well as a first in-depth look at <em>Beast of Reincarnation</em> from Game Freak. I’m hoping we might get a release date for <em>Fable</em>, but Microsoft will likely play it safe with the broad 2026 release window instead.</span></li></ul></div><p>I’m always keen to hear from readers, so please drop a comment here, or you can reach me at <a href="mailto:notepad@theverge.com">notepad@theverge.com</a> if you want to discuss anything else.

            <p>
Was your new year resolution to rebuild an evil temple on behalf of a baleful god? I bring wonderful news, then. The former Epic and Valve developers of Dead Money LLC have signed a wicked pact with the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy game</a> illuminati of Hooded Horse to release Architect of Ruin – a “completely hand drawn” fantasy colony simulation game that looks like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dwarf-fortress">Dwarf Fortress</a> twisted by 45 degrees and pumped full of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dungeon-keeper">Dungeon Keeper</a> DNA. I am already in love with the trees, their rich foliage flattening to a core of shadow. Do not turn your back on the trees. Especially when you’re chopping them down to make arcane icons.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
“The old temple lies in ruins, its power dormant, its faithful scattered,” explains <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3778820/Architect_of_Ruin/">the Steam blurb</a>. “As the new master of these broken halls, guide a growing cult against adversity and meddling heroes. Balance resource management, construction, and survival to the glory of dark gods. Untomb forbidden knowledge, perform sinister rituals, and rebuild a long-forgotten sanctuary one blood-soaked stone at a time. Thus does the age of darkness begin.”
</p>



<p>
Here are some things you will build for your creepy lair of skulduggery: turrets, tanning racks, storehouses, bedrooms, chimney stoves, pillars and butcher blocks. And here are some beings you will enlist and/or conjure and bend to your will: “irascible sorcerors”, “unstable zealots”, goblins (I think) and “reanimated thralls”. There are also some deer in the screens but they don’t appear to be especially evil deer, and are probably not recruitable. 
</p><p>
Aside from tending to your horde, you’ll need to chase away angry mobs, rival cultists, and meddling heroes. By the sounds of things, you’re free to repurpose the bodies of any good guys you slaughter. Hey, walking skeletons don’t grow on trees. Not even trees as pungent with menace as these. Unless we’re being metaphorical and talking about dangling gibbets, or whatever.
</p>
<p>
Dead Money LLC number three core members in total. They include co-owner Brandon Reinhart, who has credits on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/half-life-alyx">Half-Life: Alyx</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/counter-strike-global-offensive">Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</a>, Artifact and Dota: Underlords. There’s no release date yet, so you’ll just have to pop along and do blood sacrifices in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/timberborn">Timberborn</a> for the moment, assuming that’s possible. I haven’t played Timberborn.

              <p><span>A subset of </span><i><span>Stranger Things </span></i><span>fans </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-season-5-finale-reaction-byler-acting-2000656424"><span>unsatisfied with the horror series’ finale</span></a><span> have spent the last week </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-season-5-finale-matt-duffer-interview-2000656663"><span>dunking on the creators and actors</span></a><span> and also peddling a conspiracy theory that </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-secret-finale-conformity-gate-explained-2000656704"><span>Netflix was holding a secret finale episode</span></a><span> that would explain away things these fans didn’t like about the existing conclusion. According to the “Conformity Gate” theory, the ninth episode of </span><i><span>Stranger Things</span></i><span>’ fifth season was supposed to go live on the streaming service last night, January 7, at 8 p.m. ET. The theory had become so widespread that fans claim Netflix </span><a href="https://ftw.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/pop-culture/2026/01/07/stranger-things-conformity-gate-crashed-netflix/88073821007/"><span>crashed around this time</span></a><span> as fans flocked to the streaming service and overloaded the servers. When they finally managed to get the app to boot up, they found that no such ninth episode had been published.</span></p>   <p><span>While the Conformity Gate theory was an interesting thought experiment, and I’ll admit I watched enough videos about it that I wasn’t quite convinced but was at least willing to see it all play out, this turn of events was hardly surprising, especially after </span><a href="https://variety.com/2026/tv/news/stranger-things-conformity-gate-final-episode-doesnt-exist-1236625074/"><i><span>Variety</span></i></a><span> published a story hours ahead of the supposed launch debunking the theory.</span></p>

 <p><span>What is surprising, however, is just how far reaching Conformity Gate had become before it was inevitably disproven. Some corporate accounts, like the one belonging to the Empire State Building of all things, were posting about </span><i><span>Stranger Things</span></i><span> fans’ collective psychosis, whether in genuine support of the theory or just to take advantage of a trending topic for social media engagement. The Slim Jim account </span><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@matcrackz/video/7592796861153414413"><span>is in everyone’s comments</span></a><span> like Joyce Byers telling everyone the Conformity Gate theory is canon, to them.</span></p>

   <p><span>Perhaps the interest of brands is understandable, though, in light of what a phenomenon </span><i><span>Stranger Things </span></i><span>was right up through its final episode.. The fifth season has already cracked </span><a href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/top10/most-popular/tv"><span>Netflix’s top 10 all-time most-streamed series</span></a><span>, and even if some fans online are so unsatisfied with how it all ended that they’re imagining another episode that might fix it all, the series still has enough cultural cache that every social media manager is probably looking at Conformity Gate as a chance to ride the coattails of a trend. Now, however, even people who are actually part of the </span><i><span>Stranger Things </span></i><span>brand are starting to post about it, and sorry to those holding out hope, but the few times that people like actor Brett Gelman have acknowledged the conspiracy, it hasn’t been to confirm it. Here he is addressing Conformity Gate by name while lipsyncing a cover of Prince’s “When Doves Cry,” specifically the line “Maybe you’re just like my mother, she’s never satisfied.”</span></p>

   <p><span>The </span><i><span>Stranger Things</span></i> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@strangerthings"><span>social media accounts</span></a><span> also now have “ALL EPISODES OF STRANGER THINGS ARE NOW PLAYING” </span><a href="https://x.com/Stranger_Things"><span>in their bios</span></a><span>, and it doesn’t get much clearer than that. The X account allegedly responsible for starting the conspiracy, @67gate, has set their profile to private. Now that the dream seems to be truly dead, fans are reacting in a lot of ways. Some are grieving, finally realizing the ending they didn’t like is, in fact, the finale of </span><i><span>Stranger Things</span></i><span>, while others are saying that the theory provided a fun ride for a week, and helped cushion the blow of the finale.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Unfortunately, if you scroll through the comments on videos about there being no ninth episode, you’ll also find people moving the goalpost and saying that a secret finale could still be coming, whether that be after the upcoming </span><i><span>One Last Adventure </span></i><span>documentary about the making of the final season, or at some other date they made up. Maybe they will return to reality in the coming days as more people disperse from the discussion.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/bose-quietcomfort-ultra-earbuds-2nd-gen-launched-pricier-than-airpods-pro-3-now-match-their-price-after-a-drop-2000657843</link>
            <guid>1400590</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If upgrading your audio gear is on your New Year’s checklist, this deal is hard to beat. The Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds are widely praised for their exceptional noise cancellation, immersive sound quality, and all-day comfort, making them a great choice in the premium earbuds category. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6592/">Right now, Amazon is offering them at a $49 discount, dropping the price from their usual $299 down to just $250 for a limited time</a>. Whether you’re tuning out distractions during your daily commute, staying focused while working, traveling, or simply enjoying your favorite playlists at home without the whine of your toddler crying in the other room (they just never stop, don’t they?), these earbuds deliver a noticeably superior listening experience. If you’ve been waiting for the right moment to invest in high-quality audio, this limited-time offer makes now an excellent opportunity to do so for less.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6592/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>World-Class Noise Cancellation</h2>
<p>When paying for a premium audio accessory, you expect solid noise cancellation—and it’s the real deal here. Our sister-site <a href="https://gizmodo.com/bose-quietcomfort-ultra-2-review-the-only-earbuds-you-want-on-an-airplane-2000646784">Gizmodo</a> put it through the ringer, testing the second-gen Bose QuietComfort Ultra earbuds in busy subways and crowded, chatty coffee shops. The results were it could block out&nbsp;<em>everything</em>.</p>
<p>In addition to Quiet Mode, the Bose QuietComfort Ultra earbuds make use of two other modes. Aware Mode is the transparency option where you can pass through the sounds of your surroundings. Wearing in-ear earbuds do a little bit of noise cancelling physically just because of how they’re design. You plug your ear with them after all. This mode will actually play the sounds from your environment that it’s picking up on its and play them through the earbuds. This is good for a range of use cases, particularly if you’re a runner training on the roads while listening to music. Best to be able to hear traffic to avoid any accidents.</p>



<p>The earbuds are also equipped with Immersion Mode which blends together noise-cancelling with 3D audio. This is able to track your head movements so it feels like you are surrounded on all sides by music that you can physically move throughout, even though it’s all just simulated in your ear.</p>
<p>You can choose between five super sleek colorways, though not all have been treated equally by the Amazon discount gods. The humble black model is right now the cheapest, so if you don’t want a pair of earbuds that are too loud (except in the traditional sense, you’re in luck. Offering slightly more pizazz is the desert gold option. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6592/">These are mostly black, but with a gold accent. They’re also priced at the lowest value of $250</a>. Just above that at $268 is a really striking midnight violet model. Then at full price still ($299,) is the white and deep plum versions.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>ARC Raiders has taken the gaming world by storm, and a key reason for its success is its combat. Whether you’re fighting PvP or PvE, there’s a strong variety of weapons and gadgets at your disposal, but one item in particular stands tall above the rest—the Trigger ‘Nade.</p>



<p>This pocket-sized rendition of a C4 packs a serious punch, and whilst it’s fairly effective against the enemy ARC, it’s best utilised against <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-ceo-the-game-isnt-about-shooting-other-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fellow raiders</a>. However, the Trigger ‘Nade might be a little bit too good at ending people’s raids, as plenty of fans have been clamouring for a nerf.</p>



<p>Follow along with this guide to see whether Trigger ‘Nades are actually being nerfed in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-tv-show-and-movie-ideas-being-pitched-embark/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a>, and the reason why fans are calling for one. </p>



<h2 id="h-are-trigger-nades-being-nerfed-in-arc-raiders">Are Trigger ‘Nades Being Nerfed In ARC Raiders?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>You’ll want a stash full of them. Image by Embark Studios.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>An ARC Raiders Community Manager has confirmed that the development team is looking into nerfing Trigger ‘Nades. </strong></p>



<p>The news was broken in the <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjJgbCVm_yRAxUaZ0EAHRmqL0gQFnoECAwQAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdiscord.com%2Finvite%2Farcraiders&amp;usg=AOvVaw1Fa-gWhhqWUNZh3rIuGRH-&amp;opi=89978449" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ARC Raiders Discord</a>, where Lily, a Community Manager, was asked whether there were any updates regarding a PVP-focused balancing update. Trigger ‘Nades were specifically mentioned, and Lily promptly responded:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The team’s looking into some nerfs, including trigger nades. Keep an eye on ⁠game-announcements for updates!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>As things stand, that’s all there is to know regarding the Trigger ‘Nade nerf in ARC Raiders. Its existence is confirmed, but to what extent it will present itself in-game, and when you can expect it, you’ll have to wait for further updates from Embark Studios.</p>



<p>One thing Insider Gaming is certain of, though, is that the nerf can’t come soon enough.</p>



<h2 id="h-why-are-trigger-nades-being-nerfed-in-arc-raiders">Why Are Trigger ‘Nades Being Nerfed In ARC Raiders?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>For a small ‘Nade, they pack a mean punch. Image by Embark Studios.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>As things stand, the Trigger ‘Nade in ARC Raiders is incredibly OP, rendering many of the other utility items obsolete. </strong></p>



<p>On paper, the Trigger ‘Nade seems intended for use as a trap; place down the grenade, and remotely detonate it when enemy raiders step within range. However, what has transpired is that raiders use it more like an impact grenade, due to its incredibly quick detonation time and absurd damage potential. </p>



<p>A single well-aimed Trigger ‘Nade can down an entire trio of raiders with ease, thanks to its ludicrous damage output and large radius. To make matters worse, they’re dirt cheap to craft: both Crude Explosives and Processors are immensely simple to acquire. </p>



<p>All of these attributes combined transform the Trigger ‘Nade into what feels like a pocket-sized nuke. Fans have long been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-november-20-update-full-1-3-0-patch-notes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">desperate for a nerf</a>, and thankfully, it seems like Embark Studios is aware of its unbalanced nature—fingers crossed there isn’t too long a wait.</p>

<p>ARC Raiders retained its popularity heading into the new year, making 2026 an exciting chapter for Embark Studios and all ARC Raiders players. A 2026 roadmap is what the community is begging for, and this live tracker has the latest details and updates on future changes.</p>



<p>It feels redundant to say, but ARC Raiders is quite good, isn’t it? A record <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-sales-estimate-hits-12-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">12 million Peak Player count</a> serves to highlight this more, and ARC Raiders is expected to be a huge presence throughout 2026.</p>



<p>One thing that will keep you all coming back is new content, and this live tracker runs through everything known about the roadmap and future incomings.</p>







<h2 id="h-does-arc-raiders-have-a-2026-roadmap-yet">Does ARC Raiders Have A 2026 Roadmap Yet?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Hang fire for now. Credit to Embark Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>At the time of writing, Embark Studios hasn’t revealed the ARC Raiders 2026 Roadmap yet.</strong></p>



<p>It’s January 8, and Embark Studios is either still feeling the come-down of the holidays (who isn’t?) or reluctant to commit to a 2026 roadmap just yet. There’s always the daunting reality that there might not be a roadmap at all, but it’s unlikely.</p>



<p>Embark has already committed to a 10-year development cycle for ARC. You don’t claim this unless you’re cooking up some serious stuff. Thanks to some digging, a couple of details about the 2026 roadmap content have already been discovered.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming will update this once the roadmap is live, per its tracker status.</p>



<h2 id="h-2026-arc-raiders-roadmap-changes">2026 ARC Raiders Roadmap Changes</h2>



<p><strong>Initial ARC Raiders changes for 2026 include changes to the Trigger Nade, Kettle, and other weapons.</strong></p>



<p>On the ARC Raiders official <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1107589599045361695/1427256238651084895/1458832856120819724" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Discord</a> server, community manager ‘CM | Lily’ had this to say on January 2:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“The team’s looking into some changes to trigger nades.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Then, on January 6, community manager ‘CM | Birdie’ added some more details to the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1107589599045361695/1427256238651084895/1458217158160154704" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Discord</a> about upcoming changes in 2026:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Hey! The holidays delayed things a bit, but the dev team want you to know that they are looking into balance, for example, the stitcher, kettle, and trigger nade. Rest assured that we hear you and work on delivering a good gaming experience, things are just not immediate.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>These are minor details for now, but they show that the team is already working behind the scenes. A 2026 roadmap likely isn’t far off, and IG will let you know when it’s here.</p>
