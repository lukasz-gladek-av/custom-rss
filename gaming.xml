That’s the idea behind Retro Mod Works’ <a href="https://www.retromodworks.com/product-page/ps-placeable">PS Placeable</a>, a mod that “consolizes” the PSP and was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMQ-yDYdgks">featured yesterday in a video</a> from the YouTube channel Macho Nacho Productions. </p><p>Retro Mod Works charges $274.99 for a prebuilt PS Placeable. Those are waitlisted at the moment, though — a message on the site says the project is a “one man show” and that the demand for the Placeable was higher than anticipated. </p><p>Retro also offers to mod customer-provided PSPs for $100 less, and there’s an option <a href="https://www.retromodworks.com/product-page/psp-bt-mod-kit">preorder DIY parts</a> and do the conversion work yourself. The mod requires either a PSP-2000 or PSP-3000 revision, as the first PSP didn’t have a video output. It’s not clear when the DIY parts will ship — we’ve asked Retro Mod Works and will update if we get a reply.</p><div><figcaption><em>A stack of PS Placeables.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Retro Mod Works</cite></p></div><p>The primary person behind the project, named Dan, told Macho Nacho host Tito Perez that he “hated the idea of buying digital games” for which he has physical copies, and wanted a way to add Bluetooth controller support while preserving the UMD drive. He’s also mentioned in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PSP/comments/1e3bw4a/what_should_we_name_this_the_play_station/lddy4me/">replies on Reddit</a> that his goal is to help people revive broken PSPs with the mod, which doesn’t need the console’s screen.</p><p>But buying one of these mod kits can be pricey or require skills most people don’t have. If you just want to play PSP games on your TV and don’t care about having a UMD drive, the PSP Go — which lacked Sony’s oddball optical drive but supported Bluetooth controllers and also had a way to output video — is still <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fsch%2Fi.html%3F_from%3DR40%26_trksid%3Dp4432023.m570.l1313%26_nkw%3DPSP%2BGo%26_sacat%3D0">pretty easy to come by</a>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Call of Duty has been one of the most popular franchises in gaming for quite some time now. The series has worked hard to release titles every year, making it one of the biggest franchises in the world. </p>



<p>Games like Modern Warfare 2, Black Ops and more have stolen the spotlight as some of the greatest games of all time. Here is a list of all Call of Duty games in order.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-every-call-of-duty-game-in-order">Every Call of Duty Game in Order</h2>



<p>Call of Duty has made its staple as one of the most consistent franchises of all time. The series has been releasing a new game every year, with them only recently announcing they were switching to releasing a game every other year. </p>



<p>Still, with a new game every other year, Call of Duty continues to keep fans excited, and even pull back old players. Their constant remaking of famous maps and continuous storylines (Modern Warfare series, Black Ops series and more) has also grabbed the attention of players. </p>



<p>So, when <strong>was </strong>every Call of Duty game released?</p>



<figure></figure>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/highest-earning-call-of-duty-players-of-all-time/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Call of Duty is one of the most exciting esports titles on the market, offering fans a dense schedule packed with entertainment for around eight months of the calendar year. From Warzone to the traditional multiplayer offering of Modern Warfare or Black Ops, there’s a diverse spectrum out there that millions of fans worldwide can appreciate.</p>



<p>In this guide, I’m breaking down the highest-earning Call of Duty pro players of all time. There are thousands of competitors out there, but which among them have earned the most money during their careers?</p>



<p>Read on to learn which Call of Duty players have won the most money.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-cod-players-ranked-by-earnings">COD Players Ranked by Earnings</h2>



<p>Most of these players are still actively competing, so expect their earnings to change over time.</p>



<h3 id="h-10-dylan-envoy-hannon-984-000">10. Dylan ‘Envoy’ Hannon – $984,000</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Envoy won COD Champs in 2022 while playing for the LA Thieves, which is where the bulk of his winnings came from.</p>



<h3 id="h-9-seth-scump-abner-992-000">9. Seth ‘Scump’ Abner – $992,000</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Scump is arguably the most iconic (retired) competitor in the Call of Duty esports scene. In 2017, he won the Call of Duty Championship.</p>



<h3 id="h-8-anthony-shotzzy-cuevas-castro-1-03-million">8. Anthony ‘Shotzzy’ Cuevas-Castro – $1.03 million</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Shotzzy is one of the best and most capable COD players in the world. He’s a two-time world champion <strong>and </strong>a world champion in Halo.</p>



<h3 id="h-7-james-clayster-eubanks-1-15-million">7. James ‘Clayster’ Eubanks – $1.15 million</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Clayster was, when he retired, the most veteran competitor still playing in the COD League. He’s one of the few three-time Call of Duty world champions.</p>



<h3 id="h-6-kenneth-kenny-williams-1-19-million">6. Kenneth ‘Kenny’ Williams – $1.19 million</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Kenny is a two-time world champion, having secured the trophy in both 2022 and 2024. </p>



<h3 id="h-5-ian-crimsix-porter-1-32-million">5. Ian ‘Crimsix’ Porter – $1.32 million</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Crimsix is the winningest competitor in COD history, having won more tournaments than anyone other player. Before retiring, he’d claimed three world championship titles.</p>



<h3 id="h-4-alec-arcitys-sanderson-1-39-million">4. Alec ‘Arcitys’ Sanderson – $1.39 million</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Arcitys is no longer in the Call of Duty League, but he has claimed two world championships in almost a decade of active competition, along with many chips.</p>



<h3 id="h-3-mcarthur-cellium-jovel-1-53-million">3. McArthur ‘Cellium’ Jovel – $1.53 million</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Cellium has represented Atlanta FaZe for years and is often considered one of the best players in COD esports. He secured his first world championship in 2021 and also won the first Esports World Cup in Call of Duty.</p>



<h3 id="h-2-chris-simp-lehr-1-77-million">2. Chris ‘Simp’ Lehr – $1.77 million</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Simp is a phenomenal player with two world championship wins under his belt at just 23 years of age. He also won the Esports World Cup in Call of Duty in 2024 alongside Cellium and aBeZy.</p>



<h3 id="h-1-tyler-abezy-pharris-1-78-million">1. Tyler ‘aBeZy’ Pharris – $1.78 million</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Tyler ‘aBeZy’ Pharris is the highest-earning Call of duty player ever, but it’s close. He has won two world titles and secured the top spot at the Esports World Cup in 2024 in Saudi Arabia.</p>

<p>"Ciara Berkeley was cast as Ciri for The Witcher 4 cinematic reveal trailer," the studio said in a statement to <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/the-witcher-4-ciri-voice-actor-jo-wyatt-recast-rumours/">TheGamer</a>.</p>
<p>"Ciara is a talented actress who impressed us with her enthusiasm and vocal acting skills, and in this trailer we believe she truly brought Ciri to life in a way that is both faithful to the character and exciting for fans of the series."</p>
<p>The studio did not expand on why Berkeley had been brought in to replace Wyatt, but did confirm to press that Berkeley wasn't only brought in for the trailer, but will portray Ciri in the full game, too.</p>
<p>No, your ears were not deceiving you about Geralt, either. T<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/geralt-of-town-that-was-definitely-doug-cockles-white-haired-monster-hunter-in-the-witcher-4s-reveal-trailer">hat was definitely Geralt voice actor Doug Cockle</a> popping up at the end of the Witcher 4's reveal trailer, and yes, the white-haired monster hunter will absolutely feature in some way in the upcoming game.</p>
<p>While many had assumed as much - let's be honest, it is hard to miss the gravelling tones of Cockle's Geralt - developer CD Projekt has now officially confirmed what we all thought.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

That’s excellent news for us JRPG sickos, but that demo might give you delusions that all the bosses are just random collections of minions. That is quickly dispelled when you hit the game’s first <em>real </em>challenge. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/metaphor-refantazio-zorba-boss-how-to-beat-1851672980&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/metaphor-refantazio-zorba-boss-how-to-beat-1851672980">Read More</a></span></p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/metaphor-refantazio&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/metaphor-refantazio">You can find all our <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> coverage here</a></span></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7ee0223cb7d07cb1e5c37490d4dcc463" data-recommend-id="image://7ee0223cb7d07cb1e5c37490d4dcc463" data-format="jpg" data-width="1315" data-height="740" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Senua looks past the camera with her face half-submerged in water." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Senua looks past the camera with her face half-submerged in water." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ninja Theory / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7ee0223cb7d07cb1e5c37490d4dcc463" data-recommend-id="image://7ee0223cb7d07cb1e5c37490d4dcc463" data-format="jpg" data-width="1315" data-height="740" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Senua looks past the camera with her face half-submerged in water." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>  <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/senua-saga-hellblade-2-sacrifice-review-xbox-pc-1851489149&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/senua-saga-hellblade-2-sacrifice-review-xbox-pc-1851489149"><em>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II</em></a></span>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ninja-theory-hellblade-new-game-greenlit-microsoft-1851490677&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ninja-theory-hellblade-new-game-greenlit-microsoft-1851490677">Ninja Theory’s</a></span> latest narrative action-adventure game, arrived on May 21, 2024 for Xbox and PC.

<p>Danil ‘donk’ Kryshkovets is a name that everyone following Counter-Strike esports should be familiar with. This year, the superstar prodigy has marked himself as one of the most talented individuals to watch going forward, and after winning the Perfect World Shanghai Major, he has cemented himself as a record holder.</p>



<p>He’s the youngest Counter-Strike player to win a Major, the youngest to be named HLTV MVP, and he’s tied first for some of the highest ratings in competitive CS history. Coming out of the Team Spirit Academy and moving into the first team, he has racked up more prize money in <strong>one year </strong>than most pro players will make in ten.</p>



<p>Is there anything donk can’t do?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-donk-donk-donk-donk">donk, donk, donk, donk</h2>



<p>With all the makings of a game-wide GOAT, donk has managed to make a solid name for himself in a matter of months. Last year, he made his way into Team Spirit’s starting lineup in CS:GO, and then underwent the transition that everyone else made, moving over to CS2.</p>



<p>Since then, donk has <strong>exploded</strong>.</p>



<p>He just won the Shanghai Major, becoming the youngest CS player in history to net the achievement, and he was named MVP of the event, which is his <strong>fifth </strong>this year at a ‘big’ event. He was previously named MVP at IEM Katowice, a legendary event that kickstarted months of success for donk – and the rest of Team Spirit.</p>



<p>Few players have managed to secure more MVP awards in a single year – the likes of s1mple, ZywOo, and device come to mind.</p>



<p>As the Shanghai Major unfolded, donk racked up <strong>four </strong>aces, one of which was secured in the grand final against FaZe Clan – which was yet another record picked up by the 17-year-old competitor. </p>











<p>That move was preceded in the group stage of the Shanghai Major by a stunning 1v5 against Heroic. Later on in the tournament, Heroic would be sent home by G2 Esports.</p>



<p>All in all, this has been a <strong>stunning </strong>rookie year for donk, who has pieced together almost half a million dollars in earnings thus far. </p>



<p>What’s even more amazing is how humble donk has been through all this. Earlier this year, he <a href="https://blast.tv/article/spirit-donk-blast-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">spoke to BLAST</a> and said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’ve won some big trophies in my first season. We’ve shown good results but we should also do better and keep our routine to work harder. </p>



<p>I’m not very consistent yet. I need to find my key to playing consistently, and I’m trying to do that right now.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>When asked if he sees himself as one of the top three players in the world, he said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I don’t think I am, no.</p>



<p>It’s m0NESY, ZywOo, and sh1ro.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>With donk, the sky is the limit, and there are high expectations that he’ll become one of the greatest esports competitors of all time.</p>

<p>It has been claimed that LEGO Horizon Adventures could soon be coming to Xbox in a bid to make the game a commercial success.</p>



<p>That’s according to Arab media outlet <a href="https://justplayit.info/news/sony-game-coming-to-xbox-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">justplayit</a>, who claim that their sources have said that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-horizon-adventures-trophies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LEGO Horizon Adventures</a> will be coming to Xbox in the coming months.</p>



<p>While the outlet did not give a specific date, they said it’s likely to come in the first months of 2025 “at most” and even went as far as to speculate that it could be sooner.</p>



<p>The move comes as the console exclusivity strategy between platforms has shifted in the past few years. PlayStation has seen tremendous success in bringing some of its titles to PC, whereas Xbox has decided to bring the majority of its exclusives over to PlayStation.</p>



<p>WindowCentral’s Jez Corden even recently said that console exclusive titles on Xbox “is over” in a <a href="https://x.com/JezCorden/status/1867407921199362372" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">recent tweet</a>. PlayStation bringing Lego Horizon Adventures to Xbox could mark a change in its console strategy, too, with PlayStation seemingly testing the waters on a multiplatform release (although the game is already on Nintendo Switch and PC).</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Sony/PlayStation for comments, and if we receive a comment, we will update this article.</p>

<p>Konami's horror game also won Best Survival Horror, Best Soundtrack, and awarded James Sunderland mocap and voice actor, Luke Roberts, Best Performance in the third annual horror game showcase, but did lose out in several other categories it was nominated for given the glut of brilliant horror games we've seen this year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/xbox-exclusives-are-gone-for-good-says-jez-corden/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Xbox fans were certainly surprised to see from <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-outer-worlds-2-gameplay-showcased-at-the-game-awards-releases-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Game Awards 2024 trailer</a> that Obsidian's The Outer Worlds 2 was confirmed to launch immediately on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. There's been a lot of conflicting talk about the multiplatform strategy, with Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-red-line-porting-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stating </a>that there are no red lines when it comes to ports to other consoles, only for President of Content and Studios Matt Booty to <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-executive-says-exclusivity-will-be-considered-on-a-case-by-case-basis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">say</a> a few days ago it would be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Even Obsidian's 2025 games show that inner conflict, with Avowed only currently announced for PC and Xbox Series S|X.</p>
<p>However, Windows Central's Jez Corden confidently <a href="https://x.com/JezCorden/status/1867638349760196645" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweeted on X</a> that real exclusives for Microsoft's console exclusives are essentially gone for good in the company's plans.</p>
<p><em>Xbox won't have exclusives going forward. Everything is timed exclusive at most. If some games are exclusive it's gonna be incidental at best, the "case by case" argument is by and large going to be multiplatform, timed, and with maybe a few (very few) outliers.</em></p>
<p>When asked about the exclusivity status of Playground's Fable (which is scheduled to launch sometime next year), he replied:</p>
<p><em>That game was monstrously expensive. It might not be day one, but it'll come with the current plan in place, in my opinion.</em></p>
<p>Where does that leave Xbox hardware, though? Corden believes it won't be shut down...Unless it <a href="https://wccftech.com/activision-boosts-microsot-q3-gaming-revenue-xbox-consoles-sales-collapse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">continues to shrink</a> as it has over the past few quarters. In that case, all bets are off.</p>
<p><em>I don't think they'll stop providing hardware as long as the users and revenue are there. But growth is the issue. Without finding growth elsewhere, the shareholders won't accept it, especially with the 70 billion ABK scrutiny.</em></p>
<p><em>Don't think they'll shut it down. It'll just be flat. When you're a giant company with trillions in market cap, flat isn't viable. They need to grow beyond console for that, but maintaining what they have will power that effort. </em><em>If... it doesn't shrink. And it may well.</em></p>
<p>So far, out of the five Xbox exclusives announced for next year, only The Outer Worlds 2 and <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-revealed-release-date-xbox-games-showcase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DOOM: The Dark Ages</a> are already confirmed to launch on PlayStation 5, too. However, the likelihood of Fable, South of Midnight, and Avowed getting there is pretty high.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/atl-faze-roster-comes-under-fire-following-landmark-cdl-loss.1061925/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/atl-faze-roster-under-fire-cdl-loss/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>For the first time in 587 days, Atlanta FaZe has been dealt a 0 – 3 loss in the qualifying stage of a CDL Major. This loss came at the hands of a dominant Carolina Royal Ravens side, which succeeded in trapping FaZe in the hundred-point club during the opening Hardpoint, and it all went downhill from there.</p>



<p>Atlanta FaZe is now 0 – 3 in the qualifiers and has failed to secure a single CDL Point since the 2025 season kicked off. Typically, Atlanta FaZe is the single-most successful team on the board in the regular season, but right now, they’re on par with the Vegas Falcons.</p>



<p>Is it time for a roster change?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-paradigm-shift">Paradigm Shift</h2>



<p>Since the Call of Duty League became a thing in 2020, Atlanta FaZe has been a stalwart force in the scene. The squad, comprised of Simp, aBeZy, Cellium, and <strong>someone else</strong> (Drazah since last season), has been a team to be reckoned with for the longest time, but this season has started with such a sour mood that questions are now being asked.</p>



<p>In the Cold War season, Atlanta peaked, winning three Major tournaments and the CDL Championship. In the year that followed, the squad didn’t secure a single victory, and when Modern Warfare II arrived, only one Major win was lined up for the team.</p>



<p>This year, FaZe made history by winning the first Esports World Cup in the Call of Duty MP category, but coming in off that win has meant little for the squad, starting this CDL 2025 season with three heavy losses.</p>











<p>In a historic loss, Atlanta FaZe fell to the Royal Ravens. The opening Hardpoint set the tone for the series, with FaZe losing P2 on 42 points and securing just 88 points by the time the match had ended. Between the second rotation from P1 to P4, the team picked up just 24 points, counting themselves lucky to even find the final scraps on the hills.</p>



<p>Do you think a change is needed, or do Atlanta FaZe just need to find their fit in Black Ops 6?</p>

		<p>Dead of Darkness is a new 2D survival horror that is looking to kick off 2025 with some fear. Developer Retrofiction Games has announced that its take on the horror genre will be released on January 23rd, and it is coming to PC via Steam. You will see from the trailer that Dead of Darkness features lots of different horror elements including body horror, jump scares, and a creepy child.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dead of Darkness - Release Date Trailer (2D Survival Horror Action Adventure in Pixel Art)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mgkquIEORjM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Dead of Darkness is set on the fictional English island known as Velvet Island, and the year is 1985. The main character is private investigator Miles Windham, who has travelled to the island to find out why his sister died there. On its facade, the institution on Velvel Island is a hospital, but strip away that layer and it is a place of horror not healing. Much of the game will be based around puzzle solving, though there will be combat too in a bid to escape from various enemies and creatures. Some enemies will continue to pursue you so you will have to get away from them, and watch out. There are 15 characters that are on Velvet Island that have their own stories to tell too. Resource management will be a key focus in Dead of Darkness as there are not many items that will be available to help, so every encounter has to be planned for. Miles’ mental state will also have a toll taken on it, the more powerful the hallucinations he will experience. As a investigator, Miles will need to piece together clues found around Velvet Island to discover its secrets, and work out what happened to his sister.</p>
<p>Dead of Darkness is available to wishlist and you can grab a demo through the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2157210/Dead_of_Darkness/">Dead of Darkness Steam</a> page.</p>

<p>The Game Awards 2024 was raised in celebration of the tenth anniversary of the showcase. It was an ambitious event all around, and many viewers rated it higher than any iteration in history. Collectively, we saw dozens of awards handed out (which not everyone agreed with, admittedly) and many games either revealed or updated with new trailers.</p>



<p>It has been revealed in data collected by Streams Charts that this year’s The Game Awards was the most-watched edition ever, topping more than <strong>four million </strong>concurrent viewers. The growth was aided by co-streamers and watch parties, which are fast becoming some of the most entertaining ways to watch streams online.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-bigger-than-ever">Bigger Than Ever</h2>



<p>The Game Awards played host to some massive announcements and trailers, such as The Witcher 4, Naughty Dog’s new game, a new Virtua Fighter, and Mafia: The Old Country.</p>



<p>It was potentially the most electric edition of The Game Awards we’ve ever seen, and Geoff Keighley’s team spared no expense in piecing together an all-singing, all-dancing event featuring a star-studded lineup of guests.</p>



<p>In a report published <a href="https://streamscharts.com/news/game-awards-2024-recap" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">by Streams Charts</a>, it was revealed that The Game Awards (across top channels) racked up a combined peak concurrent viewership of 4,003,578 users. It had a total watched hours count of 15,267,555, and 1,498 channels were logged broadcasting the event in some way.</p>



<p>In total, The Game Awards was on air for just south of five hours, and while the top channels for the broadcast were the official ones, the likes of IGN, Asmongold, and Moist Cr1TiKaL pulled in massive audiences while reacting to the showcase.</p>



<p>How did you rate this year’s The Game Awards? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>On November 12, Activision revealed the full line-up of CDL skins, but fans worldwide are <strong>still waiting </strong>for them to be delivered in Black Ops 6. While this year’s CDL skins aren’t as gaudy or ‘interesting’ as they have been in recent years, fans are still eager to represent their favourite CDL teams in Black Ops 6.</p>



<p>With that being said, when <strong>are </strong>the CDL skins coming to Black Ops 6, and how much will they cost when they arrive?</p>



<p>Read on to find out what we know.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-cdl-skins-release-date-in-black-ops-6">CDL Skins Release Date in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>It hasn’t been confirmed by Activision when the CDL skins will be released in Black Ops 6.</p>



<p>If we use last season’s release schedule as a representative example, we can determine that it might still be a couple of weeks until they arrive.</p>



<p>Last season, the action commenced on December 8, 2023, and the MWIII CDL skins were released on January 8, 2024. </p>



<p>The current season started on December 6, so it could be the first week of January that the team skins arrive once again. It was mentioned that it would be ‘later in season one’ that the CDL skins would drop, and that’s more or less where we are now that the ‘Season One Reloaded’ update has arrived.</p>



<p>If you’re holding out to know when the CDL skins are coming to Black Ops 6, take note – it could be another few weeks.</p>



<p>Which skin will you be purchasing once they’ve dropped? There isn’t much variation between the various CDL skins this year, but it’s still nice to see the teams represented, and of course, the organisations benefit from the sale of the skins.</p>



<p>On that note, how much do the CDL skins cost?</p>



<p>Typically, a CDL skin pack – which comes with the base skin, weapon camos, stickers, emblems, and calling cards, retails in the COD store for around $11.99. They can’t be purchased with COD Points – only real-world money.</p>



<p>Let us know which team you’re representing in Black Ops 6 when the CDL skin packs drop.</p>

<p>TSM has announced the benching or dismissal of its Danish Counter-Strike 2 roster ahead of the 2025 season. In a post on social media, the organisation revealed an intention to ‘evaluate roster moves’ before the next year of competitive events kicks off.</p>



<p>To that end, Valde, niko, and Rejin (coach) have all been let go, while sirah, acoR, and Zyphon have been benched pending further decisions. The players aren’t sitting around and waiting, though – acoR has already taken to socials to announce his decision to seek a new team.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-it-is-what-it-is">‘It Is What It Is’</h2>



<p>Speaking on social media about the sudden decision, Frederik ‘acoR’ Gyldstrand wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We didn’t get the players that were planned when I joined the team which did make the start feel weird.</p>



<p>We had a decent period i nthe start, we managed to make the RMR with no time to practice.</p>



<p>After the benching of Altekz it took a long time to get back on track with sirah. Though it did feel like we were getting back on track in the end, but <strong>it is what it is</strong>.</p>



<p>I am looking for a new team.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It was just a few days ago that TSM brought to an end the all-female CS2 team, TSM Impact. However, it’s worth stressing that this is a different scenario, as TSM intends to stay in the CS2 scene with a male team, but it’s not yet known what that squad will look like when the 2025 season opens up.</p>



<p>On social media, <a href="https://x.com/tsmreport/status/1867990639188791782" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TSM simply wrote</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Today we part ways with Valde, niko, and a CS Head Coach Rejin. We would like to thank them for their hard work throughout the year, and wish them all the best going forward.</p>



<p>We have also opted to bench sirah acoR, and Zyphon while we evaluate our next roster moves ahead of the 2025 season.</p>
</blockquote>

        <p>"We wish we could provide a release date, but we would rather wait until we're certain."</p>

    </div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/greedfall">Greedfall</a> 2 developer Spiders is taking the end of the year as an opportunity to "reflect on our journey so far" and said it is "committed to building a great game alongside [the community] and listening to your invaluable feedback".</p>
<p>In an update posted to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1997660/view/554602728738784050">Steam</a>, Spiders said "a lot has happened since the start of Early Access", but the team is "thrilled" about progress to date, despite it being a challenging experience that has seen Update 0.2 delayed with still no firm release date.</p>

<p>"[The decision to delay Update 0.2] allows us to focus on implementing significant improvements and fixes based on your feedback," the team said. "These include the combat system - which is as important to you as it is to us - the UI, character customisation, optimisation, and many other aspects."</p>
<p>This means Update 0.2 will not introduce a slew of changes, but instead the improvements will be "implemented gradually" over time.</p>
<p>"We wish we could provide a release date, but we would rather wait until we're certain," the team added. "What we can promise is that our priority remains delivering a game that meets your expectations and takes your feedback into account."</p><p>The update also explained that Spiders was working behind the scenes to address issues with Alivda's voice lines, and whilst the original voice actor was unable to reprise the role, it was working with a new artist to get the lines re-recorded and switched in "the next update".</p>
<p>"Ensuring your voices shape this journey has always been the goal of Early Access," the update concluded.</p>
<p>Shortly after Greedfall 2 released in early access on Steam, the Greedfall team <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/greedfall-2-is-addressing-two-important-subjects-combat-and-character-customisation">said the early access launch had been "exciting", but acknowledged improvements were needed</a>, including improving the drop rate, adjusting AI behaviours, and making dialogue scenes "less blurry".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/m0nesy-g2-eliminated-faze-shanghai/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/%E2%80%98forgive-me%E2%80%99-m0nesy-to-fans-as-g2-is-eliminated-from-shanghai-major.1061769/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/m0nesy-g2-eliminated-faze-shanghai/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>G2 Esports has officially been eliminated by FaZe Clan at the Perfect World Shanghai Major. Tomorrow, FaZe Clan will face off against a dominant Team Spirit, and it could be a day that makes history, with $500,000 sitting on the line for the grand victor.</p>



<p>It has been a whirlwind tournament thus far, and many competitors have gone home with their heads hung in disappointment. One player who felt the blow this weekend was G2’s Ilya ‘m0NESY’ Osipov, who parted ways with a message of sore emotions following his loss.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-faze-clan-vs-spirit-for-it-all">FaZe Clan vs. Spirit For It All</h2>



<p>FaZe Clan wiped out G2 with a 2 – 0 win in Shanghai to qualify for the grand final against Team Spirit.</p>



<p>It was a wash on the first map, but G2 showed up a little tighter in the second round – but it wasn’t enough, unfortunately. In a slick finish, FaZe Clan’s Robin ‘ropz’ Kool came out to play, racking up 50 kills across the two maps and cementing himself as one to watch in the grand final.</p>



<p>M0NESY took it hard, though, taking to social media to write:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I can’t find the words to describe my feelings. I’m very angry with myself, forgive me for my terrible performance this month. This is the end and the beginning of something new.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Everyone wants to see if Team Spirit’s donk will have what it takes to achieve the incredible and win a CS2 Major during his rookie season. It has been a phenomenal year for the young star thus far, and securing the top spot in Shanghai would be a fantastic way to close out 2024.</p>



<p>He’s not alone in those aspirations, though. On FaZe Clan’s side, David ‘frozen’ Čerňanský is also seeking his first Major win.</p>



<p>FaZe Clan might be coming in hot off a win, but this year has been a tough one for the squad against Team Spirit. In terms of head-to-head, Team Spirit has managed to overcome FaZe Clan three times in the last 12 months.</p>



<p>If I was a betting man, my money would be on Team Spirit to secure the Major win.</p>
