			<p><strong>Isabela Merced</strong>, who you'll recognize <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-season-2-finale-sees-big-decline-over-season-1/">as <strong>Dina</strong> from <strong>HBO's The Last of Us</strong></a> and <strong>Hawkgirl</strong> in <strong>James Gunn's</strong> recent <strong>Superman</strong> film, has been chosen to star in <strong>SEGA's</strong> upcoming film adaptation of its classic zombie franchise, <strong>The House of the Dead</strong>.</p>



<p>Confirmed in a report from <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/02/isabela-merced-house-of-the-dead-film-adaptation-last-of-us-1236711085/">Deadline</a>, Merced will lead the adaptation, which is set to be written and directed by <strong>Paul W.S. Anderson</strong>, who is right at home in a gore-filled zombie world, as he's arguably most known for directing the <strong>Resident Evil</strong> films that star <strong>Milla Jovovich</strong> (who also happens to be his wife).</p>



<p>The report adds that SEGA sees the adaptation as "<em><strong>a top SEGA priority</strong></em>" and that the company wants to make it a successful and immersive franchise similar to the success of the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/sonic-the-hedgehog-2-movie-becomes-top-grossing-game-adaptation-of-all-time-at-the-box-office/">Sonic the Hedgehog</a></strong> movies, while making it a "<em><strong>fresh take</strong></em>" on the franchise.</p>



<p>"<em>The House of the Dead is a game I have loved for many years</em>," said Anderson, "<em>and I'm beyond thrilled to be bringing this to the big screen with an exciting talent as Isabela at its heart. We envisage this as the start of a tentpole franchise which can explore the rich world and lore that SEGA has created over a whole series of films</em>."</p>



<p>SEGA executive and producer <strong>Toru Nakahara</strong> added, "<em>Working with Isabela is a thrilling opportunity as she embodies the heroine character perfectly,</em> <em>bringing dynamic energy to the production. We're dedicated to crafting a visually striking and immersive experience by introducing compelling actors and terrifying creatures that will bring the House of the Dead universe to life on the big screen. With our deep understanding of video game adaptations, we're eager to deliver an electrifying cinematic journey for the franchise's fans</em>."</p>



<p><strong>Story Kitchen</strong>, a production company that'll also be working on the film that's already got its hands in other video game to film/TV adaptations, namely <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/my-lara-croft-is-not-a-sex-bombshell-says-sophie-turner/">Amazon's upcoming Tomb Raider show</a></strong>, added, "<em>We're thrilled to bring together Isabela, Paul, Jeremy, and SEGA, alongside our partners at Rocket Science and CAA Media Finance. It's a powerhouse group coming together for a truly iconic property</em>."</p>



<p>With this production still seemingly in early stages of its development, it'll be a while before we see Merced take center stage here. In the meantime, it seems like her schedule might open up sooner than later for it, if <a href="https://wccftech.com/hbos-the-last-of-us-may-wrap-up-in-three-seasons-not-four-it-certainly-seems-that-way-says-hbo-boss/">HBO boss <strong>Casey Bloys</strong> is correct about his estimate on how many more seasons The Last of Us will get.</a></p>



<p>The last time we saw anything from The House of the Dead was <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-house-of-the-dead-remake-is-coming-to-pc-playstation-xbox-and-stadia-on-april-28/">a remake that arrived back in 2022</a></strong>. If this film adaptation finds the success that SEGA and company hope it does, we may be in for a new generation of games to go along with the films.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>What if I told you a game of <em>Call of Cthulhu</em> didn’t have to take place in 1920s New England? What if it could, for example, take place in the neon-soaked world of 1980s Japan? Sounds pretty rad, right? Well dreams come true (whether we want them to or not)! I previously reviewed the fabulous <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/call-of-cthulhu-arkham-review-supplemental-strangeness" rel="nofollow"><em>Call of Cthulhu: Arkham</em></a>, and was thrilled to receive a review copy of the brand-new adventure module <a href="https://www.chaosium.com/call-of-cthulhu-the-sutra-of-pale-leaves-twin-suns-rising-hardcover/?srsltid=AfmBOorE18GDqZ_l9nqFt_Xb8c97pIqO4m82Rcwi7SXQzF1c0TIWPPKo" rel="nofollow"><em>The Sutra of Pale Leaves - Twin Suns Rising</em></a> from Chaosium.</p><p><em>Call of Cthulhu: The Sutra of Pale Leaves - Twin Suns Rising</em> is the first of two supplemental books for <em>Call of Cthulhu</em> set in 1980s Japan. Consisting of three standalone adventures (which can also each be strung together for a longer narrative), the game sees players tracking down The Sutra of Pale Leaves, a strange religious scripture with otherworldly origins.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>The book begins with a very detailed look into 1980s Japan, describing in general details the culture, how society reacted to an economic bubble, and close-up views of various aspects of daily life. Like all books in Chaosium’s <em>Call of Cthulhu</em> line, it feels well-researched, inviting you into a world that feels real and tangible (before things get extremely unreal and intangible, of course).</p><p>From there, readers will find valuable information about key characters, an overview of the plot, and rules for tracking a very specific and secret status effect throughout the campaign.</p><p><strong>WARNING: </strong>If you’re interested in <em>playing</em> this game vs. <em>running</em> this game as a keeper, I suggest you turn back now. I can’t talk about the book without spoiling at least <em>some</em> of the mystery and surprise here! Okay, you’ve been warned, here we go!</p><picture>

  </picture><h2><strong>What’s Going On With This Sutra of Pale Leaves?</strong></h2><p>While the Sutra of Pale Leaves seems to be a very old, obtuse religious text, it’s actually a kind of memetic virus created by the Prince of Pale Leaves, better known to Mythos fans as The King in Yellow.&nbsp;</p><p>Trapped underground in his home world, he seeks to infect Earth with this mind-virus by exposing as many people as possible to the Sutra of Pale Leaves.</p><p>This is where our investigators come in, though they’ll have no idea at the start of the adventure that that’s what they’re up against.&nbsp;</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/call-of-cthulhu-the-sutra-of-pale-leaves-twin-suns-rising-cops-large.jpeg?itok=YhwO_3c2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1042" height="712">

  </picture><p>In fact, they could go an entire adventure (they call them Chapters in the book) without realizing the Sutra is actually a problem - such is the insidious nature of the Prince of Pale Leaves.</p><p>As the investigators explore 1980s Japan in the three included scenarios presented in this book (there’s another book in this setting with an additional four adventures also available called <a href="https://www.chaosium.com/call-of-cthulhu-the-sutra-of-pale-leaves-2-carcosa-manifest-hardcover/" rel="nofollow"><em>Carcosa Manifest</em></a>), they’ll slowly gain Exposure Points (which are kept secret from the investigators) by coming into contact with the Sutra.&nbsp;</p><p>As these points accumulate, they’ll become more and more under the sway of the Prince of Pale Leaves.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/call-of-cthulhu-the-sutra-of-pale-leaves-twin-suns-rising-tokyo-large.jpeg?itok=6u25ODEG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1280" height="762">

  </picture><p>This creates a wonderfully tense, running problem that the investigators may have little awareness of (especially at the start), and as they begin to realize the danger of coming into contact with the Sutra in all its forms, they’ll have to balance the necessity of interacting with the text against the perils of infecting their minds further with it.</p><h2><strong>What Adventures are included in </strong><em><strong>Call of Cthulhu: The Sutra of Pale Leaves - Twin Suns Rising</strong></em><strong>?</strong></h2><p>Included in <em>Call of Cthulhu: The Sutra of Pale Leaves - Twin Suns Rising </em>are three distinct adventures that can be played solo or chained together to form a longer campaign. I’ll speak briefly here about the flavor and general thrust of each one.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/call-of-cthulhu-the-sutra-of-pale-leaves-twin-suns-rising-baku-large.jpeg?itok=qkAG0t93 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="916" height="566">

  </picture><p>First up is <strong>Dream Eater</strong>, in this adventure the investigators are called to a small town outside of Tokyo to help uncover the root cause of bad dreams plaguing the town. As they uncover more, they’ll learn that a Baku (a Japanese supernatural creature known for devouring dreams) is feeding on nightmares caused by exposure to the Sutra.</p><p>This Baku’s presence threatens the Prince of Pale Leaves, as he doesn’t want his nightmares gobbled up - and so the investigators, who have little foreknowledge of any of the goings on with the Sutra (especially if this adventure is played first), may unwittingly end up helping <em>defeat</em> the Baku! Starting slow without thrusting the players into the rush of big city Tokyo, this adventure is great when it serves as the first one played in a longer campaign.</p><p>Next up is <strong>Fan Fiction</strong>, where a talented indie manga artist has turned the Sutra into a manga to increase its viral appeal. Knowing that the Sutra as a sacred religious text won’t reach the masses, this new approach is sure to spread its influence.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/call-of-cthulhu-the-sutra-of-pale-leaves-twin-suns-rising-manga-large.jpeg?itok=XfCZJd0J 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="942" height="640">

  </picture><p>But when the adventure starts, the threat of this manga may not seem overtly apparent, as a twisted off-shoot and poorly made copy of the manga has been making the rounds, distorting the original viral code of the Sutra with disastrous consequences.</p><p>Third and final adventure in this book is <strong>The Pallid Masks of Tokyo</strong>, which begins with the ghastly discovery of a corpse in one of the nightlife districts of Tokyo. But there’s a catch… the body is completely faceless, with no eyes, nose, mouth, or ears!</p><p>This adventure will take investigators briefly through the seedy underbelly of Tokyo before plunging them into a psychiatric ward where machinations are in place to create an army of faceless servants for the Prince of Pale Leaves!</p><picture>

  </picture><h2><em><strong>Call of Cthulhu: The Sutra of Pale Leaves - Twin Suns Rising</strong></em><strong> - Final Thoughts</strong></h2><p><em>Call of Cthulhu: The Sutra of Pale Leaves - Twin Suns Rising</em> is, without a doubt, one of the most exciting run of adventures and settings in <em>Call of Cthulhu</em> I’ve read in a long time. The shift into 1980s Japan is a breath of fresh air, and I love how heady the overall conceit of the campaign feels.</p><p>This isn’t cultists trying to bring a big octopus monster out of the ocean in New England, it’s a dedicated conspiracy in Tokyo trying to blend power, indulgence, and religious and spiritual fanaticism together to virally infect the psyches of as many everyday people as possible. The threat is always immediate <em>and</em> looming, and it feels complicated and conflicted in a way we seldom see in <em>any</em> tabletop roleplaying game.</p><p>And while the scope, depth, and somewhat sandbox style of adventure writing here might feel daunting for new players, I cannot recommend this book enough to players familiar with <em>Call of Cthulhu</em>, or for experienced TTRPG players looking to dip their toes into the system, but aren’t interested in the Roaring ‘20s vibe of the core game.</p><hr><p><em>The copy of </em>Call of Cthulhu: The Sutra of Pale Leaves - Twin Suns Rising<em> used in the creation of this review was provided by Chaosium.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/mindseye-cyber-boi-youtuber-leak-lawsuit-2000666474</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Mark Gerhard, the co-CEO of </span><i><span>MindsEye </span></i><span>developer Build a Rocket Boy, has allegedly stated that a “very big American company” called Ritual Network, a YouTube and TikTok management agency which is actually based in the United Kingdom, is behind a more than $1 million campaign to continue smearing the critically panned 2025 open-world flop</span><span>.</span></p> <p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mindseye-ceo-alleges-1-million-sabotaging-its-game/"><i><span>Insider Gaming</span></i></a> reports that <span>Gerhard spoke about the alleged conspiracy </span><span>in an internal meeting with other Build a Rocket Boy staff. Per an </span><span>alleged recording of his remarks, Gerhard supposedly referred to Ritual Network as “a bunch of gangsters,” and also directly named YouTuber Cyber Boi as one of the “influencers” involved in the </span><i><span>MindsEye </span></i><span>smear campaign. </span></p>

 <p><span>Cyber Boi is the content creator who was recently threatened with a “formal cease and desist demand” by Gerhard, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mindseye-ceo-threatens-youtuber-after-epstein-video-2000665097"><span>via the </span><i><span>MindsEye </span></i><span>Discord server last week</span></a><span>, following the release of a now-deleted video about ex-Rockstar producer Leslie Benzies and the Epstein files (<a href="https://kotaku.com/leslie-benzies-epstein-allegation-gta-mindseye-2000665340">Benzies stated this week that he’s never met Epstein before</a>). </span><span><em>Kotaku</em> can confirm that an email address recently listed on Cyber Boi’s YouTube channel did belong to Ritual Network.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>However, Gerhard’s reported claim that Ritual Network is a “very big American company” appears to be false, as the company lists Scunthorpe, North Lincolnshire as its registered address. It seemingly employs fewer than 20 individuals. Also, Ritual Network’s publicly available tax returns state that its net current assets in February 2025, four months before <em>MindsEye</em>’s June 2025 release, were somewhere around £800,000, or roughly €920,000. That’s 80,000 shy of the 1 million euro sum reportedly alleged in the recording</span><span>.</span></p>

 <p><span>According to <em>Insider Gaming</em>, Gerhard stated during the internal meeting that Ritual Network and the content creators they allegedly paid “will all be served in person, criminal complaints, shortly,” for criminal charges including “espionage, sabotage, and criminal interference.” The purported video call also made mention of an “enhanced cybersecurity software” called Teramind, which had been installed on Build a Rocket Boy employees’ work systems without their prior knowledge.</span></p>

 <h2>Turning YouTuber drama into future <em>MindsEye</em> content</h2> <p><span>If true, that sounds an awful lot like the sort of futuristic, dystopian side plot that could be featured within the narrative of </span><i><span>MindsEye</span></i><span>.&nbsp;</span><span>Funnily enough, Gerhard also apparently stated that he wishes to use the names of those associated with Ritual Network in a <em>MindsEye</em> mission in the future. “Given this has happened to us, I’m gonna own this narrative,” he reportedly said. “We will use these people, these names and these facts for our own fun. We’re gonna put some of these names into our upcoming spy mission.” </span></p> <p><span>In an official statement to </span><i><span>Insider Gaming</span></i><span>, Ritual Network stated that they are “not involved in the matter” and that they are also unaware of “any legitimate legal action involving Ritual Network and have not been provided with any evidence supporting these claims.”</span></p>

 <p>Build a Rocket Boy isn’t backing down from its allegations, however. “Sadly, we do have evidence that there has been a coordinated campaign to purposefully and maliciously damage Build A Rocket Boy’s reputation and undermine confidence in <em>MindsEye</em>,” a spokesperson for the studio told&nbsp;<em>Kotaku</em>. “We are working with our legal team and taking steps to address this.”</p> <p>Build a Rocket Boy is ostensibly in the middle of trying to reboot the failed 2025 blockbuster. <span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mindseye-reboot-update-7-leslie-benzies-2000666008">A surprise February 4 update</a> was pitched as part of</span><span> “a reset for the brand and the title” which will kick off the beginning of a “new era” for <em>MindsEye</em>. The shooter still has a less-than-50-percent positive rating on Steam and, at the time of this writing, only 40 concurrent players in the game.&nbsp;</span></p>

      <p>The PS1 was an unrivaled time for soundtracks that go incredibly hard. Games like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurhMeaUThM&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Ridge Racer Type 4</u></em></a>,&nbsp; <a href="https://youtu.be/CuOd_mTABn8?si=plEy7cxdS7K60IZX&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>No One Can Stop Mr. Domino</u></em></a>, <em>Ape Escape</em> (and basically anything that Soichi Terada ever did), <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S5ZpFWA16g&amp;list=PLDD61C76EF278E530&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Ace Combat 3 Electrosphere</u></em></a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9avhp8QuAlk&amp;list=PLF8A81FAC049FB959&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Ghost in the Shell: Megatech Body</u></em></a> all punch well above their weight. Hell, even the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/seanseanson.bsky.social/post/3me56ggnr222z?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Animorphs</u></a> game kinda goes. In that vein, if you have never listened to the soundtrack to <em>Sheep, Dog 'n' Wolf </em>AKA<em> Looney Tunes Sheep Raider</em>, you should correct that right now because it contains at least one incredible heater.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wwidcxa3fmY?list=PL8D92393BACD4F09D" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><figcaption><p><span>Banger.</span></p></figcaption></figure><p><em>Sheep, Dog ‘n' Wolf </em>was a bizarre celshaded stealth action puzzler that came out in 2001 starring Ralph Wolf (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Wolf_and_Sam_Sheepdog?ref=aftermath.site"><u>NOT Wile E. Coyote</u></a>) and described at the time by Infogrames’ Director of Marketing as “E-Rated Metal Gear.” The soundtrack was done by a musician named Eric Caspar, and though a lot of it feels like boilerplate production music, it does have bangers.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Game Informer gave it a 7.25!

It is unclear what this track is called or if it has a name, although I have seen a few sites like KHInsider and Discogs cite it as “<a href="https://downloads.khinsider.com/game-soundtracks/album/sheep-dog-n-wolf-original-soundtrack?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Fronzy Last</u></a>/Fronzylast_v3.” The track itself appears in the Planet X stage later in the game, which you can see by watching this speedrun attempt.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4usCfvJrSJk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Sheep, Dog 'n' Wolf (Sheep Raider) — Any% Speedrun in 35:00 [Former World Record]"></iframe></figure><p>Anyway, enjoy this oddly specific track that keeps appearing in my YouTube suggested feed.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>An internal video seen by Tom Henderson of<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mindseye-ceo-alleges-1-million-sabotaging-its-game/"> Insider Gaming</a> is said to have shown&nbsp;Build a Rocket Boy CEO Mark Gerhard telling staff they had “caught the guys” who, he alleges, sabotaged the launch of MindsEye.</p>
<p>The meeting took place in January this year, during which Gerhard states that a “very big American company” is behind the plot, but “it’s probably not the company you’re thinking of.”</p>


<p>The campaign is alleged to have been run by Ritual Network, a UK based company, and they had been paying three unnamed journalists, several influencers and quite astoundingly, Build a Rocket Boy employees, all of whom worked to trash the game. Gerhard explain that they will all be served criminal complaints in person for &nbsp;“espionage, sabotage, and criminal interference.”</p>
<p>“Everyone who’s involved has real problems, including the company behind it. This is the start of our comeback,” he said. That comeback will, quite amazingly,&nbsp; include using the names of the alleged criminals in an upcoming spy mission for the game.</p>
<p>“Let’s have some fun with it,” said Gerhard.. “Let’s tell the community the story before it even plays out in court. So, you know, I think this is not us being the victim.”</p>

<p>Insider Gaming spoke to <a href="https://www.ritualnetwork.com/">Ritual Network</a> who gave this response.</p>
<blockquote><p>Ritual Network is a creator support platform and is not involved in the matter you referenced. We are not aware of any legitimate legal action involving Ritual Network and have not been provided with any evidence supporting these claims. Any suggestion that Ritual Network is connected to these allegations is incorrect.</p></blockquote>
<p>MindsEye was released without any review copies being made available. It has a score of <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/mindseye/critic-reviews/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">37/100 on Metacritic from 14 critics </a>reviews and <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/mindseye/user-reviews/">2.5/10</a> from user reviews, including 457 negative reviews.&nbsp; Those alleged influencers clearly earned their alleged money.</p>
<p>I played MindsEye on PS5 two months after release and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/08/what-we-played-battlefield-6-skycards-mindseye/">you can read my thoughts here.</a></p>

So we decided it’s time to figure out which mobile game you think is the best of all time with a March Madness–style bracket, presented by our friends at McDonald’s and their limited-time Hot Honey sauce, which will make your faves more perfect.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The bracket is made up of 32 entries divided into two categories. On one side are classics like Angry Birds, Fruit Ninja, Doodle Jump, and Candy Crush. On the other are modern hits like Genshin Impact, Balatro, Fortnite, and Roblox. But which game deserves to be crowned as the GOAT? Only you can tell us that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The bracket will pit games against each other 1v1, with the winner of each matchup moving on to the next round. All the matchups in each round will be done at the same time, with voting conducted through polls on the bottom of the page you’re currently on as well as <a href="https://www.instagram.com/stories/igndotcom/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>IGN’s Instagram stories</u></a>.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/zombie-survival-game-humnanitz-officially-launches-into-10-on-steam</link>
            <guid>1428496</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Isometric open-world zombie survival sandbox game HumanitZ first entered Steam Early Access in September 2023. In the more than two years since then, it’s gotten 18 major updates and countless patches. And now, it’s reached a new milestone: It’s out of Early Access, and Version 1.0 includes a visual and structural overhaul on top of all the previous improvements.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/05/press-hz3-1770330416664.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">HumanitZ takes place in a zombie-ravaged world with an emphasis on long-term progression and player choice. You can scavenge ruined cities, build bases, and try to outlast the zombies (known as Zeeks) and potentially other survivors (if you so choose). The whole game can be played solo, but there are also optional co-op, PvE, and PvP modes available on dedicated and player-hosted servers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s a variety of environments across the open world, including big city streets, suburbs, farms, and forests. And you can mold those environments to suit your needs and help you survive, with several options available to you.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">HumanitZ 1.0 Locations</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For example, you can raid a city, clear out the Zeeks, and claim an abandoned building to then turn into a fortified base using the building and crafting systems. Or you can stay away from the city and use farming, hunting, fishing, and foraging to create a self-sustaining homestead. Or you can constantly stay on the move, surviving off the resources you gather and never putting down roots.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These choices are all viable, but come with different levels of risk. Cities tend to be packed with necessary resources but are also crawling with Zeeks, leaving you with very little room for error. While building up your farmstead will see fewer Zeeks but runs the risk of sapping you of resources before it becomes self-sustaining. And you’ll never be able to completely avoid danger. Zombies and other hostile NPCs are constantly roaming the open world, so even if you choose to stay away from the city, you have to remain vigilant.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/05/press-hz1-1770330484497.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">This focus on player choice has always been at the core of HumanitZ, with extensive updates and fine-tuning during Early Access. Version 1.0 has continued to build on those ideas with a broad round of refinements, upgrades, and new content. The most obvious example is its graphical overhaul, with fully remastered maps, upgraded lighting, new character models, and updated environments.  There are also several gameplay improvements, including new skill trees, the ability to multiclass, more diverse zombie types, special ammo, new equipment, new vehicles, and countless other new additions.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/05/press-hz4-1770331040070.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">And while HumanitZ will always be an open-world sandbox, there are optional quests that can provide guidance to those of us who like a bit more structure. These quests will lead you to new areas (some of which were previously undiscoverable), where you can learn the lore behind the zombie outbreak and the horrors it’s inflicted. These quests won’t force you down a linear path, they’re just there to give you some guide rails if you want them, and they can be ignored or done at whatever pace you want.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can choose how hard the experience is, too. Difficulty can be tuned across everything from season length and day-night cycles to Zeek respawn rates, companion health and damage, airdrops, and dynamic AI events. You can also turn on permadeath, meaning that if you die once, your game is over and you’ll have to start over again from the beginning. And for you masochists out there, you can opt into the new afflictions that add a persistent debuff and long-term consequences on top of all those modifiers, cranking the difficulty up as far as you dare</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/05/press-hz2-1770330971672.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">And while Version 1.0 signals a major milestone in HumanitZ’s development, it’s far from the end. The dev team has made it clear that you can expect post-launch support, with patches and updates to add new content and address player feedback. You can find <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1766060/HumanitZ/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>HumanitZ on Steam</u></a> now, where you can also read the patch notes and see all the details of everything that was added and refined in the Version 1.0 release.

<p>It's only two months away</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Universal Pictures and Illumination have just dropped a brand new teaser for the upcoming <strong>Super Mario Galaxy Movie</strong>, which comes to cinemas across North America and Europe on 1st April 2026.</p>
<p>The Level Up teaser gives us another look at the mix of Mario worlds and inspirations, but there's a few more Galaxy nods in this trailer <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/super-mario-galaxy-movies-new-trailer-shares-a-first-look-at-yoshi">than the last</a>. Namely, you might notice Megaleg, an iconic boss from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/super_mario_galaxy">Super Mario Galaxy</a>.</p>
<p>Rosalina makes a brief appearance once again, while Bowser Jr. gets up to plenty of no good. Yoshi also gets plenty of time in the spotlight in the 19-second trailer, including the appearance of his trademark spotted eggs and that unique tongue of his.</p>
<p>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie is apparently going to get a commercial during this weekend's Super Bowl, so we'll probably be seeing more of Mario, Luigi, Peach, Yoshi, and co. pretty soon. So keep an eye out for that.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/drugs-magic-guns-and-the-egyptian-god-of-death-make-for-one-hell-of-a-great-game-2000666462</link>
            <guid>1428478</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A maze of hotel rooms stands in front of me. I have nothing but my sunglasses and my fists. I slide into the nearest door, slam a thug to the ground, take his baseball bat, and chuck it at another baddie on the other side of the seedy bedroom. Before the first thug can get back up, I execute him real fast, hop over the bed, and do the same to the other knocked-down enemy. This thrilling sequence happens in less than five seconds. Later, when I walk by the carnage on my way out, I see my partner in crime, Anubis, the Egyptian god of death, clad in a slick purple suit, weighing the souls of those dead losers. He’s a weirdo like that.</p> <p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3124230/Jackal/"><em>Jackal,</em> out now on Steam</a>, is a new top-down indie shooter that is clearly inspired by <a href="https://kotaku.com/what-hotline-miami-is-all-about-5955899"><em>Hotline Miami</em>‘s fast-paced one-shot-and-your-toast action</a>. But where <em>Hotline Miami</em> emulated the look of retro games,<em> Jackal</em> is a stylized 3D adventure that mixes realism with psychedelic art, Egyptian magic, lots of guns, and <em>Max Payne-</em>like noir voiceovers from the game’s coked-up “hero.”</p>

  <p>In <em>Jackal</em>, you have Anubis by your side. He’s a bit stoic and quick to criticize the main character, but does offer up spells that can be used during levels. These can stop time, blind enemies, or make you move really fast. Popping one of these during an ambush is a great way to get out of trouble, but you can only use a spell once during a mission, so knowing when to use it becomes part of the deadly puzzle-solving.</p> <p>Anubis and his magic aren’t the only strange parts of <em>Jackal</em>. It’s clear that this version of 1970s Las Vegas is oozing otherworldly vibes. The game’s cutscenes reinforce this with some truly trippy and wonderful uses of color, lighting, and sound. Of course, the main character is also fucked up on 20 different kinds of drugs and pills. So, how much of this is real and how much is in his rotting mind is an interesting question to ponder as you murder every gangster and cop in Vegas.</p>

 <h2>Yeah, Yeah, But What About The Killing?</h2> <p>As with any <em>Hotline Miami</em>-like game, what matters more than anything else is the movement and combat. Sure, the aesthetics and atmosphere are great in <em>Jackal</em>. But in these kinds of games, death must come swiftly, as well as the reloads. Likewise, action needs to move fast, but you should always feel like you have at least one option to get out of the chaos alive. <em>Jackal</em> nails all of this.</p>

 <p>Combat in this new indie shooter is all about being smart but relentless. Kick a guy down, grab his gun from the air, and shoot the other folks nearby; then, as he stands up, toss the gun back at his face, knocking him down again and letting you finish him with a quick execution.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000666480" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000666480"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000666480">©Transhuman Design / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>A lot of time in <em>Jackal</em> is spent tossing knives, bats, swords, guns, and more at enemies to stun them, and it always feels good. There’s also a lot of focus on making sure that you always know what’s going on. Enemies are pointed out via visual cues, guns are highlighted red so you know who to focus on, and when they run low on ammo, they go yellow. Smart choices like this help combat feel chaotic, sometimes out of control, but never messily or frustratingly so. And unlike in <em>Hotline Miami,</em> you can kick tables, chairs, and other items at enemies, which<!--StartFragment --><span>—</span><!--EndFragment -->along with the spells<!--StartFragment --><span>—</span><!--EndFragment -->adds a lot of useful options during fights.</p>

 <p>After about an hour and a half of playing <em>Jackal</em>, it looks like I’m about halfway through the game’s levels. So it doesn’t seem like this is a long experience, but there are many difficulty options, and nearly every level can be replayed with a new random layout of enemies, rooms, and weapons. That should offer a lot of replayability, especially for those chasing perfection. Just remember, someone is judging all those corpses you leave behind. And one day, will judge yours, too.</p>

<p>The Daily Mail has shared new looks at Sophie Turner in the role of Lara Croft in the upcoming Tomb Raider series for Prime Video.</p>



<p>On February 6, 2026, <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-15534645/Sophie-Turner-stunts-set-Tomb-Raider.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the Daily Mail </a>shared photos of Lara Croft in action, showing Sophie Turner parachuting over a lake and running through the woods. Instead of Croft’s signature green top and shorts, she wore athletic wear and cargo pants for the scene, which was filmed in the rain in Surrey.</p>



<p>As of yet, there’s no release date for the upcoming series, which will also feature Sigourney Weaver and Jason Isaacs, and began filming in January. However, Sophie has already encountered some challenges while filming the role. She stated on the<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSLuQpWjlj4&amp;pp=ygUeanVsaWEgY3VubmluZ2hhbSBzb3BoaWUgdHVybmVy"> Julia Cunningham Show</a> that she’d become aware of back issues during Tomb Raider training.</p>



<p>“I’ve learned I have a perpetual back problem, but I also realised that it’s much easier to kind of build muscle if you’ve ever worked out before in your life, which I never had,” she said.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>This week, a peculiar rumor picked up steam: Jeffrey Epstein, the disgraced sex trafficker with <a href="https://aftermath.site/jeffrey-epstein-files-kotick-thiel-xbox-rockstar/"><u>connections</u></a> to a plethora of the world’s most powerful men, is still alive. Why? It appears that a <em>Fortnite </em>account believed to be his was <a href="https://x.com/DissidentMedia/status/2019520779550122024?ref=aftermath.site"><u>online as recently as last year</u></a>. Today, because we live in a world gone mad, an official Epic account let conspiracy-addled X The Everything App users know that, no, this is not the case.</p><p>"This was a ruse by a <em>Fortnite </em>player,” <a href="https://x.com/FortniteStatus/status/2019817972831780952?s=20&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>said the official Fortnite Status account</u></a> in response to a since-deleted tweet echoing the conspiracy theory. “A few days ago, an existing <em>Fortnite </em>account owner changed their username from something totally unrelated to littlestjeff1, following the revelation of littlestjeff1 as a name on YouTube. These Fortnite trackers only display your current name, not any prior changes to it."</p><p>“Littlestjeff1” is a handle that appears over 20 times in the Epstein files, albeit largely <a href="https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00629064.pdf?ref=aftermath.site"><u>in association with Epstein’s YouTube account</u></a>. Additionally, at one point in 2019 Epstein appears to have <a href="https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02286126.pdf?ref=aftermath.site"><u>purchased</u></a> $25 worth of <em>Fortnite </em>V-Bucks. This, plus an Israeli flag next to a correspondingly named player’s profile pic on unofficial <em>Fortnite </em>stat site <a href="https://fortnitetracker.com/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Fortnite Tracker</u></a>, was enough to convince many that Epstein was alive, well, and farming victory royales in Tel Aviv – confirming, in their minds, heaps of other rumors that Epstein never actually died. (Officially, Epstein <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Jeffrey_Epstein?ref=aftermath.site"><u>died by suicide in 2019</u></a>. Unofficially, <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/flash-orange-caught-video-sparks-161703143.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAALyLP-k-f8z1fQKIAqK6Qn6GIqwI_0c3p7frrz64laYitqq04Lzklf2h9fArvxMvMEEJhSk8OEsXL_PZAdZGH-RretfZoznN5kdmFCPZFS8_3iUb7VJs9nM_gPICtCElS9HeqMGK2AU8BicZPBj0W-SB7fzkyJLws3p4vGFfTQde&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>well…</u></a>)&nbsp;</p><p>“We have no record of the subject's email addresses referenced in the public document existing in the Epic account system,” the Fortnite Status account added. “Since the public document releases, people have created <em>Fortnite </em>accounts with similar-looking email addresses and user names.”</p><p>Epic CEO and <a href="https://aftermath.site/tim-sweeney-x-ai-csam-epic-games-fortnite/"><u>prolific poster</u></a> Tim Sweeney also weighed in.</p><p>“Someone's been having fun renaming their <em>Fortnite </em>account,” he <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/2019819940753379740?s=20&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>wrote</u></a>, “but it's recent and not connected to the email addresses in the archive.”</p><p>Extremely cool living in a society where public trust has eroded to the point that an official account of a video game for kids needs to wash its hands of a mess made by the massively corrupt oligarchy.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Epic Games shot down rumors that a </span><i><span>Fortnite </span></i><span>account sharing the same username as a YouTube account owned by Jeffrey Epstein belonged to the deceased financier.&nbsp; The company called it a “ruse” apparently orchestrated by random <em>Fortnite</em> players attempting to spoof the alias leaked in last week’s trove of Epstein files.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span> The clarification followed several viral conspiratorial posts online alleging Epstein was still alive because of a </span><i><span>Fortnite </span></i><span>account thought to be linked to him appearing to be active following his death back on August 10, 2019. </span><span>The most popular post regarding the littlestjeff1 </span><i><span>Fortnite </span></i><span>account came from user </span><a href="https://x.com/Pirat_Nation/status/2019449522460541048?s=20"><span>Pirat_Nation on X</span></a><span>.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000666479" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000666479"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000666479">DOJ</figcaption></figure> <p><span>The post in question featured several screenshots of documents from the 3 million new Epstein files released by the Department of Justice on January 30 arranged in a pinboard-like fashion to claim something wasn’t adding up about the convicted felon’s death.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>One file revealed that Jeffrey Epstein had a YouTube account under the username littlestjeff1, and had purchased a film titled<em> Frenzy</em> using the account on October 25, 2014. Another file includes a $25.95 receipt for </span><i><span>Fortnite </span></i><span>V-Bucks on May 7, 2019 (although said receipt makes no mention of the littlestjeff1 username).</span></p>

 <h2>The littlestjeff1 <em>Fortnite</em> account was spoofed</h2> <p><span>A </span><i>Fortnite </i><span>account registered under the name littlestjeff1 was discovered using the website Fortnite Tracker. The account was in use during </span><i>Fortnite’s </i><span>Chapter 5, Season 1, which began on December 3, 2023. This led to the conspiracy that Epstein’s death was somehow faked and he was holed up somewhere in the world playing </span><i>Fortnite</i><span>. Suggestions that the account was active in Israel, leaning into speculation about whether Epstein at one point worked as a spy for the Israeli government, only added to the online drama.</span></p>

  <p><span>Things spread far and wide enough that the official <em>Fortnite</em> Status X account addressed Pirat_Nation’s post directly to </span><a href="https://x.com/FortniteStatus/status/2019817972831780952?s=20"><span>refuted the theory</span></a>. <span>“A few days ago, an existing <em>Fortnite</em> account owner changed their username from something totally unrelated to littlestjeff1, following the revelation of littlestjeff1 as a name on YouTube,” the company wrote on February 6. “These<em> Fortnite</em> trackers only display your current name, not any prior changes to it.”</span></p> <p><span>The company also clarified that it has “no record of the subject’s email addresses referenced in the public document existing in the Epic account system.” According to Epic, since the public document listing the littlestjeff1 account was released, several people have “created<em> Fortnite</em> accounts with similar-looking email addresses and user names.”</span></p>

 <p>While it’s still not clear who the <em>Fortnite </em>V-Bucks purchase in the Epstein files refers to, he did have an Xbox account. The Microsoft platform <a href="https://kotaku.com/emails-reveal-jeffrey-epstein-was-banned-from-xbox-live-2000664660">ended up banning him</a> after he became a registered sex offender.</p>

Handling is tighter, while collisions and the exterior damage they cause are more realistic.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There are also a lot more ways to interact with vehicles. Characters can join you as passengers, and they’ve gotten new riding animations. And you can honk the horn and jump out of a vehicle before it’s come to a stop. You can also pop tires, knock out windows, and damage vehicles to the point where they explode.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can requisition vehicles whenever you want, but causing excessive damage or disturbing public order will activate NTE’s multi-level wanted system, which has also seen some changes. As your wanted level rises, there will be escalating consequences. Police officers and bots will pursue you, and they’ll get more aggressive as your wanted level increases.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Previously, if you were apprehended by police officers, you simply paid a fine and were immediately let out. Now, you’ll be sent to a detention facility, where you have more options for how to get out. You can still pay the fine to leave immediately, but now you also can try to stage a jail break, which obviously comes with some risk. Or you can work off what you owe, which basically amounts to cleaning up the facility. It’s the slowest option, but it costs no money and comes with no danger. So you’ll need to weigh what’s most important to you: speed, danger, or cost.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hethereau is almost constantly plagued by reality-defying anomalies, and the main story will see you working as an unlicensed Anomaly Hunter to investigate these weird occurrences and figure out how to stop them. But in between these story beats, you’ll be able to take part in leisure activities and hobbies.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can buy a home to return to after a long day, or you can buy and customize a car and race against street crews or against other players in multiplayer. The Co-Ex Test added new activities and hobbies too, including fishing, games of Mahjong, a musical rhythm game called Super Sound (which you can see below), and a shop management sim mode.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fishing is the most in-depth addition, with a total of 76 different types of fish spread across designated fishing spots in the city. Each district of Hethereau has its own spots, and different fish are located in different bodies of water. So you’ll need to venture across the city if you want to catch them all. Whatever you catch can be sold for tokens, which can then be traded for fishing-related items or fons (the in-game currency). And as you catch different fish, you’ll earn additional rewards for filling up your fishing log.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you like being able to take over a shop and manage its day-to-day operations to improve it, then Owner’s Selection is the mode for you. You can find shops in the open world available for purchase. Once you buy one, you’re in charge of improving its popularity and business level. You do this by hiring staff, decorating the shop, and stocking products. As the shop’s popularity grows, its level will rise and you’ll earn increased profits.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s also a new dungeon-style extraction mode called Pink Paws Heist that you can access at any time once you’ve unlocked it at Tycoon Level 18. In it, you’ll gather resources and either fight or avoid patrolling anomalies to find your way to an exit. You’ll get points based on which resources you successfully extract with, and those points can be traded for currency, upgrade materials, and other goodies.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Co-Ex Test will last until February 20, and public signups are closed, but you still have the chance to win access. Go to <a href="https://nte.perfectworld.com/net/260206twitch/index.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>this site</u></a> before February 13 and link your PWG account, then tune in for Twitch Drops livestreams that will run until February 13 at 10:59 p.m. Eastern. During the livestream, you’ll have the chance to directly receive access to the beta. Good luck!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Once the beta test ends, Hotta Studio will take player feedback and implement it into later versions. A final release date for the full version of NTE has not been announced yet, but we do know it will be available for free on PC, console, iOS, and Android with cross-progression across all platforms.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Insomniac Games, the developer behind PlayStation's beloved Spider-Man games and the upcoming <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/marvels-wolverine">Wolverine</a>, just dropped a teasing hint at another Marvel hero who fans now think is likely to appear.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a href="https://x.com/insomniacgames/status/2019492430597202093" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post</a> on Twitter/X, Insomniac Games shared an image of Wolverine extending his claws and turning to face... someone, alongside the caption: "'Claws?' What's that, some kind of fancy lawyer lingo?"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The line is a fun pun on Wolverine's blades, and the kind of clause a lawyer might include in a legal contract — but which lawyer? Well, Marvel fans will know there's only one legal representative who'd likely seek out Wolverine when he's in another one of his moods.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">"Claws"? What's that, some kind of fancy lawyer lingo? <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WolverinePS5?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#WolverinePS5</a> <a href="https://t.co/vgw9Od8jHO" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/vgw9Od8jHO</a></p>— Insomniac Games (@insomniacgames) <a href="https://twitter.com/insomniacgames/status/2019492430597202093?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 5, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, fans have immediately taken the tease to be a nod at the appearance of Daredevil, otherwise known as Matt Murdock, as played by Charlie Cox in the Daredevil TV series and a swathe of other projects in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans have long been expecting Daredevil to make an appearance in one of Insomniac's Marvel games, too, after numerous references to the character in the developer's Spider-Man titles. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">A sign outside Nelson &amp; Murdock's office appeared in Spider-Man 1, and was noted by fans as having been removed in Spider-Man 2 and replaced by an eviction notice. A post-launch Spider-Man 2 patch then re-added the Nelson &amp; Murdock sign, hinting at some kind of story for the character being in the offing — something the game's director Bryan Intihar even <a href="https://x.com/SpiderManCD/status/1720233692407148815" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">commented</a> on in late 2023, teasing: "Stay tuned."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Further references to the character have teased Murdock and Jennifer Walters apparently starting a legal firm together, and included other Daredevil-themed locations such as Josie's Bar and Fogwell's Gym. Clearly, the character has been on Insomniac's mind for some time — perhaps Wolverine is where we'll finally see him?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As you would expect, replies to Insomniac's latest post have immediately picked up on the studio's apparent Daredevil hint, and responded with numerous gifs of Charlie Cox in his iconic red suit. Well, why not.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Due for release this during the latter half of 2026, Marvel's Wolverine remains somewhat under-wraps — though we <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonys-ps5-exclusive-wolverine-game-finally-gets-gameplay-reveal-at-state-of-play-2025">finally got a decent look at the game during last September's State of Play broadcast</a>.

<figure data-uuid="f8804591966af"><a title="Hollow Knight" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f8804591966af/hollow-knight.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Team Cherry</em></figcaption></figure><p>Yesterday, Team Cherry surprised us all with the shadow drop release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hollow Knight - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> (at least, it would have been a surprise if its PEGI rating hadn't cropped up online before), and the studio snuck out a new update to mark the occasion.</p>
<p>The ver. 1.5.12459 update isn't packed with game-changing additions, but it's always nice to see Team Cherry fine-tuning the experience. Alongside new screen resolution support for PC players, the patch also introduces "many under-the-hood improvements brought over from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hollow_knight_silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> to the original game," Team Cherry said in a <a href="https://www.teamcherry.com.au/blog/hollowknightupgraded">blog post</a>. And yes, this update is available on both Switch 1 <em>and</em> 2.</p>
<p>The full patch notes were shared in an announcement on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/367520/view/526493182068785899">Steam</a>, and we have gathered them together for you to check out below:</p>
<h2>Hollow Knight ver. 1.5.12459 (Released 5th Feb 2026)</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>- Added support for 21:9 &amp; 16:10 resolutions.<br>
- Game now pauses while in inventory menus.<br>
- Upgraded to Unity Input System for broader controller support (original input system is still available, if preferred, via Options&gt;Controller&gt;Advanced Settings)<br>
- Added dithering effect, and dithering options, to reduce colour banding.<br>
- Fixed a softlock in City of Tears Grub room.<br>
- Reduced Grey Prince Zote's stagger bounce height.<br>
- Updated Sly's Great Slash collider to closer match visual.<br>

</blockquote>

<p>The new Switch 2 version of Hollow Knight boasts improved resolution, frame rate, and a handful of additional effects, with a new 120fps option to boot. We've added our thoughts about the new release to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/hollow-knight">our original review</a> below, saying, "Honestly, if you haven't played Hollow Knight, the Switch 2 Edition is a no-brainer".</p>

            <guid>1428388</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>MindsEye</strong> was the <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/mindseye/">worst game of 2025 by Metacritic's standards</a>. While developer <strong>Build a Rocket Boy</strong> has made significant strides to work on and improve the game, <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-mindseye-update-is-a-big-step-forward-for-both-build-a-rocket-boy-and-mindseye-new-content-is-in-development/">including a major update that was released earlier this week</a>, the studio's co-chief executive officer, <strong>Mark Gerhard</strong>, reportedly believes the game's issues stem from more than just Build a Rocket Boy (BaRB) failing to deliver a solid product.</p>



<p>In a new report from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mindseye-ceo-alleges-1-million-sabotaging-its-game/">Insider-Gaming</a>, the studio claims to have obtained <strong>evidence</strong> of a "<em><strong>coordinated campaign</strong> to <strong>purposefully and maliciously damage Build a Rocket Boy's reputation and undermine confidence in MindsEye</strong>. We are working with our legal team and taking steps to address this</em>."</p>



<p>That comes from a statement BaRB sent to Insider-Gaming, after the publication requested a comment on information it had obtained from an internal meeting, where Gerhard not only claimed that the studio had "<em>caught the guys who've been sabotaging MindsEye</em>," but that the alleged sabotage campaign involved the perpetrators spending upwards of <strong></strong><strong>€</strong>1 million (approximately <strong>$1.1 million USD</strong>).</p>



<p>So who are the alleged devils behind the sabotage campaign? According to Insider-Gaming's report, it stemmed from a company based in the UK called <strong><a href="https://www.ritualnetwork.com/">Ritual Network</a></strong>, and video network, influencer management and advertising company. Allegedly working with Ritual Network in this claimed smear campaign includes a number of influencers, three journalists, and some internal employees at BaRB.</p>



<p>Gerhard reportedly added that the individuals accused of carrying out the alleged sabotage campaign "<em>will all be served in person, criminal complaints, shortly</em>," with the specific charges being <em>"espionage, sabotage, and criminal interference</em>." He added, "<em>Everyone who's involved has real problems, including the company behind it. This is the start of our comeback</em>."</p>



<p>A statement from Ritual Network denies the allegations, saying, "<em>Ritual Network is a creator support platform and is not involved in the matter you referenced. We are not aware of any legitimate legal action involving Ritual Network and have not been provided with any evidence supporting these claims. Any suggestion that Ritual Network is connected to these allegations is incorrect.</em>"</p>



<p>Later in the meeting, Gerhard also reportedly added that the studio will "<em>use these people, these names and these facts for our own fun</em>," confirming that his intention is to "<em>put some of these names into our upcoming spy mission</em>." This spy mission is also reportedly the one that was supposed to include <strong>Hitman's Agent 47</strong>, though that collaboration is no longer in the works <a href="https://wccftech.com/build-a-rocket-boy-said-to-have-ended-publishing-deal-with-io-interactive-after-last-years-mindseye-bomb/">since BaRB and <strong>IO Interactive</strong> ended their publishing agreement</a>. Instead, it'll be reshaped to include the alleged perpetrators.</p>



<p>"<em>Let's tell the community the story before it even plays out in court</em>," Gerhard reportedly added. "<em>So, you know, I think this is not us being the victim. We've taken a couple of punches. We've kept turning the other cheek while we got our house in order. And now it's time to start judoing this right back at them. And, you know, so let's have some fun with it. At the end of the day, we're storytellers, we're game makers</em>."</p>



<p>Last year, when MindsEye launched in an undeniably broken state, <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-is-giving-players-refunds-for-mindseye/">with players asking for refunds</a> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-developer-reportedly-beginning-mass-layoff-process-potentially-impacting-over-100-employees/">reports of mass layoffs</a></strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-developer-reportedly-beginning-mass-layoff-process-potentially-impacting-over-100-employees/"> (that were later confirmed)</a> coming less than a month after its launch, the studio said it was <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-developer-build-a-rocket-boy-heartbroken-over-the-games-launch-details-patches-coming-throughout-june/">"<em>heartbroken</em>"</a></strong> with how things had gone, and vowed to keep working on the game to make it up to players and realize the vision it always had for MindsEye.</p>



<p>At the same time, Gerhard and his fellow co-chief executive officer, <strong>Leslie Benzies</strong>, who you might also recognize as a former long-time producer at <strong>Rockstar</strong> who worked on several games in the <strong>Grand Theft Auto</strong> series and both <strong>Red Dead Redemption </strong>titles, <a href="https://wccftech.com/build-a-rocket-boy-ceo-blames-saboteurs-mindseye-struggles/">also blamed internal and external "<em><strong>saboteurs</strong></em>" for the game and the studio's woes</a>. </p>



<p>But while BaRB leadership was busy pointing fingers, developers at the studio pointed them right back at Gerhard and Benzies. <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-developers-call-out-leslie-benzies-mark-gerhard-build-a-rocket-boy/">93 BaRB developers called out Gerhard and Benzies in an open letter</a></strong> last October for "<em>longstanding disrespect and mistreatment of your staff</em>."</p>



<p>"<em></em><em>For years, you have expected them to adapt to your every whim, with those in disagreement being shut down or cast aside. We estimate a UK-majority of the 250-300 workers across the company have now lost their livelihoods. These layoffs happened because you repeatedly refused to listen to your workforce's years of experience, resulting in one of the worst video game launches this decade</em>," the letter reads.</p>



<p>"<em></em><em>Our experience at the company has been one of burnout, job insecurity, health issues, and the failure of a game that many of us have put years of our lives into. BaRB needs to change. CEOs need to take a backseat and allow the skilled people who remain at the company to forge the path ahead</em>."</p>



<p>A little more than a week after the open letter was published, <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-report-details-how-leslie-benzies-leadership-failed-staff/">a report from the BBC also pointed to the studio's internal issues stemming from its leadership,</a> with Benzies and Gerhard cited as the problem once again. "<em>Leslie never decided on what game he wanted to make. There was no coherent direction</em>," one BaRB developer told the BBC. The report added that when employees would bring their concerns to Benzies and Gerhard, they were "<em>just ignored</em>" and even "<em>laughed at</em>."</p>



<p>It's important to remember all of this when looking at the last major point of Insider-Gaming's report, which is that BaRB leadership had an employee monitoring and cybersecurity software called <strong>Teramind</strong> installed to track employee behaviour, <strong>without employees' knowledge</strong>.</p>



<p>The report adds that Gerhard took "<em>full responsibility</em>" for the poor way the software was rolled out and that he hopes to have it removed in three months' time. That said, Gerhard also reportedly stipulated, "<em>I think it goes without saying that we can trust 99.9% of this business. The problem is it's the one. It's the 1%. That is the problem, and, you know, the next 90 days for this business are absolutely critical</em>."</p>



<p>If Gerhard and BaRB actually do have the evidence to prove that there has been a sabotage campaign rolled out against BaRB and MindsEye, then that drastically changes the story around this game and adds credence to why BaRB leadership would spy on its employees without telling its staff. </p>



<p>If not, then what we're more likely seeing is another video game industry story where poor leadership and mismanagement have led to those in charge pointing their finger everywhere but at themselves, with hundreds of developers losing their livelihoods in the process, and players who, unfortunately, spent their hard-earned money on an unfinished product that may remain in that state forever.</p>



<p>If you're wondering what players think of MindsEye after all this time and all of its patches, some of its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3265250/MindsEye/#app_reviews_hash">user reviews on Steam</a> in the last 30 days are positive, noting improvements to AI-controlled characters and the introduction of new missions. However, there are still several negative reviews citing technical issues that have not been fixed, and perhaps more importantly, those negative reviews are citing more than just technical problems, like the game's writing, pacing, lack of gameplay variety, and other problems, which show MindsEye's issues go far beyond a few bugs and meme-worthy screenshots.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>This week saw the early access launch of turn-based tactics game Menace, created by the piss-swigging misanthropes behind <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battle-brothers">Battle Brothers</a>. Julian has been having <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/jetpacking-space-pirates-taught-me-a-painful-lesson-in-punishing-strategy-game-menace">a wonderful time</a> playing it and learning about the importance of spare ammo and adequate reconnaissance. It could have been worse, Julian. Your antivirus software could have deleted some of the game’s files. This being one of the currently known issues listed in the patch notes for the game’s first proper update.</p><!--more-->
<p>“Some antivirus programs incorrectly classify the 'GameAssembly.dll' file as malware and delete it, making the game unplayable,” explains <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2432860/view/540003980950897283?l=english">the Steam post in question</a>. “If that happens please whitelist the ‘GameAssembly.dll’ and ‘Menace.exe’.” A simple-enough fix, then.</p>
<p>I’m not sure why, exactly, some antivirus programs have a bone to pick with Menace, and I have to say, I am a little suspicious. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/streamer-raising-funds-for-cancer-care-loses-32000-to-steam-game-malware-thanks-to-appalling-levels-of-vetting">It’s not like Steam games are malware-proof</a>. The other way of looking at it, of course, is that your antivirus is trying gallantly to spare you the humiliation of being pinned down and bombarded by some entry-level space pirates. You, the pride and flower of the Terran Congressional Republic Navy!</p>
<p>As if there weren’t already pirates enough, the update adds a few more: "pirate veteran scavengers”, "pirate veteran scavenger armor", and the fearsome-sounding "pirate heavy machinegun truck". Julian! Stop sobbing into your Space Weetabix and help me make sense of these miscellaneous game tweaks. They’ve adjusted the splash screen for ultra wide monitors, which sounds positive, but I’m not sure what to make of “anti-tank mines now also trigger for especially large units other than vehicles”. Are you a mine-layer, Julian, or do you tend to be the one triggering them?</p><p>There are some hefty balancing tweaks in here too. They’ve added a heat mechanic to laser rifles and plasma rifles, instead of regular ammunition, and given pirate EMP units a motion scanner accessory. That’s going to ruin somebody’s day (Julian's). Are you playing Menace? Seems like it’s a sturdy bit of turn-based brain-o-war, whatever your antivirus provider may determine.</p>

Lara Croft’s iconic dual pistols are strapped to her thighs, and she dons her classic small knapsack in green canvas with brown leather straps. The fit is tied together with a forearm brace, fingerless leather gloves, a belt outfitted with grenades, and, of course, Lara’s signature braid.

 <p><span>She continued, “I’ve learned I have a perpetual back problem, but I also realized that it’s much easier to kind of build muscle if you’ve ever worked out before in your life, which I never had, so it has taken me months and months and months to get into good shape.” She’s just like me for real.</span></p> <blockquote data-media-max-width="560"> <p dir="ltr" lang="en">Sophie Turner performs her own parachute stunt on the Lara Croft set! <a href="https://t.co/j8IzQN9Tpn">https://t.co/j8IzQN9Tpn</a> <a href="https://t.co/Ok2gOFTas2">pic.twitter.com/Ok2gOFTas2</a></p> <p>— TMZ (@TMZ) <a href="https://twitter.com/TMZ/status/2019815012726976672?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 6, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>The woodsy set is located in Surrey, according to the </span><em><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-15534645/Sophie-Turner-stunts-set-Tomb-Raider.html"><span>Daily Mail</span></a></em><span>.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>The series is being produced by Amazon MGM Studios and Crystal Dynamics, with </span><i><span>Fleabag</span></i><span> creator and star Phoebe Waller-Bridge helming the project.
