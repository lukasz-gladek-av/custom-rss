			<p>In the past few years, we have repeatedly heard how consoles are about to die, but the former Blizzard Entertainment president Mike Ybarra not only thinks that this won't be the case but also that those losing are pushing a narrative that fits them, taking a not-so-well hidden dig at Microsoft.</p>
<p>Speaking on<a href="https://x.com/Qwik/status/1829502846498402459"> X</a> earlier today, the former Blizzard Entertainment president discussed Sony's approach to exclusive games, saying that it is the correct strategy to follow if you plan to win in the living room. In this regard, Sony not only knows how to make hits but also how to pick them from others, and it is definitely paying off. If he were Sony, Ybarra continued, he would double down on this strategy because the blood in the water is all over the place.</p>
<p>As another X user highlighted, the narrative nowadays is that the living room is not the future and that consoles are dying. Mike Ybarra replied that, in his opinion, <a href="https://x.com/Qwik/status/1829507360689426571">consoles will never die</a>, and it's those who are losing who are pushing a narrative that fits them. This is a not-so-subtle dig at Microsoft, whose strategy regarding its consoles and exclusives has been all over the place lately, creating much uncertainty.</p>
<p>Just as Mike Ybarra said, Sony has always been capable of producing exclusive hits themselves while also securing titles from other developers. Just this year, games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/rise-of-the-ronin-neo-edo-open-world/">Rise of the Ronin</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stellar-blade-review-nearly-automatic-angel/">Stellar Blade</a> have been released on PlayStation 5, making the console the one to own to play some of the best titles launched in the past few years. Microsoft's strategy, on the other hand, seems to have almost completely disregarded console exclusivity, releasing multiple former exclusives on PlayStation 5 and Nintendo Switch. One of the most anticipated games launching on Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S this year, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, will only be a Microsoft exclusive for a few months, as the game will launch on Sony's console sometime in <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-to-release-as-timed-exclusive/">Spring 2025.</a> With a new console generation not too far off in the future, it will be very interesting to see Microsoft's approach and if the company will continue to push the narrative that the time of consoles is coming to an end.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dcu-head-james-gunn-quashes-the-batman-video-game-rumors.968454/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/james-gunn-the-batman-rumors<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>DCU movie head James Gunn has taken to social media to shut down a rumor that's been circulating in the last few days regarding a potential video game set in the world of Matt Reeves' 2022 movie&nbsp;<em>The Batman</em>.</p>
<p>The rumors regarding&nbsp;<em>The Batman&nbsp;</em>have been handily collected in <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-game-set-in-the-batman-universe-reportedly-in-development.968079/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">this ResetEra thread</a>, and it seems they stem from a site called Puck, which alleged that Warner Bros is currently working on a game "rooted in the<em>&nbsp;Batman&nbsp;</em>movie" (presumably referring to the Reeves project).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it looks like there's no truth to those rumors, at least as far as James Gunn is concerned (and he would know, given that he's overseeing everything to do with DC's excursions into its cinematic universe right now).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/james-gunn-the-batman-game-rumors-suicide-squad.jpg?itok=hH1NnNy2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/james-gunn-the-batman-game-rumors-suicide-squad.jpg?itok=CH2XNMGh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Batman most recently appeared in February's&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Over on Threads, a user <a href="https://www.threads.net/@erikoliveira.eo411/post/C_S096FRykR" rel="noopener" target="_blank">asked Gunn</a> whether or not recent rumors regarding a game set in the universe of&nbsp;<em>The Batman&nbsp;</em>were true.</p>
<p>In response, Gunn <a href="https://www.threads.net/@jamesgunn/post/C_TDHo7gbRr/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">said that there was "no truth to this whatsoever"</a>, which is pretty much as unequivocal a denial as you can get. That's not an exec being evasive or making vague denials; that's a flat-out "no". Sorry,&nbsp;<em>The Batman&nbsp;</em>fans. Looks like you're out of luck.</p>
<p>While he was at it, Gunn also <a href="https://www.threads.net/@jamesgunn/post/C_TFYMlg2--" rel="noopener" target="_blank">quashed the rumor</a> that the song "Tubthumping" by Chumbawamba was being played on the set of the new&nbsp;<em>Superman&nbsp;</em>movie. Way to ruin my dreams, James.</p>
<h2>It might not be over for&nbsp;<em>Batman&nbsp;</em>fans</h2>
<p>While Gunn might have put paid to&nbsp;<em>The Batman&nbsp;</em>rumors, that's not to say there's nothing in the works on this front, at least if a recent LinkedIn job posting is to be believed.</p>
<p>Recently, senior Rocksteady systems programmer Tae Ho Kang added a new section to the "experience" part of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/taeho-kang-london/?originalSubdomain=uk" rel="noopener" target="_blank">his LinkedIn profile</a>. Said section states he's currently working on the tech team for an "unannounced project" at Rocksteady, which began development in June.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/batman-arkham-knight-rocksteady.jpg?itok=dMkJPC-K 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/batman-arkham-knight-rocksteady.jpg?itok=osLiebeS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Could a new single-player Rocksteady-developed DC adventure be in the works?</figcaption></figure><p>Admittedly, that's not too much to go on; the listing doesn't state what the project is (naturally), and it's likely that it's in the very early stages of development if work on it began in June. Still, this could well be the single-player game Rocksteady was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hogwarts-legacy-directors-cut-report">apparently attempting to pitch</a> a few months ago.</p>
<p>If you weren't a big fan of&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League&nbsp;</em>(and, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/suicide-squad-kill-justice-leagues-sales-disappointed-hogwarts-legacy-is-big-win">judging by Warner Bros' finances</a>, not many were), then you'll probably want to keep an eye on Rocksteady's socials in the next few months. Stay tuned for more on this.</p>

The combat doesn’t require complex strings of button mashing, the clearly marked story objectives help orient you even on a small screen, and the many side quests are perfect fodder for pick-up-and-play sessions. The remakes of the first three <em>Mana</em> games are all on mobile devices (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/secret-of-mana-square-snes-rpg-remake-best-1851611091&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/secret-of-mana-square-snes-rpg-remake-best-1851611091">even if some ports aren’t preferable to play</a></span>), so the series has a history of portable-friendly play too. Everything’s in place! So how does <em>Visions of Mana</em> fare on the Steam Deck?<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196055" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="227" data-playlist="196055,196358,195624" data-current="196055"><div><p>6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21584.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>In short, <em>Visions of Mana</em> runs…adequately on Steam Deck. It looks good enough after you fiddle with the settings, and it can hover above 30 frames per second. But you can tell this game wasn’t made for the Deck’s low resolution screen, since the text doesn’t scale well and looks kind of ugly (albeit readable). Still, it’s a passable experience, and I personally enjoyed killing time while I laid in my bed doing side questing on the Deck. I wouldn’t recommend making it your primary platform for playing the game, though, especially if you have access to any other system that can run it.</p><p>To really enjoy <em>Visions of Mana</em> on Steam Deck, check out these tips below to optimize your experience.</p><h2 id="h1819"><a id=""></a><strong>How to fix Visions of Mana not opening on Steam Deck</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="b57d72f2d4a1286d14dda4f5ca61f7d7" data-recommend-id="image://b57d72f2d4a1286d14dda4f5ca61f7d7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Steam Deck menu for Visions of Mana." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Steam Deck menu for Visions of Mana." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Valve / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b57d72f2d4a1286d14dda4f5ca61f7d7" data-recommend-id="image://b57d72f2d4a1286d14dda4f5ca61f7d7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Steam Deck menu for Visions of Mana." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This might sound obvious, but one of the most important prerequisites for enjoying <em>Visions of Mana</em> on Steam Deck is being able to open it at all. If the game refuses to load when you start it, give these troubleshooting steps a try.</p><p>1: Before you hit the “Play” button, press the cog icon on the right side of the screen. Select <strong>Properties</strong>, and then select <strong>Compatibility</strong>. Check the box that says “Force the use of a specific Steam Play compatibility tool,” and then select GE-Proton7-5.3. This is the option that worked for me, but you can give the other iterations of Proton a shot if that doesn’t work (or if a newer option becomes available after we publish this guide).</p><p>2: If the compatibility modes don’t work, or you see an error message saying “DX12 is not supported on your system,” you may need to reinstall the game. To do this, select that cog icon again, choose <strong>Manage</strong>, and select <strong>Uninstall</strong>. You should see the green Play button replaced by the big blue Install button. Try running the game using the compatibility tools again and it should hopefully work.</p><h2 id="h1820"><a id=""></a><strong>The best Steam Deck settings for playing Visions of Mana in handheld mode</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="31aef96385ad8ffcf112bb633462ad8c" data-recommend-id="image://31aef96385ad8ffcf112bb633462ad8c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The game with horrid black bars top and bottom." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The game with horrid black bars top and bottom." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="31aef96385ad8ffcf112bb633462ad8c" data-recommend-id="image://31aef96385ad8ffcf112bb633462ad8c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The game with horrid black bars top and bottom." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Now that you’ve got Visions of Mana running on your system, you’ll notice that it offers limited graphical settings in the options menu. Your resolution is unfortunately locked to 1280x720, which doesn’t quite fit the 1280X800 resolution of your screen. This means you’ll have to deal with black bars as you play (pictured above), and there’s nothing we can do about that.</p><p>Only two options here really impact the game’s performance. Since the game’s already running at a low resolution, I found setting AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution 2 to <strong>Quality</strong> and Graphics settings to <strong>High</strong> produced the best results. Some areas in <em>Visions of Mana</em> can cause dips to the frame rate, so you may prefer to adjust that first option from Quality down to <strong>Balanced</strong> to gain some extra frames. These settings should still preserve the game’s visual splendor on the Steam Deck’s small screen, even if it doesn’t compete with its console counterparts.</p><p>You could consider limiting the Frame Rate to 30 in the interest of saving battery life, but I’d personally recommend a shorter and smoother play session, unless you don’t intend to actually fight anything.</p><h2 id="h1821"><a id=""></a><strong>The best Steam Deck settings for playing Visions of Mana in docked mode</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="3e0bda270a36ef4fbe740c34d34547db" data-recommend-id="image://3e0bda270a36ef4fbe740c34d34547db" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The blurry mess of playing docked." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The blurry mess of playing docked." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3e0bda270a36ef4fbe740c34d34547db" data-recommend-id="image://3e0bda270a36ef4fbe740c34d34547db" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The blurry mess of playing docked." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I’ll be real with you: I don’t recommend playing <em>Visions of Mana</em> with the Steam Deck docked and connected to a TV.</p><p>At 1080p, Visions of Mana seriously chugs on the Steam Deck. Frames drop so dramatically that the 20 FPS of <em>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</em> on the N64 will seem smooth by comparison. This can be fixed by setting the AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution 2 to <strong>Performance</strong> and the Graphics settings to <strong>Low</strong> (pictured above), but this leaves the game looking horrid. Sure, you get normal looking text, but is that worth completely eliminating the game’s aesthetic?</p><p>You’re better off sticking to the 1280x720 resolution option and reusing the handheld mode graphical settings. However, when this image is blown up on a big TV, <em>Visions of Mana</em> winds up looking predictably blurry. It works, but you’re probably better off just trying to stream the game from a dedicated PC if you have one.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

If they’re not up to par, it’s time to turn them away with a razor-sharp insult, clever comeback, or a devastating quip.</p><p>Every night brings a new challenge. You’ll face a parade of quirky, eccentric characters, each with their own backstory, style, and attitude. As the gatekeeper of the Green Door, you’ll need to quickly size up each guest. Does their outfit scream ‘party material,’ or are they a walking fashion disaster? Are they here to dance the night away, or are they just trouble waiting to happen? When it’s time to say no, you’ll have to do it with flair—because in <em>Techno Banter</em>, words can hit harder than a bass drop.</p><p>Explore the pulsating, vibrant world of Rainbow Drive, a district that thrives under the glow of neon and the thump of heavy basslines. The city is alive with strange and fascinating inhabitants, and it’s up to you to navigate its twists and turns. From dark alleys to dazzling dance floors, every corner of the city tells a story, and every night brings a new experience. As you work the queue at the Green Door and improve the quality of the party, you’ll also have the chance to upgrade the club, turning it into the ultimate techno haven.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>No techno experience would be complete without a killer soundtrack. <em>Techno Banter</em> features tracks from real-life Berlin-based DJs, capturing the raw energy of the underground scene. Each party is underscored by deep house and techno beats that transport you straight to the heart of Berlin’s rave culture. Whether you’re bouncing guests or exploring the city, the music will keep your adrenaline pumping and your head nodding.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Gameplay / Consoles Announce Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Techno Banter - Gameplay / Console Announcement Trailer | PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1mImrCa3jew?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">There's a decades-old joke about whether the hero in The Legend of Zelda series is actually named after the eponymous character. In fact, it could be common for parents to mix up Zelda and Link, and that confusion will likely get worse when The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom launches next month.</p><p dir="ltr">Nintendo has revealed that the Hylian princess can enter a swordfighter form in a new trailer--seen below--for The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom. Not only does Zelda wield a sword and shield like Link in this transformation, she also sports a similar tunic and hat to the Hylian hero. This ability is unlocked once she discovers a mysterious sword. But, there's a catch: There's a gauge for how long she can stay in this form, which can be refilled by finding energy in the Still World.</p>

		<p>Nintendo has released a new trailer for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a>, sharing gameplay of the Still World sections that are found by stepping into the ominous purple rifts, Zelda’s swordfighting form, and more. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/18/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-lets-you-actually-play-as-zelda-this-september/">Echoes of Wisdom launches for Nintendo Switch on 26th September</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom — Into the Still World, a Journey Continued — Nintendo Switch" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wUdJF8gyO4A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>As the purple rifts have consumed large parts of Hyrule, many of its denizens, the king and link included, have been swallowed into the inky expanses.&nbsp;Thankfully, Zelda has joined forces with a little creature called Tri, who is lending her the ability to make echoes of items and creatures, and let her step into the rifts to explore what the game is calling the Still World.</p>
<p>Chunks of land are suspended here, alongside people that have been drawn into the void, and Zelda will have to get up to some 3D platforming actions to get around – potentially using echoes to solve platforming problems. The Still World is also home to dungeons, again using those echoes and a bit of ingenuity to overcome puzzles, and reaching bosses that need defeating – a boss that looks like a Knack knock off, or maybe “God” from Star Trek V was shown here. You can use echoed creatures or other abilities to hit the weak spots and find your own way to beat them.</p>
<p>Also revealed was a swordfighting form that effectively turns Zelda into a glowing blue Link – Blink, if you will – with sword and shield. However, she’s only got a little time before her energy gauge drains and she reverts to normal – this can be refilled by collecting blue nuggets of energy from the Still World. The final snippet gives a massive hint how you have to acquire this ability…</p>

<p>The trailer also introduces use to Dampé, an engineer of automatons which can be activated by winding them up. These could be a wind up bomb, a music machine, cannon and more – they’ll break if damaged, and act differently to the echo summons.</p>
<p>It all looks positively delightful, as Echoes of Wiszom borrows the visual style of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/09/19/links-awakening-switch-review-the-legend-of-zelda-remake/">Link’s Awakening remake</a>, which was a real highlight from a few years ago. We can’t wait to see more, and we thankfully won’t have to wait all that long for the full release!</p>

		<p>The shuffling hordes of the undead have appeared in almost as many games as the hordes they tend to depict, but any hint of zombie-weariness was gone the moment I saw <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/dying-light-the-beast">Dying Light: The Beast</a> in action. This all-new, standalone entry in the Dying Light franchise boasts an open-world full of zombie action, building on the series’ weighty combat and heart-stopping traversal options, while moving things forward with the power and technology they now have on tap.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dying Light: The Beast — Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c50gFkG91jc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Of course,&nbsp;Dying Light: The Beast sees the return of Kyle Crane – the hero of the first game – and we’re rejoining him after he’s undergone more than a decade of captivity and experimentation. Original voice actor Roger Craig Smith returns too (thankfully without having to go method for the role) tying it wholly to that first entry, but while that’s going to delight fans, Techland say this is going to be a great entry point for new players as well.</p>


<p>The name might be a bit of a giveaway, but in our preview session it becomes apparent that The Beast is actually you. Thanks to his incarceration and subsequent experimentation, Kyle Crane has developed a series of beast-like powers, coming to the fore when he’s pushed to the limit. These manifest when he’s angry – you wouldn’t like him when he’s angry – though in gameplay terms that seems to be when he’s been taken and/or dished out a certain amount of damage.</p>
<p>This is a new open-world region that’s not appeared in the franchise before, with a central campaign that’s set to give you over 18 hours of standalone zombie action. Techland feel this is the sweet spot in terms of narrative and gameplay content, though as an open-world game, there’s undoubtedly going to be plenty to distract you from what you’re doing.</p>


<p>Our preview mission sees Kyle tasked with getting inside the E&amp;F chemical factory. Straight away, I’d forgotten about the amazing blend of speed, fluidity and &nbsp;of Dying Light’s traversal and parkour, and it looks even more seamless this time around. The environments are incredibly detailed, and every element has been hand-crafted by the visual team. Environments shimmer with foliage, and the new and improved water and weather effects add newfound depth to every scene.</p>
<p>The narrative this time out draws on inspirations from TV shows like Twin Peaks and Stranger Things, with central villain Baron working on a new strain of virus to create chimaeras, or Freaks as the game has it. For a world that is already most of the way to hell, this seems like an unnecessary narrative kick in the balls, but it gives us a clear threat to deal with, and a reason for smashing our way through piles of zombies.</p>
<p>We see Volatiles, the returning apex predators of the undead and “king of the night”. Through our preview, there’s an emphasis on avoiding combat at first, with leaping across rooftops then replaced by hiding in long grass, and avoiding the Volatiles especially. Fans shouldn’t worry though, as Kyle soon takes out a baseball bat, smashing up a pack of zombies, culminating in a particularly graphic replacement of a skull by a crimson hole.</p>
<p>As an open world experience, you’ll come across different encounters that will distract you from what you’re supposed to be doing. We find a small group of raiders trying to lockpick a crate, though that’s an easy distraction to ensure they don’t see Kyle and his bow coming. Or indeed the arrows as they lodge in their chest.</p>

<p>If you’re coming from the first game, there’s a greater emphasis on firearms – just as there was in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/dying-light-2">Dying Light 2</a> – though Techland are keen to say that melee combat remains the focus. The team just want to give players as many tools as possible to work their way through the hordes, and the assault rifles and shotguns we see during our preview seem weighty and lethal. Ammunition is going to be limited though, so they’re never going to be the answer to every problem you encounter.</p>
<p>There’s also vehicles here, as first appeared in Dying Light: The Following, and we see Kyle hopping into a pickup truck which allows him to ferry a mission-specific canister across the map. This does, of course, involve running down a few zombies, but just as with the outlook elsewhere, this is a game about surviving against the odds. Vehicles will take damage, and you’ll need to refuel them too, so you won’t just be able to trundle across the entire map bopping zombies out of the way with the windows rolled down.</p>
<p>As an aside, Techland originally worked on several racing games including the Xpand Rally series, and they’re drawing on some of their original in-house talent who worked on these to make sure that the vehicles in Dying Light: The Beast feel and handle as accurately and enjoyably as possible. They definitely look fun as another zombie bounces over the hood and just misses out on being lodged in the pickup truck’s cargo bed. Maybe there’ll be an achievement for that.</p>

<p>The close of our preview saw Kyle complete his mission to attract the unidentified giant monster, with this Behemoth arriving in dramatic fashion, smashing cargo crates out of the way to enter the wrecking yard arena we’ve found ourselves in. At first Kyle struggles to do much damage – his guns run out of ammunition, and the equipped machete is basically just giving this guy paper cuts.</p>
<p>However, as the rage in Kyle grows he’s suddenly able to utilise his own powers, gaining some of the same attacks the Behemoth has been using to try and turn him into Kyle soup. You can now leap high into the air, crashing down to cause a painful shockwave, while Kyle’s strength goes off the charts. After wearing the creature down, Kyle finishes the encounter by literally pulling its head off. As blood spurts from the fallen monster, our time here runs out, but tellingly, nobody wants it to end.</p>
<p>As we approach the tenth anniversary of the franchise, it seems fitting to be returning to the world of Dying Light. Perhaps most surprising is that The Beast is going to be available at no extra cost for owners of Dying Light 2: Ultimate Edition, fulfilling the promise of a second DLC expansion for that game. Going so far beyond the minimum bar feels indicative of Techland’s approach to their premiere series, and to its fans. Thus far, The Beast looks stunning, with visceral and spectacular action tied to the franchise’s most impressive visuals yet. We can’t wait to see more.</p>

A realm called the Still World, full of complex dungeons and inventive puzzle platforming, was the main event, but I’m sure most people will instead be talking about how Zelda will in fact be able to use a sword when <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em> releases on September 26.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195719" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Tears Of The Kingdom's Newspaper Questline And The State Of Hyrulean Journalism" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="134" data-playlist="195719,195755,196394" data-current="195719"><div><p>Tears Of The Kingdom's Newspaper Questline And The State Of Hyrulean Journalism</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195719/195719_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195719/195719_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195719/195719_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195719/195719_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21229.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>As we’ve seen in past trailers, in <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em> a mysterious purple infection is engulfing Hyrule and sucking up the land and its people— including Link. It appears that everything getting sucked into the purple void goes to a place called the Still World, shown off in the latest trailer. It’s a second map that can be entered from different points in the main overworld, sort of like the Dark World in <em>A Link to the Past</em>. </p><p>Unlike the main overworld of <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>, the Still World is a topsy-turvy place in which the land has been morphed and frozen in place. This means that some platforms are on their side or completely flipped as they suspend in the void. This effectively creates a puzzle platformer for Zelda to traverse with the use of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-meme-reactions-1851550785&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-meme-reactions-1851550785">echoes</a></span>, the game’s central mechanic. As we’ve seen before, echoes allow Zelda to summon objects and even NPCs from her staff to complete puzzles and fight off enemies. We see echoes come in handy in the Still World, with Zelda creating some platforms to progress from one disjointed, floating island to the next. To reflect the varied environments of Hyrule, the Still World is full of different biomes, and it makes both realms seem brimming with wonderful variety.</p><p>Also within the Still World are <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>’s dungeons. As in past <em>Zelda </em>titles these will be large multi-room affairs full of tough environmental puzzles that lead to a boss. An interesting detail in the new trailer comes in a few moments that show Zelda in a 2D side-scrolling perspective, in a shift reminiscent of some spots in the dungeons of <em>Link’s Awakening</em>, or perhaps taking inspiration from <em>Zelda II</em>.</p><p>Boss fights give you another chance to really test out the limitations of the echoes system. One boss fight shown off in the trailer highlighted how open-ended these encounters are, thanks to your ability to summon almost anything you want. At one point we even see Zelda summon a bed mid-battle and get in, as if the echoes she’s summoned can take it from here and she’s gonna get some shut-eye. While that may not be the smartest strategy, as someone who is also perpetually in need of a nap I can’t really blame her. However, this trailer also revealed that you won’t just have to rely on your echoes to take down enemies, as Zelda will indeed wield a sword…at least in fleeting moments. </p><figure id="" data-id="27ee2a2af4ecc4bc78977b0a742d101c" data-recommend-id="image://27ee2a2af4ecc4bc78977b0a742d101c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="726" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Zelda wielding a sword while dressed like link" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Zelda wielding a sword while dressed like link" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="27ee2a2af4ecc4bc78977b0a742d101c" data-recommend-id="image://27ee2a2af4ecc4bc78977b0a742d101c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="726" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Zelda wielding a sword while dressed like link" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Zelda’s Swordfighter Form—which makes her the second Nintendo heroine to get a swordfighter form this year after <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/princess-peach-showtime-switch-review-roundup-1851355320&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/princess-peach-showtime-switch-review-roundup-1851355320"><em>Princess Peach: Showtime!</em></a></span>—gives her a Link-like look and her very own pointed weapon. This form seems to play about how you would expect in a traditional <em>Zelda game </em>but the ability is on a timer, so the princess can only swing the sword around for a brief period. In the trailer we saw a bar depleting that notes the form is at Level 1, so this may be something you can upgrade throughout your playthrough. </p><p>In addition to echoes, Zelda will be able to collect more ways of traversing and fighting in Hyrule thanks to a series of allies. The trailer introduces us to Dampé, an inventor who will give Zelda mechanical allies to use that have different abilities than echoes. Be careful, though, as these automatons will break if damaged too much. He’s just one of many allies you’ll meet along your journey. All in all, the latest trailer only makes <em>Echoes of Wisdom </em>look even more exciting, and I can’t wait to get my hands on it.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The Imperial Standing screen also displays enemy strength, current imperial revenue, and overall battle records.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Romancing-SaGa-2-Revenge-of-the-Seven_2024_08-30-24_059.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Romancing-SaGa-2-Revenge-of-the-Seven_2024_08-30-24_060.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>◆ The Imperial Chronicles</strong></p><p>The Imperial Chronicles allow players to see a record of all that they have done in the story thus far, as well as next possible objectives (i.e. current and completed quests).

                <p>Cooking meals in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/stardew-valley/" data-ref-id="5000-168503">Stardew Valley</a> has tons of great benefits. You can eat the meals to regain large amounts of health and energy, plus favorite meals make for great gifts to improve your relationship with villagers. Unlocking cooking requires you to make some upgrades and learning new recipes takes more effort than you might expect.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How to cook</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4341437-cookingmenu.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4341437" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4341437-cookingmenu.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4341437"></a><figcaption>Every recipe in Stardew Valley is shown in the cooking menu, but only unlocked recipes can be made.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4341437-cookingmenu.jpg"></figure><p>In order to cook food, you need <span>a kitchen in your house. To get a kitchen, you need to purchase the first <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stardew-valley-house-upgrades/1100-6524912/">house upgrade</a> from the Carpenters. The first upgrade costs 10,000G, and you need to provide 450 wood. It takes three days for the upgrade to be</span> completed, adding a kitchen to your house.</p><p dir="ltr">Once the upgrade is finished, you can cook a dish by interacting with the stovetop in the kitchen. To cook a dish, you just need to have the ingredients either on you or in the refrigerator. Just select the dish you want to make, which will be colored in if you have the ingredients, and the dish will be made--no minigame required.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How to learn new recipes</h2><p dir="ltr">There are three primary ways to learn new recipes. First, you can watch The Queen of Sauce on TV in your house. New episodes run every Sunday, offering new recipes, and on Wednesdays reruns are shown, with the game prioritizing any recipes you have missed. The second method is to increase your friendship level with different villagers, as they will mail you recipes at certain heart thresholds. Lastly, you can purchase some recipes from Gus at the Saloon in town. <strong>You cannot cook a meal that you have not found the recipe for.</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Below you can find every recipe in Stardew Valley and where you can learn it. <strong>Recipes purchased from Gus are bought at the Saloon unless noted otherwise. </strong></p><table data-max-width="true"><thead><tr><th scope="col">Recipe</th><th scope="col">Source</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Fried Egg</td><td>Known by default</td></tr><tr><td>Omelet</td><td>TV Spring 28, Year 1 or Gus for 100G</td></tr><tr><td>Salad</td><td>Emily -

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/new-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-trailer-sees-zelda-using-a-sword/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>From the past trailers, we have seen that in this game, Zelda will fight using Echoes to her advantage, allowing her to gain leverage over enemies and throw objects at them to defeat them. However, the latest five-minute trailer released on the Nintendo YouTube channel shows Zelda drawing a sword.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom — Into the Still World, a Journey Continued — Nintendo Switch" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wUdJF8gyO4A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The trailer also showcases the world of Hyrule, which has been torn apart by mysterious Rifts that have appeared out of nowhere. These Rifts similarly took her father, the King, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/link-is-playable-in-the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-too/">Link himself</a>. By teaming up with a mystical creature named Tri, she can jump into the Rifts and explore ways to repair the land and bring it back to its former glory.</p>
<p>One of the main areas, aside from Hyrule, that players will get to explore in The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom is the Still World. The five-minute trailer above predominantly showcases this area. Everything that gets sucked into the void becomes petrified and will eventually disappear completely if they cannot be brought back to Hyrule safely.</p>
<p>The Still World isn't just home to tricky platforming where Zelda will have to rely on using her Echoes to platform, but there are also ruins and dungeons to explore, with Zelda having to work her way through the puzzles below to traverse them.</p>
<p>Because of the various Rifts scattered through Hyrule, each Rift brings Zelda to a new part of the Still World, bringing about new exploration and defining features in each area. During her adventures, Zelda picks up a mysterious sword that allows her to utilize her swordfighter form.</p>
<p>By using this form, she can attack enemies directly rather than having to utilize her Echoes to do it for her, and has all of the same basic sword attacks that Link would use. She can also use a shield in this form. While she can take on enemies herself, you can also utilize her Echoes simultaneously, allowing you to take down enemies quicker by fighting them as both Zelda and the Echoes.</p>
<p>However, the Swordfighter form isn't permanently available. When she runs out of Energy, she will transform back into her standard form, where she relies solely on the power of Echoes to do her bidding. To be able to continue using the Swordfighter form, you have to collect Energy that will refill the gauge.</p>
<p>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom is <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">due for release on September 26, 2024</a> on Nintendo Switch.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1940340/view/4586440679309658784" rel="noopener" target="_blank">development update on Steam</a>, Red Hook says that the update will be released "in thematic modules", each of which will focus on a different threat for your heroes to face down. The first of these threats will apparently be "rotting, ravenous beastmen".</p>
<p>This first module, titled "Hunger of the Beast Clan", is due sometime in the fourth quarter of 2024, although we don't know exactly when just yet. Red Hook does say it'll share more about this update on its socials soon, though, so it likely won't be long until we find out.</p>

<p>Despite being entirely free, the update will bring a whole new campaign experience to the game; Red Hook says it'll offer a "completely reimagined" gameplay style that runs parallel to the base game's Confessions campaign.</p>
<h2>More&nbsp;<em>Darkest Dungeon 2&nbsp;</em>DLC is also on the way</h2>
<p>It's not just the Kingdoms update that Red Hook is releasing, either. The aforementioned development update also contained an announcement regarding a brand new paid DLC pack.</p>
<p>Set to arrive alongside the first installment of the Kingdoms update,&nbsp;<em>Inhuman Bondage&nbsp;</em>brings with it a brand new area in the form of the Catacombs, as well as a grisly new enemy faction to populate this forsaken space.</p>

<p>All of this news arrives in the wake of&nbsp;<em>Darkest Dungeon 2</em>'s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1940340/view/4284698870309376240" rel="noopener" target="_blank">modding update Darkside of the Mountain</a>, which was released last Friday. It adds official modding support to the game, as well as reworks for the Man-at-Arms, Jester, and Vestal heroes and more.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-trailer-swordfighter</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-trailer-shows-off-swordfighting-dungeons-and-more.968358/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-trailer-swordfighter<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom&nbsp;</em>trailer has been released into the (breath of the) wild by Nintendo, showcasing Zelda's combat-oriented swordfighter form, some of the game's dungeons, and more.</p>
<p>While previous&nbsp;<em>Echoes of Wisdom&nbsp;</em>trailers have <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-trailer-hyrule">highlighted the natural beauty of Hyrule</a> and its varied biomes, this one's all about the much creepier Still World, which is somewhat reminiscent of&nbsp;<em>A Link Between Worlds</em>' Lorule or&nbsp;<em>A Link to the Past</em>'s Dark World.</p>
<p>You can enter the Still World through rifts dotted around Hyrule (sound familiar?), and while you're there, you'll explore deadly dungeons, solve puzzles, and, of course, battle boss monsters intent on taking Zelda out of the picture.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-trailer-still-world.jpg?itok=RLEpTARv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-trailer-still-world.jpg?itok=nCDExf7I 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Still World should give Zelda plenty of challenges to overcome in&nbsp;<em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as exploring and solving puzzles, Zelda will also be able to transform herself into a powerful swordfighter who can take on enemies directly (remember that this isn't possible in moment-to-moment gameplay).</p>
<p>While in this form, Zelda effectively takes on Link's abilities; she can slash directly at her opponents, bypassing the need to have creatures do her bidding. However, this form is finite, so you'll need to collect energy from the Still World to prolong your time as a swordfighter.</p>
<p>The new trailer also shows off some of Zelda's allies, including the crafty gravedigger Dampé (here reimagined as an inventor of automatons) and a Goron who's crazy about fireworks, among others.</p>
<p>It's not just allies, of course; we also get to see some of the enemies Zelda will face off against over the course of&nbsp;<em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>, including familiar faces like the fire dragon Volvagia. You can check the trailer out here.</p>

<p><em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom&nbsp;</em>is a brand new top-down Zelda adventure that casts Princess Zelda as the protagonist. Link has fallen into one of the strange new rifts dotted around Hyrule, and it's up to Zelda to rescue him and discover what these rifts might herald.</p>
<p>Announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-announced">during June's Nintendo Direct presentation</a>,&nbsp;<em>Echoes of Wisdom&nbsp;</em>combines the classic top-down perspective of old-school&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>games with the more exploratory and experimental approach of recent fare like&nbsp;<em>Breath of the Wild&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>.</p>
<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom&nbsp;</em>when it launches <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-switch/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">exclusively for Nintendo Switch</a> on September 26th. Stay tuned for more.</p>

If you’re diving into this new adventure in the <em>Mana</em> franchise, here are some tips for your travels so that you can make the most of your early hours with the game.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196055" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="227" data-playlist="196055,196599,196742" data-current="196055"><div><p>6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21584.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h1182"><a id=""></a><strong>The goal is to have fun, so pick a difficulty that suits you best</strong></h2><p><em>Visions of Mana</em> offers four difficulties, and you should absolutely pick the one that offers you the level of challenge you desire, as having fun should be your highest priority here. Beginner difficulty is designed for those seeking to just experience the story with very little worry about combat. Easy, Medium, and Hard each ramp up how demanding the experience will be, with the sweet spot for most seasoned role-playing fans likely being Medium.</p><p>Just remember that all trophies or achievements can be unlocked on any difficulty, and you can rest assured that you’ll encounter fights that are certain to require some extra strategy or level grinding to overcome even on Easy or Medium. Additionally, you can change the difficulty in the settings at any time during your adventure if you begin feeling like the one you’ve chosen is either too breezy or too difficult.</p><h2 id="h1183"><a id=""></a><strong>Yes, all of the yellow items are worth picking up</strong></h2><p>You’ll see glowing yellow item pickups all over every zone you enter, which may begin to feel a bit overwhelming. It may get a bit tedious at times, but if you’re wondering if all of these items are worth picking up, the answer is unequivocally <em>yes</em>. Pick them up. Pick all of them up.</p><figure id="" data-id="5b07d3a76f9c30cefbe10e3688c62cd3" data-recommend-id="image://5b07d3a76f9c30cefbe10e3688c62cd3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A yellow glowing item! Pick it up before Billy gets you!" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A yellow glowing item! Pick it up before Billy gets you!" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5b07d3a76f9c30cefbe10e3688c62cd3" data-recommend-id="image://5b07d3a76f9c30cefbe10e3688c62cd3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A yellow glowing item! Pick it up before Billy gets you!" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>While you’ll sometimes just get a bit of money from these, you’ll also often get useful healing items that can make a meaningful difference in tougher battles. But most of all, these spots frequently provide you with Golden Clovers, which are an immensely important item for upgrading your characters and making them more powerful in battle. More on that further down.<br></p><h2 id="h1184"><a id=""></a><strong>Those colored crystals have a use later in the game</strong></h2><p>As you make your way through each zone, you’ll no doubt notice small crystals of various colors that seem to have no use. Don’t worry—as you unlock new Elemental Vessels, these will become obtainable, granting you Elemental Points for use in leveling up your Elemental Plot. Unfortunately, yeah, this means you’ll want to backtrack throughout the game to areas with crystals that match your freshly-unlocked Elemental Vessels, in order to gain as many Elemental Points as possible.</p><h2 id="h1185"><a id=""></a><strong>Collect all the Grizzly Syrup you can find</strong></h2><p>Very early in the game, you’ll discover Grizzly Syrup is, well, <em>everywhere </em>in the zones you’re exploring. This syrup can be traded with Dudbear shops—the first of which will unlock a few hours into the story—and are very much worth your time to collect. Dudbears often sell extremely helpful items, including elixirs that permanently boost the stats of whichever character you give them to.</p><figure id="" data-id="0428fa279eb310bdb1d539539698acac" data-recommend-id="image://0428fa279eb310bdb1d539539698acac" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Yum, grizzly syrup." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Yum, grizzly syrup." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0428fa279eb310bdb1d539539698acac" data-recommend-id="image://0428fa279eb310bdb1d539539698acac" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Yum, grizzly syrup." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The first Dudbear shop offers a nice selection of these elixirs (up to three of each!), so finding every Grizzly Syrup in the opening zones can help you to quickly power up a few of your early game characters. The stat boosts may not seem like much on paper, but they will certainly offer a slight edge in battle.<br></p><h2 id="h1186"><a id=""></a><strong>Convert your Golden Clovers into Elemental Points</strong></h2><p>It can take a lot of Elemental Points to unlock a full Elemental Plot tier for each character. If you have certain unlocks you’re looking to score, you can convert the Golden Clovers you’ve found into Elemental Points to earn those extra opportunities to expand your Elemental Plot. See, didn’t I tell you how important picking up all of those yellow items can be?</p><h2 id="h1187"><a id=""></a><strong>Conserve your healing items by breaking pots instead</strong></h2><p>If you’ve been picking up all of the items in the overworld (are you seeing a pattern here?), you’ll have numerous healing items on hand during the opening hours of the game. Even so, there’s no need to use them if you don’t absolutely have to—especially on higher difficulties—so keep an eye out for pots scattered all around each area.</p><figure id="" data-id="b82ac9ec1cb8f40b05bf43f1eabe28e7" data-recommend-id="image://b82ac9ec1cb8f40b05bf43f1eabe28e7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Pots to smash!" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Pots to smash!" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b82ac9ec1cb8f40b05bf43f1eabe28e7" data-recommend-id="image://b82ac9ec1cb8f40b05bf43f1eabe28e7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Pots to smash!" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Breaking these pots will often provide a quick heal that can keep you prepared for upcoming battles without having to deplete your stock of restoratives. You will frequently even find these within boss arenas, helping you to stay in the action while healing up a bit.<br></p><h2 id="h1188"><a id=""></a><strong>Beware of high-level foes in starter areas</strong></h2><p>As you’re exploring some of the initial zones of the game, you’ll stumble upon ruins that you can explore to snag things like treasure chests, Grizzly Syrup, or yellow item spots. However, you may notice some of these areas will have packs of level 50+ enemies standing around. You’ll be able to come back and fight these much later in the game, but for now, keep your eyes peeled for them so you can stay on the outer perimeters of the ruins to avoid triggering a battle you’re not yet prepared for.</p><hr><p>Okay—you’ll hopefully be slightly more prepared for what’s coming your way in <em>Vision of Mana</em>’s opening hours, so here’s hoping your time with the game is absolutely wonderful. And hey, you know what I’m going to say next: pick up all of those damn yellow items. Don’t make me remind you again.<br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This is a returning mechanic we’re taking to a fuller level by mixing it with the core platforming. </p><p>You will also find Muteki (which means invincible in Japanese), a fitting name for Astro’s iron armor that lets him roll around spiky areas, fit inside tight spaces or get blasted like a cannonball! Finally, you’ll also catch a glimpse of Astro turning into a tiny weeny mouse which makes the world, and every surrounding stomp feel huge through the DualSense wireless controller. One of our favorites right there!</p><!-- AD: content -->

There are 300 total bots to rescue in <em>ASTRO BOT</em>, of which 150 are <a title="Platforms > PlayStation [45,888 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation">PlayStation</a> cameos. We put a ton of love into animating these characters, so they re-enact funny moments from their respective games. So, no matter who your favorite PlayStation characters are, you’re bound to have a laugh with them. Once rescued, these little guys can combine to perform group <a title="Genres > Action [2,134 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>s that let you explore more of the hub planet. In the video, you can see a few of the PlayStation characters working together to make a running wall for Astro to get to higher places. </p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/ASTRO-BOT_2024_08-30-24_003.jpg"></a></figure><p>And finally… the part that a lot of you have been wondering and asking about ever since sharing our first trailer: The hero gameplay! So, yes, at a very few key moments in the adventure, Astro will get to borrow some special abilities from some PlayStation heroes. In this video, we can see how Kratos shares the amazing Leviathan Axe for Astro to use in a <a title="Games > God of War (2018) [175 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/god-of-war-2018">God of War</a>-infused level. We won’t talk more about this because we believe it is one of the nicest features to discover by yourselves. We simply hope you find it to be both a faithful and fun tribute to the original material. We’d like to take this chance to thank all the game teams out there who gave us their trust and support to make this big PlayStation celebration possible.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/ASTRO-BOT_2024_08-30-24_004.jpg"></a></figure><p>There are still many other things we have not talked about!

Once rescued, you will be able to take these bots to the new game and add them to your starting crew. And in the last few hours preceding the <em>ASTRO BOT</em> launch, we will hold a special celebration countdown inside <em>ASTRO’s PLAYROOM</em>. Please come and check it out.</p><p>Talking of the final countdown, as we approach <em>ASTRO BOT</em>‘s launch on September 6, you still have time to pre-order the game and receive early unlock of costumes and paints for your DualSpeeder as well as the Digital Soundtrack and Digital Artbook if you opt for the Digital Deluxe Edition.</p><p><strong>Behind the Scenes of <em>ASTRO BOT</em></strong></p><p>And finally, we also invite you to check out our behind-the-scene series.

                <p>Earlier this week, the Kingdom Hearts Union χ Dark Road application was unexpectedly delisted from the Apple and Google Play stores.</p><p>The Kingdom Hearts Union χ Dark Road mobile game contained pivotal lore, key story details, and an in-depth plot for the basis of much of the Kingdom Hearts series. Unchained X--previously known as Union X--and Dark Road did receive a cutscene compilation people can watch to experience the story, but playing the game seems to now be a bygone pasttime for Kingdom Hearts fans.</p><p>This delisting poses great problems since one of the main characters introduced in the mobile game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kingdom-hearts-4-announced-watch-the-first-trailer/1100-6502347/" data-ref-id="1100-6502347">Strelitzia, also appears in the first Kingdom Hearts 4 trailer</a> and is teased to play a major role in the new installment alongside Sora.</p><p>Delisting games abruptly without an announcement is nothing new.

<p>Following on from the (roughly) monthly release cadence that saw&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-version-24-release-date">Version 2.4 arrive in late July</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-version-23-release-date">Version 2.3 before it launch in mid-June</a>, Version 2.5 will arrive on September 10th across PC, PS5, and mobile devices.</p>
<p>Naturally, it's bringing a continuation of the ongoing&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>story, and this time, you'll be uncovering "long-buried secrets within the Shackling Prison", bringing what HoYoverse calls a "trailblazing silkpunk saga" to a climax.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/honkai-star-rail-version-2.5-release-date-feixiao.jpg?itok=ieDTxMuk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/honkai-star-rail-version-2.5-release-date-feixiao.jpg?itok=eGryzDlB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>Version 2.5 will introduce new characters like Feixiao into the mix.</figcaption></figure><p>This new Version also brings the Wardance event, which gives you the chance to net a Tuskpir pet, as well as the opportunity to explore other exciting events hosted by the Xianzhou.</p>
<p>As ever, new five-star characters are also joining the fray in&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>Version 2.5. The first of these is Feixiao, a warrior trained in "all forms of martial arts" who can deal heavy damage with her gunblades or her axe.</p>
<p>She's joined by Lingsha, a summoner who's able to call up the incense beast Fuyuan to assist her in combat. She can deal damage, heal allies, and debuff enemies as well, so she's a valuable ally on the battlefield.</p>
<p>A new four-star character, Moze, is also making his debut in Version 2.5. This update will see reruns for <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-reveals-new-characters-robin-and-boothill-version-21-will-be-revealed">Robin</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-honkai-star-rail-story-trailer-shows-how-deliciously-bad-kafka-can-be">Kafka</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-introduces-new-five-star-character-black-swan">Black Swan</a> in the first half of the cycle, while <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-showcases-new-fire-character-topaz-her-pet-warp-trotter">Topaz</a> will make a return in the second half.</p>

		<p><em>Recently, Rob and Patrick found themselves </em><a href="https://remapradio.com/articles/the-old-internet-was-better/" rel="noreferrer"><em>remembering what it was like on The Old Internet</em></a><em>, a period of loud dial-up modems and sketchy but surprising ways of <s>pirating</s> discovering music. In the same way, it's never been easier to "discover" movies and television shows, but doesn't it feel overwhelming and weird, too?</em></p><p><em>This conversation was prompted </em><a href="https://remapradio.com/podcasts/episodes/my-turn-o-brother-where-art-thou/" rel="noreferrer"><em>by our recent My Turn episode covering O Brother, where art thou?</em></a><em>, a movie Rob, Patrick, and Cado hadn't watched since it came out more than 20 years ago. There's plenty of movies, and plenty of reasons, to go a  long time before revisiting a film, but back in the day, the cycle was different. You had less choice of what to watch, but it also meant a world of curated entertainment by an invisible had of TV executives, or the local video store clerks.</em></p><p><em>Different doesn't mean better, but this week, we tried sitting with what we found attractive and interesting about that time, and considered ways to introduce movie spice into our lives. A little friction, so to speak.</em></p><hr><figure><figcaption><span>Now that's a damn movie. Image Credit: Touchstone Pictures</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Patrick: </strong>Rob, there’s a moment in the latest episode of My Turn where I ponder why it took me more than 20 years to return to <em>O Brother, where art thou?</em>&nbsp;</p><p>Part of my explanation—or theory—is that it’s not a movie where I sit down at the end of a long day and go “okay, time to watch <em>O Brother, where art thou? </em>It’s a weird, charming movie that I’m glad to have spent a few hours revisiting, but upon reflection, what I was most taken by was discovering I hadn’t rewatched it within the confines of, say, a hotel room looping Starz or because it accidentally came up while browsing cable channels a decade ago and going <em>huh</em>.</p><p>We talked about this in the context of music recently, but it’s got me thinking about movies, too. I miss the days of flipping on cable, landing on a movie I’d seen before and getting sucked into a scene, only to find another 90 minutes had gone by and I’d rewatched. Heck, if it was airing on something like TNT, there’s a good chance I watched it with commercials <em>and</em> it was edited up. I discovered new films by renting them at the store and revisited old films chopped up on cable.</p><p>The difference between movies and music is that I keep up with the newest movies. I listen to several movie podcasts with spoiler discussions that I keep in the podcast chamber until I’ve had a chance to see it myself. This combination of internal and external factors are useful motivation for seeing Alien: Romulus but less useful for revisiting O Brother, where art thou?&nbsp;</p><p>My favorite holiday is Halloween, and thus, one of my favorite traditions is coming up with a list of movies for my wife and I to watch over the course of the month. The list is important, because it serves as a guiding post and a checklist of shame for movies that we planned to see in October. (But if we’re being honest, the horror movie watching begins in earnest sometime in September, since it’ll take me nearly two months to watch more than 20 movies, anyway.)</p><p>That list ends up being a combination of films I hold dear that I want to revisit, movies with a significant historical milestone like a 30th anniversary, older movies I’ve overlooked, and new movies that are timed to drop around Halloween time. But one of the core services of the list is an opportunity—a push—to rewatch old movies! It’s my own curated cable channel of horror, in a world where I’m otherwise always looking forward and rarely find myself in situations where I’m revisiting a classic. Actually, let me amend that. Part of the reason I miss cable surfing is because it was full of <em>stuff, not</em> just <em>classics</em>. It’s easy to find reasons to rewatch a movie that holds a special place in your heart, but much harder to find reasons for, well, everything else.</p><p>Do you have a different method for revisiting older movies? Is your relationship to movies different from music, too?</p><figure><figcaption><span>Hellraiser is one of the movies we rewatch every year. Image Credit: Clive Barker</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>ROB: </strong>To quote a movie I suspect we’re not actually going to watch before <em>Megalopolis</em>, “I don’t see any method at all.”</p>

There’s even a bit of faux objectivity, as one reviewer included Ubisoft Connect, a boring story, and lackluster ship battles among the game’s cons and left their list of its pros completely blank. And, despite <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/valve-joke-meme-reviews-unhelpful-steam-update-changes-1851622567&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/valve-joke-meme-reviews-unhelpful-steam-update-changes-1851622567">Valve’s best efforts</a></span>, there are the usual joke reviews.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/rocket-league-leak-teases-possible-urban-legends-event/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/SamLeakss/status/1829504366086123873" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new post</a> on X today, reliable leaker SamLeakss claimed that Rocket League devs could be planning an event featuring Urban Legends.</p>



<p>Both SamLeakss and SpushFNBR state that this information is based on a leaked blog post from the devs. They claim the blog is titled “Rocket League Season 16 Urban Legends Emerge from the Arenas Darkest Depths.”</p>



<p>SamLeakss adds that “This Blog might go live this week, or could be the name of the upcoming Halloween event.” The Halloween season is quickly approaching, so the timing would certainly make sense. </p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Rocket League will soon be getting an "Urban Legends" Event, according to an upcoming leaked Blog Post 👀 </p><p>This Blog might go live this week, or could be the name of the upcoming Halloween event! Slenderman and Bigfoot are extremely likely for collaborations, as Season 16 is set… <a href="https://t.co/Fl4DyJrhMa">pic.twitter.com/Fl4DyJrhMa</a></p></div>— Sam (@SamLeakss) <a href="https://twitter.com/SamLeakss/status/1829504366086123873?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 30, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>







<p>The leaker also lists a few potential urban legends, such as Bigfoot, Mothman, and Slenderman. While this only appeared to be speculation, SamLeakss points out that the corresponding season will be set in a forest.</p>



<p>Notably, SamLeakss and SpushFNBR also suggest that the event’s themed cosmetics could end up in Fortnite, too. That’s based on previous events similarly coinciding with Fortnite.</p>



<p>At this time, the devs did not officially confirm the Urban Legends event or release the leaked blog.</p>



<p>Most recently, Rocket League just released a new Season Rush for Season 15 this week. Psyonix also revealed some competitive rewards, ahead of Season 15 concluding on September 4, 2024.</p>



<p>Rocket League recently appeared at the Esports World Cup 2024, where <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/team-bds-wins-the-rocket-league-esports-world-cup-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Team BDS won against Team Falcons</a> for the championship. The team earned $200,000 in prizing for their victory.</p>

            <p>Nintendo has released another trailer for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a>, giving us our first look at the princess embracing her inner-Link, and wielding a sword and shield.</p>
<p>On the game's release, Zelda will find a mysterious sword hidden within the lands of Hyrule, which will allow her to transform into her sword fighting form. She will be able to fend off enemies and clear obstacles that block her path. However, while certainly handy, this form isn't permanent, and Zelda will need to replenish the sword by collecting energy for it from the Still World.</p>
<p>And, what is the Still World? I hear you ask! Well, this is the world found within those strange, purple aura rifts that now litter the kingdom. The land in this world is "distorted", and Zelda must work with Echoes of Wisdom's companion Tri to negotiate the many twists, turns and dungeons within.</p>

<p>Of course, when not using her sword to overcome any ordeal in her way, she will be able to use her Tri Rod, which allows her to copy and paste items she finds in the world. This can be seen again in the most recent trailer, when Zelda mid-battle whips out a bed to have a little lie down on. I mean, why not. Also, it sure does look like she is going to face off with Volvagia at some point during Echoes of Wisdom. I am sure I recognise <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time">Ocarina of Time</a>'s Fire Temple dragon.</p>
<p>Speaking of returning characters, Dampé will also show up in Echoes of Wisdom, as an "engineer of clockwork gizmos", who has a "knack for creating automatons". The automatons can be used in battle. But, enough from me. You can check out the latest trailer for Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom in the video above. And, I have thoughts on that final frame...</p>
<p>Ahead of the game's launch on 26th September, fans have been busy trying to work out <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fans-react-to-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-reveal-with-timeline-speculation-and-adorable-artwork">where in the series' timeline Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a> sits. Our Ed also took a closer look at Nintendo's previous Echoes of Wisdom trailer, spotting a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/details-from-the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-trailer-you-may-have-missed">few extra details you may have missed</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
