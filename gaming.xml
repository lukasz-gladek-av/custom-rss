              <p>It would be hard to blame Nintendo for becoming used to getting its way when it comes to courts. In case after case, <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-piracy-reddit-mod-archbox-million-2000631966">the Japanese behemoth crushes its prey</a>, scoring millions in damages. But when it comes to the increasingly complex attempt to take down the enormous success of creature-collecting survival game&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>, Nintendo has just taken a big blow, being denied a vital patent.</p> <p>In one of the more peculiar twists of the lengthy battle between <em>Pokémon</em> owners Nintendo and&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em> creators Pocketpair, Nintendo submitted a few new or revised patents to the courts to attempt to retrospectively claim rights to specific gaming mechanics. While some might very sensibly consider the idea of a gaming mechanic being something someone could patent as anathema to all of art and creativity, and to be rank hypocrisy in an industry that’s entirely built on top of mechanics created by previous generations, it’s still somehow a thing. And a thing Nintendo was rather heavily relying on in its court case against <em>Palworld.</em></p>

 <p>When&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-palworld-ai-art-copyright-law-pocketpair-1851186580?_gl=1*21id2z*_ga*MTk4MjkyODk2OS4xNzExNTYxOTM0*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyNjcwMzk2My4xODguMS4xNzI2NzA0MDI1LjYwLjAuMA.."><em>Palworld</em> first appeared in January 2024</a>, pretty much everyone’s reaction was to laugh at the absolutely blatant copies of very familiar Pokémon that appeared in the game. It seems Nintendo wanted to take action, but suing over pastiches of their characters is a tricky business, so eight months later <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-pokemon-palworld-lawsuit-pocketpair-patent-1851654149">the company instead opted for going after&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>‘s creature-capturing mechanics</a>—throwing an orb that then captures the animal—that are most familiar from <em>Pokémon</em> games.</p>

 <p>And it only got weirder. <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-pokemon-palworld-patents-lawsuit-pocketpair-1851692965">When we finally got the details of the lawsuit in November of last year</a>, it became apparent that Nintendo and The Pokémon Company were suing for less than $70,000, and the basis for its case were all patents the company had filed in that year,&nbsp;after&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em> had been released. Three patents were cited, the first based on throwing a Poké Ball to start combat, the second a tweak of an older patent to update it to capturing Pokémon in the wild, and the third the most extraordinary, a claim to rights for a simple transition onto rideable creatures in open worlds.</p>

 <h2>Who hunts the monster hunters?</h2> <p>Jump to today, and it seems this tactic isn’t entirely panning out. <a href="https://gamesfray.com/japan-patent-office-rejects-nintendo-application-relevant-to-palworld-dispute-cites-games-like-ark-as-prior-art-after-third-party-submission/"><em>Games Fray</em></a> noticed that the Japanese Patent Office has suggested two of these three patents are pretty dubious. The issue, it seems, is Nintendo’s attempt to update its former patents to include the more open-world elements of <em>Pokémon&nbsp;</em>games since 2022, despite the wealth of prior examples of such mechanics appearing far earlier in other open-world titles. According to&nbsp;<em>Games Fray</em>, the patent office cited examples like <em>Monster Hunter 4</em>,&nbsp;<em>ARK</em>, and even Pocketpair’s own&nbsp;<em>Craftopia</em>. Oh, and to really stick it home,&nbsp;<em>Pokémon GO</em>.</p>

 <p>Now Nintendo has to decide between abandoning this specific route in the increasingly ridiculous legal action (never forget that while&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em> was absolutely mimicking Pokémon designs, it just simply isn’t a similar type of game, instead focused on survival and crafting), or petitioning the patent office to accept its case.</p> <p>It’s just…the case is gross. Developers shouldn’t be able to patent mechanics, and had it ever been a common part of games design, we simply wouldn’t have video games. Everything you play is built on the shoulders of what came before.&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong</em> may have an argument to be the first ever platform game, but it doesn’t exist without&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crazy_Climber"><em>Crazy Climber</em></a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Panic"><em>Space Panic</em></a>. Pocketpair deliberately provoked Nintendo, and Nintendo foolishly fell for it, and the result is years of expensive litigation for no meaningful results.</p>

              <p><span>This morning, Nintendo casually announced that </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/animal-crossing-new-horizons-switch-2-edition-update-free-2000640118"><i><span>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</span></i><span> is getting a Switch 2 update</span></a><span> to make it run better and use some of the device’s more powerful tech for quality-of-life improvements. Alongside this, Nintendo is also releasing a 3.0 update that includes new features, crossover items, and a whole new creator mode that exists in your character’s dreams. This is the first major update </span><i><span>New Horizons </span></i><span>has received since 2021, and at a certain point, you kind of accept that a game is probably no longer a developer’s priority and they’ve likely shifted their attention elsewhere. So the reveal that a huge update is coming has reawakened the </span><i><span>Animal Crossing </span></i><span>community like a sleeper agent, and they’re in a state of disbelief.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000640149" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000640149"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000640149">© YouTube / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>The Switch 2 upgrade and the 3.0 update are bringing some surprising changes to </span><i><span>New Horizons</span></i><span>, including crossover items from </span><i><span>The Legend of Zelda</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Splatoon</span></i><span>, as well as general Nintendo memorabilia, and, oddly enough, a bunch of Lego furniture pieces. Some </span><i><span>Zelda </span></i><span>characters will even appear as villagers in the new update, which raises questions about whether or not </span><i><span>Animal Crossing</span></i><span> takes place in the </span><i><span>Smash Bros. </span></i><span>multiverse. But more due to the existence of a big new update at all than to any one specific addition or change, fans basically have the zoomies knowing they have a reason to boot up </span><i><span>New Horizons </span></i><span>again.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">nintendo finally remembering animal crossing new horizons exists <a href="https://t.co/AjePhdBlqu">https://t.co/AjePhdBlqu</a> <a href="https://t.co/KFL7kH9goK">pic.twitter.com/KFL7kH9goK</a></p> <p>— 𝔖𝔱𝔢𝔭𝔥 𐚁 ᴺᴹ SEEING ARIANA 7/22| Mrs. Withers (@negressvelaryon) <a href="https://twitter.com/negressvelaryon/status/1983883084803277257?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 30, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">MY UGLY SON IS IN ANIMAL CROSSING <a href="https://t.co/xLPkJg8ojc">pic.twitter.com/xLPkJg8ojc</a></p> <p>— Lacey 👑🩷 (@nekolacey) <a href="https://twitter.com/nekolacey/status/1983886434516803616?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 30, 2025</a></p></blockquote>    <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">animal crossing X Splatoon comes back in the big 2026????

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/govee-smart-led-ceiling-light-is-going-for-peanuts-already-selling-out-fast-after-the-price-drop.1339297/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>You don’t have to change the entire wiring in your home just to improve the lighting situation. A simple ceiling fixture swap can do the job too, and it costs way less than a full-blown lighting overhaul. Even better, we just spotted an already-affordable smart ceiling light going for way less on Amazon.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5108/">The retailer has dropped the price of the Govee Smart RGBIC LED ceiling light to just $50, thanks to a $30 discount on its usual $80 tag</a>. It doesn’t require any complex installations and elevates the vibe of your entire space in no time. The deal is available to both Prime and non-Prime members, but there’s no telling how long it will last. If you’ve been wanting to get that ambiance boost without spending a ton, now is the time to act.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5108/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>16 Million Color Options; Something for Every Mood</h2>
<p>This smart ceiling light comes with two lights; the main light, which uses an RGB+WW configuration, and the backlight featuring RGBIC technology. You get 16 million color options and 71 scene modes to choose from using the Govee Home app. Color temperature ranges from 2200K to 6500K, so it’s easy to go from a warm, soothing light to a brighter one within seconds.</p>
<p>The brightness is also adjustable. You can pick a setting anywhere between 1% and 100%, with a maximum output of 2400 lumens. Want to wind down after a long day? Go for a gentle, warm light that makes it easier to relax. Need to focus on a task? A brighter white light should work well. And if you have other Govee lights at home, you can use the Govee Home App to sync the two together for a bigger, more fun setup.</p>



<p>Speaking of the app, it’s quite easy to use and offers a wide range of customization options to play with. You can control lights, create schedules, and even set timers. The ceiling light also works well with Alexa and Google Assistant, so you can also use your voice to control the setup. Installation is simple and should only take a few minutes, even if it’s your first time setting up a wired ceiling light.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5108/">All things considered, this deal offers a great chance to upgrade the vibe of your space for less.</a> This ceiling light is now down to just $50, but won’t be for long. Get your orders in before it’s too late.</p>

Animal Crossing: New Horizons launched in March 2020 and benefited from play-at-home gaming fueled by lockdowns, but Nintendo failed to capitalize on its popularity with significant DLC throughout the last five years. IGN's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/animal-crossing-new-horizons-review-for-switch">Animal Crossing: New Horizons review</a> returned a 9/10.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mortal-kombat-legacy-kollection-review.1339288/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Even 33 years after its debut, the Mortal Kombat series can still shock and impress with its over-the-top violence and gory spectacle. That feels especially true with the latest game compilation and documentary release from developer Digital Eclipse, which not only brings the earliest Mortal Kombat games back for another round but also offers deeper insight into their history and how this brutal fighting series was brought to life. Though the collection falls just a bit short of executing a proper Fatality due to a few unfortunate omissions and some uneven balance and polish for the games that are here, it still offers enough of a comprehensive and engaging dive into the genre’s most infamous franchise to make for a killer package.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Focusing primarily on the history behind the games that defined the first 10 years of Mortal Kombat, the Legacy Kollection really leans into the formative hits. It starts from the first Mortal Kombat arcade game in 1992 and going through the series' first steps into 3D with Mortal Kombat 4 and the handheld ports of Mortal Kombat Deadly Alliance, which tells the larger story of how Mortal Kombat co-creators Ed Boon and John Tobias went on to shake up the genre.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Included in the Legacy Kollection is the original Mortal Kombat trilogy and its ports, MK4, the Mythologies and Special Forces spin-offs, and the various handheld releases of other MK games. You're free to jump into any game in the collection right from the start, and they are essentially as they were upon release, which includes the memorable quirks, secrets, and exploits that were present. Unfortunately, this also includes the infamous enemy AI from certain versions of the original trilogy, notorious for reading player inputs and snapping back with counterattacks. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It was very jarring to see how brutal and, at times, unfair CPU opponents can be. The arcade ladder for MK2 and MK3 and its variations in particular, even on the lowest settings, can be relentless – though it's at least a great way to see just what ‘90s gamers were up against. However, the collection does make efforts to balance out those hurdles by adding some firsts to the classic games, such as a fleshed out training mode with tuning options, a difficulty setting for most games in the main menu, a Fatality training mode to help nail down the timing of those pesky finishers, and online play for the arcade and even Sega Genesis and SNES releases (though I wasn’t able to test out server stability for this review, and will update it after release if that turns out to be an issue). </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The new rewind feature can help offset the infamously brutal original enemy AI.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the more helpful features that the Legacy Kollection includes is the rewind option, which lets you roll back 30 seconds of playtime in every game. This rewind can be a super useful option for offsetting the often absurd difficulty, but it's also nice to have for trying to perfect your run when going for a particular secret in arcade mode. However, one strange quirk I noticed was that rolling back in the middle of a fight can often supercharge enemy AI, which already has the odds stacked in their favor. In some cases, I was left in a real death loop of attacks whenever I tried rewinding a few seconds, with the AI somehow countering my roll back with a brutal throw or special move. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">To be clear, these are not total remasters. While some healthy new features come with the collection, the classic games are essentially as they were, with only quality-of-life updates and visual tweaks to dress them up for modern platforms. You can even add some neat visual filters and borders to simulate the old-school arcade or home experience, or just strip it back to the essentials. The collection offers a solid, well-made container for these classics, and I appreciated that it can even make most of them look sharp on my modern display.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Legacy Kollection doesn't just focus on the key arcade games; it also includes many ports released after and alongside them, which is how many people in the '90s played them. It's such a great decision to include the supplementary ports for the Sega Genesis, Super Nintendo, and Game Boy as they help show just how popular Mortal Kombat was and how much work went into each release. I was too young to visit arcades on my own, so I ended up forming a stronger attachment to the Sega Genesis ports of the original MK games. Even though it's not totally up to the standards of the arcade releases, the ports still hit the spot when it comes to showing off that classic MK combat and spectacle. I couldn't help but feel nostalgic when I heard the Sega Genesis' scratchy rendition of the Dead Pool theme. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, parts of the package do feel more like curiosities, showing how early Mortal Kombat ran on more modest hardware. For instance, playing the Game Boy and Game Gear versions of Mortal Kombat 1 can be an eyesore. The handheld-sized experience is blown up to fit a larger screen, and the gameplay is so sluggish and unresponsive that it can feel disorienting. I would have preferred an option to shrink the screen to a more visually appealing scope, but that's not available in the collection. Still, I'm glad to have them for posterity's sake, as they are vital parts of MK history.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It's such a great decision to include so many supplementary ports.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I especially loved to have a new way to play the PS1 edition of Mortal Kombat Trilogy, which is essentially the Super Smash Bros. of the MK series with its massive roster. The Legacy Kollection also improves it with greatly reduced load times, which makes it likely the best version of MK Trilogy available. It's a fantastic addition to the overall collection.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the most anticipated inclusions in the collection is the fabled WaveNet release of Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, an updated version of the arcade game that rebalanced the combat, featured Noob Saibot and Human Smoke as unlockable characters, and also had the then-rare opportunity to play online against other arcade players. This is such a tremendous find, making the collection feel all the more comprehensive as it allows long-time fans to play the 'lost' release of UMK3, and it runs incredibly well. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, the one game that feels the most unpolished is Mortal Kombat 4, which is appropriate given that it's the series' first crack at 3D combat in the arcade. The version included in the package is the finalized arcade release, which has some odd visual and gameplay bugs. Some of the new additions with the Legacy Kollection seem to magnify its quirks, too, such as stage geometry popping out of view or obstructing the action, or instances in the training mode with characters getting stuck out of bounds. In that way, it feels like a letdown given this is the only modern way to play MK4.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Mortal Kombat Legacy Kollection Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Interestingly, the Legacy Kollection includes playable versions of some of the franchise's early spin-offs, including Mortal Kombat: Mythologies - Sub-Zero and Mortal Kombat: Special Forces, which have not been seen since their initial releases. Instead of fighting games, Mythologies and Special Forces try to inject the over-the-top violence and spectacle into action stages. Unfortunately, the two spin-offs have not gotten better with age, even with some minor improvements to controls. They are easily the weakest games of the package, being both frustrating and unintentionally hilarious to sit through. But the inclusion of these games is still very much welcome because they were, at the time, ambitious swings for the series to try something different. It's commendable that the collection includes these misfires and gives them equal attention alongside the hits. It also highlights that they served as stepping stones for more well-rounded spin-offs that were to come. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">We get to see the series' growth well in the documentary mode, which is where the Legacy Kollection truly shines as a fantastic celebration. Much like Digital Eclipse's work on The Making of Karateka and Tetris Forever, the documentary mode is displayed as an explorable timeline that shows factoids about the series, interviews, archival footage of development, deleted characters and special moves, and even classic commercials and arcade advertising for each of the key games.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Alessandro's Favorite Fighting Games</h3><p>Here are some of my favorite fighting games that I've played over the years. Whether it's 2D or 3D fighters, I love to learn new characters and find the best ways to create some great combos.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The documentary mode is a fantastic history lesson, not just on the series but also on video game development and shifting pop culture during the 1990s. With new interviews of key creatives from Williams Entertainment, Midway, and Netherrealm Studios, the documentary offers a detailed account of the developers' roots in pinball games and how Mortal Kombat became a lightning rod for the backlash against violence in media during the ‘90s. My favorite details were seeing how Mortal Kombat became a pop culture hit and how the developers felt about fans who thought Mortal Kombat 3's run-button changed the meta too much. It's a fantastic dive behind the scenes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All in all, the Legacy Kollection has some truly great inclusions and additional features, but I couldn't help but feel a little let down by some game omissions that would have helped round it out further. Along with the lack of the N64 release of Mortal Kombat Trilogy – which had a fun and experimental 3v3 mode – Mortal Kombat 4 Gold edition and the console versions of MK: Deadly Alliance not being included really make for an odd choice given that they were the series's more confident steps into 3D. This also results in the documentary mode skimming over certain details in the timeline due to the absence of these games. Though I recognize the core focus was on the main games within the first 10 years of the series, and that other outside or technical issues likely prevented these games from being included, it’s still a bit disappointing to see the package lose steam towards the end, even with how impressive the Game Boy port renditions are.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/mortal-kombat-legacy-kollection-review]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Amazon has reportedly cancelled its second attempt at developing a Lord of the Rings MMO, following <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-cuts-hit-video-game-division-reducing-work-on-mmos/1100-6535769/" data-ref-id="1100-6535769">a new round of layoffs at Amazon Games</a>. The news came from former senior gameplay engineer Ashleigh Amrine, who revealed on LinkedIn that she and others working on the project had been let go (via <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/amazon-have-reportedly-cancelled-their-lord-of-the-rings-mmo-again" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Rock Paper Shotgun</a>). This comes shortly after Amazon also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-world-aeternum-is-ending-new-content-after-season-10/1100-6535786/" data-ref-id="1100-6535786">announced it would stop developing New World</a>, its colonial fantasy MMO, though servers will remain active until 2026.</p><p>"It's always tough to see such a strong team go through something like this," Amrine wrote in her post yesterday. "I've been lucky to work with some of the most skilled, creative, and kind developers I've ever met here."</p><p>This new Lord of the Rings MMO was first announced in 2023, after Amazon partnered with Embracer Group, the current owner of Middle-earth's rights. It was described as a "persistent open-world adventure" that would span events from The Hobbit through The Lord of the Rings. However, details about the game were scarce, and now it seems the project has ended before reaching the public. This follows Amazon’s first attempt in 2019, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-amazons-lord-of-the-rings-mmo-was-canceled/1100-6507052/" data-ref-id="1100-6507052">which collapsed in 2021</a> after a contractual dispute when its partner, Leyou, was bought by Tencent.</p><p>Last August, Amazon Games VP Christoph Hartmann said part of the challenge <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-still-trying-to-find-the-hook-for-lotr-mmo/1100-6526064/" data-ref-id="1100-6526064">had been finding the right "hook,"</a> something that would make a Lord of the Rings MMO stand out. He said the team didn't want to simply repeat what's already been done, noting that the long-running <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-lord-of-the-rings-online/">The Lord of the Rings Online</a> (which launched in 2007 and still receives updates) already fills that space. Hartmann added that MMOs are "tough" to make because they’re expensive and require consistent new content to keep players satisfied--a big risk even for a company like Amazon.</p><p>At the time, Hartmann also mentioned that Amazon Games is shifting away from being an MMO-only publisher, focusing more on other genres like action RPGs--such as the recently launched <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/king-of-meat/">King of Meat</a>. Meanwhile, The Rings of Power TV series continues separately, with its second season exploring Sauron's rise--a reminder that Amazon's Middle-earth ambitions remain alive, just not in MMO form.</p>

Like previous Switch 2 editions of original Switch games, New Horizons will be bolstered with new next-gen features and additional content. Nintendo is also bolstering New Horizons with a huge content update next year for both versions of the game, introducing a new destination, brand collaborations, and more.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7nODHyw3lgs"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7nODHyw3lgs" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><h2>Switch 2 Edition Features</h2><p>Animal Crossing: New Horizons - Switch 2 Edition launches digitally and physically on January 15 for $64.99; existing owners can buy an upgrade pack for $4.99. This version boasts improvements such as higher-resolution visuals (4K while docked), and players can utilize the Joy-Con 2's mouse controls to more intuitively interact with mechanics like decorating, writing bulletin board messages, and creating custom designs.</p><p>A new in-game megaphone (purchased at Nook’s Cranny) utilizes the console’s built-in microphone, allowing players to locate residents by verbally calling them. Animal Crossing on Switch 2 also supports 12-player online sessions, but only with players who are also playing on the same hardware (meaning original Switch owners cannot join). Speaking of playing with friends, CameraPlay allows users to see each other’s faces while playing together, similar to how the feature is used in Mario Kart World.</p>

<h2>Free Content Update Ver. 3.0</h2><p>A free content update (Ver. 3.0) also arrives on January 15 for the Switch and Switch 2 versions of New Horizons that introduces a resort hotel run by Kapp ‘n’s family. Opening on the pier, this destination lets players bring guests from off the island and you’ll decorate their hotel rooms with various themes, find new furniture and clothing at the souvenir shop, and dress mannequins with outfits that guests can wear.</p><p>Additionally, the update sees Mr. Resetti return with the new Reset Service, which instantly cleans and/or stores placed items around your home, the beach, or the entire island. Home Storage will be upgraded to hold 9,000 items and players can now store trees, shrubs, and flowers there.</p><p>While sleeping, players can visit Luna’s New Dream World, which whisks them to the new Slumber Island destination. This allows players with a Nintendo Switch Online subscription to design a special island from scratch. You can save up to three Slumber Islands, which can be populated with residents from your home island. Perhaps the most appealing aspect of Slumber Island is that other players – several, in fact – can visit and help decorate their friends’ Slumber Islands; the trailer shows upwards of six buddies terraforming and decorating a Slumber Island together.</p><p>Nintendo is introducing new items based on several collaborations. First, it’s tapping into its own history with new items modeled after Nintendo hardware. From the Famicom and Switch 2 to more obscure items like the Ultra Hand and even the Love Tester, players can purchase these items at the souvenir store. Switch Online subscribers can even interact with certain consoles to play classic titles such as Ice Climbers and Dr. Mario.</p><p>A collaboration with Lego brings new Lego versions of items such as the workbench, beds, clothing, and much more. These come in various color combinations.</p><p>Scanning select Zelda amiibo introduces new themed furniture and decor, such as a Zonai authenticator from Breath of the Wild/Tears of the Kingdom, rupees and heart tanks, outfits and hairstyles based on Link, and other fun references to multiple Zelda titles. Lastly, two Zelda characters can visit and become residents of your island: Tulin and Mineru from Tears of the Kingdom.</p><p>Like Zelda, using select Splatoon amiibo allows new versions of Cece and Viché (introduced in Animal Crossing: New Leaf’s Welcome Amiibo update) to visit the island, who now sport designs modeled after Splatoon characters. Splatoon items will also become available for purchase.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em>Will you be jumping back into Animal Crossing: New Horizons on Switch 2 or to check out the new update?

But amongst all the Bells and whistles announced, you might have missed the news that retro Nintendo games are also returning to the series. Hurrah!</p>
<p>Yes, you will once again be able to play 8-bit and higher-bit classics in Animal Crossing, just like you could in the original game back on GameCube! However, there are some caveats.</p><div><figure data-videoid="HpG4hedNmz8" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HpG4hedNmz8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytHpG4hedNmz8" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HpG4hedNmz8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HpG4hedNmz8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38f0b5kyruhx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>837k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/surprise-animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition-arrives-next-year">According to the announcement</a>, there'll be a new resort hotel added on the pier in the 3.0 update where you can help out and, by increasing its "island brand recognition", a souvenir shop will start stocking new items. On one of the tabs labelled 'Special', you'll find a host of retro Nintendo hardware, including the Ultra Hand, the Love Tester, and a bunch of lovely Nintendo consoles. <em>Yaaaaas.</em></p>
<p>Buying these with the new currency lets you set them up in your room as you'd expect. However, if you've got an active NSO subscription, you can play "a select classic game on each system." <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/ice_climber">Ice Climber</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/clu_clu_land">Clu Clu Land</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/dr_mario">Dr. Mario</a> (for the Game Boy) are shown in the clip.</p>

<p>The consoles shown include a Switch 2, Famicom, NES, Famicom Disk System, Game Boy, and Super Famicom, so it looks like we're going up to at least 16-bit this time!</p>
<p>For those who weren't there, the first <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/animal_crossing">Animal Crossing</a> game had a selection of NES games, including games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/donkey_kong">Donkey Kong</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/excitebike">Excitebike</a>, that you could obtain and actually play <em>in</em> the game long, long before Virtual Console turned up and having retro titles on your current Nintendo system was a matter of course.</p>
<p>So, the retro games are back in AC! But only one per system, and probably not the classics you were hoping for.</p>
<p>Of course, there's no reason to be glum because all the games are playable in a more straightforward way via NSO itself. Still, we kind of hope Nintendo might decide to let you play <em>all</em> the games in the NSO library through this Animal Crossing wrapper. Pointless? Sure. But delightful? Absolutely.</p>
<figure data-uuid="67abf0000c4e3"><a title="Animal Crossing New Horizons Retro Games" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/67abf0000c4e3/animal-crossing-new-horizons-retro-games.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>That arcade cab looks pretty great, too, although we doubt 'Space Blaster' will be playable. C'mon, Nintendo, put <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/radar_scope">Radar Scope</a> on it! — <em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Elsewhere, a bunch of cool collabs with other Nintendo games will see <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/animal-crossing-new-horizons-is-getting-collabs-with-lego-splatoon-and-zelda"><strong>Zelda</strong> and <strong>Splatoon</strong> items crop up in New Horizons</a>.</p>
<p><em>Do you think they'll get N64, the upcoming Virtual Boy, or GameCube in there too? Is there a scenario (stick with me here) where we could be playing the original GC Animal Crossing NES games in the original GC Animal Crossing in <strong>this</strong> Animal Crossing?</em></p>
<p><em>Woah. Let us know which game you think they'll make accessible for the other systems below.</em></p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/animal_crossing_new_horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a> has just revealed that it's getting an absolutely huge update on <strong>15th January 2026</strong> alongside a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a>. It's stuffed full of new features, characters, and an entire hotel. But maybe the biggest update comes in the form of some brand new collaborations.</p>
<p>First up, after several successful sets of Animal Crossing Lego Sets, Lego is <em>actually</em> coming to the game itself. You'll be able to buy a whole suite of Lego-themed furniture and clothes via Nook Shopping, meaning you'll be able to live your brick life fantasy on your island.</p>
<p>You better save those Bells up, then. We're already eyeing up that arcade game as our first purchase. No, we don't <em>need</em> a sofa, this is way more important...</p>
<p>Next, we have a Legend of Zelda collab which will net you some gorgeous themed furniture and clothes if you have compatible Zelda amiibo.</p>

<p>There's lots of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild">Breath of the Wild</a>-themed stuff like a Guardian (it's inactive, don't worry) and a Zonai Device, but you can spy <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/legend_of_zelda_majoras_mask">Majora's Mask</a>, the Master Sword, Tri (from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_echoes_of_wisdom">Echoes of Wisdom</a>) and wallpaper and flooring themed after the forest where the Master Sword resides.</p>
<p>Similarly, Splatoon amiibo will also unlock some extremely colourful furniture (note: Big Man Sofa) and clothing. It looks like these are buyable via Nook Shopping once you've scanned the amiibo in.</p>
<p>And, two more amiibo bonuses. Scanning in Zelda amiibo will unlock Mineru and Tulin as villagers, while Splatoon amiibo will allow you to get Cece and Viché. And they look <em>adorable.</em></p>

<p>Goodness. That's a <em>lot</em>, and it's not even the bulk of 3.0! There's a whole range of stuff being added to the game next January, with playable retro games consoles making their grand return (kind of!) alongside tons of quality of life updates.</p>
<p>And, don't forget, update 3.0 is <em>free</em>.</p>

<p>In a new trailer, Nintendo reveals that the game, which passed its fifth anniversary back in March, will be getting enhanced visuals, Joy-Con 2 mouse control support, and "expanded online play" on January 15th.

<p>Those outfits may then be worn by villagers around your town, as well as people who come to visit your island via&nbsp;<em>New Horizons</em>' online play mode. Make sure you dress up those lobby mannequins nicely!</p>

<p>Everyone's favorite mole Mr. Resetti is making a reappearance in this update as well; he'll help you to reset parts of your island so that you can clean them up, and he'll get rid of things like flowers, custom designs, and objects you don't want lying around.</p>

<p>There's tons of other new stuff coming as part of this update, so check out the trailer below to get the rundown on everything you can expect to land in&nbsp;<em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons&nbsp;</em>in January.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Now is a great time for a laptop upgrade. Even though Black Friday and Cyber Monday are still weeks away, Amazon has already started rolling out some hard-to-miss tech deals, but it’s not always easy to spot the ones that are truly worth it. That’s where we come in, and we just found an incredible offer for those finally ready to say goodbye to their old, noisy machine.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5107/">Right now on Amazon, the 17.3-inch HP 2025 laptop is down to $800, after a huge $2,500 drop in its retail price</a>. This version sits between the entry-level and high-end configurations of the same model, and is appropriate for everyday work and play. Even better, you’re getting free accessories with your purchase, too! You can rely on this machine for your office tasks, creative projects, streaming, and even light gaming. The deal, however, is a limited-time one, and there’s no telling how long it’ll stick around. So if this one checks your boxes, it’s smart to grab it while it’s still live.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5107/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Windows 11 Pro Ready to Go</h2>
<p>This laptop runs on Windows 11 Pro, which comes pre-installed. You’re getting Intel’s 10-core i5-1334U processor, which ramps up to 4.6GHz, so it’s got plenty of power for resource-intensive tasks. Those who often need to work with different applications at once will appreciate the 32GB of RAM that actively prevents lag, plus a 1TB SSD, which makes for faster boot times. You can easily jump between a ton of tabs and programs without slowdown, while also keeping all your important files in a single place.</p>
<p>The display is also bigger than the standard options out there. You will enjoy impressive visuals on the large 17.3-inch HD+ BrightView display that’s suited for both indoor and outdoor use. Expect vivid, vibrant colors and impressive detail, regardless of what’s playing. There’s also an HP TrueVision 720p HD camera with a privacy shutter paired with dual microphones for clearer video calls.</p>



<p>Connectivity options include Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.3, alongside a wide range of ports to connect your essentials. The freebies include the pre-installed Windows 11 Pro we mentioned above, plus an external CD/DVD drive, a portable hard drive, a wireless mouse, a cleaning cloth, dust plugs, and a webcam privacy cover. Basically, there’s no need to buy anything extra to get started.</p>
<p>Snag the discount before it vanishes for good!</p>

<li><em>Letting the community guide the direction of the game</em></li>
<li><em>Give us the option to build more content as we go</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Without early access, we would be much more limited on the scope of what we can do. You guys have been really great at providing feedback, and I want that to continue as we expand the campaign. For now, we are launching with the first “chapter” of the campaign, which takes place in Texas. We are planning to do 2 additional chapters during early access, as well as expanding with side / contract missions. We will be posting an early access roadmap before launch, which will give some more info on what you can expect.”</em></p>

<p>The team also confirmed three more helicopters for the game including the Mi-24 Hind, the Bell 222 Sky Wolf, and the UH-1 Huey. Every helicopter in Cleared Hot will have its own stats, along with various upgrades to each one’s weapons, which are split between light and heavy. General upgrades will also be available for each helicopter model.</p>

			<p>Today, Nintendo announced that its <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/software/switch.html">second-best-selling Nintendo Switch game</a>, Animal Crossing: New Horizons, is getting a Nintendo Switch 2 version, with graphical updates and features that take advantage of the Switch 2 and its improved hardware. Today's Animal Crossing news isn't just for Nintendo Switch 2 players; a new 3.0 title update is also on its way, which will be available to players on both Nintendo Switch and Switch 2.</p>



<p>The new Switch 2 version of Animal Crossing: New Horizons leans on the updated hardware for several updates, each shown off in a new trailer, which also goes over the features coming in the 3.0 title update. </p>



<p>Both the Switch 2 version of New Horizons and the 3.0 title update will be available on January 15, 2026, and if you already have New Horizons, you'll be able to upgrade to the Switch 2 edition of the game by purchasing an upgrade pack. The 3.0 title update is free for all players.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>When it comes to the graphical updates included in the Switch 2 edition of New Horizons, Nintendo doesn't exactly go into details, but does showcase that the Switch 2 version will look much sharper compared to what you get on Nintendo Switch. </p>



<p>The more significant updates seem to be how New Horizons takes advantage of features like mouse controls on the Joy-Con 2 controllers and the microphone on Switch 2, which now lets you call out to your island guests to more easily find where they are. Also, rather than having eight players come and visit your island, you and eleven of your friends who were all wealthy enough to buy a Switch 2 can all play together with up to twelve players capable of visiting one island on the Switch 2 edition.</p>



<p>The free 3.0 title update meanwhile adds new amiibo functionality with compatible Legend of Zelda and Splatoon amiibos allowing players to add up to four new characters to their island, along with new items and furniture styles with which to decorate their island. There's also a new LEGO collaboration on the way which has a slew of LEGO items for players to decorate and use.</p>



<p>New Horizons also gets a new hotel with the 3.0 update, where players can run and unlock new items and outfits from, as you'll decorate the various rooms in the hotel to suit a guest's specific needs.</p>



<p>New Horizons launched in March 2020, and has since become one of the best-selling first-party games from Nintendo on the Nintendo Switch. </p>



<p>When we <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/animal-crossing-new-horizons-essential-social-sim/">reviewed it at launch, we gave it a 9.4/10</a>, and what we wrote back then still stands: "<em>When I saw that I had played 40 hours of Animal Crossing: New Horizons, I was shocked because it didn't feel like that long at all. And that's because it still has that Animal Crossing magic. I played for what felt like five minutes a day, but in reality was multiple hours of fishing, bug catching, material collecting, crafting, and more. I feel like a complete newbie still, like I have so much to do, so much more to learn, and I can't wait to see more. I have to. I'm going to continue playing, and build my perfect island. Animal Crossing: New Horizons has its hooks in me, and while I still don't know if it's my favorite Animal Crossing game, it's undoubtedly one of the best.</em>"</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/arc-raiders-players-blasted-with-lost-server-connections-as-it-surges-to-over-160-000-concurrent-players.1339216/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-pvpve-extraction-maps-embark-studios-2000639945"><em>Arc Raiders</em> launches today</a> across PC and console and it’s already tearing up the charts on Steam. The influx of players means some are experiencing day-one server issues, even as the extraction shooter is propelled into the Valve-owned storefront’s top-10 most-played games.</p> <p>Despite being $40, Embark Studios’ latest PVPVE game is already climbing past free-to-play games like <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>&nbsp;and <em>Apex Legends</em>. It’s currently ranked seventh overall with over <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/mostplayed">160,000 concurrent players</a> and remains the best-selling game across all of Steam at the moment. Not bad for a Thursday release when most people are still at work or in school.</p>

 <p>But the initial flood of players did bring with it some early server problems. Some players got kicked from the game with a screen that read “<a href="https://twitter.com/kelskiYT/status/1983830108210426328?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1983830108210426328%7Ctwgr%5E49b2d22e0e8daecd8b18ce1cd77d1d94e3502fbc%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eurogamer.net%2Farc-raiders-online-connection-error-launch-server-problem">online connection error</a>” while others faced a problem called “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1ojwo7x/what_does_this_mean_is_it_my_wifi_or_is_it_the/#lightbox">network timeout</a>” in which the game said it had failed to retrieve their data from the backend services. Fortunately, it doesn’t sound like these issues were super widespread and they appear to be resolving as we get further from when <em>Arc Raiders</em> first went live earlier today.</p>

   <p>The pitch for <em>Arc Raiders</em> is straightforward enough. You play as a fighter scavenging through a post-apocalyptic world that feels trapped in the surreal analog years of the late ’70s, early ’80s in the best way. You collect loot, battle other players, and try to take down powerful computer-controlled machines called Arcs. It’s from Embark Studios, which also shipped <em>The Finals</em>, and shows potential for helping the extraction shooter genre break out beyond the notoriously hardcore communities that usually play them.</p>

 <p>It’s currently sitting at a rating of over 80 percent positive on Steam with 1,000 reviews in so far. “I didn’t know bots could hold grudges, but apparently Embark Studios wrote the AI like, ‘If player breathes, hunt player,'” wrote one early player. “Each encounter feels alive, unpredictable, and truly earned,” another wrote. A third was more succinct: “Pew, pew, pew.”</p>

 <p>But not everyone’s buzzing. There have been calls for less emphasis on paid cosmetics and the addition of a solo mode. Some players have also called for a PVE-only option, speculating that the launch would be that much bigger if <em>Arc Raiders</em> had gone the <em>Helldivers 2</em> route. “<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1808500/discussions/0/811335793676561765/">PvE Isn’t a Threat, Karen – It’s Just Another Way to Play</a>,” reads one of the most active threads on the Steam Discussion page. Some hardcore fans don’t want the option “diluting” the experience. Others think the extraction shooter could be one of the biggest games of the year with it.</p>

 <h2>Is there AI slop in <em>Arc Raiders</em>?</h2> <p>You might have noticed an generative AI warning on the<em> Arc Raiders</em> Steam page. “During the development process, we may use procedural- and AI-based tools to assist with content creation,” it reads. “In all such cases, the final product reflects the creativity and expression of our own development team.” Embark’s previous game also used generative AI for its in-match announcer commentary.</p>

 <p>“<em>Arc Raiders</em> in no way uses generative AI whatsoever,” design director Virgil Watkins claimed during a new interview <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/arc-raiders/generative-ai-use">with <em>PCGamesN</em></a>. “We use something called machine learning, or reinforcement learning, and that’s to do with the locomotion for our larger drones with multiple legs, but there’s no generative content whatsoever.”</p> <p>Studio boss Patrick Soderlund elaborated on that process in a different interview with <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/arc-raiders-the-game-that-dares-to"><em>The Game Business</em> this week</a>. “If you ask for [development that’s] 100 times faster, you have to take what you know and basically throw that away and then start really thinking about what type of modifications and transformation do we need to go through in order to completely change the way that we approach this,” he said. “So that’s when we came into procedurally generated content, to using AI and machine learning to some extent in even the content creation pipelines, to what types of tools we build, and realizing that a lot of these tools that we’ve been working with for so long stem from software that’s 25 to 30 years old.”</p> <p>While <em>Arc Raiders</em> also uses the text-to-speech AI for voicing certain character lines, it doesn’t sound like the visuals or any other objects directly visible in the game were made with generative AI tools. Whether the development team’s assurances get your slop senses tingling is another question entirely.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/govee-year-round-led-smart-lights-are-practically-free-for-halloween-light-up-holidays-without-overspending-2000639108</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Even people who&nbsp;<em>really</em> love the holidays will admit that scaling a ladder to hang festive holiday lights, and then doing it all over again to take them down weeks later, is a massive pain. It’s not a stretch to say that people standing on rickety ladders in freezing weather have spent decades wishing for a solution.</p>
<p>It’s also not a stretch to say that Govee’s smart outdoor LED strip lights are that solution, because they’re weatherproof and completely customizable to fit every holiday and special event, and even just serve as accent lighting for your home. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5106/">Amazon has a limited-time deal taking 25% off the price of a 98.4-foot package of Govee smart outdoor LED lights, giving you the option to retire the rickety ladder forever for just $120</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5106/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Every Holiday Covered</h2>
<p>You know the drill — Christmas lights are green and red, or all-white; Halloween lights are orange, and if you really go all-out with the festive decorating, green for St. Patrick’s Day, red for Valentine’s Day, and so on. That used to mean more or less constant installation and removal, but these Govee LED lights have virtually limitless color possibilities, and 64 vivid festive presets to cover every occasion. With the Govee Home app you can also design and save your own color schemes and effects, including ones where the lights dance in sync with music.</p>
<p>The Govee Home app is the key to complete control and customization of your outdoor lights, including timers, brightness, scenes, colors, and more via Wi-Fi. Voice control with Alexa, Google Home, and other smart home assistants is also easy to set up.</p>



<h2>Year-Round Decor</h2>
<p>The Govee LED light strips and control box are both rated IP65 for waterproofing, and the power adapter is rated IP44. The light strips are made of durable, transparent silicone, and they operate in temperatures ranging from 140 degrees Fahrenheit to minus-22, which means once you complete the easy installation of the three 32.8-foot LED strips with the included light clip sets, you can leave them up for good. And no, it’s not like the old lights where if one went dead, the entire strip gives up.</p>
<p>It might be on the late side to <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5106/">take this Amazon deal for 25% off and buy your Govee smart outdoor lights for just $120</a> in time to get them up for Halloween 2025, but they’ll look amazing for Christmas and every holiday or special occasion for years to come, and they’ll provide beautiful accent lighting anytime you want. You’re just one click away from making your last trip up that ladder.</p>

Amid reports <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-reportedly-gutting-its-video-game-division-as-part-of-14000-company-wide-job-cuts">Amazon has 'gutted' its video games division</a> as part of 14,000 company wide job cuts earlier this week, one former developer has suggested its Lord of the Rings MMO has also been cancelled.
</p>
<p>
On Tuesday, Bloomberg shared an internal memo to staff from Steven Boom (Amazon's vice president of Audio, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a>, and Game) announcing "significant role reductions" across Amazon Game Studios. Boom added the job cuts were a result of the company's decision to halt a "significant amount of our first-party AAA game development work – specifically around MMOs". Amazon is yet to reveal the exact number of employees affected within its games division.
</p>
<p>
Following that announcement, impacted staff began announcing their departure from Amazon on social media, with the ensuing messages suggesting teams from two projects - New World and the still-unreleased Lord of the Rings MMO <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-announces-fresh-stab-at-turning-the-lord-of-the-rings-into-an-mmo">announced back in 2023</a> - were both impacted. However, a LinkedIn post by former senior gameplay engineer Ashleigh Amrine suggests the Lord of the Rings MMO will now never see the light of day.
</p>
<p>
"This morning I was part of the layoffs at Amazon Games," Amrine <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7388971058642522112/">wrote</a>, "alongside my incredibly talented peers on New World and our fledgling Lord of the Rings game (y'all would have loved it)."
</p>

If Amazon's Lord of the Rings MMO <em>is</em> cancelled, it would mark the second such project to die a death under the company's watch. It previously <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-is-co-developing-the-free-to-play-lord-of-the-rings-mmo">announced a different Lord of the Rings MMO</a> back in 2019, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-cancels-its-lord-of-the-rings-mmo">scrapped it amid reports of a dispute with Chinese mega-corp Tencent</a>. Eurogamer has contacted Amazon for comment on the fate of is more recent Tolkien MMO.
</p><p>
As for New World, Amazon has now confirmed the MMO <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-isnt-closing-mmo-new-world-right-away-but-it-wont-guarantee-the-life-of-the-game-past-2026">will no longer receive updates</a>, but will remain playable for now. The company has guaranteed servers will remain live "through 2026" and promised to give "a minimum of six months' notice" before making changes that would impact its availability. More details on its future are due "in the coming months".

<figure><a title="Luigi's Mansion Review - Screenshot 1 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159977/large.jpg"></a></figure><p><em>This review was originally published in October 2010. We're updating and republishing it to mark the game's arrival in the</em> <em><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/every-nintendo-switch-online-gamecube-game-on-switch-2-ranked">Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack GameCube library</a> on Switch 2</em><em>. Enjoy!</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Nintendo has always had a dark side. Though it's built up a name for itself as a family-friendly company, every so often, when it can be contained no longer, its dark side manifests in the form of a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_metroid">Super Metroid</a> or a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/legend_of_zelda_majoras_mask">Majora's Mask</a>. But while we expect a touch of gloom and misery in our Zeldas and Metroids, it may strike you as more than a bit curious that one of Nintendo's darkest adventures stars a platforming hero previously known for some of the happiest, most family-friendly games on earth.</p>
<p>But then, nearly every aspect of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/luigis_mansion">Luigi's Mansion</a> will strike many as more than a bit curious. Nintendo had launched each of its three previous consoles with a bright and colourful Mario platformer, yet for the GameCube the company chose a dark, atmospheric title starring the mascot's lesser-known brother. Not only that, but Luigi's Mansion was about as far from a traditional Mario game as it could possibly get. It didn't even feature a jump button.</p>
<figure><a title="Luigi's Mansion Review - Screenshot 2 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159982/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>Perhaps it's for these reasons that Luigi's Mansion didn't get the recognition and reception Nintendo had hoped, at least at launch. It simply wasn't the game that people were expecting. It's a shame, really, because in actuality it's quite a remarkable little game, a unique and atmospheric experience that's as fun as it is technologically impressive.</p>
<p>The premise is a simple one: Luigi has won a mansion in a contest... except he doesn't remember entering any contest. To see what the deal is, he heads out to check out the mansion for himself.</p>
<p>Once inside, he is almost immediately confronted by a gang of disgruntled ghosts; thankfully, the notorious Professor E. Gadd (creator of such classic commodities as the Portraitificationizer and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/super_mario_sunshine">Mario Sunshine</a>'s F.L.U.D.D.) comes to your aid with one of his latest inventions. He explains that Mario is being held captive inside. Naturally, Luigi must find a way to save him.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/retro/accessibility-report/2195/embed @ 1761835058 -->
<p>In addition to your trusty flashlight, the Professor equips you with two of his cleverest inventions to survive the haunted abode: the Game Boy Horror (GBH) and the Poltergust 3000.</p>
<p>The former — which is quite literally a Game Boy Color with a more groan-inducing name — might be likened to the Scanning Visor in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/metroid_prime">Metroid Prime</a>. The GBH screen is sort of like a window, and pressing the 'X' button lets you look through it and examine your surroundings. This item becomes useful as you encounter some of the game's trickier bosses, as it allows you to scan them and get insight into their possible weak points.</p>
<p>However, the focus is undoubtedly on the Poltergust 3000, which served as both an incredibly fun gameplay mechanic and a technological showcase for the then-new console. When used in tandem with the flashlight, the vacuum-like device is simply a way of sucking up the ghastly inhabitants – first shine your light on the ghost to catch it off guard, then quickly suck it up using the 'R' button and control stick.</p>
<figure><a title="Luigi's Mansion Review - Screenshot 3 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159976/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>However, it quickly reveals itself to be much more than a simple vacuum. The GameCube's pressure-sensitive trigger buttons were quite cutting-edge when the system launched, and Luigi's Mansion was one of the first titles to showcase their use. Being able to precisely control the airflow of the Poltergust sets the groundwork for some pretty neat boss fights and puzzles, and this, in conjunction with the game's still-impressive physics engine, makes interacting with the environment a real joy.</p>
<p>The way in which your vacuum is able to affect things like table cloths, shelves, beach balls, and carpeting is still really cool even today, and goes a long way in pulling you into the game. Interacting with the environment doesn't go unrewarded, either – exploring every nook and cranny to find cash, pearls, and gold bars is addictive and gives the game a high score twist.</p>
<p>Structurally, Luigi's Mansion is about as far-removed from a Mario game as you could get – in fact, the closest thing you could compare it to might be dungeon-crawling in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/legend_of_zelda">The Legend of Zelda</a>. Gone are the spacious and whimsical environments of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/super_mario_64">Mario 64</a>. Instead, you're given one ill-lit, claustrophobic, creepy mansion that you must explore room by room. Upon entering one, you're greeted with darkness; darkness, that is, and the haunting giggles of hidden ghosts. One by one, these spectres will reveal themselves, and it's your job to suck them up.</p>
<figure><a title="Luigi's Mansion Review - Screenshot 4 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159981/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>Clearing all of them in a given room will cause the lights to come on and, more often than not, a treasure chest to appear. Nine times out of ten, these will contain keys that allow you to access some previously impassable door, and round-and-round the formula goes.</p>
<p>It would run the risk of being repetitive if the core gameplay mechanics weren't so much fun, but thankfully the odd satisfaction of seeing Luigi getting yanked around the room by unruly ghosts never gets old, and the game's knack for creating a mood means exploring each new room is always exciting.</p>
<p>This being a launch title and all, it's not surprising that this launch title isn't the prettiest GameCube game, but what it lacks in pixels, it makes up for with artistic flair and technological impressiveness. In addition to the aforementioned physics and great use of the controller, Luigi's Mansion was also a pioneer in realistic lighting effects. The flashlight was an immediate stunner, and its effect still manages to impress after other flashlight-driven games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/silent_hill_shattered_memories">Silent Hill: Shattered Memories</a> and, more recently, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/alan_wake_remastered">Alan Wake</a> drove the concept further.</p>
<figure><a title="Luigi's Mansion Review - Screenshot 5 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159979/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>But one of the most consistently enjoyable aspects is how much work went into turning Luigi, who began life as Mario's bland palette-swap, into a hilarious and lovable individual with a distinct personality. Simply put, the character animations in this game are astounding: the way Luigi's hand trembles as he opens a new door, or how his teeth chatter as he walks down a darkened hallway. He flattens into a thin sheet of paper when something falls on him, he stretches and expands when screaming with fear — with care and detail, Nintendo turned a once carbon-copy character into one as expressive and malleable as something out of a Bob Clampett cartoon.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Luigi's Mansion's use of sound is still some of the cleverest you'll hear in a video game. There's essentially only one theme here, but it's amazing how much mileage Nintendo gets out of it. Sometimes it plays hauntingly in the background. Sometimes, in the creepiest and quietest of rooms, Luigi will whistle and hum it nervously to himself, as if to keep his mind off the ominous danger at hand.</p>
<p>And in rooms with sneaky ghosts that refuse to show themselves, if you listen carefully, you can hear them cackling the tune to get a better idea of where they are. Genius.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>What Luigi's Mansion lacks in content and longevity, it makes up for with a remarkably well-crafted and unique single campaign that will keep you consistently entertained from front to back. It's not quite on the same level as Mario's better outings, but the game is so entirely different from anything Mario has ever starred in that it feels unjust to compare them; and, really, it's this complete departure from the Mario formula that makes the game so successful in the first place.</p>
<p>The gameplay design is so uncommon that it's pretty difficult to slap a genre label on it, but suffice to say that if you consider yourself a gamer or Nintendo fan, you owe it to yourself to give Luigi's first spooky adventure a shot.</p></section>

			<p>The MMORPG AION 2 will launch globally in 2026 with DLSS 4 and Multi Frame Generation support on the PC version (the game will also be available on mobile devices).</p>



<p>The initial launch in South Korea and Taiwan is set for November 19. The game is a sequel to Aion: The Tower of Eternity, which launched in 2008 in Korea and the following year worldwide. The original game was powered by Crytek's CRYENGINE, whereas this new installment is made with Unreal Engine 5.</p>



<p>Aion 2 takes place around two hundred years later and features a world that, according to NCSOFT, is 36 times larger. Moreover, unlike the “zoned” areas of the original, Aion 2 features a seamless, fully explorable world with no loading screens between vast regions. Players will once again choose between two factions, Elyos and Asmodian, which are eternally locked in conflict. However, unlike in the original game, they will be placed in separate servers, so the conflict between them will occur entirely in the Abyss. On this special PvP battlefield, the populations of two servers (one for Elyos and another for Asmodian players) will clash.</p>



<p>Beyond that, the developers have promised over 200 dungeons to explore that range from solo instances to group dungeons for up to eight players. Eight are also the classes available at launch: Gladiator, Templar, Assassin, Marksman, Sorcerer, Spiritmaster, Cleric, and Chanter.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The news was shared by NVIDIA as part of a press release highlighting the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/gamer-festival/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GeForce Gamer Festival</a>, which is live today at COEX in Seoul to celebrate 25 years of GeForce in South Korea. The MMORPG is playable at the event, just like NCSOFT's MMOTPS Cinder City, which we checked out at Gamescom 2025 <a href="https://wccftech.com/cinder-city-preview-qa-open-world-shooter-mmo-like/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with an exclusive developer interview</a>.</p>



<p>NVIDIA also shared a brief update by KRAFTON on PUBG Ally, the 'co-playable character' powered by ACE <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-ace-to-power-dynamic-ai-characters-companions-and-bosses-in-pubg-naraka-bladepoint-inzoi-and-mir5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced at CES 2025</a>. PUBG Ally, which is powered by the small language model (SMM) Mistral-Nemo-Minitron-8B-128k and enables AI teammates to support the player including even engaging in combat with other players, will host a 'user test event' early next year. </p>

            <p>GOG continue to conquer the world of old games you either remember fondly or have totally forgotten about. They've added 18 new ones to their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gog-are-doubling-down-on-game-preservation-and-making-it-easier-to-see-which-games-run-well-on-modern-pcs">preservation program</a> this week, with the latest arrivals being the Resident Evil HD Remaster and Resident Evil 0.</p>
<p>It's good to see the storefront's preservation efforts keep on expand, given they've <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gog-say-their-preservation-program-has-been-harder-than-we-thought-thanks-to-drm-and-elusive-creators">recently revaled</a> that this program's been a tougher undertaking than originally envisioned thus far. Things that're worth doing are rarely easy, though, are they? Well, ok, maybe having a cheeky biscuit with your supper is still worth doing.</p>

<p>The Resident Evil HD Remaster and Resident Evil 0's arrivals were <a href="https://x.com/GOGcom/status/1983807379125702969">announced just this morning</a>, and they've been chucked straight into GOG's classic Resi bundle. In terms of tweaks to get them running as they should, both have had their stability checked, their compatibility with Windows 10 and 11 okayed, and support for cloud saves added. They're also currently grabbable with a 75% discount which knocks each down to £4/equivalent until November 13th.</p>
<p>The addition of those two follows 16 other games hitting the preservation program <a href="https://x.com/GOGcom/status/1983175739714191850">earlier this week</a>. Tomb Raider GOTY, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tom-clancys-splinter-cell">Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hitman-codename-47">Hitman: Codename 47</a> are the headliners to my young eye. However, you may have much stronger feelings for one or all of (clears throat):</p><p>SPORE Collection, Clive Barker's Undying, Nostradamus: The Last Prophecy, Superhero League of Hoboken, Heart of China, Thunderscape, North &amp; South, Titus The Fox: To Marrakech and Back, Battle Chess 4000, Elvira: Mistress of the Dark, Elvira II: The Jaws of Cerberus, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-cthulhu">Call of Cthulhu</a>: Prisoner of Ice, and Bloodwych.</p>
<p>GOG say their preservation program's 250 games wide with these new additions, which is inching closer to their stated goal of around 300 to 350 by the close of 2025. I'm sad they don't publicly track a 'number of private investigators hired to track down rights holders' stat, but retaining some mystery there's understandable.</p>
