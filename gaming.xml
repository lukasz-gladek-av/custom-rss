			<p>Since December, or more accurately, since the release of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-indiana-at-his-finest/">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, there’s been a feeling that Xbox has turned a corner for the better. Following up MachineGames' excellent Indiana Jones adventure was Obsidian, with a more than solid outing in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/avowed-surprisingly-meaty-unsurprisingly-deep/">Avowed</a>. Which, in a few days from the time of publishing, will be followed up by Compulsion Games’ latest, <a href="https://wccftech.com/south-of-midnight-is-out-on-april-8/">South of Midnight</a>, which hopes to keep that momentum going.</p>
<p>South of Midnight is the third game in the studio’s history since its founding in 2009 and the first full game the team has made primarily under the Xbox banner after it was acquired by Microsoft in 2018. After the studio’s last batch of DLC for <a href="https://wccftech.com/we-happy-fews-last-dlc-we-all-fall-down-is-out-on-november-19th/">We Happy Few</a>, the six years since have been spent crafting Hazel and her mother Lacey’s story, complete with stop-motion animation. The Southern gothic tale begins with a hurricane far worse than anyone in her small fictional town of Prospero could have predicted and a fight between Hazel and Lacey.</p>
<p>After storming out of the house, Hazel looks on in horror as she watches the hurricane take her home, with her Mom in it, down the river. While chasing after the floating house to try and save her Mom, Hazel is chosen to become a new Weaver. A Weaver is a person who is able to see the strings and strands that make up what the game calls the Grand Tapestry. Basically, it is the fabric of life and the world, and it’s now Hazel’s job to help untangle the knots caused by the tragedy and pain we experience in life, either by choices of our own making or at the hands of evil people.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/South-of-Midnight-Review-1.png"></a></figure>

<p>The story in South of Midnight is a bit of an odd thing. Hazel’s journey toward understanding her Mom better and how their story plays out is kind of the least interesting part. At the same time, the game’s story is one of its strengths, and that all comes from the people you meet along Hazel’s journey to finding her Mom. South of Midnight’s story constantly surprised me because, from the outside, you wouldn’t guess that this game is nearly as dark or serious as it is. In each chapter, you’ll be charged with helping someone put the pain of their worst memories to rest by untangling the knot the bad parts of their lives caused.</p>
<p>And in each chapter, I was taken aback with just how intense and tragic all of these memories were. It was actually what helped to keep the story grounded, especially in the moments where Hazel is wall-running on a floating wall that looks like it’s been ripped off the side of a building.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/South-of-Midnight-Review-2.png"></a></figure>

<p>That’s not to say the relationship between Hazel and her Mom was boring or entirely uninteresting, just that it was out-shined by every other story told, whether in a short scene of a memory you witness or an old journal entry you find along the path. It also didn’t help that, more often than not, Hazel’s first words just after witnessing the memory of an extremely tragic event rarely fit the moment, with too many of her lines sounding like generic barks you might hear in any video game where the protagonist is constantly commenting on the world around them.</p>
<p>But there are a few moments of real, excellent storytelling with strong performances from the entire voice cast, including the voice behind Hazel, Adriyan Rae. This only made it all the more upsetting when Hazel would have a line that felt like she wasn’t paying attention to the events she just witnessed. Still, even with those disappointing moments, South of Midnight delivers an emotional story that packs a heavier punch than its bright visuals and stop-motion animation might have you expect.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/South-of-Midnight-Review-5-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Speaking of its visuals, the art design and the look of South of Midnight is arguably the best part of this game. I don’t mean that as a slight towards other aspects, or that it’s not worth playing. It often feels like if the best thing you have to say about a game is that it looks nice, then it probably has little to offer beyond that. Not the case with South of Midnight, as it definitely brings more to the table, but the design of this game and the detail poured into every corner is absolutely spectacular.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the stop-motion animation effect did not agree with my eyes, and I did have to turn it off after playing the opening few chapters with it. I think your mileage with that effect may vary since my issues with it could also be traced to the number of stuttering bugs I witnessed during my playthrough. I was playing an early build of the game on my Xbox Series X that did not include the day-one patch, so I can only hope that the issues I have will be sorted by the time everyone else can jump in for themselves.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/South-of-Midnight-Review-3-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Speaking of jumping, good as the story and performances are, the main gameplay of South of Midnight is what’s unfortunately lacking. The platforming isn’t bad. But it also isn’t great, and even though it evolves somewhat throughout the 14 chapters of the game’s story, particularly with the sections that have you running from a dark fog, it only starts to get interesting by the time you’re on the last couple of chapters. And by that point, these sections had been so repetitive that I was more peeved than excited to go through another one. Even if the design of these sections was starting to get good, which shouldn’t be the case in chapter 12 of a 14-chapter game.</p>
<p>The combat is, unfortunately, the worst part of the gameplay. Put simply, it’s boring and repetitive, and it wouldn’t detract from the game so much if you weren’t thrust into a combat arena every five minutes. The small skill tree you work through never adds to the combat in interesting ways; the best part about upgrading your skills is that it can help you move through these sections faster. A key issue is that there’s no flow to combat. Hazel doesn’t have a parry or a block mechanic, so all you can do is dash and dodge away from incoming attacks, which means you’re constantly pulling yourself out of the action in order to stay alive. And whether you’re locked on to a single enemy or not, the camera is awful at keeping pace with the combat, so you’re almost surely going to take a few hits that you just couldn’t prepare for because you didn’t see them coming.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/South-of-Midnight-Review-4.png"></a></figure>

<p>Even when an enemy is in front of you, some attacks are more telegraphed than others, and you can only knock an enemy out of an animation by performing a ground-pound attack. It also doesn’t help that when you do take a hit, the knock-back effect makes Hazel so slow to react that you’re likely to take another hit before you can dodge to safety. That’s also where all the ‘challenge’ in the combat lies, not dying from hits you can’t see coming. Which makes any deaths you suffer frustrating for the wrong reasons. Even when you are performing well and not dying, the feedback on your attacks doesn’t feel satisfying, as you repeat the same set of animations again and again. And while the look of each enemy is interesting, what each of them adds to combat doesn’t evolve it in interesting ways or make you change your approach. This then feeds into the other issue that you don’t really get many different ways to approach combat. You’re mashing attack and dodge ad-nauseam, and when it’s over, you get a tragic, emotional scene about something awful that happened in a character’s life. The actions couldn’t feel more disconnected if they tried, which adds to combat feeling like a slog.</p>
<p>South of Midnight would be a tighter, more interesting game if the combat sections were instead replaced with gameplay akin to that of an adventure game or puzzle game, where you’re piecing together the past events to properly untangle what has become knotted. The gameplay there would also more easily weave into the game’s narrative instead of feeling like it’s trying to be an entirely different kind of game the moment combat starts.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/South-of-Midnight-Review-6-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>If there are any combat sections I could call out as good, it would be the few boss fights scattered throughout the game. But those sections aren’t good because the combat suddenly becomes fun, they’re good because of the scale of the bosses you’re fighting, and how well executed the presentation of each set piece is. So even though getting through to the end of a chapter isn’t all that fun with how many combat sections you have to get through, at least the set piece at the end was always visually stunning and a fun spectacle.</p>
<p>That’s also why I’d say the best of these chapter-ending set-pieces is actually one that members of the press, including Wccftech’s own Kai Tatsumoto, got to experience in <a href="https://wccftech.com/south-of-midnight-hands-on-preview-bottling-up-the-trauma/">previews</a>. How the music tied in with the story you had just witnessed, and the complete understanding you have about this giant tree that you’re climbing, still sticks out in my mind, days after seeing the credits roll. It was really beautiful, and I wish more of the game was able to weave gameplay and narrative as strongly as it was done there.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/South-of-Midnight-Review-7-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Lastly, speaking of the music, that is the final aspect of the storytelling that really makes South of Midnight special. The original songs written for each of the key characters from Prospero that you meet and help out are all so well done. It’s something you really have to experience for yourself, and it’s a big part of why I’d still recommend that you play South of Midnight. On top of the other visual and storytelling aspects I’ve already talked about, the music wraps it all together so beautifully.</p>

<p>Overall, South of Midnight has excellent storytelling, excellent artistic and visual design, a wonderful cast of characters and voice actors, and an original soundtrack that punctuates each big narrative beat in a way that will stay with you long after you put the controller down. Unfortunately, the same creativity that went into the rest of the game is missing in its combat and platforming, and Compulsion Games does itself no favors by launching you into the same boring combat scenarios again and again in each level.</p>

                <p>One of the big reveals from the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/switch-2-nintendo-direct-april-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6391/" data-ref-id="2900-6391">Switch 2 Nintendo Direct</a> this week was the announcement of a camera for the console's new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2s-c-button-is-all-about-video-and-voice-chat/1100-6530539/" data-ref-id="1100-6530539">GameChat feature that's accessible by pressing the C button</a>. Nintendo has now further discussed GameChat in a <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-17-gamechat-part-1/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">three-part interview series</a>, in which the company called GameChat a "defining" feature of the console and outlined the steps being taken to ensure safety when using the camera, especially for children.</p><p>Switch 2 design director Sumikazu Ono said Nintendo thought "a lot" about how to ensure GameChat is "safe and secure." Players will not be able to use GameChat with everyone on their friend list by default.</p><p>"We assume some players will have somebody on their friend list who they've only played online with once, and yet somehow, they ended up accepting their friend request. Given that possibility, players might feel uncomfortable if suddenly everyone on their friend list can invite them to a video chat," Ono said.

Of course, we want all players to follow the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/code-of-conduct/">Community Guidelines</a>, even when chatting with friends," Ono said.</p><p>In 2024, the Edward Snowden leaks revealed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/british-spy-agency-considered-using-xbox-360-kinect-for-surveillance/1100-6418021/" data-ref-id="1100-6418021">a British spy agency considering using Xbox 360's Kinect camera to spy on people.</a> Whether or not any actual snooping took place, however, is unknown.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/" data-ref-id="1100-6530531">Switch 2 camera from Nintendo sells for $50</a>, but the console also supports a variety of USB-C cameras from other manufacturers.</p><p>For more, be sure to check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-hands-on-more-of-the-same-but-it-can-still-surprise-you/1100-6530580/" data-ref-id="1100-6530580">GameSpot's hands-on preview of the Switch 2</a> and our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-world-hands-on-the-conservative-switch-2-gets-a-bold-sequel/1100-6530583/" data-ref-id="1100-6530583">preview of Mario Kart World.</a> GameSpot will have lots more on the Switch 2 in the days and weeks ahead.</p>

<p>Back in February, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-5-gets-new-pc-version-that-adds-ps5-and-xbox-series-xs-features-for-free">Rockstar released the free GTA 5 Enhanced upgrade for PC players</a> that brings the game in-line with PS5 and Xbox Series X/S, including improved graphics options and faster loading times.</p>
<p>When it arrives on PC Game Pass on 15th April, it will be the first time the game has been available on the subscription service for PC players.</p>

<p>The game will also return to Xbox Game Pass for console players - it's been included in the past but hasn't stayed on Game Pass continuously.</p>
<p>GTA 5 will join other <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-our-first-batch-of-xbox-game-pass-titles-for-april">games announced for Game Pass this April</a>, including day one titles <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/south-of-midnight">South of Midnight</a>, Commandos: Origins and Blue Prince.</p>
<p>When GTA 5 Enhanced released on PC, it brought in a healthy number of players. However, it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-5s-enhanced-pc-launch-is-off-to-a-good-start-on-steam-but-user-reviews-are-mixed">received a mixed rating on Steam</a> due to issues transferring accounts and disappointment with its performance.</p>
<p>The addition to Game Pass of course comes ahead of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a>, which is expected to launch later this year.</p>
<p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/take-two-interactive">Take-Two Interactive</a> boss Strauss Zelnick recently told Bloomberg the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6s-release-date-is-still-secret-because-take-two-boss-wants-to-maintain-the-anticipation-and-excitement">exact release date of GTA 6 is remaining a secret for now</a> to "maintain the anticipation and excitement".</p>
<p>"We do have competitors who will describe their release schedule for years in advance, and we found that the better thing to do is to provide marketing materials relatively close to the release window in order to create that excitement on the one hand, and balance the excitement with unmet anticipation," he said.</p>
<p>"I don't always get it exactly right, but that's what we're trying to do."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/psycho-patrol-r-early-access-impressions-review-cruelty-squad-consumer-softproducts<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In <em>Psycho Patrol R</em>, the latest game from the developer of <em>Cruelty Squad, </em>a man in the lobby of my building is having a mental breakdown because he's trying to get his pass and he wants to visit Australia. Eventually he will snap, shooting and killing me several times before I solve the problem by shooting him in the head. Outside of the office, a farmer has become radicalized because the government won’t respect his right to dump poison in the ground. He is also shooting me, while doing a Swedish Chef version of the Howard Beale speech from <em>Network</em>. This problem is solved when I step on him with a mech.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>The consumer is a fascist.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Psycho Patrol R</em>, currently in early access,<em> </em>is the followup to the abrasive, brilliant shooter <em>Cruelty Squad </em>by Consumer Softproducts (aka developer Ville Kallio)<em>, </em>a shooter that launched many insufferable YouTube essays and countless very good speedruns. While <em>Cruelty Squad</em> was primarily a shooter, <em>Psycho Patrol R </em>bills itself as a “mecha FPS hybrid policing and punishment simulator.” You play a liberal kissass in a paramilitary wing of a nightmarish dystopian version of the EU, the Federation of Pan-Europa in the dystopian retrofuture of 2000 AD.</p><figure><figcaption>This is what dogs look like in this game because they're actually just people that have been turned into dogs.</figcaption></figure><p>The Psycho Patrol are the not-so-velvet fist of liberalism, a task force founded by your beautiful, brilliant boss Lorenzo Visconti, whose prime directive is to find and violently suppress misinformation, dubbed “psychohazards.” Initially you are tasked with finding out the source of misinformation about sodium lauryl sulfate, a common ingredient in shampoo.</p><figure><figcaption>V-Stalker my beloved...</figcaption></figure><p>The Psycho Patrol is built on the principles of (real) Austrian doctor and psychoanalyst Wilhelm Reich, author of <em>The Mass Psychology of Fascism</em>. Anyone who has read Reich knows that he is onto something when it comes to the irrational nature of fascism being tied to sexual dysfunction – it is hard to question this when much of the Right is often formed from racist, homophobic and transphobic closet cases sublimating that impotence into hatred. He was also a beautiful, once-in-a-generation crank who believed in the power of a sexualized life force known as <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orgone" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Orgone Energy</a>, which he believed could be collected and harnessed, often in a big metal-lined box. This detail dovetails nicely into the lore and gameplay of <em>Psycho Patrol R</em>, as your character levels up their stats via Reichian self-criticism from the workplace psychologist. Your V-Stalker and certain energy weapons are powered by Orgone, and you can summon a friendly helper ghost dubbed a “bion,” which manifests as the EU logo with a big goofy cartoon smiley face.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>It's your smiling friend Bion!</figcaption></figure><p><em>Psycho Patrol R</em> is a game that expects more intellectually of the player than <em>Cruelty Squad </em>did. Like <em>Beyond Citadel</em>, the game wears its influences on its sleeve, and a <a href="https://datasparrow.itch.io/orientation-an-introductory-zinelet-to-psycho-patrol-r" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">helpful zine with an extensive reading list</a> of its inspirations has been provided, such as Masamune Shirow's lesser celebrated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominion_(manga)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Dominion </em></a>and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patlabor:_The_TV_Series" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Patlabor The Mobile Police: On Television</em></a>.&nbsp; While both games are brutal, <em>Psycho Patrol R</em> falls much more in the immersive sim category, often playing out like a funhouse version of <em>Deus Ex</em> but with additional mech combat. When I posted about the game on social media, a response I got from multiple people was that they didn’t understand what the game actually <em>was</em>, because the latitude of what you can do and how you can solve problems is pretty broad.</p><figure><figcaption>These are just real solid pulls outside of the context of the game.</figcaption></figure><p>One of your first quests is to try to remember your computer password. This can be done multiple ways: hacking your computer to reverse engineer the password, bribing the tyrannical IT guy until he tells you your password, or by a third, simpler way that takes a single keystroke. This is a game that requires that you read what’s on the screen and expects you to do critical and sometimes obtuse thinking. It often demands that you use older PC gaming muscles that may have atrophied.</p><figure><figcaption>The Psycho Patrol creed. Credit: Consumer Softproducts.</figcaption></figure><p>You will die frequently and violently in <em>Psycho Patrol R</em>. Sometimes this is your own damn fault for sneaking somewhere you shouldn’t, although often it’s because a random stranger just wants to shoot you in the head. Dying is part of the job, although when you die you drop whatever money you have on your person. Initially these sudden deaths feel unfair, as is the case of the Bridge of the Sovereign, a merciless early game skillcheck. The bridge is just outside of town and features several V-Stalkers that will kill your starter machine instantly. If you take the mechs head-on you will likely be demolished. You can easily solve this by either finding better guns and armor in an adjacent combat zone, buying upgrades or by getting out of your mech, taking the gun off of it, and shooting the V-Stalkers while on foot.</p><figure><figcaption>The purpose of this bridge is to humiliate you until you learn.</figcaption></figure><p>Constantly dying punches a hole in your wallet, and a primary way around this is to frequently invest whatever excess money you have in the stock market, itself a holdover from <em>Cruelty Squad</em>. This generates passive income, which you will need, because you must pay for your ammunition out of pocket. If you constantly shoot everything that moves with a chaingun you can quickly drive yourself deep into debt. Utilizing force is often less an ethical concern so much as it is a cost/benefit analysis. See, running the government like a business can be fun!</p><figure><figcaption>A banker expounds on ways to improve the quality of cheap vodka. I was broke enough when I was younger to research this.</figcaption></figure><p>If it was not already evident, <em>Psycho Patrol R </em>is one of the funniest games I’ve played in years. The world is a goofy nightmare and every interaction is filled with dry, deeply funny dialogue. When asked about his hobbies, a steroid-bound gym rat named Bramby Maximum will respond “I use the steroud [sic].” A grotesque failson of an independently wealthy man will gush to you about how many anime figurines he will buy when his father finally dies. A random NPC will entertain you with his theory of the value of people's lives being not only unequal but quantifiable, and that a CEO’s dog’s life could be theoretically worth more than that of a person’s. There’s a version of Twitter where you can see people slowly disintegrate and DM them abuse. Animals like dogs and horses have become exceedingly rare or extinct, so every animal in the game is just a person who has been grotesquely shaped into an animal (in a fashion similar to <a href="https://aftermath.site/kazuo-umezu-translation-of-fourteen" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kazuo Umezo’s <em>Fourteen</em></a>). Characters names on their own are shockingly funny, like “Jordan Grindmax, ” “Brad Gortex,” “Thierry Subaru Deontology,” “Sonboy Megapractical,” and “Fecal Sovereign,” the last one being a direct reference to an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NESticle" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">obtuse easter egg in the now-obsolete Nintendo emulator Nesticle</a>.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Steurod.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Psycho Patrol R </em>has a long road to completion. Some exits to unbuilt zones in the game are clearly marked off while others are not. A few times I walked down a hall and fell off the map, but thankfully cyanide capsules have been patched into the game in case you get stuck. Despite its early access status, I am impressed by how much is already present, and I managed to clock about 27 hours in the game as is before wrapping the current main story mission. The world initially feels gargantuanly empty, but then you’ll hit a manhole cover or a secret door and find a complex, sprawling hidden world. The grotesque PlayStation 1 style of the game heightens this sparsity but deeply rewards exploring every inch. <em>Psycho Patrol R</em> feels like a nod to Osamu Sato’s <em>LSD: Dream Emulator, </em>not just in its nightmarish dreamscape sprites and clanging, willfully atonal soundtrack but also in the capriciousness of the world’s construction. <em>Psycho Patrol R </em>is the diary of the nightmares of Europe.</p><figure><figcaption>Your coworker is a nasty little freak online.</figcaption></figure><p>Though the reaction to the game has been overwhelmingly positive, I have seen complaints online about its difficulty, which I understand theoretically but disagree with. All games in early access need balancing, but <em>Psycho Patrol R </em>feels like a logical endpoint. If Ville Kallio had made a softer, easier game following <em>Cruelty Squad </em>I would have been deeply disappointed. And while the game can feel initially disorienting by design, there’s a fairly decent quick start guide in the menu that tells you most of what you need to know. Much of this feels less like a developer making something hard out of sadism and more like the growing pains of a game being difficult in a manner foreign to an existing fanbase. The game is also immensely breakable, and once you get the lay of the land, you can get to the current “end” of it in about four minutes, if that’s how you want to play. I’ve been enjoying watching players on YouTube develop new methods for turning <em>Psycho Patrol R</em> inside out, although I would recommend that you initially try it without help.</p><figure><figcaption>This guy lives in a turd hole. </figcaption></figure><p>I cannot know what <em>Psycho Patrol R</em> will become and what it is attempting to say just yet; it is an incomplete work and I’m not even sure the developer can fully anticipate where it will end. But the world it constructs feels both apropos and dryly funny in the most Finland-coded way possible. It has the potential to be one of those rare games that approaches literature. To play <em>Psycho Patrol</em> is to feel that rot-gut sensation about the world generally and Europe specifically.&nbsp;</p><p>Pan-Europa is full of mentally ill stochastic violence mediated by overt counter violence from the state, where humans are animalized into dogs and some men seek liberation in the sewers. The internet is poison and the only path to stability is your investment portfolio and a capricious market. There is no liberation or hope, no answer to the swelling tide of fascism save militant managerial liberalism. There is only your boss, who you worship like a god, and the promise of a modest promotion down the line after doing your job objectively poorly and being ripped apart by gunfire, flesh rats, and shrapnel roughly 87 times.</p><figure><figcaption>Well that's good I guess.</figcaption></figure></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/nintendo-switch-2-price-release"><h3>Nah, Man</h3></a><p>It's not Nintendo's fault, but 2025 sure is a time</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/thomas-tank-diesel-10-scary"><h3>Fuck This Anthropomorphic Diesel Engine In Particular</h3></a><p>Thomas and the Magic Railroad's Diesel 10 gave me nightmares</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/dungeon-synth-ambient-magic-fantasy-tolkein-medieval"><h3>I Found A New Age Of Magic At A Dungeon Synth Show In Queens</h3></a><p>Dungeon synth isn't a return to an imagined past, but a vibrant vision of the future.</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>As excited as we all were to see the new features and specs for the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-launches-june-5th-120fps-4k-support/">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, and, of course, the games that Nintendo has in store for it, the price of the console was always going to be the biggest talking point coming out of Wednesday's Nintendo Direct presentation.</p>
<p>Which it certainly has been, due to just how high the price ended up being. $449.99 USD (or $499.99 with a copy of <a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-revealed-launching-exclusively-on-nintendo-switch-2/">Mario Kart World</a>) was not what gamers around the world wanted to read. Unless you happen to live in Japan, however, since Nintendo also revealed it will be selling a cheaper, Japan-only Switch 2 that's region-locked.</p>
<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendo-will-sell-a-cheaper-330-switch-2-in-japan-thats-region-locked/">VGC</a>, the 'Japanese-Language System' version of the Switch 2 will be available at <strong>49,980 yen</strong>, which works out closer to&nbsp;<strong>$334 USD.&nbsp;</strong>The version of the Switch 2 that supports multiple languages, which is the one everyone outside of Japan will be buying, will cost <strong>69,980 yen</strong>.</p>
<p>If you plan on going to Japan sometime after June 5, 2025, and have no trouble reading and understanding Japanese, then it's not entirely clear if you could purchase one of these consoles at the cheaper, Japan-only price, and take it back to your home country and continue to enjoy it there.</p>
<p>Niko Partners analyst Daniel Ahmad <a href="https://nikopartners.com/niko-partners-take-on-nintendo-switch-2-reveal/">reports</a> that the console will only be "<em>linkable to [Nintendo] accounts with their country/region set to Japan,</em>" so, presumably, as long as you meet that requirement (and again, can read and understand Japanese), you could get the Switch 2 for more than $100 less than you would have otherwise paid. Though surely the trip to Japan, or shipping the Japanese-only Switch 2 out of the country to wherever you live, will fill that gap quickly enough.</p>
<p>As to why Nintendo is adopting this two-tiered pricing model for Japan only, Ahmad has a few common-sense theories.</p>
<p>"<em><span data-contrast="auto">To discourage reselling of the new system by foreign buyers who leverage the console’s lower price point in the country to resell the title to regions with a higher price – an issue faced by the first Nintendo</span></em> Switch," Ahmad writes.</p>
<p>He also adds, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2s-price-could-go-even-higher-due-to-trumps-tariffs/">regarding the tariffs</a> announced by the United States and Donald Trump on Wednesday, that the difference in pricing between Japan and the United States particularly, is "<em>likely a calculated move on Nintendo’s part, driven by tariff impacts, the weak Japanese yen and local market conditions</em>."</p>
<p>"<em><span data-contrast="auto">Japan accounted for nearly 25% of global Nintendo Switch unit sales, with Nintendo offering a cheaper Switch 2 SKU in this market to stimulate early adoption and maintain</span></em> <em>momentum</em>," he continues.</p>
<p>"<em><span data-contrast="auto">While the company has shifted some of its manufacturing to Vietnam to offset US tariffs on China, the looming threat of reciprocal tariffs prior to the Switch 2 showcase will have also forced Nintendo to consider a higher price for the rest of the world. The reciprocal tariffs on Vietnam and Japan have come in higher than expected, and Nintendo will feel the impact of this if the tariffs go into full effect.</span></em>"</p>
<p>At least Ahmad does end on a more positive note, saying that he does not believe Nintendo will raise the price of the console within the first five years of its lifetime.</p>

			<p>The full Monster Hunter Wilds 1.010.00.00 patch notes have been revealed, confirming the new content and changes coming to the latest entry in the series ahead of the patch's release in a few hours.</p>
<p>Besides highlighting the return of series' classic monster Mizustune, its Tempered variant, and the Zoh Shia high rank hunt, <a href="https://info.monsterhunter.com/wilds/update/en-us/Ver.1.010.00.00.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the patch notes</a> revealed some previously unknown balance changes, which include the increase in guild points rewards for investigations, the increase of points required for Wyverian Melding and Meld Decorations functions at the Melding Pot, and Mantles rebalancing, including the previously announced nerfing of the Corrupted Mantle.</p>
<p>Among the changes to weapons, most have been left untouched, except for the Lance, which receives a change that makes it easier to land thrust attack finishers after a focus strike, and the Bow, which sees nerfs to Dragon Piercer and buffs to Power Volley and Thousand Dragons, among other things. Sadly, the patch notes don't reveal any unexpected performance improvements, other than the VRAM usage improvements and upgraded DirectStorage version confirmed <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-1-pc-improvements/">last week.</a></p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S worldwide. Learn more about the latest entry in the series by checking out my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/">review.</a></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/marvel-rivals-season-2-starts-next-week-emma-frost-and-ultron-confirmed.1154238/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-season-2-emma-frost-ultron<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>NetEase has confirmed that&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>season 2 will begin next week, and the developer has also confirmed two new playable characters for the game.</p>

<p>As revealed in a new trailer, Emma Frost and Ultron will be joining the ranks of the Marvel-themed hero shooter when its second season begins on April 11th. It's not yet clear what role either character will play in terms of mechanics.</p>

<p>The debut trailer welcomes players to the Hellfire Gala, which is hosted on the mutant-led island of Krakoa. However, during the opening ceremony of the gala, Ultron interferes and essentially declares war on the gathered heroes. Exciting stuff!</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-rivals-season-2-ultron.jpg?itok=srW0X84m 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-rivals-season-2-ultron.jpg?itok=iwbT0xYm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ultron joins the cast of&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>in season 2, along with Emma Frost.</figcaption></figure><p>We also seemingly see a new range of skins that will be available for many of&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>' existing characters, with heroes like Wolverine, Cloak and Dagger, and Captain America decked out in their finest formal wear.</p>

<p>NetEase hasn't yet revealed what else lies in wait for&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>players when season 2 arrives, but if <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-modding-clampdown" rel="nofollow">season 1</a> is anything to go by, you can expect new events, a new battle pass, and perhaps even some more playable characters arriving later in the season.</p>

<p>Several heroes coming to the game have already <a href="https://www.si.com/esports/news/x-men-heroes-leak-for-marvel-rivals" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">reportedly been leaked</a>, including the likes of Cyclops, Gambit, and Rogue, as well as a number of other X-Men-related characters (and, of course, Deadpool).</p>

<p>It is, of course, worth noting that we're simply assuming Emma Frost and Ultron will be playable; it's possible only one of them will be, or maybe even neither of them, unlikely as that may be. Nevertheless, you can check out the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>season 2 right here.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>, it's an<em>&nbsp;Overwatch</em>-style hero shooter that lets you play as some of your favorite Marvel heroes (and villains!) across a series of objective-based gameplay modes.</p>

<p>The game managed to reach <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-player-count-40m" rel="nofollow">40 million players</a> within its first few months on release, but despite that success, NetEase still elected to shut down the Seattle studio responsible for&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>' creation <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-studio-shockingly-closed-by-netease-laying-off-everyone" rel="nofollow">back in February</a>.</p>

<p><em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>is available to play for free right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2767030/Marvel_Rivals/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/marvel-rivals/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS5</a>, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/640287/heart-machine-patreon-gdc<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Heart Machine, the studio behind games like <em>Hyper Light Drifter</em>, <em>Solar Ash</em>, and the upcoming platformer <em>Possessor(s)</em>, launched a <a href="https://www.patreon.com/c/HeartMachineHQ/home">Patreon</a> last December. Like many other developers, it has dealt with its share of struggles, including layoffs <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/hyper-light-breaker-developer-heart-machine-confirms-layoffs">late last year</a>. With the many challenges in the gaming industry right now, the studio is experimenting with using Patreon as a source of revenue and to help build community.</p><p>“The Patreon’s there, really, to open up to the community and talk about certain things when it comes to game development,” Heart Machine founder Alx Preston told <em>The Verge</em> at the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco last month. “I think there’s still a lot of distance between developers traditionally and the audience that consumes what they make — what we make — so finding ways to dig back in and have a conversation there is important.”</p><p>It could help on the money front, too. “Industry dynamics have changed a lot, so money is tough to come by in a lot of ways,” Preston said. “Whatever we can do to support ourselves and stay alive longer term is an important thing to turn to, as well.”</p><p>The indie games space has run into a fair share of challenges lately, including Annapurna Interactive’s team <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/2024/9/12/24243317/annapurna-interactive-staff-reportedly-resigns">resigning</a> and Take-Two selling its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/6/24289932/take-two-private-division-publisher-sale">Private Division indie label</a> last year. While there have been some bright spots — including that the former Annapurna team has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338274/annapurna-interactive-new-company-take-two-private-division">taken over</a> Private Division’s discarded games — indie games still face some difficulties getting funding and succeeding in an increasingly crowded marketplace. Even former lifelines like Netflix have <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/633481/netflix-gaming-strategy-alain-tascan-interview">pulled back on indie investing</a>.</p><p>While it’s not a replacement for proper funding — <em>Possessor(s) </em>is being published by Devolver Digital — the subscription is meant to be a potential way to augment the studio’s earnings. Patreon isn’t “our biggest portion of revenue or anything,” Preston said. (Heart Machine’s <a href="https://www.patreon.com/c/heartmachinehq/about">About page</a> on Patreon shows it has around 230 paid members out of about 700 total members.)</p><p>But the idea is to grow it over time. “If you keep engaging and keep doing more stuff there, it’s a different model than going to publishers for money all the time,” he said, adding that it’s “the experimental phase of figuring out what the fuck works these days.”</p><p>Heart Machine isn’t the only developer to <a href="https://www.patreon.com/creators/gaming">utilize Patreon</a> – <em>Caves of Qud</em> developer <a href="https://www.patreon.com/freeholdgames">Freehold Games</a> is another notable example — but it’s one of the most prominent that’s experimenting with the platform. “Since the old models are not enough, we have to adapt,” Preston said in Heart Machine’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTx8TGLPeKc">announcement about the Patreon</a>. “So we’re asking for support to help us continue to not just survive, but adapt and thrive.”</p><p>“We’ve always been big on talking directly to our audience,” he said. “We think this Patreon is an opportunity for us to do more on this front while also benefiting.”</p><p><em>Possessor(s)</em> is set to launch this year. The studio launched <em>Hyper Light Breaker</em> in early access <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/11/24318562/hyper-light-breaker-finally-launches-in-early-access-on-january-14th-2025">in January</a>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The brow was scaled back, giving him a kinder, rounder look closer to his design in The Super Mario Bros. Movie. It's not the first time Donkey Kong has been given a facelift. Originally looking like King Kong, he was completely overhauled with Rare's Donkey Kong Country franchise, and was designed by artist Kevin Bayliss.</p><p>As with any redesign, no matter how mild or extreme, some fans have welcomed the new look while others aren't going bananas for it. Bayliss took to social media to say not only did he like the design, but that fans should embrace the change.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="853012682" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

<p>While the games are the main focal point of today's presentation - we've already had a deeper look into console launch title <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-how-mario-kart-worlds-grand-prix-and-free-roam-modes-work">gave us a better understanding of how its Grand Prix and Free Roam modes work</a> - there is one comment that is dominating the live chat: "Drop the price."</p>

<p>As you can see in the screenshots below, the price of both the console itself and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/all-nintendo-switch-2-launch-games">Switch 2 games</a> is a clear bone of contention among viewers.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-release-date-revealed">Nintendo Switch 2 is due to be released on 5th June</a>, retailing £395.99. A bundle including Mario Kart World will also be available, retailing at £429.99. In isolation, Mario Kart World will retail for £74.99 for a physical copy, or £66.99 digitally.</p>
<p>Since the reveal, there has been online uproar at the console's pricing. However, as Ed laid out earlier, if we take into consideration inflation over the last eight years, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-switch-2-actually-cheaper-than-the-original-console-cost-in-the-uk-and-whats-the-situation-with-switch-2-pricing-globally">Switch 2 Mario Kart World bundle works out cheaper in the UK than the original Switch with a copy of Breath of the Wild</a> did back in 2017.</p>

<p>Speaking on X, CD Projekt Red's Vice President of Business Jan Rosner confirmed the game will ship on a 64 GB cart that includes both the base game and the Phantom Liberty expansion, so no additional download will be required to run the game. The game will launch the same day the Nintendo Switch 2 launches worldwide for the price of $69.99, €69.99.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition will be available on June 5th. SRP is $69.99/€69.99. The game will be distributed on a 64GB game card (containing the game and expansion, no download required), as well as via digital download from Nintendo eShop for Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

<p>At the time, we haven't seen much of Cyberpunk 2077 Ultimate Edition running on Nintendo Switch 2 besides the short trailer shown during yesterday's Nintendo Direct, but it seems like a high refresh rate experience is out of the cards, even in docked mode. Earlier today, Bloomberg's Jason Schreier confirmed, after a hands-on session, that the game runs at 40 FPS in Performance Mode with the console docked, which is definitely disappointing for those who expected a 60 FPS mode, but not completely unexpected, considering how demanding the game can be.</p>

<p lang="en">Some other Switch 2 observations:<br>
- The "Welcome Tour" app is surprisingly cool (one minigame reminded me of Mario Paint) and it is insane that Nintendo is charging for it<br>
- Metroid looks and feels fantastic<br>
- Cyberpunk 2077 runs at 40fps in performance mode while docked (oof)</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/switch-2-dlss-ray-tracing<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has revealed that the Switch 2 uses some form of Nvidia's DLSS upscaling technology, and that the console will also support ray tracing, although the Japanese gaming giant is being a little cagey with details.</p>

<p>IGN got the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-confirms-switch-2-uses-dlss-and-ray-tracing-but-is-being-super-vague-about-the-details" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">chance</a> to talk to Nintendo reps about the Switch 2 during a roundtable yesterday, and in that discussion, Nintendo exec Takuhiro Dota said the Switch 2 "use[s] DLSS upscaling technology", which he describes as "something that we need to use as we develop games".</p>

<p>Apparently, it'll be up to individual developers how the Switch 2's DLSS capabilities are used; Dohta said that "the software developer can choose" whether a game outputs in 4K natively or whether upscaling is used.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-dlss-ray-tracing-tabletop.jpg?itok=fR5sy10m 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-dlss-ray-tracing-tabletop.jpg?itok=HNoS0d7p 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Nintendo Switch 2 will support DLSS and ray tracing, apparently.</figcaption></figure><p>Dohta went on to say that the Switch 2's GPU "does support ray tracing", and that like DLSS, it'll be up to developers whether or not to implement it in games.</p>

<p>As for the GPU's specs, tech exec Tetsuya Sasaki says Nintendo "doesn't share too much on the hardware spec" and that the company prefers to focus on "the value that we can provide to our consumers".</p>

<p>He did, however, say that Nvidia, which is providing the Switch 2's graphics tech, "will be sharing some information", so we may well get to know more about the specifics of the Switch 2's capabilities soon.</p>

<p>If you missed yesterday's Direct, it was revealed during the show that the Switch 2's handheld screen <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-specs-revealed" rel="nofollow">will be a 1080p LCD with HDR support</a> and that the console's dock will be able to support up to 4K resolution. The console will also feature 120fps support in certain games.</p>




<p>We also got a first glimpse of the Switch 2's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-launch-lineup" rel="nofollow">launch lineup</a>, which will include the likes of first-party game&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-kart-world-switch-2-launch-title" rel="nofollow"><em>Mario Kart World</em></a>, as well as a number of third-party ports and new releases.</p>

<p>The Switch 2 launches <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">on June 5th for $449.99</a> (up to $499.99 if you want the console bundled with&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World</em>). Stay tuned for more.</p>

In fact, in the last 25 years it’s seen some of the very finest examples it’s ever received, and we’re here to celebrate them today.</p><p>For clarity, a point-and-click (PnC) adventure is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/genres-fps-hero-shooter-adventure-rts-action-opinion-1851772168&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/genres-fps-hero-shooter-adventure-rts-action-opinion-1851772168">a somewhat malleable genre</a></span> in which players click on the screen to move a character, look at and interact with objects, add items to an inventory, talk to other characters, and solve puzzles, usually through conversation or combining inventory items. The most famous example ever is <em>The Secret of Monkey Island</em>, originally released in 1990, going on to spawn four sequels and a spin-off series of episodic adventures. But today we’re only interested in looking at the games that came out over a decade later, after the point when the naysayers so inaccurately claim the format died out.</p><p>This is not a comprehensive list of every good PnC adventure game made in the last 25 years—that’d be far too long. We’re also not including remasters or graphical overhauls, because that’d be cheating. It’s also not ranked in any order, because that’s silly. If an adventure game you love isn’t here, it’s not necessarily because we think it’s bad or hate you in particular—that only might be the case.</p><p> It’s also worth noting that yes, there’s very little between 2000 and 2010—the peak “adventure games are dead” period—because the rise of 3D meant it was incredibly difficult to get a game financed if it was 2D. There were plenty of 3D adventure games, but most sucked very badly, and those that didn’t weren’t technically point-and-click. Those that were tended to be European games that had inexplicable support from those desperate for the genre to still be fine, a phenomenon I frequently described at the time as like heroin addicts reviewing heroin. So no, <em>The Black Mirror</em>, <em>Still Life</em> and <em>Dracula: Origin</em> will certainly not be appearing, no matter how many people won’t let go, and even <em>Syberia</em> was only “fine.”</p><p>For the the avoidance of doubt, <em>Disco Elysium</em> is an RPG, <em>Life Is Strange</em> is a third-person adventure, <em>Broken Sword 3</em> was a tank-controls third-person game, and <em>Broken Age </em>was  truly terrible and isn’t appearing for that specific reason.</p><p>Now, let’s get to the good stuff.</p></div></div><div><p>Dave Gilbert, as Wadjet Eye, has been at the forefront of the PnC adventure game scene throughout the 21st century. Since his debut short, <em>The Shivah</em>, Gilbert and his frequent collaborator, artist Ben Chandler, have demonstrated a skill for classic adventuring with excellent storytelling. His <em>Blackwell</em> series of ghostly detective games are a huge pleasure, as are so many of the games the company has published over the years. But the standout among a very impressive collection is <em>Unavowed</em>, a deep and involving story of a team who control the demonic activity within New York City.</p><p>As well as being just a great adventure game, <em>Unavowed</em> goes a massive step further, embracing the conceit of BioWare’s party-based RPGs, in which the characters you take with you affect how the game is experienced. The result is, depending upon the buddies you choose, puzzles are solved in entirely different ways, and the story is uniquely told. On top of that, your own character can have three different career paths, each with a unique opening chapter, and then determining how you can solve puzzles throughout.</p><p>It’s a modern classic, and let it be known that releasing in 2018, it was named before <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/avowed-xbox-pc-rpg-game-pass-skyrim-review-kotaku-1851761525&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/avowed-xbox-pc-rpg-game-pass-skyrim-review-kotaku-1851761525">this year’s great action-RPG <em>Avowed</em></a></span> was even a twinkle in Obsidian’s eye.</p></div><div><p>Honestly, my hopes were not high for <em>Return to Monkey Island</em>. Of course the first three games are stone-cold genre classics, but the fourth was disliked, and while Telltale’s <em>Tales of Monkey Island</em> games had their fans, I think looking back most can accept they’re firmly in the territory of “meh.”</p><p>Then, there was that whole Kickstarter thing in the early 2010s. Every single retired adventure developer remerged from their caves to make a new game, and god, they were all awful. Jane Jensen’s execrable <em>Moebius: Empire Rising</em>, Al Lowe’s disappointing <em>Leisure Suit Larry: Reloaded</em>, and the <em>Space Quest</em> guys taking half a million bucks to spend a decade making the completely broken and still unfinished <em>SpaceVenture</em>.</p><p>So when it was announced that original creator Ron Gilbert and original designer Dave Grossman were reuniting for a new <em>Monkey Island</em>, yeah, I worried. But goodness gracious, that’s a lot of build up to tell you it’s <em>completely wonderful</em>.</p><p>Rather than rely on nostalgia, <em>Return to Monkey Island</em> makes the stunning choice to not repeat any of the series’ catchphrases (there’s no insult swordfighting, no second biggest anythings), instead coming up with a swathe of new, excellently funny ideas of its own. It looks and sounds gorgeous, is laugh-out-loud funny throughout, and has an ending that’s as poignant as it is divisive.</p><p>What a completely marvellous treat.</p></div><div><p>This Southern Gothic piece of magical realism felt like it sprang from nowhere, with the confidence and talent of a team that had been making games for decades. And yet, it was a first-time project from a tiny team, with the writing and code by one person.</p><p>Set in a dystopian Louisiana, <em>Norco </em>casts you as Kay, returning to her childhood town and home after her mother dies of cancer. Her brother is missing, although that’s not especially surprising, and there’s a sentient robot in the backyard that shouldn’t be there.</p><p>But, despite that setup, this is a very lowkey, very recognizable world, where the real danger is melancholy. There’s this creeping sense that things are far more wrong than they appear, expertly delivered through its beautiful art and exquisite writing. <em>Norco</em> has some of the best writing I’ve ever seen in a game, absolutely stunning prose in even the most throwaway descriptions.</p><p>This is the sort of game that I wish the broader critical industry would play, to get an understanding of how sophisticated a medium gaming can be, to understand its unique abilities in storytelling. You should play it, too!</p></div><div><p>I’ve recently been replaying the entire <em>Rusty Lake </em>franchise from the start, beginning with the incredible <em>Cube Escape</em> series, and then the larger PC/mobile adventure games, <em>Rusty Lakes Hotel</em>, <em>Roots</em>, and <em>Paradise</em>. I’m right near the end of <em>Paradise</em> right now, looking forward to returning to <em>The White Door</em>, <em>Samsara Room</em>, <em>The Past Within</em>, and <em>Underground Blossom</em>. And yet, despite this incredible run of ten years of fantastic, creepy, near-inexplicable adventure games, there’s a good chance you’ve never heard of it.</p><p>Unashamedly inspired by David Lynch (occasionally going a bit too far, literally quoting from <em>Twin Peaks</em>), these games all focus on the titular lake, and the few buildings that are built on its banks and islands. The games follow multiple generations of a couple of families, each haunted by the same creatures—Mr. Owl and Mr. Crow—who seek to extract memories from the dead, so they can be returned to the lake. Each was originally the patriarch of one of the families, and seemingly responsible for the “corrupted souls” that feature in every game.</p><p>I’m writing all that with an unearned confidence, given it’s so incredibly hard to entirely follow—trying to maintain the <em>Rusty Lake</em> narrative is like grabbing at smoke. What we know for sure is not to trust the owls, and that there will be blood.</p><p>The <em>Cube Escape</em> games are essentially escape room games, elevated by their surrealism and faintly interconnected storyline. The cubes are a vital part of every game in the series, the black cubes made from painful memories, the white from positive. The very rare blue cubes can travel through time, while the golden cubes are a combination of all three, and despite appearing in three of the games so far, have an unknown purpose. These all appear in the full-length games too, which are more traditional PnC adventures, albeit ones where you might not entirely know who it is you’re playing, when and where you are, and why that man with the stag skull for a head is suddenly staring at you through that window.</p></div><div><p>Amanita Design have been making stunning point-and-click adventures for over 20 years, knocking it out of the park straight away with 2003's surreal, adorable mini-adventure <em>Samorost</em>. The studio’s combination of collage art and adorable animation was immediately enticing, given further life through the frequent use of mouth-made sound effects on top of scores by musician Floex (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floex&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floex" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tomáš Dvořák</a></span>).</p><p>The developer is responsible for so many fantastic games, including the insect-filled <em>Botanicula</em>; one of the funniest games ever, <em>Chuchel</em>; and peculiar puzzle-cum-adventures like <em>Pilgrims</em> and <em>Creaks</em>. But it’s perhaps <em>Machinarium</em> that cemented the studio’s reputation.</p><p>This wordless point-and-click adventure, with a heavy emphasis on puzzles, is about helping a robot called Josef. Dumped on a scrapheap, you help the little tin man to return to the city and attempt to prevent a plot by some evil robots who want to blow up the city tower, all while looking to reunite with his girlfriend Berta.</p><p>There’s no dialogue at all here, neither written nor spoken, the game instead using pictograms to communicate. This immediately gives the Czech game an international understanding, and 4 million sales for a self-funded tiny team is proof of just how accessible and adorable it is.</p></div><div><p>Size Five Games, consisting of Dan Marshall and Ben Ward, have made three Ben and Dan games, but the third—the magnificent <em>Lair of the Clockwork God</em>—doesn’t quite qualify here for its excellent combination of PnC and platforming. But play it too. They’re all wonderful.</p><p>Being defiantly British in their humor many years before the arrival of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/thank-goodness-youre-here-steam-sale-absurd-comedy-1851656501&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/thank-goodness-youre-here-steam-sale-absurd-comedy-1851656501"><em>Thank Goodness You’re Here</em></a></span>, both games break almost every rule of what’s acceptable in a modern point-and-click adventure. Utterly verboten are LucasArts’ games references and self-aware jokes about being a game, and yet, they’re <em>hilarious</em>.</p><p>Based loosely on the developers, the two protagonists make you immediately feel like you’re part of the in-jokes of their deep friendship, as they set off to try to fix the antenna on their TV so they can watch <em>Magnum P.I.</em> This, as you’d expect, causes them to become abducted by aliens, and travel to all manner of universes. That’s the first game, <em>Ben There, Dan That!</em> (the obnoxious exclamation point insisted upon), which was released in 2008 for free. It’s now bundled with <em>Time Gentlemen, Please!</em>, and the two games make a perfect pairing.</p><p>In <em>TGP</em>, the pair continue on from the previous adventure, accidentally killing everyone in the world by making them watch a <em>Magnum P.I. </em>marathon. So obviously it’s time for time travel to try to put this right, while also battling the efforts of their evil future selves, and accidentally giving Hitler access to dinosaurs. Yeah, that sort of stuff.</p><p>As “wacky” as it all sounds, it’s all extraordinarily funny, the writing piling excellent jokes on top of one another while spoofing the genre, itself, themselves, you, pretty much everything. They’re two of the funniest games you can hope to find.</p></div><div><p>Don’t get upset, you’re perfectly welcome to substitute any of the Telltale series you prefer into this slot. You can even have the <em>Walking Dead</em> games if you want, even if they’re not really point-and-click adventures, but rather choose-your-own-adventures and actually rather overrated. Or put in <em>The Wolf Among Us</em> given that it’s brilliant. I’ve picked <em>Strong Bad’s Cool Game For Attractive People</em> because I’m so incredibly fond of both <em>Homestar Runner</em> and Mike Stemmle.</p><p>Telltale’s episodic adventures were always  hit-and-miss—the atrocious first couple of <em>Sam &amp; Max</em> games before the developer finally found its feet with the fantastic <em>The Devil’s Playhouse</em>) or the openly dreadful <em>Puzzle Agent </em>representing the nadir—but when everything fell into place, they could be a joy. The five <em>Strong Bad</em> games represent this for me perfectly.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://homestarrunner.com/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://homestarrunner.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Homestar Runner</em></a></span> had pretty much wound down by this point, the Brothers Chaps (Matt Chapman and Mike Chapman) having stopped making weekly cartoons on the site, so seeing them writing for this run of daft adventures set in the cartoon series’ world was already a great pleasure. Then, Telltale brought Mike Stemmle on board, one half of the dream-team of adventure writers that brought us <em>Sam &amp; Max: Hit the Road</em> in 1993. And the results are hilarious, with really decent puzzles.</p><p>The five games are just what you could want them to be: like being able to fully interact with a <em>Homestar Runner</em> cartoon, replete with all the running jokes including Teen Girl Squad, Trogdor, 20X6, and the arcade minigames of revered ‘80s developers Videlectrix. (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rps-speaks-exclusively-to-videlectrix&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rps-speaks-exclusively-to-videlectrix" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I once was lucky enough to interview them!</a></span>)</p><p>If you’re not already a Strong Bad fan, then yes, admittedly, this is somewhat impenetrable. But then, if you’re not already a Strong Bad fan, that’s a personal failing that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/@homestarrunnerdotcom&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/@homestarrunnerdotcom" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">you would do well to correct as soon as possible</a></span>.</p></div><div><p>We already covered Ron Gilbert’s triumphant return to the <em>Monkey Island</em> franchise, but before that, he was keeping his hand in the industry he helped define with <em>Thimbleweed Park</em>.</p><p>Teaming up with fellow LucasArts alumni, artist and animator Gary Winnick, this was one of the few adventure game Kickstarter campaigns that resulted in something wonderful. <em>Thimbleweed Park</em> is a game that deliberately looks like Gilbert and Winnick’s first project, 1987's <em>Maniac Mansion</em>. As such, it used the SCUMM engine games’ verb system, letting you choose words with which to interact with the world from the bottom third of the screen.</p><p>In a perhaps belated <em>X-Files</em> spoof, you play as two FBI agents, Angela Ray and Antonio Reyes, along with three other characters as the game goes on. Much as with <em>Maniac Mansion</em>, much of the puzzle solving involved combining the abilities and actions of multiple characters as you investigate a series of murders in the town of Thimbleweed Park.</p><p>It’s very funny, as you’d expect. It’s also a <em>huge</em> game! While you might often feel like you’re drowning in nostalgia, it still manages to be a very contemporary game, too, even if it’s a little too self-referential. And remember, there’s nothing wrong with using hints—it’s how we all did it back in the day.</p></div><div><p><em>Kathy Rain</em>, by Swedish developers Clifftop Games, is a glorious example of a straightforward, unembellished point-and-click adventure, not needing to add any fancy new bells or whistles but instead delivering a rock-solid storyline with fantastic voice acting and a pile of great puzzles to solve along the way.</p><p>Kathy Rain is a college student, dragged back to her hometown after the death of her grandfather in 1995. She had a complicated relationship with him and her surviving grandmother, adopted by them when her own parents proved unable or unwilling to raise her, but always resenting them in the way a mixed-up kid will. Heading back to Conwell Springs and seeing her loving grandmother again for the first time in years obviously dredges this all up—even more so when she learns that the police never properly investigated an accident that had happened to her grandfather, leaving him in a permanent vegetative state many years earlier.</p><p>What follows is an untangling of mysteries that might be supernatural, or just very natural, and not knowing which is very much part of enjoying the game.</p><p>An awful lot of the games listed in this article are  running on the same engine: <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.adventuregamestudio.co.uk/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.adventuregamestudio.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Adventure Game Studio</a></span>. There’s a reason for this: the open-source project by Chris Jones is designed to replicate the sorts of adventure games that were popular in the 1990s, while letting developers take any graphical approach they wish. <em>Kathy Rain</em> combines some stunning rendered art with traditional pixel work, but with a level of detail that still blows my mind. That was all boosted even further when the game received a Director’s Cut in 2021 that extended the story, added new puzzles, and made the art even more impressive.</p><p>Clifftop also made the excellent <em>Whispers of a Machine </em>which also deserves a place on this list (I recently replayed both, and they are just so good), and are <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1466390/Kathy_Rain_2_Soothsayer/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1466390/Kathy_Rain_2_Soothsayer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">now working on a sequel to <em>Kathy Rain</em></a></span> in which the grumpy protagonist is now a failing private detective.</p></div><div><p>Wow, 2022 was a great year for adventure games!

It’s a game about being on the cusp of maturity, of wanting to be seen as an adult but finding safety in the trappings of childhood. And it’s a game about the fractious nature of teenager and parent relationships throughout this time. Protagonist Mara’s father died a couple of years previously, and her family is living in the wake of this grief.</p><p>What makes this so fascinating is we’re assumed to be perceiving Mara’s teenage behavior through adult eyes, able to see the glaring, horrible, heartbreaking bad assumptions she’s making, while being utterly sympathetic with her for making such mistakes. Her inability to recognize her mother’s personal grief, and to instead interpret it through childish self-absorption and solipsism, is the most utterly honest storytelling I can remember. </p><p>But, importantly, it’s not a gloomy game! It’s also about taking the first adult steps of rebelling, of first tastes of alcohol and first parties, and the decisions you make are never portrayed puritanically. Mara’s internal tumult is the story here, in beautiful, frustrating, and heartbreaking ways. We see her responses as melodrama, but we also understand that for her, this is her real life, occupying all her emotions.</p><p>I cannot express how wonderful this game is, and my subsequent joy that a sequel is being worked on. </p></div><div><p>A fantastic example of British folklore, where bucolic rural villages hide dark secrets, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/indie-horror-pc-adventure-hobs-barrow-wadjet-eye-1849632515&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/indie-horror-pc-adventure-hobs-barrow-wadjet-eye-1849632515"><em>The Excavation of Hob’s Barrow</em></a></span> demonstrates how the point-and-click adventure is so ideally suited for telling quiet, subtle stories.</p><p>Arriving in the tiny village of Bewlay, Thomasina Bateman is an explorer of ancient burial grounds and intends to excavate Hob’s Barrow. It’s perhaps the late 19th century and Bateman is made to feel unwelcome almost immediately, the locals very against some outsider poking around.</p><p>The game has the vibes of the best British ‘70s gentle horror, those Hammer movies that were more about atmosphere than lurching monsters, most especially the vibes of <em>The Wicker Man</em>. There’s a huge emphasis on getting to know the people of the village, exploring their lives and backgrounds, and in turn, Thomasina’s own, while a calm rumble of brooding danger underlies it all.</p><p>This is a game published by the aforementioned Wadjet Eye, and Gilbert is responsible for the game’s voice direction (always a welcome credit, shared by <em>Kathy Rain</em>), and does a spectacular job. This is a fantastic cast, and a brilliant ensemble performance.</p><p>This is a piece of pastoral perfection, delivering an affecting and meaningful story as only an adventure game can.</p></div><div><p>When people get nostalgic about adventures games, the focus tends to fall on 1993 onward. Mice were now ubiquitous on PC (it’s very easy to forget they weren’t always the default, and even games like <em>Doom</em> were designed to be played keyboard only!), and even LucasArts dropped the verb system by the release of <em>Sam &amp; Max</em>. At this point, they were games played with a mouse cursor alone, albeit one that switched between many modes for more interesting interaction.</p><p>But before even clickable verbs were text parsers. Sierra Online—the publisher that must receive the credit for properly popularizing the genre—originally created adventures in which interaction was performed by typing instructions into a pop-up box. “LOOK AT BOX,” “PICK UP LADDER,” “POO ON FLOOR,” and so on. (The latter got a response weirdly often in Sierra games!) This was an evolution from the same instructions being typed into text adventures, and game series like <em>Police Quest</em>, <em>King’s Quest</em>, and <em>Leisure Suit Larry</em> all started out this way. Today, however, while many of the modern games in this list are designed to hark back to previous decades, almost none return to the parser. Until 2024's <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/crimson-diamond-adventure-game-sierra-1851638458&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/crimson-diamond-adventure-game-sierra-1851638458"><em>The Crimson Diamond</em></a></span>.</p><p>Set in 1914, it finds Nancy Maple traveling to a small Canadian town called Crimson, sent by her boss to investigate the discovery of a large diamond. However, this soon develops into a full-fledged murder mystery, full of twists and turns, and all controlled not only by pointing and clicking, but also through the extraordinary number of ways the game adapts to what you choose to type in.</p><p>This is the work of one developer, Julia Minamata, and it’s an incredible feat. The EGA-style graphics make it feel extremely nostalgic, while the phenomenal parser makes sure you know this is a huge step forward from the games of the 1980s. It’s so splendid that games like this can still be made, and indeed find a wide, enthusiastic audience. You should join them!</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-livestream-comments-are-99-spam-of-%E2%80%9Cdrop-the-price%E2%80%9D.1154178/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-complains/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The first Nintendo Treehouse livestream for the Nintendo Switch 2 is live now and fans have voice their frustration over the consoles and games prices.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, 121,000 people are currently watching the livestream on the official Nintendo of America YouTube channel, with many voice voicing their frustration about the console and game prices.</p>



<p>“DROP THE PRICE” currently consists of about 99% of the comments on the stream, with a few comments here and there giving thoughts on the actual stream.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 will cost players $450, with its games going up from $70 to $80. In some regions, such as Spain, the price is an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-games-will-cost-80-for-digital-90-for-physical/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">eye-watering 90 euros for a physical game, which converts to $99.91</a> at the time of writing.</p>



<p>Nintendo raising it’s prices will undoubtedly set a precedent for other publishers moving forward, and by the end of the year, we could see $80 games normalised. </p>



<p>Earlier today, Argos, a UK retailer <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-are-already-live-in-the-uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">made its pre-orders for the Nintendo Switch 2</a> live ahead of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-announces-nintendo-switch-2-pre-order-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">worldwide April 9 pre-order date</a> and went on to sell out of the Switch 2 in a matter of hours. Argos was offering the base unit for £395.99 and the MK bundle for £429.99.</p>



<p>If you choose to pre-order via Nintendo, the company is working to limit scalpers with a new pre-order plan. According to the company, those who want to pre-order through Nintendo will have to be an active Nintendo Switch Online member for “at least two years continuously by March 31, 2025”. Players must also have spent a certain amount of time playing on the console with priority going to those who played more. It’s currently unknown how other retailers will work to combat scalping.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-first-hands-on-preview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">We're going bananas for this long-awaited 3D Donkey Kong game.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">For the last several years it’s felt like Nintendo just hasn’t cared that much about Donkey Kong. As Nintendo gifted pretty much every one of its cherished characters their best outing <em>ever </em>on Switch, the great ape who once stood high atop the girders of Nintendo’s essential arcade cabinet faceplanted hard on the concrete with a litany of ports, remakes, and remasters. But on Switch 2, Nintendo is finally giving one of gaming’s biggest icons the love he deserves with a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-announced-for-nintendo-switch-2">brand new, flagship, launch window 3D action-platformer</a>, and if the first 30 minutes we spent with Donkey Kong Bananza are any indication, Mario’s original rival is looking poised to stand tall once again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s hard to talk about Bananza without referencing that darn plumber as just seconds after jumping into its Underground World, the significant parallels to Super Mario Odyssey became abundantly clear. While Nintendo hasn’t confirmed the developers of Bananza, after playing it we’re willing to bet Odyssey developer Nintendo EPD Tokyo is behind it. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Bananza’s setup will feel instantly familiar to anyone who’s spent hours throwing Cappy and collecting Power Moons. DK is joined by an adorable assistant (this time in the form of a purple rock who talks and sings) to scour self-contained explorable sandboxes for Golden Bananas, some of which are found by completing story missions while others are sprinkled across the landscape just waiting to be found. As you explore, you find isolated linear challenge rooms that dial back the exploration in favor of testing your combat and platforming abilities. There are other collectibles to find too, like gold presumably playing the role of coins, dozens of fossils (which we didn’t find a use for during our demo) and currency  we’re hoping will be used to outfit Donkey Kong in the local flavor. Even the UI is reminiscent of Mario’s globetrotting adventure! So if you were disappointed  the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct lacked a big, flashy 3D Mario, I'm here to tell you that Donkey Kong Bananza feels like the sequel to that formula we’ve been clamoring for, it just happens to star the giant monkey instead.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Wrecking Crew</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Like the best Nintendo games, Donkey Kong’s brand new moveset completely suits him as a character and feels right the moment you step into his shoes (okay, big hairy feet). Bananza is furiously fast and delightfully destructive as Donkey Kong can demolish most of the terrain in his path, and we spent our demo transforming the lush opening area filled with grass, trees, and lakes into DK’s personal chaotic excavation site. DK punches forward, upward, and downward, instantly destroying most materials and oftentimes carving a makeshift path to follow that can lead to entirely new areas. At one point I was punching through a mountain just for the heck of it and a valuable collectible fell into my lap, so there’s definitely value to breaking ground everywhere you can – it may lead to a groundbreaking discovery.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If pulverizing every stone wall in sight sounds overwhelming, it really didn’t feel that way in the moment, which is likely due to how much fun we had controlling Donkey Kong. In addition to turning everything to rubble, Donkey Kong can also pick up giant stone boulders from the ground, walls, or wherever, and hurl them to obliterate nearby enemies. Or, he takes a page out of Link’s book and can use the stone slab to boogie board at a rapid pace across the landscape. There are surely dozens of unique moves and chain combos waiting to be discovered and I can imagine how much fun speedrunners will have trying to master DK’s moveset, which already feels ripe with expressiveness and possibility. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Nintendo Direct: Nintendo Switch 2 - Donkey Kong Bananza</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Bananza’s central theme of exploration via destruction was present throughout every second of our demo, even down to the map screen. Instead of a simple top-down overview of the landscape, the map here is a fully-rendered 3D model of the entire area <em>in its current state, </em>meaning when you pause to get your bearings, you can see all of the walls you’ve punched and caves you’ve carved. It’s like the Hero’s Path feature in Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom cranked up to 11, and it felt like an incredibly impressive touch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That map helped us track down challenge rooms which rewarded us either with Golden Bananas or a ton of cash. And unlike Odyssey, there’s no more wondering if you have a Moon left to find and going inside to wait for Cappy to tell you, because the entrance to each bonus room tracks how many Golden Bananas you’ve found and how many more are waiting within. We saw three of these rooms in Bananza’s opening area, with each focusing on either platforming, combat, or destruction: we had to monkey bar our way through an obstacle course, take down three stone enemies before time ran out, and blast through as much gold ore as possible to take home a big payday. They were all fun and unique and left me excited to see what other challenges are in store.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Nintendo Switch 2 Direct April 2025 Games</h3><p>Every game shown in Nintendo's April 2 Nintendo Switch 2 reveal direct event.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I also think Bananza is on track to be one of the most gorgeous Nintendo games I’ve seen. It really does take advantage of Switch 2's hardware – the environments are beautiful and DK’s animations are wonderfully expressive, and I left feeling like the next generation of first-party Nintendo games had truly arrived.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Donkey Kong Bananza is out July 17 for $69.99, and I might destroy my entire house if I have to wait that long to play it again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Logan Plant is the host of Nintendo Voice Chat and IGN's Database Manager &amp; Playlist Editor. He played the entire Donkey Kong Country series earlier this year and is so excited for a brand new DK game.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/we-played-nintendo-switch-2-first-hands-on-preview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">After years of speculation, months of leaks, and weeks since its official reveal, the Nintendo Switch 2 finally has a price and a release date… And we’ve actually held it and played it. Read on for our first impressions of the Switch 2’s build quality, screen, mouse mode, and more. Since two of us here at IGN got to spend a ton of time with it, we figured we’d both take turns telling you all about it, like we’re two friends sitting next to you on a couch. Hey buddy! Wanna hear about Nintendo Switch 2?</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Switch 2 Screen: LCD vs OLED (and Docked Performance)</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Brian Altano: </strong>Let’s start with the Switch 2 screen since it’s the thing you’re gonna look at the most, unless you plan on playing entirely in docked mode or you drop your device on the floor and decide to never pick it up again, which would be weird and rude. Unlike the first Nintendo Switch, Switch 2 won’t have an OLED option at launch (admittedly kind of a bummer!) but it’s probably so Nintendo can keep costs down and eventually get us to upgrade to a Switch 2 OLED in a few years, so hey, it sort of makes sense for now. That said, Switch 2 has a 1080p screen in handheld mode which immediately looks way better than Switch 1’s 720p non-OLED screen did. Colors pop and look vibrant and most of the games we played run smooth and at a consistent framerate in handheld mode, so it’s not a total dealbreaker here. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Plus, Switch 2 is capable of 4K and HDR docked, or up to 120FPS in some games (just never all of those things at once) so you’ll get better looking and playing games this time around either way, plus better looking upgrades of many of your old Switch games. We walked into our hands-on preview expecting to miss the OLED display but walked out completely satisfied with the Switch 2’s LCD, so it’s not the end of the world for Nintendo fans. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Logan Plant: </strong>Even better though, the games we played docked looked great on televisions, including the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-nintendo-switch-2-will-improve-switch-1-games">Nintendo Switch 2 Editions of original Switch games</a> like Tears of the Kingdom, Breath of the Wild, and Metroid Prime 4. This is the version of Breath of the Wild we wanted at launch, with no noticeable slowdown whatsoever in moments that taxed the original Switch hardware, like when Link set everything on fire and it felt like my Switch was going to burst into flames. The Switch 2 dock has a built-in fan, so that should help keep things cool and maintain performance in TV mode. Switch 2-exclusive games like Mario Kart World and Donkey Kong Bananza looked gorgeous too, and both feel like great showcases of Nintendo’s timeless art direction running great on newer hardware. We’re a little worried about the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-tech-specs-battery-life-4k-and-up-to-120fps-storage-and-more">listed battery life of 2 - 6.5 hours</a>, but that number honestly makes sense given how good the performance was in handheld mode.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Until we really get some significant time with the console along with finished versions of the games, it’s tough to say exactly how long the battery will last, but one thing that almost certainly won’t change before Switch 2 launches on June 5th is the actual design of the hardware itself...</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Nintendo Switch 2 System and Accessories Gallery</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Altano: </strong>One of my biggest issues with the original Nintendo Switch was the build quality. Joy-Con drift aside, the system itself just felt a bit wobbly at times. Joy-Con and anything else you attached to the console felt loose, the kickstand was flimsy, and the launch dock literally scratched the screen. That all feels largely improved with Nintendo Switch 2 from what we played so far. Overall the system feels much more sturdy and much less like a fancy toy like Switch 1 did, with sleek ergonomic design and no Joy-Con wobble. It’s got a nice weight to it and holding it side by side with a Steam Deck (which we literally did) makes it feel lighter and less bulky. Sticks, triggers, and buttons all feel great too, as does the d-pad. We didn’t get to play any 2D games like twitchy sidescrolling platformers or classic fighters, but the d-pad feels like it will hopefully be better for them. Buttons have that nice clicky feel they had on Switch 1 but feel slightly softer and are slightly bigger. This is definitely a system aimed for an older audience than the first Nintendo Switch, and not just because of the premium price tag. It doesn’t even have a fun, kid friendly alternate colorway available at launch like Nintendo usually does, just dark gray with some muted colors hidden inside the Joy-Con 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Plant: </strong>Speaking of the Joy-Con 2, the sticks feel nice and smooth to rotate, but Nintendo isn’t saying yet if they’re Hall-effect joysticks, which was a frustrating omission from the hardware overview in the Direct. Presumably they’ve done whatever it takes to avoid Joy-Con drift again this time around, but until players really start putting the Switch 2 through its paces, there’s no real way of knowing if Mario will slowly start walking to the left as time goes on and wear and tear impact the performance of your controllers. In general, the new and improved Joy-Con 2 controllers look better, feel better, and the way they snap on and off feels immensely satisfying. Brian and I took turns clicking them on and off the Switch 2 unit dozens of times which probably made us both look like we were a little bit crazy, but it really is a noticeable upgrade. When we first heard they’d be using magnets to attach the Joy-Con there were a lot of concerns they’d be flimsy, but so far they’re the total opposite. </p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Nintendo Switch 2 Direct April 2025 Games</h3><p>Every game shown in Nintendo's April 2 Nintendo Switch 2 reveal direct event.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Then there are the brand new mouse control options for certain games, which worked surprisingly well – especially with the haptic feedback with each “click” of the shoulder button. In select games, you can turn the Joy-Con sideways and drag them across a flat, smooth surface to mimic the functions of a PC mouse, and it feels like a classic “weird, innovative, and very fun” Nintendo design decision. We used these controls in a variety of ways like aiming in Metroid Prime 4, playing air hockey in Mario Party, and trying out tech demo-like minigames in the odd new Switch 2 Welcome Tour game, and they were largely responsive. Metroid smartly lets you swap back and forth between pointer controls and mouse controls seamlessly without having to go into settings to change them, and I could see mouse controls becoming the preferred way for a lot of people to play Prime 4 – as long as you have easy access to a flat surface. It can sometimes feel awkward – I wish the Joy-Con 2 was just a bit wider as a mouse and I occasionally had to crane my pointer finger or thumb at a weird angle to hit a face button – but the improved aiming precision felt worth these small concessions. The Joy-Con 2 straps even have mouse feet – those little rubber bumpers on the bottom of your PC mouse that I had to Google the name of because I’ve gone my entire life never needing to know what they were called until today.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>The Kickstand, C-Button, Built-in Mic, and Accessories</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Altano: </strong>There are also some less immediately noticeable additions on Switch 2 that you’ll probably end up using for a bunch of things. The new kickstand feels significantly improved over the launch Switch model from 2017. It can practically lay flat and move to almost any viewing angle and doesn’t feel like it’s going to instantly snap off. I think I still slightly prefer the Switch OLED’s flat panel kickstand over this one, but time will tell. Meanwhile, we didn’t get to launch anything with the new C-button tucked under the right Joy-Con 2’s home button, but it’s a nice inclusion and is largely used to pull up Game Chat and video interactions. We did get to play some Mario Party minigames with the new camera peripheral, though, which is sold separately for $50. It placed fuzzy versions of us into warp pipes and cropped out our backgrounds like we were on a Zoom call, except instead of our bosses getting mad at us for the typos in this article, Bowser breathed fire on us. Other third-party cameras will be supported by Switch 2 in case you have a couple of those sitting around and don’t want to buy a new one on launch day alongside a $450 Switch 2 and an $80 Mario Kart World (or $50 if you get the $500 bundle with the console, but you see my point).</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Plant: </strong>Then there’s the Switch 2’s built in microphone which we literally only tested by seeing which of our Mario Party teams could yell the loudest, but ideally you’ll use it for much more normal things like casual voice chat between Switch 2 friends while you’re sitting on the couch. You’ll also be able to hear them talk via the newly added headphone jack on the Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller (or just regular in-game audio… Right, Nintendo? Right?!) and it’s just one of the many things that feels better about the new Pro Controller. It’s even got programmable GL and GR back buttons, a feature that has become pretty common with controllers on other consoles, and while we didn’t get to assign functions to them during our preview, they were nice and clicky. It’s also got amiibo support and new Zelda and Street Fighter amiibo were announced this week, so if you collect amiibo, get ready for your third console generation of buying amiibo.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Is Switch 2 Worth the Upgrade?</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Altano: </strong>Okay, so it’s tough to say if this system will do Switch 1 numbers worldwide. Switch 1 had a ton of factors in its favor, like a $300 price tag and an open world Zelda at launch, a mountain of Wii U ports that were brand new games to most people, and a global pandemic that made a bunch of people get back into video games for the first time in a while. But Switch 1 is the second best-selling video game console ever made so hey, that’s a lofty goal. Ultimately it’s a steady software lineup that keeps Nintendo consoles successful, but factors like press make a big difference too, and a $450 launch price might be a bit steep for people wanting to impulsively buy a new system for themselves or their kids or for people who are just happy enough with their original Switch model. But tech wise, Switch 2 solves a lot of the problems that Switch 1 had. A bunch of older Switch games look better on it, it’s got a really fun new and exclusive Mario Kart game, and holding the console made me want to take it home immediately. I’m a longtime Nintendo fan so I was probably always going to be there on day one but this system feels like the kind of thing I want to play games on and travel with for years to come. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Plant: </strong>Switch 2 is a more premium product and the price tag reflects that. It’s also a better version of a great thing, and it’s trying to pull off a bunch of cool new tricks at the same time, like mouse controls. Obviously we’re both buying Switch 2 on day one, and I did really love our hands-on time with the console. But I’ll be honest and say I have some concerns about if the general public is willing to adopt a $450 Nintendo console with an $80 Mario Kart. It’s a big ask for a company that traditionally targets families and younger players, and I feel like the high cost of entry limits the Switch 2’s potential to take off in the way its predecessor did. But for those of you that do decide to take the plunge, you’ll be getting what’s shaping up to be a great hybrid console that makes a ton of worthwhile improvements on the original Switch and adds some fun bells and whistles for good measure.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo Switch 2 is out on June 5th for $450.

    <div>
                      
                      
          <p>Among the changes mentioned in yesterday's Nintendo Switch 2 presentation was a note that the new console doesn't just support MicroSD Express cards for augmenting the device's 256GB of internal storage, but it <em>requires&nbsp;</em>MicroSD Express. Whatever plentiful, cheap microSD card you're using in your current Switch, including Sandisk's Nintendo-branded ones, can't migrate over to your Switch 2 alongside all your Switch 1 games.</p>
<h2>MicroSD Express, explained</h2>
<p>Why is regular-old MicroSD no longer good enough? It all comes down to speed.</p>
<p>Most run-of-the-mill SD and microSD cards you can buy today are using some version of the Ultra High Speed (UHS) standard. Designed to augment the default speed (12.5MB/s) and high speed (25MB/s) from the earliest versions of the SD card standard, the three UHS versions enable data transfers of up to 624MB/s.</p>
<p>But most commodity microSD cards, including pricier models like Samsung's Pro Ultimate series, use UHS-I, which has a maximum data transfer speed of 104MB/s. The original Switch uses a UHS-I microSD card slot for storage expansion.</p>
<p>Why have newer and faster versions of the standard—UHS-II, UHS-III, and SD Express—failed to achieve critical mass? Because for most consumer applications, it turns out that 100-ish megabytes per second is plenty. The SD Association itself says that 90MB per second is good enough to record an 8K video stream at up to 120 frames per second. Recording pictures and video is the most demanding thing most SD cards are called upon to do—give or take <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/what-i-learned-from-using-a-raspberry-pi-5-as-my-main-computer-for-two-weeks/">a Raspberry Pi-based computer</a>—and you don't need to overspend to get extra speed you're not going to use.</p>
<p>All of that said, there&nbsp;<em>is</em> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbItTEmozxw">a small but measurable increase in launch and loading times</a> when loading games from the original Switch's microSD card instead of from internal storage. And for games with chronic performance issues like <em>Pokémon Scarlet&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Violet</em>, one of the community-suggested fixes was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2022/11/video-you-can-improve-pokemon-scarlet-and-violets-performance-yourself">to move the game from your microSD card to your Switch's internal storage</a>&nbsp;to alleviate one of the system's plentiful performance bottlenecks.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>The Switch 2's additional power opens the door to more complex games that could lag even more noticeably, especially if they're ported from consoles that expect more than 50 times the storage bandwidth (Sony requires an SSD with read speeds of at least 5,500MB/s for the PlayStation 5).</p>
<p>And that's where SD Express comes in. These cards are connected to the same PCI Express/NVMe interface that internal SSDs use in modern PCs and the other game consoles, theoretically giving your SD card access to the same bandwidth as internal storage.</p>
<p>Now, you won't actually&nbsp;<em>get</em> performance as fast as an internal SSD using this interface. The speed varies a lot based on the PCI Express version your gadget is using (3.0 or 4.0) and how many "lanes" of bandwidth it's allowed to use (these are, in short, the connections between a device's CPU and external accessories like SSDs, Wi-Fi adapters, or dedicated GPUs, and all CPUs and SoCs have a limited number of them to hand out). Depending on these factors, microSD Express can deliver anywhere between 985MB/s and 3940MB/s of theoretical bandwidth.</p>
<p>MicroSD cards will also be slowed down because there are fewer physical flash memory chips to write to at a time, a process called "interleaving" that is responsible for much of an SSD's speed. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DFQGVLYF">This SanDisk microSD Express card</a>, one of the only ones actually available at retail right now, lists its top speeds as 880MB/s for reads and 650MB/s for writes.</p>
<p>But even at its worst, this is several times the amount of bandwidth available to whatever UHS-I microSD card is inserted into your current Switch. Express cards won't make an SD card feel as fast as internal storage, but it will help the microSD card keep pace a bit.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<h2>At what cost?</h2>
<p>One other benefit of workaday, plain-old UHS-I microSD cards? The price. Great ones are cheap. Good-enough ones are <em>dirt</em> cheap, even if you stick to major storage vendors like Samsung, Sandisk, and Lexar (<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/08/walmart-lists-a-30tb-portable-ssd-for-39-it-is-naturally-a-scam/">please do not buy no-name solid state storage</a>). A quality 256GB microSD card will run you around $20, a pittance compared to whatever you paid for the device you're putting it in.</p>
<p>For the SanDisk microSD Express, the same amount of storage will run you around $60. This is not only more expensive than a regular cheap SD card, but it's more expensive than actual internal SSDs. The cheaper name-brand 1TB internal SSDs, including <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C8XMH264">some sold by SanDisk parent company Western Digital</a>, can give you four times as much space for around the same price.</p>
<p>These prices should go down over time, and the Switch 2 will be a part of the reason why—at a bare minimum, it will likely prompt the creation of multiple alternate microSD Express options from SanDisk's competitors. But at launch, it may still feel like a raw deal because it's just one of&nbsp;many things about the Switch 2 that costs more money than the Switch 1. Compared to the first Switch, you're paying between $100 and $150 more for the console itself, $10 more for each pair of Joy-Cons or Pro Controllers you buy, $50 for a replacement dock, and between $10 and $20 more for first-party games.</p>
<p>The Switch 2's relatively generous 256GB of internal storage should help you avoid the need for an SD card, and it could be all you ever need if you manage your storage space carefully. But the extra cost of microSD Express on top of everything else does rankle, even if the technical reasons behind the move are totally justifiable.</p>

<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 could be considered the most direct "sequel" to a Nintendo console that the company has ever made. The lineage is right there in the name, with Nintendo simply appending the number "2" onto the name of <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/hard_soft/index.html">its incredibly successful previous console</a> for the first time in its history.</p>
<p>Nintendo's previous consoles have all differed from their predecessors in novel ways that were reflected in somewhat new naming conventions. The Switch 2's name, on the other hand, suggests that it is content to primarily be "more Switch." And after spending the better part of the day playing around with the Switch 2 hardware and checking out some short game demos on Wednesday, I indeed came away with the impression that this console is "more Switch" in pretty much every way that matters, for better or worse.</p>
<h2>Bigger is better</h2>
<p>We've <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/01/how-big-is-the-switch-2-trailer-suggests-7-9-screen-10-5-width-w-joy-cons/">deduced from previous trailers</a> just how much bigger the Switch 2 would be than the original Switch. Even with that preparation, though, the expanded Switch 2 makes a very good first impression in person.</p>


<p>Yes, the Switch 2 feels a good deal more substantial in the hands—Nintendo's <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/corporate/release/en/2025/250402.html">official stats page</a> pegs it at about 34 percent heavier than the original Switch (as well as a tad wider and taller). But Nintendo's new console is still noticeably short of Steam Deck-level bulk, coming in about 17 percent lighter (and a bit less wide and thick) than Valve's handheld.</p>
<p>That extra size and weight over the original Switch is being put to good use, nowhere more so than in a 7.9-inch screen that feels downright luxurious on a handheld that's this compact. That screen might be missing a best-in-class high-contrast OLED panel, but the combination of full 1080p resolution, HDR colors, and variable frame rates up to 120 fps still results in a handheld display that we feel would hold up well next to the best modern OLED competition.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>The system's extra size also allows for Joy-Cons that are expanded just enough to be much better suited for adult hands, with much less need for grown-ups to contort into a claw-like grip just to get a solid hold. That's even true when the controllers are popped out from the system, which is now easily accomplished with a solidly built lever on the rear of each controller (reconnecting the Joy-Cons by slotting them in with a hefty magnetic snap feels equally solid).</p>


<p>The controls on offer here are still a bit smaller than you might be used to on controllers designed for home consoles or even those on larger handhelds like the Steam Deck. But the enlarged buttons are now less likely to press uncomfortably into the pad of your thumb than those on the Switch. And the slightly larger-than-Switch joysticks are a bit easier to maneuver precisely, with a longer physical travel distance from center to edge.</p>
<p>Speaking of joysticks, Nintendo has yet to go on record regarding whether it is using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hall_effect_sensor">the coveted "magnetic Hall effect" sensors</a> that would prevent <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/04/nintendo-promises-unlimited-repairs-for-drifting-joy-cons-throughout-europe/">the kind of stick drift that plagued the original Switch Joy-Cons</a>. When asked about the stick drift issue in a roundtable Q&amp;A, Switch 2 Technical Director Tetsuya Sasaki would only say that the "new Joy-Con 2 controllers have been designed from the ground up from scratch to have bigger, smoother movement."</p>



<p>When it comes to raw processing power, it's all relative. The Switch 2 is a noticeable step up from the eight-year-old Switch but an equally noticeable step down from modern top-of-the-line consoles.</p>
<p>Playing the Switch 2 Edition of <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>, for instance, feels like playing the definitive version of the modern classic, thanks mostly to increased (and silky smooth) frame rates and quick-loading menus. But an early build of <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> felt relatively rough on the Switch 2, with visuals that clocked somewhere just south of a PS4 Pro (though this could definitely change with some more development polish before launch). All told, I'd guess that the Switch 2 should be able to handle effective ports of pretty much any game that runs on the Steam Deck, with maybe a little bit of extra graphical panache to show for the trouble.</p>

<h2>A mouse? On a game console?</h2>
<p>Nintendo has a history of trying to differentiate its consoles with new features that have never been seen before. Some, like shoulder buttons or analog sticks, become industry standards that other companies quickly aim to copy. Others, like a tablet controller or glasses-free stereoscopic 3D, are rightly remembered as half-baked gimmicks that belong in the dustbin of game industry history.</p>
<p>I can't say which side of that divide the Switch 2's Joy-Con "mouse mode," which lets you use a Joy-Con on its side like a mouse, will fall on. But if I had to guess, I'd go with the gimmicky side.</p>
<div>

    <p><span>It works, but it's kind of awkward.</span>
                    <span>

<p>The main problem with "mouse mode" is that the Switch 2 Joy-Cons lack the wide, palm-sized base and top surface you'd find on a standard PC mouse. Instead, when cradled in mouse mode, a Joy-Con stands awkwardly on an edge that's roughly the width of an adult finger. The top isn't much better, with only a small extension to rest a second finger on the jutting shoulder button that serves as a "right-click" option on the right Joy-Con (the thinner "left click" shoulder button ends up feeling uncomfortably narrow in this mode).</p>
<p>This thin "stand-up" design means that in mouse mode, the thumb side of your palm tends to spill awkwardly over the buttons and joysticks on the inner edge of the Joy-Con, which are easy to press accidentally in some gameplay situations. Meanwhile, on the other side, your ring finger and pinky will have to contort uncomfortably to get a solid grip that can nudge or lift the Joy-Con as necessary.</p>


<p>These ergonomic problems were most apparent when playing <em>Drag x Drop</em>, a Switch 2 exclusive that I can confidently say is the first video game I've ever played using two mice at once. Using long, vertical swoops of those mice, you can push and pull the wheels on either side of a wheelchair in a kind of tank-like fashion to dash, reverse, pivot, and gently turn with some degree of finesse in a game of three-on-three basketball.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>That repetitive mouse-swooping motion started to strain my upper arms after just a few minutes of play, though. And I ended my brief <em>Drag x Drop</em> play sessions with some soreness in my palm from having to constantly and quickly grasp the Joy-Con to reposition on the playing surface.</p>
<p>These problems were less pronounced in games that relied on more subtle mouse movements. In a short demo of <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em>, for instance, using mouse mode and a few small flicks of the wrist let me change my aim much more quickly and precisely than using a joystick and/or the Joy-Con's built-in gyroscopes (or even the IR-based "pointer" on the Wii's <em>Metroid Prime 3</em>). While my grip on the narrow Joy-Con still felt a bit awkward, the overall lack of mouse motion made it much less noticeable, even after a 20-minute demo session.</p>

<p><em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em> also integrates mouse controls well into the existing design of the game, letting you lock the camera on the center of an enemy while using the mouse to make fine aim adjustments as they move or even hit other enemies far off to the side of the screen as needed. The game's first boss seems explicitly designed as a sort of tutorial for this combination aiming, with off-center weak points that almost require quick flicks of the mouse-controlling wrist while jumping and dodging using the accessible buttons on the thumb side.</p>

<p>Other mouse-based Switch 2 demos Nintendo showed this week almost seemed specifically designed to appeal to PC gamers. The Switch 2 version of <em>Civilization VII</em>, for instance, played practically identically to the PC version, with a full mouse pointer that eliminates the need for any awkward controller mapping. And the new mouse-based mini-games in <em>Mario Party Jamboree</em> felt like the best kind of early Macintosh tech demos, right down to one that is a close mimic of <a href="https://gamesfromtheblackhole.wordpress.com/2020/10/04/shufflepuckcafe/">the cult classic <em>Shufflepuck Cafe</em></a>. A few games even showed the unique promise of a "mouse" that includes its own gyroscope sensor, letting players rotate objects by twisting their wrist or shoot a basketball with a quick "lift and flick" motion.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          


<p>The biggest problem with the Switch 2's mouse mode, though, is imagining how the average living room player is going to use it. Nintendo's demo area featured large, empty tables where players could easily slide their Joy-Cons to their hearts' content. To get the same feeling at home, the average sofa-bound Switch player will have to crouch awkwardly over a cleared coffee table or perhaps invest in some sort of lap desk.</p>
<p>Nintendo actually recommends that couch-bound mouse players slide the Joy-Con's narrow edge across the top of the thigh area of their pants. I was pleasantly surprised at how well this worked for the long vertical mouse swipes of <em>Drag x Drop</em>. For games that involved more horizontal mouse movement, though, a narrow, rounded thigh-top does not serve as a very natural mouse pad.</p>
<p>You can test this for yourself by placing an optical mouse on your thigh and going about your workday. If you get weird looks from your boss, you can tell them I said it was OK.</p>
<h2>Start your engines</h2>
<p>Mouse gimmicks aside, Nintendo is leaning heavily on two first-party exclusives to convince customers that the system is worth buying in the crucial early window after its June 5 launch. While neither makes <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/01/hands-on-with-nintendo-switch-jack-of-all-trades-master-of-some/">the massive first impression that <em>Breath of the Wild</em> did eight years ago</a>, both seem like able demonstrations for the new console.</p>

<p><em>Mario Kart World</em> feels like just the kind of update the long-running casual racer needs. While you can still race through pre-set "cups" in Grand Prix mode, I was most interested in the ability to just drive aimlessly between the race areas, searching for new locations in a freely roamable open world map.</p>
<p>Racing against 23 different opponents per race might sound overwhelming on paper, but in practice, the constant jockeying for position ends up being pretty engaging, like a slower-paced version of <em>F-Zero GX</em>. It definitely doesn't hurt that items in <em>World</em> are much less punishing than in previous <em>Kart</em> games; most projectiles and hazards now merely slow your momentum rather than halting it completely. Drifts feel a bit more languorous here, too, with longer arcs needed to get the crucial "sparks" required for a boost.</p>

<p>While the solo races were fine, I had a lot more fun in Knockout Tour mode, <em>Mario Kart World</em>'s Battle Royale-style elimination race. After pairing up with 23 other human players online, Knockout Tour mode selects a route through six connected sections of the world map for you to race through. The bottom four racers are eliminated at every section barrier until just four racers remain to vie for first place at the end.</p>

<p>This design makes for a lot of tense moments as players use up their items and jockey for position at the end of each section cutoff. The frequent changes in style and scenery along a multi-section Knockout Tour competition also make races more interesting than multiple laps around the same old turns. And I liked how the reward for playing well in this mode is getting to play more; success in Knockout Tour mode means a good ten to fifteen minutes of uninterrupted racing.</p>

<p>Nintendo's other big first-party Switch 2 exclusive, <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, might not be the new 3D Mario game <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/what-were-expecting-from-nintendos-switch-2-announcement-wednesday/">we were hoping for</a>. Even so, it was incredibly cathartic to jump, dig, and punch my way through the demo island's highly destructible environments, gathering countless gold trinkets and collectibles as I did. The demo is full of a lot of welcome, lighthearted touches, like the ability to surf on giant slabs of rock or shake the controller for a very ape-like beating of Donkey Kong's chest. (Why? Just because.)</p>
<p>One of my colleagues joked that the game might as well be called <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2009/04/red-faction-guerilla-demo-is-out-now-worth-your-time/">Red Faction: Gorilla</a>, but I'd compare it more to the joyful destruction of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/10/lego-dc-super-villains-review-a-familiar-simple-romp-through-the-dcu/">Travellers Tales' many Lego games</a>.</p>
<p>A single whirlwind day with the Switch 2 isn't nearly enough to get a full handle on the system's potential, of course. Nintendo didn't demonstrate any of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/nintendo-offers-new-details-on-switch-2-hardware-software/">the new GameChat features it announced Wednesday morning</a>&nbsp;or the adaptive microphone that supposedly powers easy on-device voice chat.</p>
<p>Still, what we were able to sample this week has us eager to spend more time with the "more Switch" when it hits stores in just a couple of months.</p>

            <p>At yesterday's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> Direct, Nintendo revealed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-kart-world-announced-as-switch-2-launch-title-complete-with-24-player-races-new-modes-and-more">launch game Mario Kart World</a>. It's an evolution of the series by going open world, but how does that impact its Grand Prix mode?</p>
<p>Today, in a Nintendo Treehouse: Live presentation, more of the game was shown, which answered some questions. For instance, if the map is one continuous world, will the races still consist of standard lap courses?</p>
<p>The answer is yes and no. If you've played <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-8">Mario Kart 8</a> (who hasn't), you'll be aware of the Mount Wario track (and others) that's not in laps but is one continuous track split into sections. It seems that's how many of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>'s courses will operate, to give the flow of multiple locations existing in one world.</p>

<p>In the Treehouse example, Nintendo showed the Mushroom Cup consisting of four tracks: Mario Bros. Circuit, Crown City, Whistlestop Summit, and DK Spaceport. These are distinct locations, but blend together into a consistent Grand Prix.</p>
<p>Mario Bros. Circuit takes place in the desert, with the Yoshi Diner and more from the game's initial tease. It begins with a standing start and runs over three laps, as usual. (Note, though, the weather does dynamically change as the race plays out)</p>

<p>Things change with the second course. After the first race concludes, the second continues from the same location in a rolling start. The track blends into Crown City as one path split into three "laps" towards the finish line, the environment slowly morphing from desert motorway to cityscape.</p>
<p>The third track operates in a similar manner, beginning with a rolling start and then the environment slowly changing over one continuous track split into lap sections. However, the final two laps form a complete circuit for a more traditional race feel, overall blending the two styles.</p>
<p>My favourite of the tracks was the final DK Spaceport, clearly inspired by the classic Donkey Kong arcade game with its red rails and giant barrels, and taking place continuously over eight lap sections.</p>

<p>After the Grand Prix, Nintendo showed the Free Roam mode. Players can effectively drive across the entire world however they please, which, more than anything, shows the genius of Nintendo's level design that not only do the courses work individually, but they blend together into a continuous world too.</p>
<p>Free Roam also allows players to teleport to a specific course, and includes a photo mode to tinker with screenshots before uploading to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-looks-to-be-streamlining-screenshot-and-video-sharing-so-its-less-of-a-faff">improved capture sharing on the revamped Switch app</a>.</p>
