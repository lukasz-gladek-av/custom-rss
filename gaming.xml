			<p><strong>Pearl Abyss</strong> has debuted a new gameplay overview trailer for <strong>Crimson Desert</strong>, the long-awaited open-world action adventure game that began its life as a completely different game from what will launch on <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-has-release-date-recommended-requirements-reduced/">March 19, 2026</a></strong>. The 15-minute-long showcase highlights the game's story, which follows its protagonist <strong>Kliff</strong>, and shows off the five distinct regions of Pywel, the game's vast open-world setting.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-interview-with-lead-producer-jason-jung-co-op-campaign-new-engine-ray-tracing-support/">When Pearl Abyss first revealed Crimson Desert</a>, the plan was for it to be an MMORPG for the next generation of consoles and PCs. That was seven years ago, and the next-gen is now the current-gen, and just a year into that plan, Pearl Abyss decided to <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-shifts-from-mmo-to-open-world-action-adventure-with-multiplayer-support-launch-set-for-winter-2021/"><strong>entirely overhaul the direction of the game</strong>.</a> After <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-delayed-to-q1-2026/">multiple delays</a></strong>, the team is finally ready to release the single-player open-world adventure, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-release-date-gone-gold-pearl-abyss/">just last week confirmed that the game had officially "<em><strong>gone gold</strong></em>."</a></p>



<p>Today's new overview, which you can check out below, is an in-depth look at the game's story, which follows Kliff, a Greymane warrior who fights to protect the innocent and his fellow Greymanes like they're his own family. Our story with Kliff begins shortly after the peace he and his fellow Greymanes were enjoying is shattered, and he embarks on a journey to take back his homeland and reunite his lost Greymanes, but within that quest, he discovers a darker conspiracy at play.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Features Overview #1: Kliff and the Open World of Pywel | Crimson Desert" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MfZCV8EySac?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>That darker element is the Abyss, a realm that holds incredible amounts of power, power that some are looking to exploit, which further drives the Abyss towards imbalance and threatens to harm the rest of the world if Kliff can't put a stop to it first.</p>



<p>Nothing about the story seems necessarily groundbreaking, but that's perfectly fine so long as it's executed well. Besides, while the game's narrative might be the vehicle that carries players through the land of Pywel, the engine driving everything is its wide exploration and gameplay variety.</p>



<p>You'll be able to explore five regions that make up the setting of Pywel: <strong>Hernand, Pailune, Demeniss, Delesyia </strong>and the<strong> Crimson Desert</strong>. Each region has its own stories and environment, with players being free to explore the world of Pywel in any order they choose.</p>



<p>The overview also shows off the two other playable characters beyond Kliff, which you'll unlock as the story progresses. It also features a quick look at the mix of fantasy and sci-fi embedded within Crimson Desert, since you'll be able to jump from classic sword and shield medieval combat to flying around in a giant missile-launching mech.</p>



<p>Needless to say, Pearl Abyss has packed a lot into Crimson Desert, and today's overview didn't even go too in-depth on the game's combat.

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/869386/ai-game-development-gdc-survey</link>
            <guid>1420117</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>While generative AI is being adopted at various levels of game development, a new survey suggests that developers increasingly think the technology is bad for the industry. According to the most recent survey from the Game Developers Conference, 52 percent of respondents said that gen AI is having a “negative” impact on the games industry, versus just 7 percent who viewed the technology as “positive.” Perhaps most startling is how the negative outlook has grown over the years: in 2024, just 18 percent of those surveyed viewed the tech as a negative, and that number jumped to 30 percent in 2025. Now it’s up to more than half.</p><p>GDC surveyed 2,300 “game industry professionals” to get these results, and the demographics are primarily male (64 percent), white (67 percent), and based in the United States (54 percent). The organizers admit that this makeup is “far from truly representative of the global community, and we know more work is needed.” (You can check out <a href="https://reg.gdconf.com/2026-SOTI">the full report right here</a>.)</p><p>However, the results still provide some fascinating insight into how actual developers feel about the AI, at the same time that the leaders of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/805777/ea-stability-ai-transformative-game-development-tools">major publishers like EA</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/805509/krafton-pubg-ai-first-developer-agentic-gpu-cluster">Krafton are espousing its virtues</a> (and as Larian has had to clarify <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/859551/baldurs-gate-3-larian-studios-gen-ai-concept-art-reddit-ama">how it’s using the technology</a>). As for how much the gen AI is actually being used in the industry, 36 percent of those surveyed said they utilize it as part of their jobs, while 64 percent said they don’t. The majority of those who do use gen AI said they use the tech for research and brainstorming (81 percent), as well as administrative tasks like email (47 percent). But some did admit to using AI for more development-oriented tasks, including prototyping (35 percent), testing or debugging (22 percent), and asset generation (19 percent). Only 5 percent of that group said they use gen AI on “player-facing features.”</p><p>The other major topic broached in the survey was the persistent <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24009039/video-game-layoffs-2023">layoffs and studio closures</a> that have ravaged the industry over the last few years. In the 2025 survey, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/22/24349728/gdc-state-of-the-industry-survey-2025-results">one in 10 developers said they had been laid off within the last year</a>. This year, the numbers were similar, with 17 percent of respondents saying they had been laid off in the last 12 months, while a whopping 28 percent had been laid off within the last two years. Naturally, this had led to an aura of uncertainty; 23 percent of those surveyed said that they expected more layoffs in the next year, while 30 percent are unsure.</p><p>The survey also questioned a small number of those in the educational space — more than 100 educators and 50 students, according to GDC — and unsurprisingly the outlook isn’t very positive. 60 percent of those surveyed said that they expect the current state of the industry to make it difficult for new students to get jobs. “Most of my students will not have a career in game development,” said one anonymous educator in Michigan.</p><p>GDC itself kicks off this year on March 9th in San Francisco, and it’s likely these two issues will be a major topic throughout.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTk3"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Webster</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/869386/ai-game-development-gdc-survey]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>This week, a new generative AI tool from Google let me create bad knockoffs of 3D Nintendo worlds.</p><p>Check out my version of something like <em>Super Mario 64</em>:</p><p>I didn’t like <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em>, but it’s better than my version of a <em>Metroid Prime</em> experience:</p><p>Or how about my take on <em>The Legend of Zelda</em>:<em> Breath of the Wild</em>, complete with a paraglider (and, briefly, a second Link):</p><p>It was all possible thanks to Project Genie, an experimental research prototype that Google gave me access to this week, though I don’t think I’m using it in exactly the way Google intended.</p><p>Google DeepMind has been putting a lot of effort into building its AI “world” models that can generate virtual interactive spaces with text or images as prompts. The company announced its impressive-looking Genie 3 model <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/718723/google-ai-genie-3-model-video-game-worlds-real-time">last year</a>, but it was only available as “a limited research preview” at the time. Project Genie, which will be rolling out to Google AI Ultra subscribers in the US starting today, will be the first opportunity for more people to actually try out what Genie 3 is capable of.</p><p>Google is releasing Project Genie now partly because it wants to see how people use it. “It’s really for us to actually learn about new use cases that we hadn’t thought about,” Diego Rivas, a product manager at Google DeepMind, tells <em>The Verge</em>. The company is already excited about how Genie could help to visualize scenes for filmmaking or for interactive educational media. You could, if you wanted, take a photo of your kids’ favorite toy and use it to prompt a Genie-generated world. Genie could potentially help robots navigate the real world, too. But Project Genie isn’t yet an “end-to-end product that we expect people to just use every day,” stressed Shlomi Fruchter, a Google DeepMind research director.</p><p>With Project Genie, you pick from a bunch of worlds designed by Google or define prompts for the environments and characters you want to create in your own world. After a brief wait, Genie first generates a thumbnail, then you can have it generate the world. You can explore each generated world for 60 seconds, and each has a resolution of about 720p and a frame rate of about 24fps. While you’re in one, you can (typically) move your character with the WASD keys, jump or go higher with a tap of your space bar, and turn the camera with arrow keys.</p><p>One of Google’s worlds, called “Rollerball,” features a blue orb in a white, snowy world, and as you roll around, the orb leaves a trail of paint behind it. As a “game,” Project Genie wasn’t great. There was nothing to do but roll around; there weren’t any objectives or goals. There was no sound. There was frustrating input lag that was even worse than what I sometimes experience with cloud gaming. (Some of this could be due to the generally poor Wi-Fi I get in my office.)</p><p>Over the course of the 60-second experience, Genie sometimes forgot to show a paint streak where I had previously rolled. Occasionally, the ball would randomly stop laying down paint at all. So I started to distrust Genie’s ability to recall what I had already seen with my own eyes.</p><p>Another Google-designed world, “Backyard Racetrack,” was a little more fun because there was an actual track to follow. My racing lines were awful — the input lag didn’t help — but I enjoyed trying to make the turns and stay on the road. Near the end of the experience, though, part of the track unexpectedly turned into grass, which ruined the immersion. And the wheel rims looked really janky.</p><p>I had a lot more fun pushing the limits of Project Genie to try and make 3D, AI-generated games featuring recognizable characters, like with my <em>Super Mario</em>, <em>Metroid Prime</em>, and <em>The Legend of Zelda</em>-themed worlds. While they made me laugh, the worlds don’t have scores or anything to strive for, so there’s nothing to do but walk or jump around. Even if there were specific things to do, the input lag made the worlds basically unplayable. (Again, this may be a Wi-Fi issue, but even when I was closer to my router, I still experienced lag.)</p><p>I wasn’t able to make everything I wanted. Project Genie wouldn’t generate a world that I prompted with the scenario of <em>Kingdom Hearts</em> — here was my prompt, if you’re curious:</p><div><blockquote><p>Environment</p><p>It’s a world filled with Disney characters with a steampunk vibe. Donald and Goofy are your sidekicks. Jack Skellington is present, as is Cloud Strife.</p><p>Character</p><p>You are a spunky, anime teenager with spiky brown hair wielding a blade that is like a key.</p></blockquote></div><p>When I removed the specific names of characters and wrote descriptions of them instead, Project Genie generated a thumbnail preview of the world featuring characters that were dead ringers for Sora (the series’ protagonist), Donald, Goofy, Jack Skellington, and Cloud. But when I tried to generate the actual experience, Project Genie blocked me.</p><p>I asked about why I was able to generate worlds with Nintendo characters. “Project Genie is an experimental research prototype designed to follow prompts a user provides,” Rivas says. “As with all experiments, we are monitoring closely and listening to user feedback.” Rivas also notes that the Genie 3 model was “trained primarily on publicly available data from the web.” (This probably partially explains why Link deployed his paraglider in my test, which surprised me. At a high level, the Genie model is constantly trying to predict the next frame, and I’m sure there are <em>many</em> videos of people jumping in <em>Breath of the Wild</em> and then gliding forward, which the model probably learned from.) Shortly before publishing this article, Project Genie stopped letting me generate worlds based on <em>Super Mario 64</em> due to “interests of third-party content providers.”</p><p>Assuming Google clamps down on the ability to generate interactive worlds based on known gaming franchises — I can’t imagine Nintendo will be happy with what I was able to generate! — Project Genie otherwise isn’t that great at the moment. The input lag and 60-second limit make them pretty poor interactive experiences. Occasionally, I couldn’t control my character at all, only the camera. After the weirdness with the paint stripes and the road turning into grass, I had a general feeling that I couldn’t trust the worlds to stay consistent from moment to moment.</p><p>Project Genie is better than <a href="https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/675395/odyssey-ai-generated-interactive-video-holodeck">some AI-generated worlds I tried last year</a>, but it’s still much worse than an actual handcrafted video game or interactive experience. Fruchter described a potential future where the line blurs between different kinds of media thanks to technology like Genie, but I think it has a long way to go to get there.</p><p>Perhaps my standards are too high. Project Genie is an experimental research prototype, after all. And maybe I’ll feel differently after the technology improves down the line. But I can’t imagine that people will want to spend an extended period of time jumping into these types of AI-generated worlds anytime soon. With world models, I don’t think we have to worry about the genie being out of the bottle just yet.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/869726/google-ai-project-genie-3-world-model-hands-on]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The disappointing saga of <em>Mighty No. 9</em> has reached its long, meandering conclusion. Blizzard has big plans for <em>World of Warcraft</em> in 2026. And <em>Diablo</em> veterans are working on their own not-<em>Diablo</em> ARPG rival. It’s the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news, rumors, and culture. <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em> is getting <em>Fortnite</em>-ified. The tactical shooter teased Solid Snake <a href="https://discordapp.com/channels/@me/1458090158170570805/1466485455578075342">as its next operator</a>. I doubt it’ll be as lucrative for Konami as those <a href="https://x.com/serkantoto/status/2016797054304231572">millions of <em>eFootball</em> downloads, though</a>.</p> <h2>The messy, sad saga of Comcept finally comes to a definitive end</h2> <p>Legendary <em>Mega Man</em> artist Keiji Inafune launched his own independent studio in 2010 after leaving Capcom following the cancelation of <em>Mega Man Legends 3</em>. It was called Comcept and one of its early projects was a spiritual successor to <em>Mega Man</em> called <a href="https://kotaku.com/mighty-no-9-tries-real-hard-but-no-1782427135"><em>Mighty No. 9</em></a>. It was a 2D action platformer that relied on Kickstarter backing and ended up being a disaster both as a game and in terms of the promise of crowdfunding.</p>

 <p>Comcept was eventually acquired by Level-5 in 2017. In 2024, the company announced Inafune had departed amid a reboot of life sim RPG <i>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time. </i>Oversight of the project shifted back to Level-5’s Osaka Office. It came out last summer and was very good. But the last trace of Inafune’s legacy there is no more. The final, official dissolution of what remained of the studio was <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2026/01/comcept-shuts-down">announced this week</a>.</p> <h2><em>Hytale</em> lays out an ambitious update schedule</h2> <p>The <em>Minecraft</em> clone that has early players importing all sorts of wild modes and creations is promising a rapid update pipeline to help the Early Access release grow and iterate quickly while still experimenting. “Going forward, we’ll use the pre-release patchline to be a bit more adventurous,” Simon Collins-Laflamme, founder of developer Hypixel, <a href="https://x.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/2016619068242219093?s=20">wrote on X</a>. “It will be updated weekly and may be unstable by design; this is where new features, larger changes, and iterations happen. FYI, we might skip a week from time to time for holidays, PTO, or other reasons.”</p>

 <h2><strong><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 </em>gets a mode that’s been MIA for seven years</strong></h2> <p>Safeguard, which first debuted in <em>Black Ops 3</em>, is back for season 2 beginning February 5. It’s essentially escorting the payload from <em>Overwatch</em> but with a robot. There will of course be new maps, cosmetics, and other unlockable with the new content drop as well.</p>

 <h2><em>Darkhaven</em> is a new ARPG from <em>Diablo</em> veterans</h2> <p>It’s got a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3571870/Darkhaven/">spiffy retro-looking trailer</a> and promises a twitchier combat and traversal loop than your average loot clicker. “From the very beginning, we wanted <em>Darkhaven</em> to feel good to play,”<em> Diablo</em> co-creator Erich Schaefer <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/darkhaven/arpg-diablo-veterans">told <em>PCGamesN</em></a>. “Being able to jump over attacks, climb cliffs, dash out of danger, or swim across a lake that may or may not be infested with riverfangs changes how combat feels in this kind of game. It’s not just about numbers fighting numbers any more. It’s much more engaging. For me, it becomes more about skill, finding flow, and making smart decisions in the moment. I’ve never had more fun making and playing an ARPG.” No release date yet.</p> <h2><em>World of Warcraft</em> is getting massive new dungeons</h2> <p>They’re called Labyrinths and they’ll launch in the 12.1.5 patch slated for fall 2026, Blizzard revealed in <a href="https://youtu.be/pkFMkdZWxdk">a Thursday showcase</a>. The event outlined what fans of the MMORPG can expect in the year ahead beyond the upcoming March 3&nbsp;<em>Midnight</em> expansion.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/bg3-swen-vincke-highguard-concord-steam-reviews-metacritic-2000663800">The <em>Highguard</em> backlash is a collision of a bunch of different things that have been brewing for some time</a></strong></li> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-says-no-to-toxic-dong-on-switch-2-as-dispatch-devs-confirm-censored-content-2000663868"><em>Dispatch</em> on Switch is censored</a></strong></li> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/code-vein-2-review-ps5-xbox-steam-soulslike-jrpg-anime-2000663834"><em>Code Vein II</em> is Soulslite-slop with a fun JRPG at its core</a></strong></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

For many, sharing their creations on social easily from their Switch consoles at just a few button presses is one of the great joys of modern gaming.</p>
<p>But <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Support/Purchases-Subscriptions/Games/Information-Regarding-Image-Sharing-Features-in-Tomodachi-Life-Living-the-Dream-3016504.html?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=TomodachiLifeLivingTheDream%7CNULL%7CNDirectImageSharingNotice%7Cm_id_MWjeHHp9KL%7C3016504">Nintendo has announced</a> that it's implementing a handful restrictions on image sharing for the game. In a vague statement on its support pages, Nintendo says that in its commitment "to creating experiences that are welcoming and enjoyable for everyone", it's placing "restrictions on certain image sharing features".</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067lgmtqv&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>Here's the full statement from Nintendo:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nintendo aims to create experiences where players have the freedom to enjoy their Mii characters in their own way. In <em>Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</em> this freedom can sometimes lead to humorous, surprising or unpredictable moments during gameplay.</p>
<p>While these moments are often fun for players, we recognise that out-of-context scenes may be misunderstood or may not reflect the spirit in which the game is intended to be enjoyed.</p>
<p>Nintendo is committed to creating experiences that are welcoming and enjoyable for everyone.</p>
<p>To support this commitment, and in consideration of the unique gameplay in <em>Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</em>, we have decided to place restrictions on certain image sharing features. These limits help to make the worlds players create in <em>Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</em> remain fun and safe, and that the game can be enjoyed comfortably by all players.</p>
<p>We understand that some players may find these restrictions limiting. However, they reflect Nintendo’s ongoing philosophy of creating experiences that bring smiles to everyone who plays.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, not very specific! But Nintendo does outline things a little more clearly over on the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/switch/blfga/index.html?modal=1">Japanese website</a> (via machine translation): "The console's functions for transferring images to smartphones, posting directly to social media, and automatically uploading images (Nintendo Switch 2 only) will not be available".</p>
<p>Essentially, automatic transfer to the Nintendo Switch app (on Switch 2), as well as transferring images to your smartphone or posting from your console directly to social media (for both consoles) will be disabled. GameChat on Switch 2 and streaming the game on Twitch or YouTube won't be restricted.</p>
<p>You can, of course, still take screenshots (at least, we assume so) and use your SD card or connect your Switch console to your PC to transfer photos to your computer and <em>then</em> share them online, but it certainly adds a few extra steps to the process of sharing your ideas and screenshots.</p>

<p>So, why is Nintendo doing this? We can only speculate, but those of you who remember <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds-eshop/nintendo_letter_box">Swapnote</a> might recall that the drawing and photo-sharing service was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2013/11/nintendo_disables_swapnotes_spotpass_service_due_to_online_safety_concerns">disabled in 2013</a> as it was being used "to exchange offensive material". We have to imagine the company is trying to prevent fans from doing this again, from sharing potentially rude and lewd designs and harmful imagery.</p>
<p>Considering all of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/tomodachi-life-living-the-dream-nintendo-direct-every-announcement-how-would-you-rate-it">additions</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/tomodachi-life-living-the-dream-will-allow-same-sex-relationships-and-non-binary-miis">inclusivity</a>, and creativity coming to this Switch sequel, it seems like a strange decision. For a game as social as Tomodachi Life, taking out the convenience of screenshot sharing a little frustrating. It can still be done of course, but it'll just take a little more effort.</p>

            <guid>1420051</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The first of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/blizzard-announces-showcases-for-world-of-warcraft-diablo-hearthstone-and-overwatch-all-within-the-next-two-weeks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Blizzard</strong> showcases planned for the <strong>studio's 35th anniversary</strong></a> is dedicated to its golden goose, the 21-year-old MMORPG <strong>World of Warcraft</strong>. The so-called <strong>State of Azeroth</strong> livestream opened with Executive Producer <strong>Holly Longdale</strong> revealing that, in the first two weeks of early access to <strong>World of Warcraft: Midnight</strong>'s new <strong>Housing</strong> feature, players <strong>spent over four million hours in player housing</strong> (450 cumulative years, basically) and <strong>placed more than 14 million décor items</strong> in their new homes. So far, the most popular item was the Secretive Bookcase Wall.</p>



<p>Longdale then switched to talk a bit about <strong>WoW Classic</strong>, which is currently at the <strong>Mists of Pandaria</strong> expansion. The next major update, the <strong>Escalation</strong> patch, will be released in a few weeks, introducing a new quest campaign, the Battlefield: Barrens world event, the new Challenge Cards system and new bosses in the Brawler's Guild, four new scenarios and Heroic scenarios, and progression to the Legendary questline. Later this year, WoW Classic players can look forward to the arrival of the Siege of Orgrimmar and Timeless Isle. Meanwhile, the launch of <strong>The Burning Crusade Classic</strong> on the <strong>Anniversary Realms</strong> is very close, featuring iconic Outlands content.</p>



<p>The State of Azeroth livestream then featured Senior Game Director <strong>Ion Hazzikostas</strong>, who appeared to outline the roadmap <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-midnight-officially-launching-march-2-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to the March 2, 2026 launch of the World of Warcraft: Midnight expansion</a>:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Twilight Ascension</strong> is a repeatable pre-launch event running until March 2, in which players join Magister Umbric and Grand Magister Rommath to repel <strong>Twilight's Blade</strong>, a splinter faction of Twilight's Hammer operating primarily in the Twilight Highlands. The cult performs large ritual events to summon rare elite bosses around the zone, which players must interrupt and defeat. By participating, players can earn limited-time rewards like pets, mounts, transmogs, and housing décor.</li>



<li><span>This week, Blizzard is also kicking off another limited-time event called&nbsp;<strong>Winds of Mysterious Fortune,</strong>&nbsp;in which experience gains when using characters between level 10 and 80 are boosted by 20%, and reputation gains, regardless of character level, are boosted by 5</span>0%. Additionally, quests and monster kills for leveling characters have a chance to award the player a so-called <strong>Mysterious Satchel</strong>, which can contain gear, cosmetics, and potions. It's a way to help returning players or existing players who are leveling alternate characters (commonly called ALTs).</li>



<li>On that note, there's also a <strong>Welcome Back Weekend</strong> live now. Former players with a lapsed subscription can enjoy free access to World of Warcraft until Sunday, February 1, with leveling up available up to 80.</li>



<li>The developers are giving away a unique <strong>Dark Portal</strong> décor item to active subscribers who log in between now and the launch of World of Warcraft: Midnight.</li>
</ul>



<p>After recapping <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-midnight-deep-dive-housing-early-access-december-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the main features of the expansion</a>, Hazzikostas then moved to provide fresh details on the post-launch roadmap. </p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Season One</strong> will kick off a couple of weeks after March 2, introducing the 6-boss <strong>Voidspire raid</strong>, the single-boss <strong>Dreamrift mini-raid</strong>, four world bosses, a Mythic+ pool consisting of 4 Midnight and 4 returning legacy dungeons, a new Delve season, and a PvP season.</li>



<li><strong>March on Quel’Danas</strong>, another 2-boss raid zone, is scheduled to open a few weeks after Season 1 begins to cap off the expansion's initial story chapter.</li>



<li><strong>Patch 12.0.5</strong>, which goes to the Public Test Realm shortly after the launch of the expansion, is set to introduce global <strong>Void Assaults</strong> to the outdoor world and a lighthearted "Prop Hunt" inspired event featuring a new 5v5 mini-game located in Silvermoon City.</li>



<li><span><strong>Patch 12.0.7</strong>&nbsp;will further escalate</span> Void Assaults and introduce a standalone single-boss raid called <strong>Sporefall</strong> to experiment with a more frequent raiding cadence.</li>



<li><strong>Patch 12.1</strong> is going to be a major content update featuring a large new outdoor questing zone, a new raid, a new dungeon, new Delves, a new world boss, a Mythic+ refresh, and a complete overhaul of the <strong>Friend System</strong>.</li>



<li><strong>Patch 12.1.5</strong>, slated to go live alongside BlizzCon 2026, adds <strong>Labyrinths</strong> (which are mega-dungeon-inspired sprawling Delve experiences), another small narrative-themed raid that will set the stage fo what's coming in 2027, and an experimental standalone mode from the creators of <strong>Plunderstorm</strong> (the Pirate-themed Battle Royale mode <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-plunderstorm-battle-royale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that launched two years ago</a>) and <strong>Remix</strong>. </li>
</ul>



<p>Hazzikostas also unveiled some of the improvements coming to the Housing feature, including <strong>copy/paste functionality</strong>, <strong>mass-select</strong> for moving complex structures, and the ability to share designs via <strong>import/export codes</strong>. Décor budgets will also slowly increase, both for interiors and exteriors, as Blizzard irons out technical limitations and provides players with a sense of progression as they grow their homes. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>Future updates will allow players to place companion pets within their homes and hitch favorite mounts in their outdoor yards. With the launch of World of Warcraft: Midnight, the <strong>Neighborhood Endeavors</strong> feature will go live as well, and the team plans to use it to monitor player behaviour and inform future updates.</p>



<p>Last but not least, the Senior Game Director teased that <strong>BlizzCon 2026, the studio's convention that returns after three years, will be 'one for the ages' </strong>where Blizzard is going to unveil <strong>its plans for the next 20 years of the Warcraft franchise</strong>. As a reminder, <a href="https://wccftech.com/blizzcon-2026-tickets-on-sale-in-two-days-pricing-events-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BlizzCon 2026</a> will take place at the Anaheim Convention Center on September 12 and 13. According to the latest rumors, <a href="https://wccftech.com/third-person-starcraft-shooter-will-reportedly-be-unveiled-at-blizzcon-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Blizzard</strong> <strong>will reveal a third-person StarCraft shooter during the keynote</strong></a>.</p>

            <p>When I first played <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crimson-desert">Crimson Desert</a> I had trouble working out what it wanted to be – Spider-Man? The Witcher? <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dynasty-warriors">Dynasty Warriors</a>? Dragon’s Dogma? Jedi Academy? The first of three new talkthrough videos from developers Pearl Abyss has helped concentrate the game in my mind. This is a grittier medieval fantasy take on The Legend Of Zelda: Tears Of The Kingdom, isn’t it! Those airborne ruins are a dead giveaway. All it’s missing is the elegance and feeling of completeness. OK, it doesn’t have a magic vehicle editor, either. That I know about. Without further ado, here’s the video.

<p>
Crimson Desert looks madder than a catful of hatters. If you’re wondering why main guy Kliff Macduff walks in such a weirdly jerky way, like a toddler on springs, it’s probably because he’s trying to restrain the compressed energies of every open world mechanic ever devised. He can grapple. He can mech pilot. He can throw barrels and do wrestling moves. He can fish.</p>
<p>I don’t mean this as criticism, though I don’t entirely mean it as praise, either. I strongly suspect that this game is going to be a triumphant combination of mechanically silly and tonally self-serious and savagely broken in a way that somehow demands to be experienced for tens of hours. 
</p><p>

In watching the video, you are sparing yourself the derangement of mastering Crimson Desert’s control scheme, assuming they haven’t revised it since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/crimson-desert-is-a-dork-ass-enormity-of-an-open-world-action-rpg">I played the game last year</a>. I got thrown in the deep end with that preview, asked to make sense of a midgame Kliff with a multitude of clashing abilities to choose from, while fending off the hydra of jetlag.
</p><p>I spent a lot of my demo either caterpaulting Kliff Macduff into holes, or confusing Kliff Macduff with all the people killing Kliff Macduff, or plaintively asking the PR to explain why Kliff Macduff is on fire now. The boss QTEs are like something out of the original Steel Battallion. You will beg for the sweet relief of a Bennett Foddy game. Anyway, Crimson Desert is out on March 19th this year.</p>

<p>The community has had an explosive time with Battlefield 6 Season 1, but the time will come for it to make way for Season 2. Read on for full details about Battlefield 6 Season 2’s start date, times, and more.</p>



<p>Even though <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/battlefield-6/" id="1961" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a>‘s player base has dropped quite dramatically since launch, you better believe there are still thousands (if not hundreds of thousands) of players going into battle across <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/playstation/" id="81" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/xbox/" id="131" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/category/pc/" id="4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC</a>. Battlefield 6 Season 1 dropped a decent amount of content, but Season 2 is creeping over no man’s land toward us.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-does-battlefield-6-season-1-end">When Does Battlefield 6 Season 1 End?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Time to evac. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Battlefield 6 Season 1 finally comes to an end on February 17</strong>.</p>



<p>This means you’ll have experienced four months of Season 1. Technically, it doesn’t mean you’ve been bereft of content for four months, as EA has slowly dripfed live-service content through mini-releases: Rogue Ops, California Resistance, Winter Offensive, and even the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-battlefield-6-season-1-january-27-bonus-content-frostfire-bonus-path-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">January 27 Frostfire Bonus Path content</a>.</p>



<p>The original end date was actually supposed to be January 21, but an unexpected <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-delays-start-battlefield-6-season-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delay</a> struck.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-does-battlefield-6-season-2-start">When Does Battlefield 6 Season 2 Start?</h2>



<p><strong>You can look forward to Battlefield 6 Season 2 starting on February 17, the same time that Season 1 ends.</strong></p>



<p>If you’re a regular live-service player, you get the gist of the transition between seasons. One season ends, another begins right away. Season 1 comes to a close on February 17, and Season 2 picks up where its predecessor left off.</p>



<p>We’ve already started to learn about S2 aspects as well, such as a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-battlefield-6-map-leaked-ahead-of-season-2-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new Battlefield 6 map leaking ahead of the S2 reveal</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-season-2-start-date-amp-times">Battlefield 6 Season 2 Start Date &amp; Times</h2>



<p><strong>Season 2 is expected to begin on February at 8 AM PT, with the start time varying in other regions.</strong></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Phasmophobia devs have revealed a new roadmap for 2026 as they work towards the 1.0 update. </p>



<p>Phasmophobia developers, Kinetic Games, made an announcement earlier this month; however, it wasn’t related to the game. Instead, it was revealed that they are launching a new publishing label, <span><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/phasmophobia-dev-launches-game-publishing-label/" target="_blank">Kinetic Publishing</a>, which</span> will&nbsp;collaborate with small teams and individual developers worldwide. </p>







<h2 id="h-phasmophobia-will-get-new-major-updates-new-map-amp-reworks-and-events-in-2026">Phasmophobia Will Get New Major Updates, New Map &amp; Reworks, and Events in 2026</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>According to the new <a href="https://kineticgames.co.uk/news/phasmophobias-roadmap-for-2026" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a>, the developers of Phasmophobia are planning significant updates throughout 2026, categorized into three sections: major updates, maps, and events.</p>



<p>Players can expect major updates, including a complete overhaul of their character, reworked horror elements, a lore update for Phasmophobia 1.0, the Nintendo Switch 2 launch, and the Unity 6 and Netcode update.</p>



<p>Regarding maps, the developers will initially focus on updating older maps to meet current standards. The first of these will be an improved version of Tanglewood Drive, followed by Willow Street, which is set to be released in 2026. Additionally, a new map will be introduced this year, featuring a fresh style of location for the game.</p>



<p>In 2026, the popular in-game community events will return, featuring Cursed Hollow, Crimson Eye, and Winter’s Jest at approximately the same times as before. Furthermore, the team is developing a new limited-time event, with details to be announced at a later date.</p>



<p>In other news, check out Highguard’s roadmap, which reveals an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-roadmap-reveals-year-of-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">entire year’s worth of content plans</a>. Additionally, the ARC Raiders roadmap <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-2026-roadmap-four-months-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">contains four months of content</a>, including new events, maps, ARC enemies, and more. </p>

			<p>Another Thursday means another <strong><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/geforce-now-thursday-linux/">GeForce NOW Thursday,</a></strong> with ten new games entering <strong>NVIDIA's</strong> cloud gaming service, led by the mountain climbing narrative game <strong>Cairn</strong> and <strong>The Bard's Tale Trilogy</strong>, while the newly revealed <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-geforce-now-available-linux-fire-tv-clients-more-games/"><strong>Linux-native</strong> GeForce NOW app enters beta</a>.</p>



<p>Cairn is the latest game from <strong>The Game Bakers</strong>, the indie team behind games like <strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/423230/Furi/?snr=1_1056_4_18_curator-tabs&amp;curator_clanid=32982976">Furi</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/983970/Haven/?snr=1_1056_4_18_curator-tabs&amp;curator_clanid=32982976">Haven</a></strong>. It continues the studio's tradition of sticking to making something completely new genre-wise, while keeping a strong narrative focus. It was one of <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftech-most-anticipated-adventure-games-of-2026-against-fire-air-water-mind/">Wccftech's Most Anticipated Adventure Games</a> for the year, and it's out today on PC and PS5. It's even already a game of the year contender, if early reviews are to be believed. It's also one of the five games that are <strong>RTX 5080-ready</strong> for GeForce NOW users.</p>



<p>As for the other brand-new RTX 5080-ready games, players will be able to take full advantage of the power of an RTX 5080 with the new <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-midnight-walkers-zombie-fps-november-early-access-release-steam-next-fest/">first-person extraction zombie shooter, <strong>The Midnight Walkers</strong></a>, the physics-based medieval combat simulator <strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2397300/Half_Sword/">Half-Sword</a></strong>, and the open-world adventure <strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2191500/Vampires_Bloodlord_Rising/">Vampires: Bloodlord Rising</a></strong>. The final RTX 5080-ready game is <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review/">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a></strong>, which is <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-january-2026-death-stranding-space-marine-2-talos-principle-2/">now available to <strong>Xbox Game Pass </strong>subscribers</a>.</p>

<figcaption><em>Bloodlines 2 </em>was a big letdown for Paradox last year.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Revenues for the quarter technically increased, driven largely by Paradox's strategy-focused back catalog (as well as the newly-released <em>Europa Universalis V</em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/paradox-europa-universalis-v-project-caesar-maybe" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="94d6591e-5da9-4df4-85db-66063c38e046" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">first teased in May last year</a>), but sales for the year as a whole remained static when compared to last year.</p><p>Paradox CEO Fredrik Wester admits that <em>Bloodlines 2 </em>"did not meet [the company's] commercial expectations", but he says his studio is now reassessing its resource allocation to ensure it focuses on the right projects in future.</p><p><em>Bloodlines 2 </em>was released in October following a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-indefinitely" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="14f47468-9696-4619-adfe-4a904a94f05a" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">very lengthy</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-is-back-developed-by-chinese-room" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="424a86e4-db05-4ea2-9339-418c1fb748b3" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">troubled development cycle</a>. The game was met with criticism for its perceived lack of similarities to Troika's original <em>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines</em>, as well as shallow gameplay and a lack of meaningful RPG elements.</p><p>The game's poor reception led Dan Pinchbeck, co-founder of developer The Chinese Room, to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bloodlines-2-name-chinese-room" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ec744b99-1543-4387-b78c-dd265b6df66b" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">suggest that the project's name was ill-fitting</a>, and that he and another former <em>Bloodlines 2 </em>producer attempted to convince execs "to not call it <em>Bloodlines 2</em>". Evidently, those efforts fell on deaf ears.</p>

At this price, the game is cheaper than the original Switch version (but pro tip: the Switch 2 cartridge will work in the original Switch, too, and will let you play the full game as if it were a regular Switch cart).</p><p>For those who haven’t jumped into a Pokémon game in a while, <em>Legends: Z-A</em> follows the formula that <em>Arceus</em> introduced. Rather than strictly operating as a turn-based RPG, the player can engage in real-time battles against Pokémon — even catching them sneakily without engaging in a fight is possible. Personally, games like <em>Pokémon Sword / Shield </em>burned me out on the idea of playing another, as it felt similar to playing previous titles, but with better graphics and a larger world. But shaking up how you engage with the core mechanics sounds like a good time.</p><div><p id="other-verge-approved-deals"><h2>Other Verge-approved deals</h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span>If you need an affordable-but-good MagSafe charging puck to recharge your iPhone while you’re in bed or working, <strong>Anker’s MagGo Qi2 puck with 15W charging</strong> is $14.99 at <a rel="sponsored" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CMH2JVMM/?th=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a> in black or white.

The QM6K supports up to 144Hz refresh rate, meaning it’s great for console and PC gaming. One thing to note, however, is that it has a matte anti-reflective screen.

            <p>Break out your blocky cybernetic killing apparatus and the sort of shotgun Arnold Schwarzenegger might have wielded on the big screen back in the days of big hair and cocaine. Huntdown: Overtime, a prequel to side-scrolling shoot-em-up Huntdown has been announced and is set to arrive in early access this year.</p>

<p>Building on the arcadey cyberpunk gangland arse-kicking of its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/598550/HUNTDOWN/">predecessor</a>, Huntdown: Overtime puts a roguelite twist on the carnage, with cybernetically-enhanced bounty hunter John Sawyer taking out as many targets as he can per run, before being dragged back to a cyber-doc's operating table on death. As you go, you'll murderdeath a lot of foes and gradually unfurl Sawyer's origin story by morphing from mostly man, part killer toaster to mostly killer toaster, part man.</p>
<p>"We've tried to capture that relentless, forward-momentum gunplay from classic action movies and modern ones like John Wick," said Tommy Gustafsson, art director at devs Easy Trigger Games. "Then we added a massive arsenal, cybernetic upgrades that reshape your playstyle, and wrapped it in a roguelite loop. The result is something we hope captures the badass spirit of 80s cinema while giving you a reason to keep hunting run after run."</p><p>The devs promise "multiple paths through gang territories, wastelands, and more" to help keep things fresh, in addition to weapons ranging from fists of fury, to fully automatic rifles, massive snipers, and explosives. The likes of flamethrowers, miniguns, and futuristic  beam or plasma shooters look to await those who rise up the killer toaster ranks.</p>
<p>"This hits a sweet spot for me," Adam Smith (RPS in peace) wrote in a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/huntdown-preview-retro-game">2017 preview</a> of the first Huntdown. "On one level, it's not a particularly exciting game, doing things that I've been familiar with for a long time and lacking any specific hook. But at another level, it's one of those retro games that's actually far more detailed than any of the things that it remembers. As I was talking to the developer, I suddenly remembered a 'similar looking' game called After The War that I hadn't thought about since I was a kid. 'It's the same kind of future world, though in After The War a nuclear bomb has been dropped', I explained as I searched the internet for an image."</p>
<p>Huntdown: Overtime's scheduled to drop in early access in Q2 2026, which'd put in somewhere between April 1st and June 30th by my googling. If you fancy, you can wishlist it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2473350/HUNTDOWN_OVERTIME/">Steam</a>.</p>
