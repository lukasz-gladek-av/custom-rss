<p>Gardener's World</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>We were delighted to see Ustwo Games' gorgeous mobile puzzler, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/monument_valley_iii">Monument Valley 3</a>, make the jump to Switch earlier this year, and today the dev has given us even more story chapters to sink our teeth into — <em>for free</em>!</p>
<p>The 'Garden of Life' expansion is now available on Switch, bolting four additional chapters onto the end of the main game, packed with even more of the series' signature perspective-bending puzzles. There are even some hidden optional puzzles to find in the bonus levels, for those after even more.</p>
<p>The expansion drop accompanies the news that MV3 is now back on mobile, so you can check out all the extra content wherever you please.</p>
<p>If the above trailer didn't do enough to sell you on the new freebie, here's a statement on what you can expect from the expansion by lead designer Emily Brown, and a handful of screenshots:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am really pleased to be able to share these new chapters and puzzles, because<br>
they bring together the skills of an incredible team who care deeply about what<br>
they make. After the events of the main game, we wanted The Garden of Life to<br>
tell a story of people coming together to build a new future. A story of hope.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You'll find Monument Valley 3 and the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/monument_valley_1and2_bundle">previous two series entries</a> on the Switch eShop right now. Those who want to experience the full trilogy from start to finish can even pick up the collection in physical form from <a href="https://www.iam8bit.com/products/monument-valley-the-trilogy-nintendo-switch-exclusive-edition">iam8bit</a>.</p>
<p>We had a wonderful time with Monument Valley 3 earlier this year. Despite our confusion around the lack of touch controls at launch, we stated that the game "lives up to its predecessors as an excellent little puzzler with mind-tickling structures and stunning presentation sewn together with a delicate narrative thread" in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/monument-valley-iii">our 8/10 review</a>.</p>

            <p>
The Soulslike is dead. The age of the Souplike has begun. It's been going for decades, in fact. Indie developer Kite Line has just published Soup Rooms - a sequel of sorts to dong yarhalla's <a href="https://yh.16dimensional.com/soup/">videogame concept album</a> from 2007, in which you visit small square rooms with feverdream aesthetics and a peculiar entity in the middle.
</p>
<p>
What was I doing back in 2007? Alas, I was not playing Soup. There's a high probability that I <em>cooked</em> soup in 2007, but it wouldn't have been very interesting soup. It would not have featured any spirit wolves, whiny fallen clouds, consumptive Casio men, "boinglers", or Willem Dafoes.

<p>
Available <a href="https://kiteline.itch.io/soup-rooms">for free on Itch</a>, Soup Rooms features contributions from such leftfield big bananas as Mike Klubnika (<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/buckshot-roulette">Buckshot Roulette</a>), Modus Interactive (<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/armored-shell-nightjar">Armored Shell Nightjar</a>), and scumhead (<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/franzen">Franzen</a>). The new rooms were created using Kira's tool <a href="https://akuma-kira.itch.io/bap">Bapalon</a>, which lets even people with no gamedev or programming experience (hello!) devise their "own small walkable spaces that link together to showcase different art, atmospheres, and music".
</p><p>
There's nothing to do in the rooms save orbiting the central sprite,  sizing up the inevitably mind-boingling decor, and listening to the audio, which varies from vapourwave licks to DECtalk bedtime stories about wireframe dogs. I say "nothing to do" but I have spent 30 minutes in the room with Willem Dafoe doing the splits while gazing at you intently. It is hard to leave a room in which Willem Dafoe is doing the splits while gazing at you intently. Those thighs... they refuse to let go.
</p>
<p>
I had no idea about Soup Rooms before catching Kite Line's <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/kiteline.bsky.social/post/3m6rsibyjm22r">Bluesky announcement post</a>. I may never need another game. Disappointed by a room? Simply drift through the wall to the next. Weary of soup? Perhaps you will prefer exploring <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wikipedia-is-now-an-endless-3d-museum-and-admission-is-free">an endless museum generated from Wikipedia entries</a>. See if you can find the entry for Soup Rooms, even. There's probably a lot of fascinating development history I'm missing.

              <p>I’m a humble man with simple needs. It turns out what I really look for in games is a really good bumpity-bumpity-bumpity noise while sliding down a flight of stairs. If it weren’t already <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-extraction-shooter-constantly-dying-2000649095">packed with a squillion other good reasons</a>, this would still be enough on its own to have me booting up <em>Arc Raiders</em>.</p> <p>Let’s not mince words: sliding down a flight of stairs is great. From bumping down the carpeted steps on my bottom as a child, to launching myself down headfirst on a sleeping bag as a teenager, it’s an ideal way to spend a wet afternoon before a trip to the ER. As an adult, however, my significantly less resilient frame tends to object to such antics, and falling down the stairs has become the stuff of nightmares, likely to bruise a bone such that I’ll complain for a month. So thank goodness for <em>Arc Raiders</em> and its simulation of the joyful action.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000650070" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000650070"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000650070">© Embark Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>In&nbsp;<em>Arc</em>, like so many first- and third-person shooters, when you hit the crouch/crawl button while sprinting, it plunges your character into a sliding skid that is primarily programmed into most games to look cool. However, in Embark Studio’s extraction shooter, the action has multiple benefits. First and foremost, there’s the looking cool, but beyond this, skidding is a fast way to descend hills without draining your stamina. In fact, you can actually regain stamina during a skid, and when well-timed, it’s the perfect means of escape from a feisty gang of angry drones. Run, crouch, and slide down the dusty slopes, then regain enough energy to sprint off into a nearby doorway at the bottom.</p>

 <p>But it’s not until you attempt this move at the top of a flight of steps, whether they’re in a concrete bunker or from a metal walkway, that you discover the utter life-affirming joy that’s on offer here. Sliding down steps is the smoothest, most satisfying movement in a video game since&nbsp;<em>Kingdom of Amalur: Reckoning</em>‘s forward roll. Its perfection is a combination of factors that I shall lay out for you, scientifically:</p>

 <ol> <li>It’s not just a gimmick, but a very effective means of movement, especially when trying to escape danger</li> <li>It’s an uninterrupted and effortless slide with no tiresome movement penalty at the end</li> <li>You go “ba-dada, ba-dada, ba-dada” as you bump down the stairs at such speed in the most rewarding aural element in all of gaming history</li> </ol> <p>Sometimes when I’m playing, I’ll see other players just running down stairs and not sliding, and I worry. I worry that either they&nbsp;<em>don’t know</em>, and thus the vital necessity of this article. Or far, far worse, they&nbsp;<em>do&nbsp;</em>know and yet choose not to. These are broken people, and we need to have a way to report them not for bad play, but for the emotional support they so desperately deserve.</p> <p><em>Arc Raiders</em>‘ stair slides are a deep pleasure in difficult times, a sublime all-rewarding action that delivers both function and form, and it would be a sin against all that is positive not to celebrate them.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/bose-flex-bluetooth-speaker-drops-to-all-time-low-on-amazon-now-cheaper-than-budget-options-2000650056</link>
            <guid>1371613</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon is still running Cyber Monday prices well into December, so people who missed the first sales rush can still get the <strong>Bose SoundLink Flex</strong> at a lower price. This portable <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5691/">Bluetooth speaker is now $119 instead of the regular $149 price</a>&nbsp;which means that premium Bose audio is now available at a mid-range price, where you would normally find speakers with bad sound quality.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5691/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Great Sound</h2>
<p>The SoundLink Flex has PositionIQ sensors that can tell if you’ve put the speaker upright, flat, or hanging from its utility loop. It then automatically changes the audio output to keep the sound quality at its best no matter how the speaker is positioned. This awareness of space is important because speaker drivers send sound in a certain direction, and what sounds balanced when you’re standing up can sound muddy or thin when the speaker tips over. The onboard processing changes the audio profile in real time, so the speaker works the same whether it’s on a picnic table, in your shower, or clipped to your backpack while you hike.</p>
<p>Bose designed the acoustics around a custom transducer and two passive radiators that give the small enclosure (3.6 by 7.9 by 2.1 inches) a surprising bass response. The passive radiators vibrate in sync with the active driver, which makes the low-frequency output go beyond what the small cabinet volume would normally produce. This bass emphasis doesn’t drown out the mids and highs because Bose tuned the frequency response to keep vocals and instruments clear even at high volumes. With complex music, you’ll be able to hear the different parts clearly instead of everything blending together into a mushy mess like cheaper portable speakers do.</p>



<p>The IP67 rating means that this speaker is truly waterproof, not just splash-proof like many of its competitors claim. It can also protect against dust and submersion up to one meter deep for 30 minutes. After a day at the beach, you can rinse it off under the faucet or let it float in the pool without worrying about water damage. The outside is covered in silicone, which protects against scratches, rust, and UV damage when the device is outside for a long time.</p>
<p>Bluetooth 5.3 lets you connect to your paired device wirelessly up to 30 feet away and uses less power than older versions of Bluetooth. This helps the battery last longer between charges, up to 12 hours. Bluetooth 5.3 has more bandwidth, which means that audio compression artifacts that can make sound tinny or distorted on lower-quality speakers are less likely to happen. With multipoint pairing, two devices can connect at the same time. This means that you and a friend can take turns controlling music without having to keep disconnecting and reconnecting through Bluetooth settings.</p>



<p>The speaker charges through USB-C instead of the older micro-USB standard which means you can use the same cable that charges new phones and laptops to charge the speaker. The battery can charge quickly to a partial charge when you need to leave but forgot to charge it overnight. The speaker is only 1.3 pounds, so you can easily fit it in a daypack without adding too much weight or bulk.</p>
<p>The SoundLink Flex is a strong competitor with brands that can’t match its combination of sound quality and durability because it costs $119, which is a lot less than what you’d normally pay for Bose audio quality. The $30 off might not seem like much compared to some holiday deals, but Bose doesn’t often offer big discounts on its speakers, so any price drop is important.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Would <a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-rpg-review-in-progress-1851777402"><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></a> have been just as big without <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-pass-2025-new-releases-doom-fable-ninja-gaiden-1851746651">a Game Pass deal</a>? Sandfall creative director creative director Guillaume Broche doesn’t seem to think so. On Wednesday, Microsoft crowned the RPG its most popular third-party Game Pass launch of 2025, and Broche thinks the marketing and word-of-mouth from subscribers trying the game for free helped propel it to being one of the year’s biggest hits.</p> <p>“Fresh from sweeping the Golden Joysticks and poised to do the same at The Game Awards, Sandfall Interactive’s phenomenal debut RPG is one of the most buzzed-about releases of the year, so it should surprise no one when we announce that <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>&nbsp;is the biggest new third-party game launch on Xbox Game Pass of 2025,” Microsoft announced <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/12/03/clair-obscur-expedition-33-game-pass-biggest-launch/">in a new blog post</a>. “That’s based on the number of unique users in the first 30 days of its availability, which means a huge number of Xbox players joined Maelle, Gustave, Esquie, and the gang on their journey right from the beginning.”</p>

 <p>If that sounds a bit like Xbox trying to steal some credit for the game’s success, Broche doesn’t seem to think it’s completely unwarranted. “From being there to announce our game back in Summer 2024, to coming to the studio for the Developer Direct video in January, Xbox helped us get the word out there and reach a lot of players,” he said.</p>

 <p>Being on Game Pass also let “a lot of people try our game when maybe they might not have before.” The turn-based RPG genre has a lot of fans, but sometimes it might put people who prefer more real-time action games off. Game Pass lowered that barrier of entry. They could just try it and see how it feels. So a lot of curious players could start the game, explore Lumière and the early game, and realize there’s a lot to enjoy here, even if they weren’t expecting it at first.”</p>

 <p>That was back in April when Game Pass was still just $20 a month. If <em>Clair Obscur</em> were coming out today, players would need to shell out <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-gets-massive-price-hike-yet-amid-big-changes-2000630604">$30 a month</a> to have that same barrier to entry lowered. The Game Awards frontrunner is a good example of a Game Pass deal working out for everyone involved, but is it just the exception that proves the rule? As the service gets more expensive and deals for most indie releases get smaller, it’s unclear if Game Pass can keep a good thing going or will <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-cancel-controversy-console-pc-2000631061">continue to enshitify</a>.</p> <p>Microsoft says the service is profitable and generated $5 billion in revenue, but it also hasn’t released new subscriber numbers in over a year. Maybe the platform will land another <em>Clair Obscur</em>-sized hit out of nowhere in 2026, or maybe this year will be remembered as the one that Game Pass peaked in.</p>

<p>No Man’s Sky creator has recently responded to Once Human, allegedly using their assets in a premium loot box, stating, “jokes on them.” </p>



<p>Hello Games No Man’s Sky was released all the way back in 2016, but has still been going strong almost a decade later. The developers recently released a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/no-mans-sky-breach-update-patch-notes-improved-ship-building-space-wrecks-salvaging-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">brand-new update</a> for the title, introducing improved shipbuilding, space wrecks, salvaging, and more. Once Human, on the other hand, is a more recent title, releasing in 2024. However, Once Human was recently accused of ripping off assets from No Man’s Sky, and the founder has responded. </p>

The user has revealed that Once Human’s cosmetic item, Sky King, looks very similar to No Man’s Sky’s Teleport Module. The item from Once Human can only be obtained as the highest-tier reward from a premium lootbox, whereas in No Man’s Sky, you can acquire the item just by progressing through the game. </p>

<p>The post caught the attention of Hello Games founder Sean Murray, who responded on <a href="https://x.com/NoMansSky/status/1995953990958547164" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter). Murray stated, “jokes on them – we forgot to LOD those rivets,” with an image of the asset in question. For those wondering, LOD stands for Level of Detail, a process in game development that optimises performance by displaying simpler versions of 3D models when they are far from the camera. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Microsoft has announced that Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has set the record as the best third-party title to release on Xbox Game Pass in 2025, adding a further accolade to Sandfall Interactive’s debut title.</p>



<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is widely regarded to be one of the best games to release this year, with the expectation that it will sweep up numerous victories in The Game Awards next week, and the Game Pass record shows just how impressive the release of the title was.</p>







<h2 id="h-clair-obscur-expedition-33-is-game-pass-best-third-party-title-of-2025">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is Game Pass’ Best Third-Party Title of 2025</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Another accolade. Image via Sandfall Interactive</figcaption></figure>



<p>In a post on the <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/12/03/clair-obscur-expedition-33-game-pass-biggest-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Xbox Wire</a>, Microsoft’s announcement of Clair Obscur’s impressive accolade detailed how it was based on the data of the number of unique players who played the title in the first 30 days of launch.</p>



<p>Sandfall’s creative director, Guillaume Broche, said the success was “so far beyond what any of us could have imagined,” detailing how nerve-wracking it was to release a title, but the “support of everyone has really made everything feel like a dream.”</p>



<p>Broche also thanked Xbox and Game Pass for their support, noting that the game’s addition to the service allows people to “try our game when they might not have before,” particularly as the turn-based RPG genre can be off-putting for newcomers.</p>



<p>Clair Obscur is up for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-vote-game-awards-2025-all-categories-nominees-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">several major honors at The Game Awards</a>, having been nominated for Game of the Year, Best Game Direction, Best Narrative, Best Art Direction, Best Score/Music, Best Audio Design, Best Independent Game, Besty Debut Indie Game, and Best Role-Playing Game, while Charlie Cox, Jennifer English, and Ben Starr make up half of the contenders for Best Performance.</p>

Within the footage, we can see Requiem's lead character Grace Ashcroft approaching a staircase in a dimly-lit mansion, and taking aim at a shuffling zombie.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ashcroft's shots miss, and the zombie lunges forward to grab the character.

Jennifer Hale, probably best known as Commander Shepard in the Mass Effect trilogy, previously provided the voice for Samus in the first three Metroid Prime games. But for Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, Erin Yvette voices the protagonist and Krystle Martin provides the motion capture, per <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/metroid-prime-4-beyond-credits-reveal-a-plethora-of-assist-devs-including-next-level-games">Nintendo Life</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">This isn't the first time Yvette has worked with Nintendo. Her previous experience with the company includes voicing Neilnail in Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition and Great Fairy Cotera in Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-has-replaced-samus-voice-actor-for-metroid-prime-4-so-its-no-longer-mass-effects-jennifer-hale-doing-the-grunts" rel="nofollow ">IGN</a> asked Hale about reprising her Metroid Prime role recently, and the actress seemingly implied she wasn't involved this time. "I don't know," Hale said. "I have no recollection of recording it or signing a contract, so it could be no." Hale has been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bayonetta-3-actor-says-she-was-thrown-under-the-bus-after-recasting/1100-6536607/" data-ref-id="1100-6536607">on the flip side of this before, too, with Bayonetta 3</a>.</p>

                <p>Recently, CD Projekt published a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-is-teasing-something-for-its-fifth-anniversary-heres-when-to-tune-in/1100-6536608/" data-ref-id="1100-6536608">social media post about Cyberpunk 2077</a> that some took to be a teaser for some kind of announcement on December 10, the game's fifth anniversary.</p><p>This was not a teaser for anything, CD Projekt's Marcin Momot has now <a href="https://x.com/Marcin360/status/1995815488396423529" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">clarified</a>. The developer publishes these kinds of posts every 30 days to celebrate birthdays for Cyberpunk characters, and for December, the 10th was mentioned as well to celebrate the game's fifth anniversary.</p><p>"It's not a teaser. Hope this clears things up!" he wrote.</p><p>Cyberpunk 2077 was released on December 10, 2020, so its fifth anniversary is right around the corner. The game launched in a rough state in terms of quality, but CD Projekt steadily supported the game with updates and improvements over the years.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> is the biggest third-party launch on Xbox Game Pass this year, with game director Guillaume Broche stating the subscription service allowed the studio to reach a wider audience.</p>
<p>The stat, shared on <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/12/03/clair-obscur-expedition-33-game-pass-biggest-launch/">Xbox Wire</a>, is based on the number of unique users in the first 30 days of the game's availability, meaning it made an immediate impact on the service.</p>
<p>"This year has been so far beyond what any of us could have imagined, and it's down to how passionate and supportive our fans have been to make that a reality," said Broche. "It's really nerve-wracking to be a new studio releasing our first game, but the support of everyone has really made everything feel like a dream."</p>

<p>Broche added the game's inclusion on Game Pass let "a lot of people try our game when maybe they might not have before".</p>
<p>He continued: "The turn-based RPG genre has a lot of fans but sometimes it might put people who prefer more real-time action games off, but Game Pass lowered that barrier of entry. They could just try it and see how it feels. So a lot of curious players could start the game, explore Lumière and the early game, and realise there's a lot to enjoy here, even if they weren't expecting it at first."</p><p>Expedition 33 also released on PC and PlayStation 5 at the same time as its inclusion on Xbox Game Pass. In its first three days, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-hits-500k-sales-in-one-day">the game sold a million copies</a>. It then reached the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-reaches-a-fitting-sales-milestone">fitting milestone of 3.3m copies in a month</a>; most recently, the studio announced it had sold over 5m copies worldwide across all formats. Presumably, the number of overall players is even larger thanks to Game Pass.</p>
<p>Additionally, the game had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elder-scrolls-oblivion-surprise-release-didnt-seem-to-harm-clair-obscur-expedition-33-success-publisher-says">stiff competition at launch with the surprise release of The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered</a>, which also released on Game Pass. However, publisher Kepler's senior portfolio director Matt Handrahan said "proximity to Oblivion didn't seem to harm us at all".</p>
<p>Xbox will be keen for positivity around Game Pass following its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-increases-price-of-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-despite-record-subscription-profits-last-year">price hike earlier this year</a>. And while Expedition 33 is a success for the subscription, without actual numbers it's hard to ascertain how it compares with other platforms. Still, it's further proof <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/if-xbox-game-pass-dies-then-well-have-lost-one-of-gamings-best-tools-for-discovery">Game Pass remains a great tool for discovery</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-will-receive-new-update-with-a-bit-of-whee-and-a-bit-of-whoo-as-studio-celebrates-new-sales-milestone">An update is in the works for Expedition 33</a>, which Broche teased to Eurogamer will have "a bit of whee, and a bit of whoo as well". He also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/incredibly-moved-and-grateful-clair-obscur-expedition-33s-director-talks-success-art-house-aspirations-and-the-scope-of-future-projects">reflected on the game's success</a>, stating the team is "incredibly moved and grateful at how big [the game] got and how it emotionally resonated with people".</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Nintendo has released an update for their wheelchair basketball multiplayer game, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/drag-x-drive">Drag x Drive</a>. Patch 1.2.0 adds a new game mode for the full game, while also revamping the Global Jam beta test into a regular demo for all to try.</p>
<p>The new game mode is Survival Tag, which is basically exactly what it sounds like. Survival Tag can be played throughout the park lobby with friends, local wireless and LAN, and needs to be started by the lobby host from the X menu.</p>


<p>Elsewhere there’s just some general bug fixed and improvements to the game, which are outlined in the patch notes below.</p>
<p>As for the demo, this allows you to check out the game offline, playing the tutorial, challenging bots in 3v3 matches, and exploring the park. You’ll generally be able to get used to the Joy-Con 2 mouse mode controls and how they work to play the game.</p>
<p>It’s nice to see the game getting some support still, but will it entice any new players to really dive into the game? Looking back on our review of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/13/drag-x-drive-review/">Drag x Drive</a>, I said, “Drag x Drive makes good use of the Joy-Con 2 mouse controls for a simple game of wheelchair basketball, but it lacks the charm and personality you’d expect from a Nintendo game.”</p>

<p>Here’s the full Drag x Drive 1.2.0 patch notes:</p>
<p><strong>General Updates</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added the chasing game Survival Tag to friend parks, local wireless parks, and LAN parks.
<ul>
<li>Note: To play Survival Tag when in the parks listed above, the player who created the park opens the X Menu, then selects <strong>Start Survival Tag</strong> on the Players tab.</li>
<li>Depending on the wireless environment, there may be times where player positioning does not perfectly match between users. For that reason, there may be cases where, even if it appears to one player as if contact was made, from the other player’s perspective no contact occurred. In order to limit unpleasant experiences in situations like these as much as possible, in basketball games this may be determined as no contact.</li>
<li>On the other hand, in Survival Tag, the question of contact is the whole crux of the game and is particularly important to game progression. Therefore, it has been designed such that a tag is considered successful if there was contact from either perspective (the tagging player, or the one who was tagged).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Corrected the calculation of Iso Wins on the Game Stats tab under Stats. Previously, it counted the total number of Isos, not just wins.</li>
<li>Added Rope Jumps to Other Stats tab under Stats.</li>
<li>Changed the target of the Focus Cam when near the sumo ring to the sumo ring itself.</li>
<li>Made some adjustments to bots in friend parks, local wireless parks, and LAN parks.
<ul>
<li>Note: We slightly lowered the strength level of the Easy and Standard bots that the player who created the park can add under the Players tab of the X Menu.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added a feature to enable players to delete their own records.
<ul>
<li>On the screen that displays players’ records before starting time trials or shooting contests, simultaneously press and hold the ZL Button, left directional button, and right directional button on the Joy-Con 2 (L) for 10 seconds to delete the record.</li>
<li>Once deleted, records cannot be restored.</li>
<li>Obtained trophies will remain, even if records are deleted.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fixed Issues</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a very rare issue where, due to unintended behavior, the displays for level or total distance would reach the upper limit.</li>
<li>Fixed a rare issue in Circuit Sprint where players sometimes passed through terrain.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where bunny hops made it possible to accelerate to and maintain speed that exceeded top speed.
<ul>
<li>The intended design is that it is only possible to accelerate beyond the normal top speed when driving down a slope or successfully pulling off a halfpipe or ramp trick. However, unintended behavior occurred, such as players accelerating beyond top speed when landing after rotating, or not decelerating while in midair even if they had exceeded top speed. We fixed this because this issue required players to control their character in unintuitive ways in order to achieve good results.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fixed various issues to create a smoother gaming experience.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Version 1.1.1 for the <em>Drag x Drive Demo</em> (formerly <em>Drag x Drive: Global Jam</em>) was also released.</p>
<p><strong>General Updates</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Changed software title from <em>Drag x Drive: Global Jam</em> to <em>Drag x Drive Demo</em>.</li>
<li>Changed the software icon that displays in locations such as the HOME Menu.</li>
<li>Made it possible to play the tutorial and certain bot games any time.</li>
<li>Fixed various issues to create a smoother gaming experience.</li>
</ul>

            <title><![CDATA[MLB The Show Mobile Announced, Out Now In the Philippines]]></title>

			<p>Sony and San Diego Studio are bringing MLB The Show to iOS and Android devices with MLB The Show Mobile. Published by Sony and developed by San Diego Studios, it's already available, though only in the Philippines. It's getting a limited regional release to start, and will roll out globally as development on the game expands.</p>



<p>The free-to-play mobile game will be "<em>a new standalone experience built from the ground up to deliver realistic baseball gameplay on mobile devices</em>," <a href="https://theshowmobile.com/">according to the game's website</a>. If you're keen to swing for the fences with MLB The Show Mobile but you don't live in the Philippines, you can sign up on the website to receive an email when it is available in your region.</p>



<p>The trailer showcases a bit of gameplay and the touch-control-optimized user interface. It also shows a bit of the card system, where players will be able to collect cards and create their all-star team, which will also likely be where the game makes its money.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Preview Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ctcq_G3UclA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>This is the latest mobile venture for Sony, and it's arguably the one that makes the most sense. Baseball lends itself to mobile devices better than other sports and definitely better than some of the other intellectual properties in Sony's portfolio. It's also the latest platform expansion for MLB The Show, which was the first PlayStation exclusive title <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-early-march-2024-mlb-the-show-24-control/">to make the jump over to Xbox </a>after the MLB forced the issue to make it happen. </p>



<p>The limited regional release is perhaps the most interesting aspect of this. It feels like Sony and San Diego Studio are trying to take their time before bringing it elsewhere, like the United States, which is, of course, a significant chunk of the baseball market. Though this could just be a quick test ahead of a global launch that'll <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/06/goal-setting-mlb-the-show-26/">coincide with the release of MLB The Show 26</a>, which will arrive somewhere in its regular window of early 2026.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Chrono Trigger Doesn’t Need A Remake But I’ll Definitely Play The Heck Out Of One]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/chrono-trigger-remake-dragon-quest-yuji-horii-rpg-2000650055</link>
            <guid>1371547</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Chrono Trigger</em> is very special. It’s a bold and beautiful RPG assembled by some of the best developers working in gaming at the time. Perhaps just as importantly, it holds up remarkably well for a game that <a href="https://kotaku.com/chrono-trigger-jrpg-snes-30th-anniversary-square-1851769192">released on the SNES over 30 years ago</a>. Go play it right now if you haven’t. I promise you it sill looks great, sounds amazing, and packs a neat, evocative, one-of-a-kind story into an incredibly streamlined but satisfying time-travelling structure. I mention all this because <a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-quest-3-remake-changes-horii-gender-elon-musk-1851665687"><em>Dragon Quest</em> creator Yuji Horii</a>, who was also one of the writers on <em>Chrono Trigger</em>, is once again playing coy about Square Enix’s plans for a remake.</p> <p>“I can’t talk about that,” Horii said on the latest episode of the ‘<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq1II1jaiuA&amp;t=6628s">KosoKoso Hōsō Kyoku</a>‘ talk show livestream (translated by&nbsp;<a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/chrono-triggers-original-supervisor-yuji-horii-says-i-cant-talk-about-it-dont-ask-and-ill-get-in-trouble-when-asked-about-new-developments/">Automaton</a>) when asked if <a href="https://x.com/squareenix_jp/status/1899298993613791338?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1899298993613791338%7Ctwgr%5Edfec9381ad5a12d366a05615b17599a5209267ae%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eurogamer.net%2Fsquare-enix-celebrating-chrono-trigger-anniversary-with-new-projects-sparking-re-release-hopes">anniversary events</a> for the SNES classic might be leading up to a bigger project. He continued to say he couldn’t talk about it in a way that heavily implied there was something to talk about. “Wait, if I say that, you’ll figure it out!” he added, followed by “Don’t ask!” and “I’ll get in trouble!”</p>

 <h2>Square Enix is in the middle of a remaster frenzy</h2> <p>This might feel like a bit of smoke with no fire if not for the fact that Horii has done this before. At Napoli Comicon, the designer appeared to let slip that <em>Chrono Trigger</em> was getting a remake before following it up with “You have heard nothing.” There <a href="https://x.com/buzz_95b/status/1918366504048804155">was video</a>, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dragonquest/comments/1kd11di/comment/mq7liqb/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">first-hand accounts from attendees</a>, but it was all a bit messy to parse due to the translations and loud audience reactions. Square Enix later <a href="https://twitter.com/Genki_JPN/status/1923998070309781720?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1923998070309781720%7Ctwgr%5E96578349a12f5ffb6114b601fc5b0fd5fd94b346%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamesradar.com%2Fgames%2Frpg%2Fit-is-a-mistranslation-regarding-a-chrono-trigger-remake-says-square-enix-further-dashing-hopes-of-a-new-version-of-the-iconic-rpg-30-years-after-its-release%2F">followed up</a> to say that Horii had been “mistranslated,” which only convinced fans the remake was even more real.</p>

 <p>But while I absolutely believe at this point that Square Enix is working on something related to <em>Chrono Trigger</em>, what exactly it will be and when, if ever, it’ll see the light of day, is harder to pin down. Square Enix has released all sorts of remasters and remakes running from simple HD updates (<em>Chrono Cross</em>) to HD-2D glow-ups (<em>Dragon Quest III Remake</em>) to complete 3D overhauls (<em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em>). There’s even Horii’s own upcoming <a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-quest-7-remake-ps1-switch-2-graphics-chrono-trigger-2000625721"><em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em></a>, which falls somewhere between those last two categories.</p>

 <p>In other words, <em>Chrono Trigger</em> could get a straightforward <em>Pixel Perfect</em>-style upgrade or a full-blown reimagining. My money’s on something simpler. Square Enix has shown a desire to remain pretty conservative when tampering with its classics, and doesn’t necessarily <a href="https://kotaku.com/square-enix-business-plan-multiplatform-1851472456">have the resources</a> to be throwing at a more ambitious remake. Then there’s the fact that things like a rumored remake of <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-9-remake-anniversary-merch-rpg-1851773483"><em>Final Fantasy IX</em> are still MIA</a>. As it pulls from its back catalog, Square Enix seems a bit less predictable with what will come out when and in what form.</p>

 <h2>Yes,<em> Chrono Trigger</em> really is that good</h2> <p>Maybe there’s also a little bit of trepidation with trying to “improve” on what’s widely considered to be one of the all-time greats. <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> game director Brandon Adler was recently gushing about the game with zero caveats. “Let’s just take the actual visuals and the music on that thing,” Adler said on a recent episode of <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/04fCqmmagL4Nz56PAMcvA4?"><em>My Perfect Console</em></a>. “Just aesthetically, the game is gorgeous on so many different fronts. I can still hear the music. The characters, they made such an impact, and they did such interesting things, even in terms of the actual systems behind them, like the [techniques] that were being used.”</p>

 <p>He also complimented the pacing which remains unmatched in the genre. “It doesn’t get enough credit for, although I think the real RPG heads will know this, is the pacing on it is just amazing,” he said. “It’s one of the only JRPGs I can think of where you don’t actually have to grind. You can just play through the entire experience and you don’t have to worry about that aspect of JRPGs. Which, some people like that, but also it’s a grind.”</p> <p>This is the kind of stuff people think about when they call <em>Chrono Trigger</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/chrono-trigger-the-kotaku-review-1826393914">a “perfect” game</a>, and the kind of thing that would be easy to mess up with a remake that starts reorganizing things at a deeper level than just the look and sound. Those things are precious too, though. Trying to remake that first glimpse of the Kingdom of Zeal would be like going in decades later and trying to monkey around with <em>Laurence of Arabia</em>. Good luck! But also I would 100 percent use it as an excuse to go back and replay<em> Chrono Trigger</em> either way. Some games are too good to be remade. Others are so good that no remake could ever take anything away from them.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[To The Moon Founder Promises To ‘Make It Better’ For 2026 Following Disastrous Expo]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/to-the-moon-founder-make-it-better-for-2026/</link>
            <guid>1371541</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>To The Moon’s inaugural event took place last month in the United Kingdom, and it was, by all accounts, a complete shambles. The images and clips shared on social media painted a picture of a sorry affair in every respect, and many creators made videos exposing the event as an utter failure.</p>



<p>Weeks after the event, To The Moon’s founder, Monty Stewart, has surfaced on LinkedIn with a lengthy statement about what comes next for the expo. He stressed that <strong>it will </strong>be back, and suggested that this year’s expo wasn’t all that bad.</p>







<h2 id="h-to-the-moon-will-return-in-2026">To The Moon Will Return in 2026</h2>



<p>Early in November, To The Moon was on a little marketing kick, and the materials provided suggested that it <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/to-the-moon-expo-recover-uk-games-expo/">planned to revive</a> the UK’s failing gaming expo scene. Fast forward to a weekday in the middle of November, and To The Moon had arrived, halted temporarily by bad weather, poor planning, and an almost empty conference hall in Birmingham, England.</p>



<p>On social media, creators wasted no time sharing images of the event, with some claiming they’d spent hundreds to reach the venue and were left feeling extremely sour and disappointed:</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Alright last little photo dump of To the Moon Expo. These feature the VR Arena, B2B Trade stage, the Indie ‘City’ and the LAN Zone</p><p>Honestly my favourite part is flat hall lighting considering we were meant to be in a (checks notes) Spaceship… <a href="https://t.co/yINWrmiGpW">pic.twitter.com/yINWrmiGpW</a></p></div>— 💽 CaptainAshtro🔜DreamHack (@CaptainAshtro) <a href="https://twitter.com/CaptainAshtro/status/1989293562169843739?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 14, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>There was almost nothing good to take away from To The Moon, but that’s not how the expo’s founder, Monty Stewart, put it on LinkedIn <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7401872276251631616/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in a recent post</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<div><p>On a personal level I wanted to say thank you to every single person that has supported and continues to support the vision of To The Moon Expo and attended. Every speaker, exhibitor, attendee and the like.</p><p>Seeing the vast majority of posts on LinkedIn being positive, hearing that some of our indies acquired investment meetings and received invaluable feedback on their games is a check box for me; alongside gamers being able to interact with actual games and their favourite IP’s, not just merch stalls. And let us not forget, we were the largest gathering of unique studios and games under one roof nationally within the UK for 2025.</p><p>If we can help people realise their dreams, acquire the funding they need to shoot for the stars and follow their creative passion; that is a win.</p><p>Were there some learning curves? For sure. Definitely some curveballs with the weather and a couple other aspects, but we continued onwards and adapted with the hand we were dealt.</p><p>Can we make it better? Damn right. How are we going to do that? We are looking to 2026 and moving forward with experience that only progress can teach!</p><p>I cannot wait to share with you what is coming for next year. I am also incredibly grateful to not have to handle the mantle by myself moving forward into 2026.</p><p>Innovation has always belonged those willing to challenge the status quo, not those who cling to it. So to the certain few people who have spent more energy on blocking new ideas than building their own; don’t worry, we aren’t here to replace you. Time will handle that for us.</p><p>We will continue to stand at the Vanguard for our creative industry and our movement to ensure that exhibiting at events is not fiscally gatekept and that creative passion within the UK and the globe can thrive.</p></div>
</blockquote>



<p>Not only does Stewart think the event wasn’t all that bad, but he also intends to come back in 2026 with a new expo, seemingly expecting it to be better received just because he promises it will be.</p>



<p>Some reports came in ahead of the event that revealed how ill-planned it was, even before it landed:</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>I will not be speaking at To The Moon Expo next week</p><p>I was asked to be part of an Esports advisory group for the event some months ago; however, after the announcement, we were never consulted</p><p>The panel that I was put on last minute, had little to no structure &amp; a loose topic</p></div>— Jeff Simpkins (@HereLiesJeff) <a href="https://twitter.com/HereLiesJeff/status/1986463348821467570?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 6, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>Everyday gamers went to the expo at the NEC in Birmingham expecting a spectacle of an event because of bold marketing claims, but were met with almost nothing to do. One user wrote on X (formerly Twitter), <em>‘Went to see the To the Moon expo today as it was my first ever time heading to see one, it’s just disappointing how little there was to do there, legitimately one area just has consoles connected to monitors with Minecraft installed.’</em></p>



<p>This is a little first-person perspective, but I was invited to attend To The Moon and got cold feet in the morning before making the 2.5-hour drive to Birmingham, instructing my colleague to ‘stay in bed’ because I had some ill juju about the expo. Was that a lucky escape?</p>



<p>Sadly, as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/egx-death-uk-gaming-expo/">EGX has died a death</a>, Insomnia appears to be coming back under some distrustful banner, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/uk-gaming-expo-london-wasd/">WASD has also faded</a> into an abyss; there’s effectively nothing left in the United Kingdom for gamers.</p>







<p>Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord if you attended To The Moon</a> and what you thought about the event.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 GameSpot Video Review</p>
      </div>
<p>Expedition 33 was developed by Sandfall Interactive, and it was the team's first game. Creative director Guilllaume Broche said, "This year has been so far beyond what any of us could have imagined, and it's down to how passionate and supportive our fans have been to make that a reality."</p><p>The game launched the same week this past April as Microsoft's own Oblivion Remastered, and some feared that Expedition 33 could be overshadowed by the RPG. However, Sandfall said this was not the case and that launching close to Oblivion Remastered <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/oblivion-remastered-didnt-steamroll-expedition-33-publisher-says/1100-6531269/" data-ref-id="1100-6531269">had no meaningful effect.</a></p><p>Guy Richards, who works for Xbox, said he understood Sandfall's ambition from the onset of meeting the team. "Once we played early builds, we experienced their gripping story, stunning visuals, and the mix of JRPG mechanics with French cultural themes that felt fresh and distinctive. It's the kind of experience we knew Xbox players would love to discover," Richards said.</p><p>Broche said taking a deal from Microsoft to put Expedition 33 on Game Pass worked out for the studio and the game in part because it allowed the game to reach people who "might not have" tried a title like it.</p><p>"The turn-based RPG genre has a lot of fans but sometimes it might put people who prefer more real-time action games off, but Game Pass lowered that barrier of entry," he said. "They could just try it and see how it feels. So a lot of curious players could start the game, explore Lumière and the early game, and realize there's a lot to enjoy here, even if they weren't expecting it at first."</p><p>Expedition 33 is available now with Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass, or it can be purchased outright for $50, though it's on sale right now for $40. It's also available on PS5.</p><p>Expedition 33 is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-game-awards-2025-winners-nominees/2900-7258/" data-ref-id="2900-7258">nominated for 12 awards at The Game Awards</a>, which is the most nominations for a single game in the event's history. The biggest award it's up for is Game of the Year.

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/metroid-prime-4-beyond</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<p>Smooth as a Morph Ball 'round a half pipe</p>
<p><strong>Version Reviewed:</strong> North American</p>
</section><section>
<p>After having completed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> on Switch 2, booting the game up on the original Switch was an immediately familiar, if bizarre experience. The game was almost certainly made with Nintendo’s 2017 system in mind from the off given how long it’s been in development, and yet there’s something about playing it on the original Switch that just feels… odd.</p>
<p>Don’t leap to any mad conclusions. It plays very well at a very solid 60fps in both docked and handheld, but after getting used to seeing Viewros in stunning 4K (or an internal resolution approaching it), it’s surprising how much the art direction seems to have been built with this in mind. This also lacks the (<a href="https://www.digitalfoundry.net/reviews/metroid-prime-4-proves-retro-studios-prowess-on-switch-2#:~:text=In%20either%20resolution,of%20existing%20abilities.">excellent</a>) HDR support of the NS2 Edition.</p>
<p>Playing this on Switch 1 when docked feels fine enough, but that crispness, that pop, that ludicrously intricate, high-contrast detail, it’s just a bit fuzzy and pixelly by comparison. I personally feel it’s almost the direct antithesis to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends Z-A</a>, which actually felt as though the art style was more cohesive on the weaker platform. Textures have taken an understandable hit, and models that are further away can look quite smeary, but overall the game still looks good. I just can't help but compare it unfavourably to Switch 2.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch/related-articles:194214 @ 1764773209 -->
<p>Handheld takes things further down, as you would hopefully have already guessed. Wide shots of Samus when she’s being loaded into the transport cannon thing just don’t look right, as though you’ve somehow mucked up some settings; you can taste the sub-720p-ness. It’s perfectly passable for such aged hardware, but I can’t help but feel that as time went on, the Switch 2 version became the focus. It's safe to say things in the final build aren't the crystal-clear examples we were shown in earlier trailers.</p>
<p>That’s another change you can expect: loading screens. They’re relatively brisk on Switch 2 to the point that Ollie rightfully didn’t feel the need to mention them in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">our primary review of the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a>, but on Switch 1 you really feel them. Some of them are easily double and even triple the length, which can be a pain if you’re doing a lot of jumping from one area to another in quick succession.</p>
<p>All that being said, the game runs just as smoothly as it does in the Switch 2’s quality mode. I wasn’t able to shake the 60fps target at all, bar perhaps one exception when out in the Sol Valley when I presume some enemy models were loading. It simultaneously feels like it’s pushing the old hardware to its absolute limit, and yet manages to run at 60fps without breaking a sweat.</p>
<p>If Switch 1 is your only means of playing Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, you’re not going to have <em>quite</em> the same experience, but if you’re not looking to upgrade anytime soon and you’re keen to jump into Samus’ latest adventure, it's well worth picking up, as there's a fantastic game to be had. Just keep your visual expectations in check after seeing all that delicious Switch 2 Edition footage.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/metroid-prime-4-beyond]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-sale-cyber-monday-mario-kart-world-walmart-amazon-2000649232"><i><span>Mario Kart World</span></i></a> <span>got a </span><a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68580/~/how-to-update-mario-kart-world"><span>major patch last night</span></a><span>, and most of the changes in the update are what you’d expect. There are some bug fixes, track tweaks, and some smaller stuff, like making specific items respawn faster. But on top of all this good stuff, Nintendo also did one of the most obnoxious, Nintendo-ass things it could have possibly done by making its audio settings a toggle, rather than a slider for players to adjust to their liking.</span></p>

 <p><span>As demonstrated by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/kzxcellent.live/post/3m72cm4q6zk2t">this clip</a>, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-patch-online-three-lap-2000628126"><i><span>Mario Kart World</span></i><span>’s</span></a><span> new update adds a “Music Volume” option in the racer’s settings that lets you adjust how loud the music is while you’re driving around and throwing blue shells at each other. However, the only options you have in this setting are “Normal” and “Loud.” You can’t tweak these presets at all, and most people who adjust the music volume in video games aren’t making it </span><i><span>louder</span></i><span>; they’re usually trying to balance it so they can hear audio cues, voice acting, or whatever they’re trying to hone in on.&nbsp;</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000650068" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000650068"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000650068">© Nintendo / @kzxcellent.live on Bluesky / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Audio options can be helpful for a lot of reasons, but they are, at their core, an accessibility accommodation, and Nintendo has a history of weird oversights like this. </span><i><span>Pokémon Sword </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Shield </span></i><span>famously locked its audio settings behind </span><a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Hi-tech_Earbuds"><span>an in-game item</span></a><span> you couldn’t get until you were hours into the game. Adding music volume settings and making it a toggle that only gets louder, rather than quieter, sounds like someone at Nintendo heard someone asking for audio options, then didn’t bother to ask why or what they should do. It’s annoying, but it’s also incredibly funny because it feels like Nintendo is so insistent that it isn’t going along with the rest of the industry that it won’t even look at other games or companies as a reference for how to handle basic quality-of-life settings.</span></p> <p><span>The full patch notes are as follows:&nbsp;</span></p> <p><strong>General</strong></p> <ul> <li>Added “Custom Items”

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-strikes-google-hard-now-selling-fitbit-charge-6-at-all-time-low-after-cyber-monday-2000650049</link>
            <guid>1371505</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon extended its Cyber Week deals into December with continued discounts on major brands including Fitbit, which Google acquired to strengthen its wearables lineup. The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5847/">Fitbit Charge 6 fitness tracker dropped to $99 on Amazon, matching the Cyber Monday price and slashing $60 off the regular $159 tag</a> and this all-time low makes the Charge 6 accessible for anyone who wants detailed health tracking.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5847/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Heart Rate Accuracy</h2>
<p>The Fitbit Charge 6<strong> sends your heart rate in real time to exercise machines</strong> that can use Bluetooth which means that treadmills, ellipticals, and stationary bikes can show your actual heart rate instead of using their often-unreliable handlebar sensors. This connection is important for interval training or heart rate zone workouts where you need exact feedback to keep up the right level of intensity. Fitbit changed the heart rate sensor array on the Charge 6 to <strong>make it more accurate during high-intensity movements</strong>. This was done in response to complaints that previous models lost tracking during vigorous exercise.</p>
<p>The <strong>built-in GPS records your pace, distance, and elevation data</strong> while you run, walk, or ride your bike outside. You don’t need to bring your phone with you; the data will sync with the Fitbit app once you’re back in Bluetooth range. You can leave your phone behind while you work out and still get all the information about your route for later analysis. The GPS receiver locks onto satellites quickly, unlike older fitness trackers that sometimes took a few minutes to get a signal.</p>



<p>When you start directions on your phone, <strong>Google Maps integration shows turn-by-turn directions right on the Charge 6’s screen</strong>. This puts navigation prompts on your wrist so you can see them without taking out your phone. With Google Wallet support, you can tap to pay at checkout terminals with cards stored in your Google account. This means you don’t have to carry your wallet around when you run quick errands or go get coffee. When you play music through the app on your phone, music controls show up on the tracker’s display. This lets you control playback without having to touch your device while you work out.</p>
<p><strong>Sleep trackin</strong>g keeps track of how long you spend in light, deep, and REM sleep stages during the night. This gives you more information about the quality of your sleep than just the total hours you slept. The Sleep Score algorithm takes into account how long you slept, how restful it was, and how well it restored you to create a single number that tells you how well you actually slept. Morning readiness scores look at your recent activity, sleep, and heart rate variability to suggest whether you should work hard or take it easy during your workout today. Stress management tools check your heart rate variability and start guided breathing sessions when the tracker sees that your stress levels are too high.</p>



<p>The <strong>six-month Premium membership that comes with it</strong> gives you access to advanced analytics, guided programs, and detailed health metrics that help you see patterns in your data. Premium gives you daily readiness scores, advanced sleep analysis, and workout suggestions that are tailored to your fitness level and recent activity. You can keep using core tracking features after the trial period ends without paying for Premium, but you won’t be able to access the extra insights and guided content.</p>
<p>Depending on how often you use GPS and other power-hungry features,<strong> the battery can last up to seven days between charges</strong>. This is a huge improvement over smartwatches that need to be charged every night. When you don’t have much time, quick charging adds a full day of battery in just 12 minutes. Fitbit i<strong>ncludes both small and large bands in the box</strong>&nbsp;so the tracker can fit wrists that are 5.5 to 8.1 inches around without the need to buy extra bands.</p>
<p>The Charge 6 is now in the entry-level fitness tracker price range at $99, but it has features that are usually only found on devices that cost $150 or more. The $60 discount and six months of Premium included make this a great deal because Premium costs $10 a month on its own.</p>

<p>Pokémon fans appear to have hit the nail on the head with a huge fan theory regarding Pokémon Pokopia, with leaks confirming the speculation.</p>



<p>Pokémon Pokopia <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-pokopia-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">releases on March 5, 2026</a>, putting players in control of a playable Ditto that has transformed into a human, with the game’s setting showing islands filled with Pokémon but no humans in sight.</p>



<p>That has led to intense speculation that Pokémon Pokopia takes place in a post-apocalyptic world, and a fresh leak seems to confirm that environment.</p>







<h2 id="h-leaked-pokemon-pokopia-map-shows-post-apocalyptic-kanto">Leaked Pokémon Pokopia Map Shows Post-Apocalyptic Kanto</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Posting on X, <a href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1996007165002199320" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CentroLeaks</a> shared what is claimed to be the Pokémon Pokopia map, and the translation shows that a post-apocalyptic adventure through Kanto is on the cards.</p>



<p>Areas on the map include Fuschia, with “dried up and unfertilized fieldland,” Pewter, “an abandoned mine covered by rocks,” and, perhaps the most telling of them all, the Viridian Area with a “never-ending burning forest of ash.”</p>



<p>All of those areas are well known in the Kanto region, with Fuschia City being the home of the Safari Zone, Pewter City presenting the first gym badge test against Brock, and Viridian Forest being one of the first areas players explore in the world of Kanto.</p>



<p>Additional content, reportedly arriving in DLC or as part of post-launch updates, includes areas for Cerulean, Cinnibar, Lavender, and Celedon.</p>



<p>Ever since the first trailer of Pokémon Pokopia appeared, fans have theorized that the game’s setting would be a post-apocalptic version of Kanto, with major hints including a destroyed first-generation Pokédex and the remnants of buildings like Pokémon Centers.</p>



<p>Fans have also theorised that Peakychu, the mysterious ghost-like version of Pikachu, is the deceased version of Red’s partner Pokémon Pokopia, and Mosslax, a Snorlax covered in greenery, is the same Snorlax that players in the Kanto region are tasked with waking up by using the Pokéflute.</p>



<p>It remains to be seen whether those theories are true, and it could be that Pokémon Pokopia takes place in an alternate universe away from the main franchise. </p>



<p>While this may seem far-fetched, Pokémon has blown open the doors to craziness with the likes of time-travelling in Pokémon Legends: Z-A and wormholes in Ultra Sun &amp; Ultra Moon.</p>

        <p><em>Serpent’s Gaze</em> features handcrafted levels, with no procedural generation, best enjoyed in up to four-player cooperative play, though the game can also be played in single-player. Every run is unique thanks to a “Curse” system that applies stacking difficulty modifiers to your runs, from invading enemies, to minibosses that will hunt you down. Construct powerful builds on each run to overcome the many challenges you will face.</p><p>You play as a scion—given life by the withering tree god Magnolia, with the sole purpose of vanquishing the opposing gods and usurpers who currently rule the lands. There is only one path towards that goal—violence. But you choose how to tread that path, and along the way you’ll learn more about the secrets of the desert and the truth behind your patron in a story that subtly unfolds as you play.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Soulslike Combat With a Roguelike Twist</strong> – Choose your favorite weapon and fight tough enemies in heavy, tactical combat, with a plethora of different upgrade possibilities.
