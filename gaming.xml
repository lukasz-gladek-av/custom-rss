  <p id="fbq1fP">In 2018, when director Pablo Berger was thinking about his next movie, he happened to crack open one of his favorite graphic novels, a short, wordless story about a dog and a robot, best friends who are separated and drift apart. Berger had read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Robot-Dreams-Sara-Varon/dp/1250073502?tag=polygon05-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank" has-subtag="true" data-cdata="{&quot;rewritten_url&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Robot-Dreams-Sara-Varon/dp/1250073502?ascsubtag=___pl__p_23927611__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder\u0026tag=polygon05-20&quot;,&quot;subtag_max_length&quot;:99,&quot;subtag_delim_length&quot;:3,&quot;subtag_key&quot;:&quot;ascsubtag&quot;,&quot;subtag_data&quot;:{&quot;ascsubtag&quot;:&quot;___pl__p_23927611__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder&quot;,&quot;tag&quot;:&quot;polygon05-20&quot;},&quot;encode_subtag&quot;:false}">Sara Varon’s <em>Robot Dreams</em></a> before, but the reread caught him off guard. </p>
<p id="Tv73ol">“This time, when I got to the end of the book, that last act, I was so moved by the story, it brought me truly to tears,” Berger told Polygon in an interview ahead of the film’s limited theatrical release. “I was so shaken by the story. Right there at that moment, I thought there was something very special about the book. That’s when I decided to adapt it and make an animated film — even if it was something new for me.”</p>
<p id="x6aZwS">Varon’s book is a surprisingly poignant look at the ephemeral nature of friendships, and Berger was determined to capture that in his movie. He’d written and directed three celebrated, successful live-action feature films — <em>Torremolinos 73</em>, <em>Abracadabra</em>, and Spain’s 2012 Academy Award submission, <em>Blancanieves</em>. But making an animated movie would be different. Very different. </p>
<p id="akdf6n">“I was truly very frightened about starting the production,” he says. “But I like challenges. It didn’t block me. It really excited me, the fact that it was something new.”</p>

<p id="SaW6xK">But despite his lack of experience, Berger’s <em>Robot Dreams</em> captures the book’s surprising poignancy, while using the extra space of a feature-length film to expand on its central relationships. It’s set in 1980s New York City, in a world populated by anthropomorphic animals. When one of them, Dog, feels lonely and isolated, he orders a robot companion. And after a whirlwind summer together, bonding over <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qfi9JpgMc2U">Earth, Wind &amp; Fire’s “September,”</a> they become best friends. </p>
<p id="gJeJ0X">But an outing to Coney Island leaves Robot powered down and stranded on the beach, and when Dog returns to rescue him, he finds the beach closed for the rest of the year. The remainder of the movie follows what happens to the two of them in their time apart, and how they forge new connections while never forgetting each other. It’s a lovely reverie on friendship, and the space we hold in our hearts for those we left behind (in this case, pretty physically and literally). </p>
<p id="eXZBtS">Following a limited release, <em>Robot Dreams</em> was nominated for the Best Animated Feature Oscar, alongside <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23742233/spider-man-across-spider-verse-review"><em>Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse</em></a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23759647/nimona-netflix-comic-changes-nd-stevenson"><em>Nimona</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23797923/how-do-you-live-boy-and-the-heron-hayao-miyazaki-review"><em>The Boy and the Heron</em></a>. The movie finally debuts in American theaters this summer, starting with a small release in New York City on May 31. Berger is excited to see his movie gain more traction after its surprise Oscar appearance, especially since it’s a story he is so passionate about. That passion was what fueled the production, despite the challenges for a first-time animation director. And there were some big challenges. Originally, Berger was set to work with Irish animation studio Cartoon Saloon (<a href="https://www.polygon.com/entertainment/2020/9/15/21438560/wolfwalkers-review-apple-tv-plus"><em>Wolfwalkers</em></a>, <em>The Secret of Kells</em>) for<em> Robot Dreams</em>. But production hit a snag during the COVID-19 pandemic, and Berger had to pivot. </p>
<p id="VWGo6C">“Suddenly, we had to create our own studios in Spain,” he says. “So we called them pop-up studios, because we had to create them from scratch. We had to find the offices, buy the computers, hire animators and artists from all over Europe, and create a pipeline. So that was really hard.”</p>

<p id="PmfR95">Berger quickly learned some key differences between production on a live-action movie and an animated one. For one, there are no individual department heads for hair and makeup or camera on an animated movie; it all falls under the art department. And there are no actors in a movie without dialogue; the animators handle all the “acting.”</p>
<p id="oMqAUC">“At the same time, I had to achieve the same goal,” says Berger. “Three-dimensional, emotional, believable performances.” </p>
<p id="MEIp5T">Berger tells us that in his live-action work, he talks with actors and looks deep in their eyes in order to draw out the most emotionally truthful performance he can. And with <em>Robot Dreams</em>, he wanted to take the same approach — just a little bit adjusted, of course, since there were no actors to make that connection with. </p>
<p id="39wYvq">“When I was looking at the animation of the drawings, I looked at the pupils of the characters,” he explains. “So basically, to bring a truthful, believable performance that could move the audience, that the audience could have empathy for Dog and Robot.”</p>

<p id="95QKXB">Berger says he enjoyed every minute working on <em>Robot Dreams</em>, and he would happily do another animated film in the future. There’s a lingering prejudice, especially in the United States, against animation, seen primarily as a medium for children’s movies. But Berger, like <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23511107/guillermo-del-toro-pinocchio-interview-netflix-monsters">Guillermo del Toro</a> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/tv/2020/7/2/21311449/clone-high-revival-new-episodes-lord-miller-mtv-lawrence-season-2-gandhi">Phil Lord and Christopher Miller</a> before him, is a firm believer that animation isn’t a genre. </p>
<p id="DINWCB">“Animation is just a way to tell the story. And animation is not only for kids. There are so many great animated films that could be for kids, but could be for adults,” he says, citing the likes of <em>Persepolis</em>, <em>The Triplets of Belleville</em>, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/animation-cartoons/21267907/studio-ghibli-movies-watch-guide-totoro-spirited-away-miyazaki-takahata-films">Studio Ghibli’s filmography</a>. While <em>Robot Dreams </em>is family-friendly, Berger says his studio never made any compromises in the filmmaking process in order to appeal to children. In fact, aiming at a specific audience was the last thing on his mind. </p>
<p id="tSedp4">“I like to make an analogy with film. Films, for me, they are like a lasagna. And there are different layers. Every audience gets a different layer,” he says. “In a way, it looks back to when I was a kid and I saw the same film as my parents. Some of the films that are released in the last decades seem that they’re catered for [just] cinephiles, or for commercial [audiences], or for children. I think [<em>Robot Dreams</em>] really is for a very wide audience.” </p>
<p id="z5W2Pj"><small><em>Robot Dreams </em></small><small>opens in New York City on May 31, and will eventually roll out into theaters nationwide.</small></p>

<p>Today’s blog confirms Days of Play will last from “May 29 at 12:01 AM through June 12 at 11:59 PM local time in each region.”</p>



<p>PlayStation players will get access to new, celebratory avatars throughout Days of Play. Sony also announced the PlayStation Plus Monthly Games lineup for June, and bonus titles for the Game Catalog and more.</p>



<p>Some highlights include Star Wars: The Clone Wars for PS2, and Dredge for PS4 and PS5 on day one of the event. Later, the definitive edition of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas for PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 is coming on June 7.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Some of the Days of Play activities will include a community challenge, new Stars campaigns, and an Esports tournament.</p>



<p>The announcement confirms a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-days-of-play-event-coming-end-of-may-2024-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent report by Dealabs</a>, which also claimed the event would return on May 29. Dealabs also mentioned some discounts, and PlayStation did announce some notable sales today.</p>



<p>Sony will offer $50 off a PlayStation 5 and the PlayStation 5 Digital Edition. Additionally, there will be $100 off PlayStation VR2. Although, a March report suggested that Sony paused PS VR2 production because the device <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-pauses-psvr2-production-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wasn’t selling enough</a>.</p>



<p>Between May 29 and June 9, fans can also save “up to 30% on a 12-month membership plan” for PlayStation Plus. </p>



<p>Other Days of Play 2024 deals include discounts for key titles such as Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, Rise of the Ronin, and more.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/DragonsDogma/status/1795387174453395631" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new post</a> on Twitter/X, Capcom confirmed that Dragon’s Dogma 2 has reached 3 million copies sold. </p>



<p>The Dragon’s Dogma 2 team officially thanked “3 million Arisen who have embarked on adventures” for their continued support. </p>



<p>In the first week of April, Capcom previously announced that Dragon’s Dogma 2 had <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dragons-dogma-2-2-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold 2.5 million units</a>. This gives fans an idea of the game’s healthy sales pace. </p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Thank you to the 3 million Arisen who have embarked on adventures in Dragon's Dogma 2! We are grateful for your continued support.</p><p> – The Dragon's Dogma 2 Team <a href="https://t.co/jMZL6DUxxE">pic.twitter.com/jMZL6DUxxE</a></p></div>— Dragon's Dogma (@DragonsDogma) <a href="https://twitter.com/DragonsDogma/status/1795387174453395631?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 28, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Dragon’s Dogma 2 first launched in March 2024 to strong critical reviews. However, it also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dragons-dogma-2-microtransactions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">faced early backlash</a> over microtransaction concerns, and Capcom’s approach surrounding them. Some fans also noted performance issues, among other flaws.</p>



<p>Still, data showed that Dragon’s Dogma 2 was the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dragons-dogma-2-was-march-2024s-best-selling-game-in-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best-selling game of March 2024</a> in the US. </p>



<p>In fact, the combined revenue boost from Dragon’s Dogma 2 and the latest Street Fighter ultimately encouraged Capcom to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/capcom-raises-earnings-forecast-following-dragons-dogma-2-boost/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">raise its earnings forecast</a>. </p>



<p>As a result, Capcom’s revised forecast for the year ending March 31st, 2024, increased from 40 to 43.3 million yen in net income. </p>



<p>So, despite some early criticism toward Dragon’s Dogma 2, it seems the game will continue to perform well. The series first began in May 2012, so it celebrated another major anniversary last week. The devs also took that opportunity <a href="https://x.com/DragonsDogma/status/1793932038778814900" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to thank players</a> on Twitter. </p>



<p>Dragon’s Dogma 2 is available now on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. </p>

As revealed by a TikTok clip posted by Royza Gaming, below, the announcement of the R6 Membership specifically was booed by fans during the BLAST R6 Major Manchester 2024 event for Rainbow Six Siege that took place over the weekend.</p><blockquote cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@royzagaming/video/7373343581811133704" data-video-id="7373343581811133704"> <section> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@royzagaming?refer=embed" target="_blank" title="@royzagaming" rel="noopener noreferrer">@royzagaming</a> New siege membership <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/r6?refer=embed" title="r6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#r6</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/r6siege?refer=embed" title="r6siege" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#r6siege</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/r6update?refer=embed" title="r6update" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#r6update</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/royzagaming?refer=embed" title="royzagaming" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#royzagaming</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7373343772052048657?refer=embed" target="_blank" title="♬ original sound - Royza" rel="noopener noreferrer">♬ original sound - Royza</a> </section> </blockquote> <p>Another <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/1d151ny/live_reaction_to_r6_membership/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">clip</a> posted by redditor I-Am-Bodge also showed the booing at the R6 Membership announcement. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/R6ProLeague/comments/1d24h0d/comment/l603gm8/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">According to  I-Am-Bodge</a>, when a prerecorded video announced the R6 Membership, some in the audience chanted “greedy bastards.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Siege isn’t the first live service to offer a premium membership, but it compares poorly to those from other games in terms of value. The R6 Membership is even being compared unfavorably to the Fortnite Crew subscription, which is for a free-to-download game. "Although yeah you can simply ignore it (and I'm aware this system isn't tailored for people like me for example), that doesn't take away to how shitty is both the intention of making a subscription at the life-point of this game and overall how bad of a deal it is," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/1d14f55/comment/l5rkrhn/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">redditor Jesus_PK commented.</a></p><p>There are now <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/1d1ky4a/lets_boycott_membership_system/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">calls to boycott the R6 Membership</a>, although such calls have been met with scepticism by many within the community. As Rainbow Six Siege nears its 10th year on sale, Ubisoft is under pressure to continue to grow money made from the game, just as other publishers are with their own live services. But it will also be mindful of community sentiment, and the strength of feeling from some core players about how the game is monetized now and in the future.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamesindustry.biz/larian-did-a-bit-of-crunch-on-baldurs-gate-3-due-to-unforeseen-challenges<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        

        <p>Director Swen Vincke emphasised the team "didn't overly crunch," and staff were paid overtime</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Baldur's Gate 3 director Swen Vincke touched upon crunch at Digital Dragons last week, saying that while Larian's team didn't "overly crunch" during development, you "always have a little bit" of overtime when trying to finish a project of that scope.</p>
<p>Vincke made these comments during a Q&amp;A at the Polish conference, as reported by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/baldurs-gate-3-had-less-crunch-than-larians-previous-rpgs-but-its-director-says-you-will-always-have-a-little-bit-of-overtime/">GamesRadar</a>. Answering a question about whether challenges encountered during Baldur's Gate 3's development resulted in crunch, Larian's CEO said:</p>
<p>"Certainly less on BG3 than we did in the past. It would be a lie to say that we didn't. We had things happen that we didn't foresee."</p>
<p>He mentioned Larian's structure, with its global offices relaying with each other when working on a project, often avoiding overtime falling on any one office.</p>
<p>But when overtime did occur, staff was paid for it (which isn't necessarily a standard in games), with offices mostly empty by 8pm and occupied "very, very, very rarely" on weekends. He added that the overtime wasn't "as long as you would consider crunch."</p>
<p>He said: "We didn't overly crunch, but we did have to do a bit of crunch. And I think, to be honest, you will always have a little bit when you're trying to finish something, especially when there's so much complexity that needs to be brought together."</p>
<p>Larian announced the <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/larian-to-expand-with-warsaw-office">opening of its seventh office in Warsaw, Poland just last week</a>.</p>
<p>We <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/larian-after-baldurs-gate-3-we-have-ambitions-to-make-really-good-rpgs-and-thats-sufficient">talked to Vincke earlier this year about life post-Baldur's Gate 3</a>, why the team is moving on, and solving the industry's unsustainable growth.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/tango-gameworks-2-games/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tango-gameworks-was-developing-2-unannounced-games-before-closure.882714/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/tango-gameworks-2-games/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>A developer at Tango Gameworks has revealed that the studio was working on at least 2 unannounced titles before the studio’s closure.</p>



<p>The information comes courtesy of Tsuyoshi Okugawa’s LinkedIn page, which was first spotted by Twitter user <a href="https://x.com/bogorad222/status/1795393325023060194?s=46&amp;t=w9td4FZz74Qwy4DLK4vbiA">@bogorad222</a>. According to his LinkedIn page, he was working on two unannounced titles.</p>



<p>“Unannounced Title Graphics Programmer 2024” and “Unannounced Title Lead Programmer 2023-2024”, his LinkedIn profile reads.</p>



<p>One of these titles is almost certainly the Ghostwire: Tokyo sequel that was leaked during the Microsoft x Activision FTC hearing, which leaked that the game would be released during FY24. As for the second game, it’s highly speculated that it would be a sequel to Hi-Fi Rush. </p>



<p>Unfortunately, Microsoft announced Tango Gameworks would be closing as a part of a restructuring that would see four studios close. The other three studios were Arkane Austin, Alpha Dog Studios, and Roundhouse Games.</p>



<p>“These changes are not a reflection of the creativity and skill of the talented individuals at these teams or the risks they took to try new things,” Booty said in the email. “I acknowledge that these changes are also disruptive to the various support teams across ZeniMax and Bethesda that bring our games to market. We are making these tough decisions to create capacity to increase investment in other parts of our portfolio and focus on our priority games,” it was said in an internal email to staff.</p>

CIG calls this money “funds raised.”</p><p>CIG even breaks down the revenue by recent months, weeks, and hours. At its lowest point on the morning of May 28, Star Citizen brought in $42,886 in one hour, about $1.5 million yesterday, May 27, $10,883,513 last week, and $4,753,264 for the month of April (things appear to have picked up considerably in May after the launch of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-citizen-alpha-323-patch-is-largest-to-date-adds-first-native-animals">Alpha 3.23: Adventure Beckons update</a>).</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Star Citizen - Alpha 3.23: Adventure Beckons Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Star Citizen is considered one of the most controversial projects in all video games. Over the 12 years since its crowdfunding drive began, it's been called many things including a scam by those who wonder whether it will ever properly launch. Its virtual space ships, some of which cost hundreds of dollars, are often the focus of criticism.</p><p>Alpha 3.23 launched two months after <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-citizen-10-twinkles-on-the-horizon-dev-says-12-years-and-669-million-later"><u>CIG began talking about Star Citizen’s 1.0 launch being within sight</u></a>, over a decade after the game released its first crowdfunding drive. CIG chief Chris Roberts has said 2024 will see the launch of Star Citizen Alpha 4.0, and that the developer is working to bring features developed for <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/squadron-42"><u>Squadron 42</u></a>, the standalone story-based game starring the likes of Mark Hamill and Gillian Anderson, to the persistent universe portion of the game “at an accelerated rate”.</p><p>This is all building up to Star Citizen 1.0, which, Roberts has said, “is what we consider the features and content set to represent ‘commercial’ release.” However, there is still no release date or even release window for Star Citizen 1.0. CIG will share the roadmap later this year, it has said.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

<p data-characters="216" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">It’s been a long time since we had a true competitor to EA Sports in the soccer simulator world, but according to new rumors, 2K Sports is working on a new <em>FIFA </em>game that will supposedly be released this year. </p> <p data-characters="448" data-current-count="448" data-injectable="true">In a post by MohPlay Inc. on <a href="https://x.com/mohplay_inc_/status/1793985090231451777" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">X</a>, formerly Twitter, they claimed that 2K Sports had reached a partnership with football’s governing body FIFA to develop a new series to rival <em>EA Sports FC</em>. The tweet claims that <em>FIFA 2K25</em> is set to launch this year, just in time for the 2026 FIFA World Cup. This development timeline seems very quick, unless 2K were already working on a soccer game and landed the licensing after development had already begun.</p>
 <p data-characters="285" data-current-count="285" data-injectable="false">This story was then corroborated by Insider Gaming’s Mike Straw, who suggested there was “more smoke to this,” and that nobody was willing to talk to him about it on the record, before suggesting that an announcement was coming “sooner rather than later.”</p> <figure data-current-count="585" data-injectable="true"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">More smoke to this. No one is willing to talk to me on the record about it, but we could be getting an announcement of a new partnership sooner rather than later <a href="https://t.co/cy6gqGGftl">https://t.co/cy6gqGGftl</a></p>— Mike Straw of Insider-Gaming.com (@MikeStrawMedia) <a href="https://twitter.com/MikeStrawMedia/status/1794529425247109424?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 26, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure>
 <p data-characters="421" data-current-count="421" data-injectable="true">This matches up with rumors from earlier in the year that suggested 2K and FIFA were in discussions, following the split between EA Sports and FIFA in 2023. The pair, who had worked together since the release of <em>FIFA International Soccer</em> in 1993, could not come to terms on a licensing agreement for the <em>FIFA </em>name, with EA Sports eventually deciding to move on without the branding and releasing <em>EA Sports FC 24</em> in 2023. </p>
 <p data-characters="237" data-current-count="237" data-injectable="false">This would mark the first major competitor to EA Sports in a while, as while Konami’s <em>Pro Evolution Soccer</em> was a true rival to <em>FIFA</em> in the mid-2000s, its <em>eFootball</em> successor has failed to make a dent in the footballing juggernaut. </p> <p data-characters="319" data-current-count="556" data-injectable="false">As we’ve seen in the past, competition is good for everyone, as it forces developers to up their games to keep ahead of their competition. Of course, take this all with a pinch of salt until we get confirmation from FIFA or 2K Sports, but as a fan of the game, I’d love to see someone take it to EA Sports. </p>

<p>After an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/genshin-impact-developer-teases-next-project-zenless-zone-zero">initial tease</a>, HoYoverse - which manages all of miHoYo's global operations outside of China - revealed Zenless Zone Zero is an action role-playing game and described it as an urban fantasy title and an "attempt to further explore action-oriented gameplay".</p>
<p>Our Jessica took part in a closed beta for Zenless Zone Zero towards the end of last year, stating the game would be "brilliant if it didn't keep wasting your time".</p>
<p>"There's something missing from Zenless Zone Zero. Armed with a deep combat system, new urban setting, and roster of characters easy to love, it seemed like developer miHoYo was teed up for another win after recent successes Genshin Impact and Honkai: Star Rail... and yet after playing its second beta, I'm left more confused than anything else," she wrote in our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zenless-zone-zero-would-be-brilliant-if-it-didnt-keep-wasting-your-time">Zenless Zone Zero preview feature</a>.</p>

            <p>A whopping 1000 corpses have been found in our ongoing investigation into <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/anthology-of-the-killer">Anthology of the Killer</a>, Rock Paper Shotgun can reveal. The bodies were discovered in the aforementioned murder mystery "video game", which <a href="https://thecatamites.itch.io/anthology-of-the-killer">is out now on itch.io</a>. Following our previous reports we can confirm that exposure to the game's crime-infested city can cause severe disorientation, confusion, uncontrolled fits of laughter, and moderate enlightenment. The streets here are so dense with crime that entire apartment blocks must shutter at night. When Rock Paper Shotgun reported the 1000 corpses to detectives, we were told this was "normal" and "appropriate".</p>

<p>Anthology of the Killer was last sighted at the IGF Awards, where it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/eH67as6A7Og?feature=shared&amp;t=4478">won the Nuovo Award</a>, traditionally given to experimental games that "push the boundaries". Those dangerous boundaries continue to be pushed by the game's principal creator, Stephen "thecatamites" Gillmurphy. The enigmatic perpetrator of these, yes, entirely fictional murders, has now released his felonious software upon the public at large, demanding a reprehensible $6 for the death-fuelled interactive entertainment. That is the price of one entire pain au chocolat from Caffè Nero! Or perhaps half au chocolat, please check our latest economics editorial for clarity on this matter.</p>
<p>It is believed that Anthology of the Killer follows the daily life of one "BB", an employee of a life insurance firm who prints zines on the side using company resources. This innocent and hardworking young woman is soon thrown into a twisting nightmare of crime, living out nine episodes of terror including Voice of the Killer, Eyes of the Killer, Blood of the Killer, Heart of the Killer, Drool of the Killer, and many Others of the Killer. A soundtrack composed by similarly shadowy entity Tommy Tone is also present, causing fear and/or amusement in unequal measure to those with ears. Ears of the Killer is also included.</p>
<p>Please see <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dont-worry-im-a-murderer-award-winning-comedy-anthology-of-the-killer-is-out-next-week">our previous reports on this matter</a> for more information. Stay safe.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/amd-fsr-3-frame-generation-immortals-of-aveum-performance-boost-72-xbox/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>AMD FSR 3 Frame Generation could be a game changer even in the console space, as its first implementation delivers an impressive performance boost and a responsive experience.</p>
<p>The tech experts at Digital Foundry took a look at how AMD's frame generation technology works in <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-fsr-3-lands-on-consoles-with-immortals-of-aveum-update-pc-implementation-also-improved/">Immortals of Aveum</a> on Xbox Series X, highlighting how the tech generally boosts performance by 72%. In areas where the game runs in the 40, 60 FPS range, AMD FSR3 Frame Generation essentially delivers a high refresh rate experience. Additionally, the experience felt very responsive, close to a 60 frames per second or more experience, convincingly producing an image that looks like a proper 120 FPS game or close to it. The fact that AMD's Frame Generation is capable of boosting performance so well in a Unreal Engine 5 game makes its first implementation on consoles even more impressive.</p>
<p>However, AMD FSR 3 Frame Generation on consoles still requires some work. In Immortals of Aveum, for example, it still uses FSR 2 upscaling, which doesn't really look good in the game. Additionally, it introduces some small visual artifacts, and it doesn't apply to interface elements. It also brings some issues in cutscenes, causing some second-long pauses that are very noticeable, but thankfully, this issue is not present during gameplay, although some camera motions don't look as smooth as they should be at over 60 frames per second. Still, AMD FSR 3 Frame Generation bodes extremely well for the future, even in its current state, as it makes more visually advanced games a little bit more viable at high frame rates.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/28/the-game-pass-app-has-confirmed-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-for-day-one/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>It seems someone over at Microsoft has a pressed a button rather earlier than they should have as the Game Pass app has just announced that Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will be coming to the service on day one of launch.<br>
</p>
<p>This is the latest leak in regards to Call of Duty and game Pass,&nbsp; Jez Corden confirmed the news <a href="https://x.com/JezCorden/status/1795324954084528632?t=CJxBNvGUwOfKfkFLvmCGIw&amp;s=19">over of Twitter&nbsp;</a> and last week The Wall Street Journal also&nbsp; reported that Microsoft had made up their mind and would bring the next Call of Duty game straight into Game Pass when it launches later this year.</p>


<p>This year’s COD has been confirmed to be Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, as Activision follow up on a teaser site and leaked newspaper advertising with a formal announcement. The game will debut during the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/04/30/xbox-games-showcase-and-a-redacted-direct-confirmed-for-june-9th/">Xbox Showcase on 9th June</a> with a Black Ops 6 Direct to follow immediately afterwards.</p>
<p><iframe title="wake up (rushmore) #thetruthlies" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RxIHyfwUrTg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The advertising came with copies of USA Today in a promotional supplement that show’s the game’s logo, title and some in-universe news stories. In particular there’s the defacing of Mount Rushmore, which also appeared on <a href="https://thetruthlies.com/6/">the Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 teaser website</a> yesterday.</p>

<p>That teaser site features an analogue TV which you can scroll through six channels, some of which give static, but the first of which shows Mount Rushmore’s defacement, and the sixth of which tunes in to News 6, with faux reporting of monuments around the world also being defaced.</p>
<p>The hope is that this will be a major boost to Xbox Game Pass subscriber counts, across both Xbox and PC, and since COD will not be a platform exclusive for a long, long time, should preserve a lot of the overall profitability of the franchise with the majority of gamers still happy to buy the games outright on PlayStation in particular. A large portion of the money that Call of Duty makes also comes from the free-to-play Warzone game mode.</p>

            <p>
Sega initially "flat out rejected" the first proposal for Yakuza, as it wouldn't attract the masses.
</p>
<p>
That's according to series creator Toshihiro Nagoshi on the latest <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxz5fP2iaeY">News Picks video</a>, in which he discusses the origins of the series (thanks <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/like-a-dragon-creator-talks-about-sega-flat-out-rejecting-the-first-yakuza-game-thinking-it-wouldnt-sell/">Automaton</a>).

</p>
<p>
The Like A Dragon series (Yakuza in the West) debuted in 2015, but initially wasn't seen as a profitable idea.

</figure>
<p>

At this time in the industry, Japanese games no longer dominated sales. "This led to a mindset of making games that would appeal to the masses, games that could sell anywhere and to anyone. Many producers, including myself, thought this way," said Nagoshi.  
</p>
<p>
"But this mindset wasn't really leading to a solution, and I saw many game proposals gradually become watered down as producers bent over to change things the way management instructed them to."
</p>
<p>
However, when Nagoshi pitched the concept of Like a Dragon to Sega, "it was flat out rejected," he said. "After all, it was completely contrary to what I mentioned earlier about attracting the masses. Children wouldn't be able to play it, and it wasn't catered to women nor overseas audiences. In this sense, there was no way for it to be approved without resistance."
</p>
<p>
Nagoshi believed the game's strong identity would make it a commercial success, though admitted the route to approval was "quite forceful".
</p>
<p>
He also did not want the game to affirm violence, despite its Yakuza subject. "I wanted it to be a game that makes you want to do your best to live another day," he said. "I remember reminding people of this frequently."
</p>
<p>
It's perhaps surprising Sega was initially reluctant to green light the game, considering it's now one of its top franchises alongside Sonic and the Persona series. Nagoshi was clearly right that its strong Japanese identity would result in global appeal.
</p>
<p>
The latest in the series, Infinite Wealth, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-hits-1m-sales-in-first-week">sold 1m units in its first week</a> and was the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-is-series-biggest-steam-launch-to-date">series' biggest Steam launch ever</a>.


</p>
<p>
As a whole, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-sammy-reports-best-financial-performance-for-a-decade-despite-european-studio-disappointment">series has sold 21.3m units</a> (as per November 2023).

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> will be the first Call Of Duty to launch on Microsoft Game Pass, according to a notification that went out this morning via the Xbox Game Pass app for iPhone and Android. "Just announced: Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is coming to Game Pass on day one later this year!" it reads. Sounds like a solid confirmation from me, though Microsoft and Activision have yet to start bellowing the news from any of Call of Duty’s official pulpits.</p><!--more-->
<p>As reported by <a href="https://x.com/tomwarren/status/1795385251306324292">Tom Warren</a> of the Verge, the notification links to a currently unpublished blog, which suggests that it has gone out early by accident. Look at me go, joining the dots. The addition of COD to Game Pass has been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-next-call-of-duty-will-launch-on-game-pass-on-day-one-reports-say">much rumoured</a>, with one former Microsoft senior PR describing it as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/game-passs-only-outside-shot-for-sustainability-is-to-get-gta-6-or-call-of-duty-says-former-microsoft-senior-pr-lead">vital if the subscription service is to ever become "sustainable"</a>.</p>
<p>It all follows the more-deliberate release of a Black Ops 6 teaser trailer, below, which is certainly very Black Operational in being a woozy smear of period newsreel footage, close-ups of eyes, and vocodery voices urging you to discover the truth, although please bear in mind that the truth is a lie. By logical extension, are lies truth? In that case, let me swiftly add that Call Of Duty: Black Ops 6 is actually a double-A immersive sim with an emphasis on dialogue puzzles, set in a pastel-coloured Soulslike dystopia under the friendly regard of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-2024-revealed-as-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-a-dark-new-chapter">a Capitol-wearing giga-wolf</a>. </p>

<p>The trailer seemingly confirms that this year’s codpiece is indeed strapped to the groin of the first Gulf War, as per <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-next-call-of-duty-is-a-black-ops-game-set-during-the-first-gulf-war-according-to-reports">a report last November</a>. There are fleeting glimpses of Margaret Thatcher, Saddam Hussein and OG George Bush, together with a shot of Glowering Silhouette Man from the first Black Ops. Doubtless there will be shooting of some kind, though my dream of lopping Thatcher’s head off and using it to petrify people like the Medusa’s head in GOW remains a few kilometres over the horizon of probability.</p>
<p>Still, remember that lies are truths, and as such, that this year’s Call Of Duty is definitely a pen-and-paper journalling game that’s only available in Malta. Roll with it, you apes! Anything’s possible! Look, they’re <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-is-getting-in-the-gundam-robot">putting Call Of Duty in Gundam now</a>!</p>
<p>There’s a big Black Ops 6 segment coming at Microsoft’s Summer Games Fest showcase on June 9th. Hopefully it'll clear a few things up, or at least give us some nicely remastered period music to hum along to.</p>

			<p>This morning, CAPCOM <a href="https://x.com/DragonsDogma/status/1795387174453395631?" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced </a>through Twitter/X that Dragon's Dogma 2 has now sold over three million units across all platforms. The game had reached the 2.5 million units milestone <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragons-dogma-2-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in early April</a>.</p>
<p>According to Circana, <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragons-dogma-2-final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-npd-circana-march-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it outsold every game in North America this past March</a>. Moreover, it has already managed to outsell the combined sales of previous franchise entries. Such great sales performance from Dragon's Dogma 2 (and other titles) <a href="https://wccftech.com/capcom-announces-upward-revision-for-earnings-forecast-following-favorable-dragons-dogma-2-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">allowed CAPCOM to revise upward its earnings forecast</a>:</p>
<p><em>In our core Digital Contents business, in addition to Street Fighter 6, the latest title in the Street Fighter series, being met with broad acclaim globally, Dragons Dogma 2 was released in the fourth quarter and has performed favorably. Further, sales grew for catalog titles consisting primarily of past titles from major series due to their steady popularity. Altogether, this has led us to expect earnings for this business to exceed our plan.</em></p>
<p>Users can now <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragons-dogma-2-mod-adds-path-tracing-and-other-rt-options-including-performance-boost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">add built-in path tracing to the game on PC</a>. However, the lack of a proper denoiser makes it less than ideal. Here's what I wrote about Dragon's Dogma 2 in my review:</p>
<p><em>The original game was an amazing foundation to build upon, and yet CAPCOM seemed content with keeping the same strengths without improving much on the weaknesses. Twelve years later, though, the effect cannot be the same. Still, make no mistake: Dragon's Dogma 2 is a highly enjoyable fantasy action/adventure with RPG elements that will provide you with about 40 hours of pure fun. Its peerless sense of exploration, meaty combat system, and stunning visuals will motivate you throughout the entire playthrough. Just don't expect to find a fantasy world simulator or, indeed, a narrative worth remembering.</em></p>
<p>Following this sales performance, it is highly likely that CAPCOM will release some DLC for Dragon's Dogma 2, although no plan has been shared as of yet.</p>

        <p>Lawsuit claims gunman bought gun after using it in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Parents and victims of the 2022 Robb Elementary School shooting in Uvalde, Texas are suing Activision and its parent company Microsoft.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/24/us/uvalde-gun-instagram-activision-lawsuit.html">The New York Times</a>, dual <a href="https://www.politico.com/f/?id=0000018f-acc4-d34e-afcf-bdd6a4660000">lawsuits were filed</a> in California and Texas last Friday, which marked the second anniversary of the shooting where 19 children and two teachers were killed by an 18-year-old gunman.</p>
<p>Instagram and its parent company Meta were also included in the suit, in addition to gun manufacturer Daniel Defense, for their alleged role in "grooming" the teenager into becoming a shooter.</p>
<p>Activision was described as being "the most prolific and effective marketer of assault weapons in the United States," referring to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/activision-made-a-secret-deal-for-gun-product-placement-in-call-of-duty">alleged gun product placement</a> in the Call of Duty games.</p>
<p>The suit claimed that within a week of the gunman downloading Call of Duty: Modern Warfare in 2021, he bought a gun that had been featured in the game and used in promotional material.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for Activision said (via <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/uvalde-shooting-families-wrongful-death-lawsuit-meta-activision-daniel-defense/">CBS News</a>): "The Uvalde shooting was horrendous and heartbreaking in every way, and we express our deepest sympathies to the families and communities who remain impacted by this senseless act of violence. Millions of people around the world enjoy video games without turning to horrific acts."</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uvalde-school-shooting-victims-sue-activision-claiming-its-the-most-prolific-marketer-of-weapons-in-the-us">ESA also issued a statement</a> in which the organisation said the claims of the lawsuit were "baseless."</p>
<p>"We are saddened and outraged by senseless acts of violence," it said. "At the same time, we discourage baseless accusations linking these tragedies to video gameplay, which detract from efforts to focus on the root issues in question and safeguard against future tragedies.</p>
<p>"Many other countries have similar rates of video gameplay to the United States, yet do not see similar rates of gun violence."</p>

<p data-characters="231" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Call of Duty</em> coming to Xbox Game Pass has been a topic of discussion since Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision was announced. Now, Xbox may have accidentally revealed that <em>Black Ops 6 </em>will be on Game Pass from release day. </p> <p data-characters="277" data-current-count="277" data-injectable="false">Teasers for the next installment of the <em>Call of Duty </em>franchise dropped throughout last week, eventually leading to the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/call-of-dutys-black-ops-6-logo-has-been-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official <em>Black Ops 6</em> reveal</a> on May 23. While we expect it to drop in Autumn 2024, we weren’t sure if it would be available on Game Pass on release day. </p> <p data-characters="224" data-current-count="501" data-injectable="true">It appears that will be the case; however, after a notification from the Xbox Game Pass mobile app appeared, it said: “Just announced: <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em> is coming to Game Pass on day one later this year!”</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>A nice notification to receive. Image via Quelanight2324 on Reddit. </figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="247" data-current-count="547" data-injectable="true">Microsoft insider JezCorden moved quickly to throw support behind the news, writing that he expects to see the official announcement of <em>BO6</em> on Game Pass “sometime this week,” but wasn’t able to give an exact date for the reveal. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I think you can expect to see the official announcement from Xbox / Microsoft that Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is going to Xbox Game Pass from day one some time this week. <a href="https://t.co/EXqTZfelQu">https://t.co/EXqTZfelQu</a></p>— Jez (@JezCorden) <a href="https://twitter.com/JezCorden/status/1795325273875038238?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 28, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure> <p data-characters="429" data-current-count="729" data-injectable="true">While Microsoft president Sarah Bond had previously stated that all titles from their developers would appear on Game Pass, there was still some uncertainty around <em>Call of Duty</em>. While it was expected that older titles would be added to the platform, the decision to release this year’s game on the service on launch day is huge, especially considering that <em>CoD</em> games regularly dominate the year’s best-seller charts. </p>
 <p data-characters="383" data-current-count="383" data-injectable="false">How this will affect sales of the FPS title remains to be seen, but it marks a seismic shift for the franchise and could help to boost player count when people don’t have to drop $70 to try the game out. With the success of <em>CoD</em>‘s free-to-play battle royale <em>Warzone</em> already bringing players back to the franchise, it feels like a golden age of <em>CoD</em> could be upon us again. </p>

            <p>Konami has announced a second Silent Hill Transmission show.</p>
<p>This show will cover game updates, another look at the Return to Silent Hill film adaptation, and merch, Konami said.</p>

<p>While Konami has kept further specifics for the show under wraps, I have a few ideas for what we can expect. First of all, I am sure we will see more of the Silent Hill 2 Remake, and perhaps even get a release date. Back in January, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-gives-2024-release-window-to-metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-and-silent-hill-2-remake">promotional video from PlayStation</a> appeared to suggest the remake would be released at some point this year.</p>
<p>As for gameplay, the Silent Hill 2 Remake team may want to redeem itself after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bloobers-silent-hill-2-remake-gets-fresh-airing-in-combat-focused-trailer">an earlier combat-focused trailer</a> failed to wow audiences. In fact, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/even-bloober-team-wasnt-a-fan-of-silent-hill-2-remakes-combat-focused-trailer">developer Bloober said this previous teaser failed to "capture the spirit of the game"</a>, adding Konami was responsible for marketing. Then, just last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-developer-is-excited-and-very-confident">Bloober stated it was "very confident" and "excited" about Silent Hill 2 Remake</a>.</p>
<p>Another game I expect we may see on Thursday is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-f-announced-from-resident-evil-reverse-developer">Silent Hill: f</a>, which was first announced in 2022 during the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-in-konamis-silent-hill-october-2022-showcase">first Silent Hill Transmission show</a>. It was revealed with a goosebump-inducing trailer that made my skin crawl, and it is making my skin crawl again just thinking about it. This particular release will be the first new mainline game for the series in over a decade. </p>
<p>We may also see more of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-townfall-is-a-new-entry-to-the-series-from-stories-untold-developer-no-code">Silent Hill: Townfall</a>, which was announced at the same time as f.</p>
<p>Film-wise, I am also expecting a release date for Return to Silent Hill, along with a cinematic trailer. Last year, it was announced that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/return-to-silent-hill-casts-war-horses-jeremy-irvine-as-james">War Horse's Jeremy Irvine had been cast as James</a> in the upcoming release, with Hannah Emily Anderson playing his "true love", presumably Mary.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-film-leak-suggests-plot-changes-new-character-and-cast-update">leaked film synopsis for Return to Silent Hill</a> previously stated James will return to Silent Hill looking for "his lost love Mary Crane" (in the game, James returns to Silent Hill in search of his wife Mary Shepherd-Sunderland, suggesting the characters may not be married in this adaptation).</p> <div>

            <p>
Square Enix has teased a HD-2D remake of Dragon Quest 3.
</p>
<p>
Yesterday, 27th May, was Dragon Quest day, celebrating the release of the original Dragon Quest game in Japan in 1986.
</p>
<p>
The short tease was shared on social media platform X featuring the Dragon Quest 3 logo with the words "The legacy begins". The post reads "The legend of Erdrick draws near", Erdrick being the most common name to refer to the third game's protagonist - chronologically the first in the series, though some fans are hoping for remakes of the first three games together.

<p>

In the corner of the video is a HD-2D logo, while platforms listed are Switch, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Steam and Windows.

<p>
So while this isn't yet a full announcement, it's easy to deduce what game this is.
</p>
<p>
A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-quest-12-takes-the-long-running-rpg-series-down-a-darker-path">HD-2D remake of Dragon Quest 3 was first revealed on Dragon Quest day in 2021</a>, with a video of the game in motion (see below) developed by Team Asano (Octopath Traveler, Triangle Strategy). This latest tease, then, is the first we've heard of the game since.

<p>
It's unknown when the full reveal will be as there's no date in the tease, but perhaps it'll appear in a showcase during <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/summer-game-fest-2024-conference-schedule-all-dates-times-streams">Summer Game Fest</a>? Leaker <a href="https://x.com/MbKKssTBhz5/status/1795062186391273783">Midori</a> believes it'll be seen at the next Nintendo Direct.
</p>
<p>Dragon Quest 3 first released on the NES in 1988 and has seen a number of re-releases since then, including on SNES and Game Boy.</p>
<p>
Series creator Yuji Horii also shared a post with a brief update on Dragon Quest 12, the next major game in the series, stating he wants to make something worthy of the posthumous work of the two people who passed away.
</p>
<p>
That would be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tributes-shared-as-dragon-ball-creator-akira-toriyama-passes-away">artist Akira Toriyama</a> who passed away earlier this year, and composer Koichi Sugiyama who passed away in 2021 at the age of 90.

A number of Dragon Quest spin-off games have been released in recent years, but the next game in the series is highly-anticipated.

            <p>In the vast <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wuthering-waves-release-date">Wuthering Waves</a>-shaped shadow that has descended across gaming comes an announcement from HoYoverse, publishers of quite large gacha gubbins 'em up, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/genshin-impact-3-7-release-time">Genshin Impact</a>. The studio's follow-up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/zenless-zone-zeros-closed-beta-has-started-offering-glimpses-of-its-genshin-impact-style-combat">Zenless Zone Zero</a> is now set to release on July 4th. For anyone who hasn't yet heard of the bright cyberpunk character action game, I guess now's your chance to look at the slick anime visuals in the new trailer below and go "hmmm", with either a songful note of eye-widening interest or the suspicious rumble of a free-to-play skeptic.  Your choice.</p>

<p>That housekeeping wolf has got legs. Zenless Zone Zero is set in the futuristic city of New Eridu, an urban cybertopia under threat from the interdimensional beasts that erupt from invasive gateways called Hollows. As the hero conscripted in the city's hour of need, you have to navigate the Hollows and wreck the baddies. What this looks like from trailers, betas and marketing material is a sorta-roguelike jaunt through a grid of CRT television screens, with a lot of flashy combat and big boss battles along the way. Jeremy has a more thorough <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/zenless-zone-zero-release-date-details-everything-we-know">summary of what you do in Zenless Zone Zero</a>, for anyone interested. </p>
<p>The <a href="https://zenless.hoyoverse.com/en-us/news/123831">release date announcement</a> comes quite soon after the release of Wuthering Waves, a Genshin-esque adventure about (as far as I can tell) a gaggle of anime stereotypes all tattooed with their favourite .wav file. Considering how widely played Genshin Impact appears to have been, the release of similar games chasing its sparkly coattails feels inevitable. Whether these new contenders appeal with the same forcefulness remains to be seen. I've been playing Wuthering Waves a bit and it's not capturing me a whole lot. Zenless Zone Zero looks more my style of hack-the-planet nonsense but we'll have to wait until July to see if its jet-legged lycanthropes are enough to keep things lively. Meanwhile, total keeners can <a href="https://act.hoyoverse.com/zzz/event/e20240528landing-2byyms">pre-register with HoYoverse</a>, we're told.</p>

			<p>Dragon Quest III HD-2D won't take much longer to release, and it will be accompanied by a rather welcome surprise, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>Speaking on X/Twitter, Midori, who proved to be an extremely reliable insider in the past few months, revealed that the game will be released by the <a href="https://x.com/MbKKssTBhz5/status/1795158319201440033?t=Rp2_AO2_VycztqA91P3iuQ&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noopener">end of the current fiscal year</a>, so by the end of March 2025. Additionally, it seems like Square Enix is remastering in 2D-HD the entirety of the <a href="https://x.com/MbKKssTBhz5/status/1795163362344472878" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Loto trilogy</a>, which comprises the first three entries in the series. <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-quest-3-hd-is-coming-to-switch-ps5-xbox-series-and-pc/">Yesterday's teaser</a> kind of gives it away, as it mentioned the legend of Erdrick, which is the main focus of the Loto trilogy.</p>
<p>If Dragon Quest III HD-2D will indeed be accompanied by the remasters of its predecessors, playing these games will be a great way to prepare for the release of<a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-quest-xii-the-flames-of-fate-is-being-co-developed-by-orca-dev-is-recruiting-unreal-engine-5-staff/"> Dragon Quest XII: The Flames of Fate</a>. Very little is currently known about the game besides the fact that it will be powered by Unreal Engine 5 and will feature an overhaul of the series' classic turn-based combat system.</p>
<p>Dragon Quest III HD-2D will launch on a yet-to-be-confirmed release date on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Nintendo Switch. We will keep you updated on the game and the other rumored remasters as soon as more information becomes available, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-game-pass-day-one/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Earlier today, people woke up to a new notification from Xbox that Black Ops 6 will be coming to Xbox Game Pass Day One.</p>



<p>The message read, “Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is coming to Game Pass on day one later this year!” Which diverted people to this link on <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/05/28/play-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-day-one-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Xbox Wire</a>. As pointed out by the URL, the announcement is expected to be made today, May 28th, 2024. </p>



<p>Later today, Black Ops 6 will reveal its live-action trailer for Black Ops 6, which will presumably coincide with the announcement of Day One Game Pass. </p>



<p>Following the rumours on Black Ops 6 going to Game Pass last week, new rumours began to emerge that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-to-make-changes-to-xbox-game-pass-tiers-because-of-call-of-duty-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">move will result in changing to Game Pass tiers</a>, which could imply increases are soon on their way. Currently, there’s Xbox Game Pass Core for console that replaced Xbox Live Gold for $9.99/month, Game Pass PC for $9.99/month, and Xbox Game Pass Ultimate that covers both console and PC for $16.99/month.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming understands that Call of Duty Black Ops 6 is expected to launch on October 25, 2024. The game will be fully revealed during the Xbox Games Showcase on June 9th, 2024. Immediately after, it will be given an exclusive Black Ops 6 direct, during which the developers are expected to discuss some of the game’s features and story in more depth.</p>



<p>What do you think of Black Ops 6 coming to Game Pass Day One? Let us know in the comments below!</p>

            <p>
Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will be a day one launch via Xbox Game Pass, a Microsoft notification has now seemingly confirmed. 
</p>
<p>
Users of the Xbox Game Pass app for iPhone and Android have this morning received a notification that states: "Just announced: Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is coming to Game Pass on day one later this year!"
</p>
<p>
As first reported by <a href="https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1795385251306324292">Tom Warren</a>, the notification includes a link to a currently-unpublished blog post on Xbox.com, likely set to go live in the near future.

<p>
News that Black Ops 6 will launch via Xbox Game Pass isn't a huge surprise - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-2024-will-launch-into-xbox-game-pass-microsoft-has-reportedly-decided">The Wall St Journal previously reported that Microsoft had now made the decision earlier this month</a>.
</p>
<p>
But the question remains whether <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/there-will-be-changes-to-xbox-game-pass-when-call-of-duty-is-added-says-industry-insider">Microsoft will take advantage of Black Ops 6's status to change Xbox Game Pass' pricing or tier structure somehow</a> - which would also help recoup some of the money that players would otherwise have spent on $70 copies.
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>the Xbox Game Pass app on iOS / Android is notifying people that Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 "is coming to Game Pass on day one later this year!" </p><p>it looks like an announcement is due today 👀 <a href="https://t.co/FBRteX5Nkl">pic.twitter.com/FBRteX5Nkl</a></p></div>— Tom Warren (@tomwarren) <a href="https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1795385251306324292?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 28, 2024</a></blockquote></div>

<p>
Microsoft will fully show off Black Ops 6 in a dedicated hour-long presentation after its June Xbox Showcase event, which will once again take place alongside other events from Ubisoft and (its expected) Nintendo during the old E3 conference week.
</p>
<p>Eurogamer has contacted Microsoft for more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/best-classic-board-games<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Board gaming is great in part because of the variety of new options available nowadays. You'll find plenty to choose from, whether you're interested in <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-family-board-games">family board games</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-strategy-board-games">strategy board games</a>, or just about any other genre.

So it's of particular interest to go digging for gold in the years prior to that explosion. Here, presented in reverse chronological order, are some of the best classic board games that stand the test of time. Some of these will likely also be on sale during <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-friday-2024">Black Friday 2024</a>.</p><h3>TL;DR: The Best Classic Board Games</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/Mj0Ym" target="_blank">Azul</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/YBy5d" target="_blank">Pandemic</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/Mg8qg" target="_blank">Ticket to Ride</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/pPl0o" target="_blank">Settlers of Catan</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/w2lqq" target="_blank">Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/2m8pl" target="_blank">Can't Stop</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/EDX4G" target="_blank">Acquire</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/jPy3q" target="_blank">Diplomacy</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/gdR7D" target="_blank">Yahtzee</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/XZbMW" target="_blank">Scrabble</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/DMJ6g" target="_blank">Othello</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/MgpE0" target="_blank">Crokinole</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/NwKND" target="_blank">Liar's Dice</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/3wjnw" target="_blank">Chess</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/ZXmYR" target="_blank">Playing Cards</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/mLl43" target="_blank">Go</a></li></ul><p>Don't have time to sift through the blurbs below? Here's a cheatsheet for what games are included, from most recent to earliest.</p><h2>Azul (2017)</h2><div id="157144"><p><h3>Azul Board Game</h3></p></div><p>Despite only having been released in 2017, and an abstract to boot, a genre that’s notoriously hard to sell, Azul has all the makings of a modern classic. It’s a delight to look at, featuring a huge bag of bright, chunky, sweet-sized tiles. The gameplay is easy: you take all the matching tiles from one of several pools each turn and fit them in rows on your board, which have room for between one and five tiles. Fill a row and goes onto your scoring mat, where you get points for neighbouring tiles and completing rows, columns and matching sets. Simple, right? Except a single play will leave you astonished at the variety, depth and subtle interaction this straightforward formula supports. </p><h2>Pandemic (2008)</h2><div id="198687"><p><h3>Pandemic</h3></p></div><p>How can the game that launched the entire, now hugely popular, genre of cooperative games not rate as a classic? It wasn’t the first title that had all the players working together to defeat the game scenario, but its mix of clever mechanisms and easy rules helped it conquer the world. Which is ironic, since you’re trying to save the world. New diseases are threatening the globe, represented by cubes in major cities on the map. If too many accumulate, the infection will spread to neighbouring spaces which can, in turn, cause further outbreaks. Players need to accumulate card sets and use special powers to find the cures, but with the city cards that control disease spread going back on top of the deck, it’s a race against time before this pressure cooker explodes.</p><h2>Ticket to Ride (2004)</h2><div id="161110"><p><h3>Ticket to Ride</h3></p></div><p>Developed by legendary game designer Alan R. Moon, Ticket to Ride and its many spinoffs trade on the widely-known set collection card game Rummy, making it super accessible and easy to learn. You’re picking up coloured cards that match train routes on the board, trying to connect cities that correspond to your ticket cards for bonus points. But the maps are super-tight, and other players are always watchful for a chance to block your plans, making it an incredibly exciting and tense experience. Especially so when failed tickets lose you the bonus points instead of gaining them. Fast, furious and fun, this is a franchise that’s made it into the mass market and is here to stay.</p><h2>Settlers of Catan (1996)</h2><div id="159921"><p><h3>Catan</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://bonsai.to/eoy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Also at Target</a></li></ul><p>A modern classic, now known simply as Catan, this game has fallen a little out of favor. But we shouldn't forget what a revolution it was in its time. Its mix of clever dice mechanics, trading and route planning as players competed to colonize an island was like nothing we'd seen before. In its native Germany, games like this weren't quite so novel, but its import in English kickstarted the whole modern gaming scene. It's worth playing for its historical value alone. Luckily, it remains worth playing to recall how addictive its sweet blend of luck and strategy can be.</p><h2>Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective (1981)</h2><div id="157800"><p><h3>Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective</h3></p></div><p>A bizarre blend of board game, whodunnit, and choose your own adventure, this sleuthing title was years ahead of its time. Pick a scenario and head out onto the foggy streets of Victorian London as the agents of fictions' most famous detective. Players must work together to uncover clues, solve riddles and try and piece a solution together as efficiently as they can. Do it better than Holmes himself and your group wins. Atmospheric writing elevates these scenarios into an engrossing fiction in its own right. And if you manage to solve them all, there are loads of expansion packs to puzzle through.</p><h2>Can't Stop (1980)</h2><div id="159920"><p><h3>Can't Stop</h3></p></div><p>A second Sackson classic, Can't Stop is an easier and more raucous game. It's a race to reach the top of three of the eleven columns on the board. Each column matches a possible roll of two dice and the more likely the result, the longer the column. You roll four dice, make two pairs and move two markers. Then comes the kicker: you can keep rolling, or end your turn. If you carry on and fail to roll a match, you lose your progress. It's a constant, agonizing temptation to balance luck and skill. Play it as a board game, or try the excellent mobile version.</p><h2>Acquire (1964)</h2><div id="159919"><p><h3>Acquire</h3></p></div><p>Some credit this game, by virtuoso designer Sid Sackson, as the progenitor of much of modern gaming. In an era where there were only mass-market titles and war games, Acquire was something new.  It's a game about creating, merging and investing in companies. On your turn, you place a tile onto the grid, representing a company stock. If your placement joins two existing companies, the larger absorbs the smaller. Then, you can buy shares in any of the companies which you'll sell later for a profit, depending on the size. The result is a masterful mix of fiendish spatial challenges and economic wiles that remains fresh and thrilling to this day.</p><h2>Diplomacy (1959)</h2><div id="159918"><p><h3>Diplomacy</h3></p></div><p>Wrecking friendships for over 50 years, Diplomacy is divisive in a way few other games are. Designed by a historian to examine the political geography of 19th century Europe, the game has no randomness. Players struggle to conquer the continent, with one unit simply eliminating another in combat. It's designed so that you can't win alone: you need allies to prosper. Yet only one player can claim victory, so betrayal and backstabbing is inevitable. Its clever catch is that movement is simultaneous. You write orders down in advance, and all players reveal them at the same time. So you don't know who's kept their promises and who's turned against you until it's too late.</p><h2>Yahtzee (1956)</h2><div id="159917"><p><h3>Yahtzee</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://bonsai.to/r3y" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Also at Target</a></li></ul><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-roll-and-write-board-games">Roll and write games</a>, where you scribble in the results of dice or card draws, are very much in vogue right now. But let's not forget their mass-market progenitor, Yahtzee, which is far more fun than you may remember. Sure, you're in the hands of fate when you're rolling the bones. But filling in the grid takes a lot more skill and statistics than many realize. There's nothing worse than crossing in a blank and then getting the right rolls down the line. Fast, furious and family-friendly, get the pencils out and take this classic for a roll.</p><h2>Scrabble (1948)</h2><div id="159916"><p><h3>Scrabble</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://bonsai.to/8lo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Also at Target</a></li></ul><p>Yes, this well-known word game does take a bit too long between turns, especially with more players. But it's a fascinating and brilliant balance between vocabulary and spatial play. Sure it helps to know a lot of words when you're finding ways to lay out your seven random letters. But a player that can sneak a ten-point letter into an awkward bonus space will scoop the prize every time.  And it's so well-known it's easy to find people willing to play. Grab your phone between turns, and get gaming.</p><h2>Othello / Reversi (1883)</h2><div id="159915"><p><h3>Othello</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://bonsai.to/4r4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Also at Target</a></li></ul><p>This is often presumed to be a classic two-player ancient abstract like Chess and Checkers. In fact, it's much more recent and, bizarrely, two different men took credit, each rubbishing the other's claim. On your turn you place a disk of your color, black or white, onto a grid space. The aim is to fill the grid with your color. But the disks are reversible. If you can bookend a line or diagonal of your opponent's color with yours, all the disks flip to your side. Cue a fiendish battle of wits that can suddenly swing, even late in the game.</p><h2>Crokinole (1876)</h2><div id="159922"><p><h3>Crokinole</h3></p></div><p>Of all the many and varied dexterity games in the world, Canada’s Crokinole holds the crown. Boards aren’t cheap but they’re lovely objects in their own right. Particularly nice specimens can be mounted on the wall as a talking point. And when you get it down to play, you’ll find out what all the fuss is about as you navigate its treacherous mix of flicking skill and tactical positioning. Your goal is to get your disks into the highest scoring zones possible, but the catch is you have to flick them off existing disks to count. It’s all about trying to rack up the points while also hiding your disks behind the board pegs or other disks.</p><h2>Perudo / Liar's Dice (1800)</h2><div id="159914"><p><h3>Liar's Dice</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://bonsai.to/bgk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Also at Target</a></li></ul><p>You'll see this sold under various branded names, but the game is always the same. Everyone shakes some dice in secret, under a cup. Then they have to bid a certain number of a particular value they think the combined dice hold: seven fours, for example. Next player either ups the bid or calls their bluff. This straightforward setup disguises a wealth of statistics, guesswork and outright chicanery. Making a bid high enough to put the next player in a quandary is a wonderful moment. Being in a quandary, calling the bluff and finding the fates have rolled in your favor is better.</p><h2>Chess (16th Century)</h2><div id="198685"><p><h3>Anzid Wooden Magnetic Chess Set</h3></p></div><p>Chess is one of the most well-known strategy games, but the Chess you know has origins all the way back to 600 AD. Modern Chess was born from an Indian game called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaturanga#:~:text=The%20Sanskrit%20word%20chaturanga%20means,been%20a%20puzzle%20for%20centuries." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chaturanga</a> in which the pieces, board, all look very similar. One of the first true masters of Chess didn't appear until that 16th century after the game had spread and evolved throughout Asia and Europe. Nowadays, the game of Chess is huge across the globe and there are a ton of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-chess-sets">great Chess sets</a> worth adding to your board game collection.</p><h2>Playing Cards (~900 AD)</h2><div id="159913"><p><h3>Bicycle Playing Cards</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://bonsai.to/hf1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Also at Target</a></li></ul><p>These also originated in China, and are also a game you can play for the rest of your life. Because, of course, it's not one game but thousands. Many you'll already know: Poker, Bridge and other popular titles constitute hobbies in their own right. But there are equally fun games played with slightly different decks across the world. You can play them fine with a standard 52 card deck: Jass, Scopa and dozens more. There are modern designers working with the deck to create new, strategically rich games like Ambition. Get a deck, get to <a href="https://www.pagat.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pagat.com</a>, and it might be the only gaming equipment you ever buy.</p><h2>Go (~2200 BC)</h2><div id="159912"><p><h3>Go - Magnetic Board Game Set</h3></p></div><p>We're not including well-worn abstracts like Chess on this list. Go is huge in Japan and China, where it originated, but it's a little more obscure in the West. And that's a shame because Go is a thing of staggering genius. On your turn, you place a stone of your color atop an intersection on a grid of lines. If you can cut off all four adjoining spaces for a stone of the opposite color, it's removed. That's pretty much the entire game, yet the strategy beneath is so deep that only very recently has an AI challenged a top human player. Place one stone and you could be playing for a lifetime.</p><h2>What makes a board game a “classic”?</h2><p>In common with pretty much every use of that word, the real answer is that “it depends”. There are no cast iron rules to tell us when a game has crossed over that magical barrier into semi-mythical status. But two of the key things that guided us in compiling this list were units sold, influence and brand familiarity. For an example of the former, take Ticket to Ride. It borrows liberally from older designs, and it’s not a name that’s on the lips of any average person if they’re talking about board games. Indeed, relatively few people probably realise it’s an entire franchise of titles. But the original has sold over 10 million copies and is on supermarket shelves the world over, and something that popular has definitely made the leap, especially considering it started out in the hobby market. </p><p>Influence is a trickier thing to measure, but some games contain concepts so revolutionary that those in the know will cite them often, even if they never caught on more widely. Our poster child on this list is Sid Sackson’s Acquire, which anticipated the revelatory mathematical design concepts of games like Hoity Toity and Settlers of Catan by decades, yet has been frequently out of print in the years since its release and is almost unknown outside of enthusiast circles.</p><p>Finally, brand familiarity are the games that everyone instantly thinks of when talk turns to tabletop titles. Unfortunately, a lot of these games are simply not very good, and that really disqualifies them from being classics in the same way that recognisable and popular film and TV is often pretty forgettable in the long run. The best examples on the list are the ancient abstracts like Chess, but you could also make an argument that Diplomacy falls in this category. Far more people have heard of its infamous friendship-breaking reputation than have played it as an intensive, multi-hour marathon game.</p><p><em>For more board game suggestions, check out our roundups of the </em><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-adults"><em>best board games for adults</em></a><em> or the </em><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-2-player-board-games"><em>best two-player board games</em></a><em>.</em></p><p><em>Matt Thrower is a contributing freelancer for IGN, specializing in tabletop games.

            <p>Resident Evils Code Veronica and 0 will be the next entries in the survival <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> series to get the remake treatment, according to rumours. “A remake of Resident Evil Zero &amp; Code Veronica in development right now,” <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1795075373727613065">claimed user</a> Dusk Golem on Le Epic Musk Zone. The claim was <a href="https://x.com/Andy_VGC/status/1795144763382853937">casually corroborated</a> by trustworthy sort Andy Robinson of VGC. Note the wording here, which suggests a bundle package of sorts, similar to the rumoured original plan for the remakes of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resident-evil-2-remake">Resident Evil 2</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resident-evil-3-remake">Resident Evil 3</a>.</p>

<p>So, there’s the facts, such as they are. But what do I, the discerning muncher of herbs found growing from the putrified innards of unholy kill dogs, think of such fanciful speculation? I’m glad I asked! If we take for granted that Capcom are going to have some form of Resi remake cooking from now until the great fraying of Shinji Mikami’s baseball caps, then….sure? Resident Evil 0 never struck me as an especially well-regarded entry, but Code Veronica seems as sensible a candidate as any. After the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resident-evil-4-remake">Resident Evil 4 Remake</a>’s post-credit happenings, I had assumed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resident-evil-5">Resident Evil 5</a> would be up next. Still, Veronica does offer some context for marauding beefster Chris Redfield’s journey, years before he would shoot Ethan Winters' wife in the face and refuse to elaborate for absolutely no reason.</p>
<p>My high-level take here is that, awful terrible no-good Resident Evil 3 remake aside, I would trust Capcom with my heart medication, accepting the irony that I only require such medication because of how heartbreakingly shite the Resident Evil 3 remake was. </p>
<p>If you’ve already gorged yourself on the available Resident Evil back catalogue, fear not! It’s been a bumper few years for indie survival horror titles. Most recently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crow-country">Crow Country</a>, which Alice Bee <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/crow-country-review">reckons</a> is “a well-observed love letter to the genre with great attention to detail all over the place.”</p>
