                <p>For the next Hearthstone expansion, we're going back to the Lost City of Un'goro with another swashbuckling adventure. And since any such adventure needs an angry swarm of stinging insects, we have the Demon Hunter quest. With the <strong>Unleash the Colossus</strong> quest, you'll get regular tempo plays to inflict damage, followed by a reward that will make your future stings that much more deadly.</p><p>For those unfamiliar, Hearthstone quests are 1-mana spells that always start in your hand, and give you big rewards for completing their objectives. Demon Hunter's quest, Unleash the Colossus, challenges you to deal exactly two damage to an enemy on your turn, a whopping 15 times.</p><figure data-embed-type="comparison" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4509083-demonhunter_tlc_631_enus_unleashthecolossus-117871_normal.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4509084-demonhunter_tlc_631_enus_unleashthecolossus-117871_signature.png" data-ref-id="1300-4509083,1300-4509084" data-size="large" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_super/1585/15855271/4509083-demonhunter_tlc_631_enus_unleashthecolossus-117871_normal.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_super/1585/15855271/4509084-demonhunter_tlc_631_enus_unleashthecolossus-117871_signature.png"><p>Gallery</p>       <figcaption>The Unleash the Colossus quest card, in both standard and Signature variants</figcaption> <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4509083-demonhunter_tlc_631_enus_unleashthecolossus-117871_normal.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4509084-demonhunter_tlc_631_enus_unleashthecolossus-117871_signature.png"></figure><hr><p>This may be an especially tricky proposition for Demon Hunter, whose hero power only deals one damage by default. But the full Demon Hunter quest package is built around giving you lots of options to deal exactly two damage, with a variety of new beasts to deliver the 2-damage stings. There's <strong>Gorishi Wasp</strong> that hits for two damage and gives you access to the <strong>Gorishi Stinger</strong> spell, which then delivers two damage twice more. <strong>Infestation</strong>, a new spell, also gives you Stingers. There's also the new <strong>Insect Claw</strong> weapon that gives you two charges of a two-damage strike, <strong>Gorishi Tunneler</strong> that acts as a two-for-one trigger of the quest by damaging both its target and the hero, and the 1-mana <strong>Silithid Grub</strong> with rush. Finally, while not a direct trigger for the quest, <strong>Silithid Queen</strong> synergizes well with the rest of the package by giving you big damage if you played a Beast the previous turn, thanks to its <strong>Kindred</strong> keyword.</p><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4509085-demonhunter_tlc_630_enus_gorishiwasp-117869_normal.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4509086-demonhunter_tlc_630t_enus_gorishistinger-117870_normal.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4509087-demonhunter_tlc_833_enus_insectclaw-117813_normal.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4509088-demonhunter_tlc_840_enus_gorishitunneler-119754_normal.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4509089-demonhunter_tlc_902_enus_infestation-117686_normal.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4509090-demonhunter_tlc_903_enus_silithidqueen-117687_normal.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4509091-demonhunter_tlc_903t_enus_silithidgrub-117689_normal.png" data-ref-id="1300-4509085,1300-4509086,1300-4509087,1300-4509088,1300-4509089,1300-4509090,1300-4509091" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4509085-demonhunter_tlc_630_enus_gorishiwasp-117869_normal.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4509086-demonhunter_tlc_630t_enus_gorishistinger-117870_normal.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4509087-demonhunter_tlc_833_enus_insectclaw-117813_normal.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4509088-demonhunter_tlc_840_enus_gorishitunneler-119754_normal.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4509089-demonhunter_tlc_902_enus_infestation-117686_normal.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4509090-demonhunter_tlc_903_enus_silithidqueen-117687_normal.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4509091-demonhunter_tlc_903t_enus_silithidgrub-117689_normal.png"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4509085-demonhunter_tlc_630_enus_gorishiwasp-117869_normal.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4509086-demonhunter_tlc_630t_enus_gorishistinger-117870_normal.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4509087-demonhunter_tlc_833_enus_insectclaw-117813_normal.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4509088-demonhunter_tlc_840_enus_gorishitunneler-119754_normal.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4509089-demonhunter_tlc_902_enus_infestation-117686_normal.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4509090-demonhunter_tlc_903_enus_silithidqueen-117687_normal.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4509091-demonhunter_tlc_903t_enus_silithidgrub-117689_normal.png"></figure><p>So after delivering multiple stings against your opponent, you'll be rewarded with the <strong>Gorishi Colossus</strong>, a 5-mana 8/8 Beast that doubles your 2-damage attacks from that point on, for the rest of the game.

                <p>Legendary video game developer Hideo Kojima hasn't made a secret about being <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hideo-kojima-says-he-feared-he-would-never-make-games-again-after-illness/1100-6532346/" data-ref-id="1100-6532346">gravely ill during the COVID-19 pandemic</a>, and he worried that he would never finish another project. Kojima is still thinking about his mortality even after his recovery. However, he doesn't believe that Kojima Productions would survive if he instructs his successors to keep making games exactly the way he does.</p><p>"I am not going to pass the baton to anyone," Kojima told British <a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/hideo-kojima-interview" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GQ</a>. "I will rather crush the baton… [Laughs] I don't need to give 'Hideo Kojima' to anyone. If I pass the baton to my staff and tell them to make things the same way I do, the company will not succeed and will go out of business."</p><p>When asked to elaborate on his statement, Kojima explained that creators who are inspired by him "received my small fire" and aren't trying to be exactly like him. He's happy to have influenced so many, but not eager to see anyone try to copy him exactly.</p><p>Earlier this year, Kojima disclosed that he filled <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hideo-kojima-reveals-he-has-a-usb-stick-of-game-ideas-for-his-studio-to-use-after-he-dies/1100-6531577/" data-ref-id="1100-6531577">a USB stick full of his ideas for video games</a> to be used after his death. He referred to it as his "will," and stated that he would rather Kojima Productions continue making new games and new ideas rather than simply repeating the ones he's already made.</p><p>Kojima's next game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-2-story-theories-and-everything-we-know/1100-6516214/" data-ref-id="1100-6516214">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a>, will be released on PlayStation 5 on June 26.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/fortnite<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Fortnite Review - Screenshot 1 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156743/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>Listen. I'm not gonna dive into this review of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fortnite">Fortnite</a> on Switch 2 with any ideas of pretending to know everything, or even understand anything, about a game that's grown from hastily retooled battle royale to...well...it looks kind of like <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/roblox">Roblox</a> now, in all honesty. What on earth is going on here?</p>
<p>Yes, since the last time I launched into a game of Epic's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/fortnite">Fortnite</a>, it's changed, I think it's fair to say, <em>immeasurably.</em> The menu system that you boot into is incredibly confusing if you haven't been keeping up with the changes, and looks exactly like the mess of game modes, fan content, and madness I watch my sons syphon through on a daily basis in the Roblox Corporation's behemoth.</p>
<p>Fortnite, it seems, has evolved into something of a lifestyle choice, and it's attracted all the big brands. Hey, there's LEGO, that's cool to see. And over there are lots of licensed superheroes in the main battle royale mode, there's a music festival going on, and there's even some sort of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/rocket_league">Rocket League</a>-type racing thing happening. It's a lot. And, even though I may sound a little dismissive, it's actually all very impressive.</p>
<figure><a title="Fortnite Review - Screenshot 2 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156738/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Epic has the mega-bucks to make things happen, you see, and it shows. All of the various games here are decently entertaining, great at times even, and they are collected together in such a way that it all feels, I'm sure, as though you are socialising in effect, dropping in and out of game types with your pals and getting chaotic on the mic. Again, it's basically turning into Roblox, as far as I can see.</p>
<p>This is all much slicker, though. You can feel the money in the bigger games, and even the fan stuff is much better. Hopping between games is fast and breezy now, too, and so there's always something, whether official or fan-made, to take for a spin without having to worry about a sluggish port making it much slower than it need be.</p>
<p>Let's dig in, just a little, to the core modes involved for those who are new to this 2016 game, or platform, such as it is these days. You've got the super-solid battle royale that started it all (pour one out for Save the World), seemingly available here in a few seasons at once, with superheroes and some classic older stuff all there to cycle through. It may have been around for aeons now, but honestly the building element to this — where you erect makeshift walls and platforms on the fly — just never really gets old, and having this one mode running smoothly on Switch 2 is probably enough for some to make it worth the download.</p>
<figure><a title="Fortnite Review - Screenshot 3 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156741/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>There's <strong>Lego Fortnite Odyssey</strong>, a fully fleshed out survival game that's managed to stick around and remain popular for quite some time (full transparency, I've been very excited by what I've played of this so far) alongside <strong>Lego Brick Life</strong>, a sort of multiplayer social-sim deal where you can probably spend hundreds of hours making an apartment just how you like it in a big Lego city full of other people.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Harmonix gets involved with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/fortnite_festival">Fortnite Festival</a>, which is a full-on rhythm game featuring rotating song selections, a song shop, and the choice to take control of one of four instruments in each song, meaning multiplayer is a go-go. What I played was, like everything in Fortnite, surprisingly in-depth and fully-featured, so I can imagine it's good fun with some pals.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/rocket_racing">Rocket Racing</a>, meanwhile, is genuinely a pretty great online 12-player racer (by Psyonix!) that does a great job of giving you a fast-paced, flashy and very moreish arcade experience replete with everything from boost pads to drift techniques and more besides.</p>
<figure><a title="Fortnite Review - Screenshot 4 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156737/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>These offerings are the main pillars within the Fortnite zeitgeist at the moment, with all the other good stuff just gravy. You've also got a huge creative suite which has been powered up and added to over time, resulting in a flexible system that enables gamers to make impressively varied content, some of which is actually very decent - from the little I've tried.</p>
<p>There's freeze-tag games, co-op horror efforts, a Minecraft clone (which seems good?!), BMX games, sports stuff, sci-fi adventures and a game which I will even mention by name here, Octo Game, which is basically <strong>Squid Game</strong> online. Nice.</p>
<p>I'm sure none of us need a 46-year-old nerd's in-depth thoughts on every last one of the game modes and fan content bits and bobs here; we all know what Fortnite is and how it plays across the various aspects that have been added to it over the past few years. It's also <em>free</em> — the microtransactions, although annoying in quantity, are purely cosmetic, so ruining yourself financially is entirely optional — so I guess there's no loss to just jumping in and giving it a whirl.</p>
<figure><a title="Fortnite Review - Screenshot 5 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156736/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Now, the big question. How does it play on Switch 2? Well, it's all very good news. Looking back on the original Switch version now, after years of iteration and several console launches, it really is a bit of a muddy, depressing mess. We all put up with it, because we're hard-as-nails gamers, but as soon as you make the leap to Switch 2, there's no turning back.</p>
<p>The blurred visuals have been eradicated to the point my son is happily playing it in docked mode on a big TV and thinks it looks "great". This coming from someone who baulked at the idea of just <em>looking</em> at the Switch version is surely a very good sign.</p>
<p>In both docked and handheld mode you are now getting 60fps and it looks way, way sharper. Resolutions, I believe, have jumped from 900p/660p (or thereabouts) for docked and handheld respectively on OG Switch — both of which were 30fps — to 1220p/900p at 60fps on the Switch 2. Result!</p>
<p>Geometry looks far more impressive, with way more detail and sharper, cleaner edges and textures have seen a big old boost all-round. Foliage has also returned to the map in the form of lots of lovely trees and details, an aspect which looked AWFUL on Switch 1 as you departed the Battle Bus and landed down onto a barren wasteland. Here it looks great. Is it as sharp as a PS5? Of course not. But it looks very nice, especially in handheld, and there have been no issues across any of the game modes as far as I have experimented. It's 60fps all the way, baby.</p>

<p>In terms of the modes themselves, just very quickly, I still love the main battle royale/building mode of this game. It's just very smart, and one of those timeless things that draws you in fully every time you return to it. Elsewhere, I have to say, I could also quite easily get fully addicted to Rocket Racing and all of the various Lego stuff is also great. I'd much rather my kids stuck to playing this than return to the dankness of Roblox, in all honesty.</p>
<p>Another cool aspect to this embiggened version of Fortnite, is all of the creative opportunities it offers to players through its various Creative modes. I should also mention that the Lego Odyssey survival/adventure mode absolutely got me hooked. I was not expecting it to be this involving.</p>
<p>Seasoned players will also be happy to hear that loading times are way sharper, and all of your various skins — which on Switch might straight up refuse to load in — now appear in a timely and orderly fashion. Heck, they even look good! These are the sorts of changes that take it from a fuzzy, low-end version, albeit one we put up with on Switch, to an eminently viable experience.</p>

<p>Whilst I've been playing Fortnite on Switch 2, it's also received an update to add mouse controls, and I...love them? I was not expecting to say that. Quite the opposite, in fact. However, the way the game handles it all is very cool.</p>
<p>Hopping into Settings, you can select a hand for mouse control, turning your chosen Joy-Con on its side and using the shoulder buttons as your mouse buttons. Sweet. The other Joy-Con then gets held normally for movement with your thumbstick, and combining these gives you a hybrid setup that feels ace. Yes, you'll need to have a little space to do it, but if you're sitting at a desk (or have ironed your trouser legs), this is now the way. A big surprise, and something that's now got me excited to use mouse controls for shooters on Switch 2 going forward.</p>

<p>Overall, then, this port may not be quite as slick as your powerhouse PC or Series X variants, which is fair enough and expected, but honestly, if I had to choose a console to go with, it's no longer straightforward. Portable brings <em>a lo</em>t to the table, especially considering the gaming habits of the kids this game is primarily aimed at. I also now love mouse controls.</p>
<p>So, yes, it looks a bit shinier on other platforms, but sitting on the sofa to mess in creative mode, listen to tunes via Fortnite Festival, or get stuck into Lego or battle royale? I'm gonna go ahead and say I'm rocking the Switch 2 every time.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Fortnite on Switch 2 fixes all glaring — and not so glaring — issues with the Switch 1 version of the game. This is a huge package of activities; from battle royale to survival game, racing, creative modes, music festivals, and more besides. It's a lot, and it now runs at 60fps with crisp, clean resolutions all round.</p>
<p>Mouse mode controls are a revelation, loading times are hugely improved, graphics look very nice indeed, thanks, and, well, I reckon this is now the best way to play this one, regardless of a slight downgrading in visuals.</p></section>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/street-fighter-6-sales-5m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Capcom has announced that&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter 6&nbsp;</em>sales have topped another major milestone around the world, including sales across all platforms and on both digital and physical platforms.</p>

<p>According to a <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/news/html/e250611.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a> on the official Capcom website,&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter 6&nbsp;</em>has managed to sell five million copies since launching back in June 2023. The new sales milestone means that&nbsp;the fighting game has picked up another million sales for itself <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/street-fighter-6-sales-4-million" rel="nofollow">since September last year</a>.</p>

<p>Sales may well have accelerated thanks to the launch of&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter 6&nbsp;</em>as a Switch 2 launch title. The console, which launched on June 5th, racked up 3.5 million sales <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/switch-2-fastest-selling-nintendo-console" rel="nofollow">within its first four days</a>, making it Nintendo's fastest-selling console around the world.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/street-fighter-6-sales-5m-kimberly.jpg?itok=wJYGqsjb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/street-fighter-6-sales-5m-kimberly.jpg?itok=--9bxZBj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Street Fighter 6&nbsp;</em>has hit a brand new sales milestone.</figcaption></figure><p>If you've somehow missed out on&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter 6</em>, it's absolutely far from the sixth installment in the&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter&nbsp;</em>series, but it is the sixth mainline entry.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The game largely continues the one-on-one fighting game trappings of its predecessors, although it naturally boasts new characters in its roster, as well as new mechanics and a more newcomer-friendly approach (which, incidentally, is one of the things Capcom credits with the new game's popularity).</p>

<p><em>Street Fighter 6&nbsp;</em>also features a single-player mode by the name of World Tour, in which players can create their own avatars and explore various environments from both the&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Final Fight&nbsp;</em>universes.</p>

<p>Like many modern fighting games,&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter 6&nbsp;</em>also features <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/street-fighter-6-rollback-netcode-will-be-better-open-worlds-detailed" rel="nofollow">rollback netcode</a>, as well as cross-platform play. A host of new characters have also been added to the roster as part of post-launch DLC, many of which are included in the Switch 2's&nbsp;<em>Years 1-2 Fighters Edition&nbsp;</em>package.</p>




<p><em>Street Fighter 6&nbsp;</em>is available right now for PC, PlayStation, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch 2. You can check out <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/street-fighter-6-review" rel="nofollow">our review of the game here</a>.</p>

He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>If you’re dealing with what appears to be poor battery life on the Nintendo Switch 2, the company has a <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68272/~/the-battery-charge-indicator-or-percentage-displays-incorrectly-on-nintendo">support document</a> with steps you can try to fix it.</p><p>The document spells out what you can try if “the battery amount displayed and the actual remaining battery use don’t match,” according to Nintendo. “For example, you are able to continue using your Nintendo Switch 2 console for a few hours even though the battery charge indicator displays the battery is almost depleted.”</p><p>Nintendo’s troubleshooting steps include making sure you have an “adequately powerful AC adapter” to charge your system, confirming that your console has the latest system update, and booting the system into recovery mode, which the company says “should reset the battery level meter.” If those steps don’t work and your battery life is still showing incorrectly, Nintendo suggests sending your console in for service.</p><p>Since last week’s launch, there’s been <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nintendo/comments/1l4pv2t/switch_2_battery_life/">some chatter</a> about poor battery life, but some of that might just be due to the Switch 2 not having a great battery. On the Switch 2 <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fgaming-systems%2Fswitch-2%2Ftech-specs%2F%3Fsrsltid%3DAfmBOoqtSU0D6vLzB2FZkUZBPUQThJrhxAhmYOFf54WuhkoLdMQmWf3-" rel="sponsored">tech specs page</a>, Nintendo rates battery life from approximately 2 to 6.5 hours, and it notes that those are “rough estimates” and that “the battery life will depend on the games you play.” For comparison, Nintendo rates the <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fgaming-systems%2Fswitch%2Ftech-specs%2F%3Fsrsltid%3DAfmBOopTIBh2Cpv7_cuH96gdOvMX8PCEYxr2_v8l8nLREfBVOws7Xnso%23switch-section" rel="sponsored">Switch</a> and <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fgaming-systems%2Fswitch%2Ftech-specs%2F%3Fsrsltid%3DAfmBOopTIBh2Cpv7_cuH96gdOvMX8PCEYxr2_v8l8nLREfBVOws7Xnso%23oled-section" rel="sponsored">Switch OLED</a> for about ​​4.5 to 9 hours of battery.</p><p>The differences are stark in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gqD6US5HEo">battery test on YouTube</a> between the Switch 2, Switch OLED, and Switch Lite. With all three running <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em> under similar conditions, the Switch 2 was the first console to power down after about 2 hours and 45 minutes. The next was the Switch Lite, which lasted nearly 30 minutes longer. And the Switch OLED? It lasted for approximately double the time of the Switch 2, finally powering off at just about five hours and 30 minutes.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/street-fighter-6-sells-five-million-copies-on-track-to-be-best-selling-street-fighter-ever<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Capcom has announced that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/street-fighter-6">Street Fighter 6</a> has sold over five million copies, just as the game has been released on the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-review-of-the-switch-2-as-much-as-you-can-review-a-new-console-after-a-weekend-in-its-company">Nintendo Switch 2</a>. At this pass, the game is on track to be the best-selling game in the series.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/StreetFighter/status/1932603814827180338">Celebrating the achievement on social media</a> with a lovely bit of custom art, the company wrote: "Street Fighter 6 has now sold over five million copies! What a way to celebrate our 2nd anniversary! Thanks to all our fans out there around the world and to all the prospective fans in the future!"</p>
<p>Street Fighter 6, released on 2nd June 2023, is catching up the series sales leader at a faster pace than its predecessors. According to the <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/business/million.html#tab2">Capcom Platinum Titles page</a>, which tracks the company's best-selling games, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/street-fighter-v">Street Fighter 5</a> is holding the top spot for now. It's sitting pretty at 7.8m units sold since its release on 16th February, 2016. By comparison, Street Fighter 6 has sold five million copies in just over two years.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/street-fighter-2">Street Fighter 2</a>, which you may have assumed was the best-selling game in the series due to its prevalence in popular culture and influence on the genre, has sold 6.3m. It is worth noting that this Capcom list only tracks console sales, we also know that over 200,000 Street Fighter 2 arcade cabinets were sold during the golden era of arcades.</p>
<p>Okay, so why is Street Fighter 6 on track to surpass Street Fighter 5 in sales? Well, it's still receiving plenty of updates and has a flourishing global community of players. <a href="https://x.com/StreetFighter/status/1931118961846038736">Its third season of DLC characters was just announced at Summer Game Fest</a>, and includes plenty of returning favourites like Sagat and Alex. These, plus a recent port to the Switch 2 will help tempt older fans back into the fray.</p>
<p>The game has also had a far faster start in terms of sales than Street Fighter 5. If you don't remember, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-street-fighter-5-will-and-wont-have-at-launch">the launch of Street Fighter 5 was a disaster</a>. The PC version was a technical mess, online netcode was poor making it hard to play matches online. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/yoshinori-ono-discusses-street-fighter-5s-launch-problems">Yoshinori Ono came forward and discussed all its issues candidly too</a>, explaining that the team underestimated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/street-fighter-5-review">the appetite for single player content in a barebones release</a>.</p>
<p>Street Fighter 5 rose up the ranks of Capcom's best-sellers due in large part to continuous support over the years. The game was tied heavily to the game's competitive scene, promoting FGC events and Capcom Pro Tour tournaments through in-game stage advertisements and purchasable cosmetics. The game essentially regained the love of fans over time.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/street-fighter-6-review-social-silly-spectacular">Street Fighter 6 never had this problem</a>. It launched in a great state, with good online infrastructure and a sizable amount of single player content with the World Tour mode. What's left is ongoing support for the game on Capcom's part. Funnily enough, here the game has the opposite problem to Street Fighter 5. While previously there was no shortage in character cosmetics to buy, Street Fighter 6's community has been frustrated at the lack of character packs released during its life cycle.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the game has a popular competitive scene that continues to encourage new players to hop in, it has been supported heavily by community efforts like the Sajam Slam and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a> Rivals, and popular content creators continue to dip their toes into the waters of Street Fighter 6 to entertain their fans.</p>
<p>Street Fighter 6 may not be around during the height of esports like Street Fighter 5 was, largely due to many of the speculative investors running away with empty pockets upon realising esports is a burning money pyre, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/capcom-sends-fighting-game-community-into-overdrive-with-whopping-1m-first-prize-street-fighter-6-tournament">Capcom continues to offer a million dollar top prize for its annual Capcom Cup finals event</a>. This has kept top players interested, and an aura of excitement alive.</p>
<p>How long will it take for Street Fighter 6 to surpass Street Fighter 6? Who can say. If I may make a prediction, I believe it'll pass the milestone around the end of 2026. Sales will slow down due to a deluge of newer fighting games releasing and snatching interest, like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/project-l">2XKO</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls">Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls</a>. Regardless, it's safe to say the game has proven quite the success for Capcom.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/a-must-have-launch-title-digital-foundry-delivers-its-fast-fusion-verdict<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<p>"The most technically impressive game of the launch line-up"</p>
</section><div><section>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJUn7Kc3W3A">Digital Foundry</a> has provided its tech review for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fast-fusion">Fast Fusion</a> on the Switch 2, calling it "the most technically impressive game of the launch line-up" and a "must-have" for early adopters.</p>
<p>Starting off on a bit of a downer, however, DF notes that the overall image quality isn't quite up to scratch, with gameplay looking like "a mess of pixels with a lot of temporal blur". Essentially, Shin'en is making heavy use of DLSS, with the 1080p mode actually rendering at a base resolution of 540p, 1440p mode at 504p, 4K/60 mode at around 648p, and 4K/30 at 720p.</p><p><figure data-videoid="NK1xJVeVTDM" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NK1xJVeVTDM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK1xJVeVTDM"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>821k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK1xJVeVTDM">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>Basically, with the fast-paced nature of the game, the heavy use of DLSS causes some serious image issues. Now, the good news is that, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/fast-fusions-first-content-update-includes-a-remade-fast-rmx-track">as we'd reported recently</a>, Shin'en will be implementing a new graphics mode called 'PURE' in a future update, which essentially gets rid of anti-aliasing and reprojection for a cleaner image more in line with the technology seen in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/fast_rmx">Fast RMX</a>.</p>
<p>Onto the more positive stuff, then. DF praises the frame rate across most of the game's performance modes, but understandably states that the 30fps ultra quality mode probably isn't worth it for most people. Although very minor frame rate hiccups were noticed, DF could not replicate them for the actual frame rate test in the video. Meanwhile, the basic quality mode uses real-time shadows over baked shadows, but it's noted that the difference between the two is pretty minor.</p>
<p>GameShare is also tested, and thanks to the streaming technology involved, the image quality for player two isn't quite up to par. This is understandable, and again, the fast-paced gameplay makes this much more obvious.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, DF heaps praise on the lighting effects in the game along with the actual design of the tracks themselves. Compared to Fast RMX, which used quite basic track designs with a few environmental assets added in here and there, Fast Fusion's tracks feel like they're part of a much bigger world, and this is quite the feat given just how few people are on the development team.</p>
<p>Pretty good stuff then! We absolutely loved the game too, and gave it a well-deserved score of 9/10 in our review. If you've not tried this one yet, then we highly recommend giving it a shot.</p>

			<p>PlayStation has <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/06/11/playstation-plus-game-catalog-for-june-fbc-firebreak-battlefield-2042-five-nights-at-freddys-help-wanted-2-and-more/">announced</a> the nine games that are being added to the PS Plus Extra and Premium game catalogs for June 2025, with the two biggest titles being Battlefield 2042 and FBC: Firebreak, the latter of which is launching into the service on June 17, 2025.</p>
<p>Along with Battlefield 2042 and FBC: Firebreak, other notable titles PS Plus Extra and Premium subscribers can play beginning on June 17, 2025, include Five Nights at Freddy's: Help Wanted 2, and We Love Katamari Reroll + Royal Reverie. PS Plus Premium subscribers will also be able to dive back into the world of Deus Ex, with Deus Ex: The Conspiracy being the lone addition to the PS Plus Premium Classic's Catalog for June 2025.</p>
<p>Here's the full list for all nine games that'll be available to subscribers on June 17:</p>
<ul>
<li>FBC: Firebreak (PS5)</li>
<li>Battlefield 2042 (PS5, PS4)</li>
<li>Five Nights at Freddy's: Help Wanted 2 (PS5)</li>
<li>theHunter: Call of the Wilds (PS4)</li>
<li>We Love Katamari Reroll + Royal Reverie (PS5, PS4)</li>
<li>Eiyuden Chronicles: Hundred Heroes (PS5, PS4)</li>
<li>Train Sim World 5 (PS5, PS4)</li>
<li>Endless Dungeon (PS5, PS4)</li>
<li>Deus Ex: The Conspiracy (PS5, PS4) - <strong>PS Plus Premium subscribers only</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>While Battlefield 2042 and FBC: Firebreak are arguably the two major games added to the PS Plus Extra and Premium game catalogs this month, having Battlefield in this month's batch of games won't feel like much of anything for subscribers.</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/ps-plus-essential-march-2023-battlefield-2042-extra-premium-uncharted-ghostwire/">In March 2023,</a> Battlefield 2042 was the headlining game for the PS Plus Essential's tier three monthly games. Anyone who is subscribed to PS Plus at all, without needing to go to the higher tiers, likely already has Battlefield 2042 in their library of games they got through PlayStation Plus.</p>
<p>This also makes for two straight months of Battlefield games being added to the PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium game catalog, because<a href="https://wccftech.com/sandland-battlefield-v-and-stalker-legends-of-the-zone-trilogy-included-in-ps-plus-extra-and-premium-games-for-may-2025/"> May 2025's additions included Battlefield V</a>. Another game which had <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps-plus-may-2021-games-godfall-disco-elysium-battlefield-v/">previously been one of the three free games offered for Essential tier subscribers</a>, even before PlayStation officially switched to its new tiered PlayStation Plus structure.</p>
<p>At least FBC: Firebreak is an entirely new addition for subscribers to enjoy this month. <a href="https://wccftech.com/remedy-details-two-major-updates-coming-in-fbc-firebreaks-post-launch-roadmap/">Remedy also just detailed</a> what Firebreak players will be getting in two major free updates coming to the game post-launch.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/warframe-to-get-isleweaver-update-on-june-25/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Digital Extremes revealed that the next large Warframe update called Isleweaver will be released on all platforms on June 25.</p>
<p>Players who have completed the <a href="https://wccftech.com/warframe-1999-is-available-everywhere-today/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Warframe: 1999</a> quest 'The Hex' will have access to an expanded Kingdom of Duviri. They will face Major Rusalka once again in the emotionally turbulent Kingdom of Duviri, alongside new threats to this region such as The Murmur and the looming presence of The Indifference. Activities include collecting lore fragments to reveal narrative secrets, discovering the new island of Scholar’s Landing and unraveling the mystery behind Rusalka’s reign, before facing off against the latest Warframe, Oraxia, in a new mini-boss battle.</p>
<p>Moreover, Isleweaver introduces Operation: Eight Claw. Here, players partner with Dominus Thrax to earn exclusive event rewards by reclaiming Scholar’s Landing and Duviri’s throne from Major Rusalka and the Murmur in a new Clan Operation.

<p>All players will have access to Oraxia, the 61st Warframe, known as the mistress of fear. Oraxia can isolate and execute weakened foes, poison enemies, imbibe marked enemies for buffs and summon spiderling swarms like a good broodmother would from the corpses of the fallen. Two new weapons will be added to the Warframe arsenal alongside Oraxia: the Scyotid barb cluster throwing weapon and the Spinnerex poison whip.</p>
<p>There are also new Deluxe Cosmetics and TennoGen. Explore new facets of Citrine with the latest Deluxe Collection, including the Citrine Aphrodita Skin, the Corazon Syandana and other bejewelled cosmetics, all of which have been given a new look. Players can also take their Fashion Frame game to the next level and collect new TennoGen cosmetics to adorn their Warframes, weapons and operators with new, community-designed customisations when Isleweaver launches.</p>
<p>Digital Extremes also reiterated its commitment to refining Warframe's first impressions for new players this year with the launch of Isleweaver. A revamped onboarding tutorial has been introduced in one of the first quests, Vor's Prize, which modernizes the boss fight. Players may also experiment with a rework of Valkyr’s gameplay, which changes her ability kit to allow for a faster, more aggressive playstyle that caters to her melee-focused kit.</p>
<p>More announcements will be made during <a href="https://www.warframe.com/tennocon" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TennoCon</a>, which will take place on July 18-19 in London, Ontario, Canada. It should be a special event, given that it's the tenth year of the fan-focused Warframe convention.</p>

            <p>A fresh report has shed a bit more light on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age-dreadwolf">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>'s famously difficult time in development, offering info on culture clashes between BioWare's different teams, and revealing that the game was re-written due to concerns about its banter being too snarky.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-11/inside-the-dragon-age-debacle-that-gutted-ea-s-bioware-studio">report</a>, from Bloomberg's Jason Schreier, goes through the whole sordid story of Veilguard's journey from in-the-works single player game, to in-the-works online thing, back to in-the-works single player thing, parts of which you're likely familiar with at this point. There's also a bunch of context as to how wider events across the studio and publisher EA influenced the game that ended up hitting shelves after a decade or so of development.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The new revelations tell how the tone of the game's dialogue, as well as the choices and consequences, had to be revamped following the switch from multiplayer back to single player in 2020.</p>
<p>Schreier emphasises that this shift didn't come with a full reset of the project, which meant developers had to work on something with lots of vestigial features intended for an entirely different type of game.</p>
<p>An alpha build at the end of 2022 flagged that testers believed Veilguard didn't have satisfying or meaty enough choices and consequences to live up to BioWare's previous works, another problem attributed to the game having been designed for multiplayer, according to the devs Schreier spoke to. Cue extra work to add in more choices, including an important choice between saving two cities, and a struggle to ensure these decisions played into the narrative further down the road.</p>
<p>The report also cites concerns about the reception to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/forspoken-patch-adjusts-frequency-and-content-of-banter-ahead-of-dlc-release">the dialogue</a> of Square Enix's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/forspoken">Forspoken</a> as having led to a rewrite for Veilguard's chatter. This was an attempt to drag it away from the "snarky tone" that'd been pencilled in as part of the multiplayer vision, and instead "make it sound more serious". Similarly, the game's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-very-first-dragon-age-the-veilguard-trailer-makes-it-look-like-a-fornite-heist-movie">June 2024 reveal trailer</a> reportedly raised concerns about EA's ability to market the game in a way that didn't feel a bit Fortnitey.</p>
<p>There's also plenty of detail regarding "internal friction" between <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age">Dragon Age</a> tream that were originally working on the game and the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> team EA drafted in for the project's final push around 2023, with cultural differences between the two teams adding to what sounds like it was already a pretty unpleasant mix of pressuresand forces at play.</p>
<p>In the aftermath of Veilguard and the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/please-call-a-job-cut-a-job-cut">layoffs at BioWare</a> that followed its release, a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bioware-quietly-lay-off-key-dragon-age-team-members-while-talking-up-the-next-mass-effect">smaller team's left beavering away</a> on on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mass-effect-5">Mass Effect 5</a>, with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ea-never-grasped-dragon-ages-value-as-an-rpg-says-inquisition-writer">plenty of questions</a> still hanging over the RPG studio's future. It's a sad state of affairs to put it mildly, especially given that while it definitely isn't everyone's cup of tea - I found what I played to be decent fun and you can read <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review">Nic's verdict here</a> - the version of Veilguard we got was far from a complete trainwreck.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Since you can directly control your character using WASD, you can control the vehicle’s path and ram into a secondary Zoi.</p><p>However, and once again, this only works for the Zois under your care. You cannot run down an NPC, for example, or a child any longer.</p><p><strong>Alternatively, you can arrange an unfortunate accident in which your Zoi passes away due to electrocution, a house fire, or starvation</strong>. Okay, so the last one isn’t precisely an accident. But you can continue using old, broken appliances that may lead to a kitchen incident, and if your Zoi doesn’t move away quickly enough (such as when you turn off autonomy), they’ll likely perish in the blaze.</p><h2 id="h678950"><a id="2"></a>All the ways a Zoi can die in <em>inZoi</em></h2><figure id="" data-id="ad19b874780467494a93aa74d374b076" data-recommend-id="image://ad19b874780467494a93aa74d374b076" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An in-game guide overview of fire hazards in inZOI." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An in-game guide overview of fire hazards in inZOI." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Krafton</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ad19b874780467494a93aa74d374b076" data-recommend-id="image://ad19b874780467494a93aa74d374b076" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An in-game guide overview of fire hazards in inZOI." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There are several currently available ways in which a Zoi may perish, including:</p><p><strong>Car accidents</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Should another Zoi ram your current Zoi with their vehicle, either in a car accident or a pedestrian accident, it may lead to an untimely death.</li></ul><p><strong>Fire</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Due to an accident or a busted appliance, a fire can break out in a kitchen and lead to severe injury or death.</li></ul><p><strong>Fall damage</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Should your Zoi slip on a wet surface, the ensuing fall may lead to death.</li></ul><p><strong>Starvation</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Ignoring your Zoi’s needs, specifically their hunger, can lead to starvation over time.</li></ul><p><strong>Sleep deprivation</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Once again, ignoring a need and refusing to allow your Zoi to sleep will lead to sleep deprivation and, in time, death.</li></ul><p><strong>Electrocution</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>In the same way as a fire may break out, using a broken appliance or attempting to hack into an ATM may lead to electrocution.</li></ul><p><strong>Old age</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Zois will pass away due to old age, though the age in question varies between characters.</li></ul><p><em>inZOI </em>is available now on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows PC.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

How could I hate on such a precious, friendly little Koopa as he? But you don’t have to play <em>Mario Kart World</em> for long to realize somebody must have pissed in his Cheerios this time around—he is more aggressive than ever, hauling players back onto the race track whenever they put the slightest toe out of line. </p><p>Ram into a barrier along the side of a course? Bam, you’re getting Lakitu’d. Try to cut corners and drive through an open field? There’s a 50/50 chance he’ll be on your ass before you even realize you’re not allowed to go that way. Want to relive that classic shortcut from Mario Circuit 4 dating back to the days of the SNES by hopping that green barrier at the second-to-last bend before the finish line? Get fucked. </p><p>I thought I was alone, but nope, Lakitu is ruining everyone else’s fun too. It’s ironic too, considering <em>Mario Kart World </em>features the series’ most complex and open courses yet, each existing on a full map in which you can drive between the tracks. For a sequel where exploring off the beaten path and grinding on every surface you can find is core to its ethos, <em>Mario Kart World</em> really doesn’t want you living your best, improvised life a lot of the time. It’s especially annoying since Lakitu takes your items and an extra <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-coin-farming-tips-vehicles-unlock-1851784093&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-coin-farming-tips-vehicles-unlock-1851784093">three coins every time he grabs you</a></span>. </p><p> “Lakitu is a bastard in this game,” wrote SkeletronDOTA on the subreddit. “One time I just drifted slightly wide with a golden shroom and he put me back on the track, and took my golden shroom and bullet with him.” User Chrop responded, “Lakitu seems extremely strict in this game, was playing on Boo Cinema and I flew slightly to the right on the glider section and said no. I was fully able to get back on the track but he didn’t like that I flew a little too far away.”</p><p>It’s not all bad. Lakitu won’t mess with you in Free Roam mode where you can complete the Mario Circuit feather jump shortcut in peace, and there are definitely times where his quick interventions are appreciated. For instance, say, if you <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/mariokart/comments/1l7f75b/uhh_excuse_me/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mariokart/comments/1l7f75b/uhh_excuse_me/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">start randomly falling</a></span> through the map.

Still, he could use way more overall chill. Maybe <em>Mario Kart World</em>’s next patch will dial him back a bit. For now, Lakitu is way overtuned. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It's still below Siege's all-time peak of 201,933 achieved on May 17, 2024, but it's an impressive gain all the same as people returned to Siege or tried it for the first time to check out the Siege X update and all of its new features and functionality.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BI9fgQY0d5I" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BI9fgQY0d5I" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Siege is currently <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">inside the top five best-selling Steam games</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/mostplayed" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">inside the top 10 most-played games.</a> Steam shares this data publicly, but Microsoft and Sony do not share similar sales or engagement data for the Xbox and PlayStation stores.</p><p>The Siege X update gives the game a makeover, of sorts, with better-looking graphics and improved sound.

                <p>Epic Games wants to enhance Fortnite's appeal in Korea and announced multiple collaborations, including a new skin for South Korean soccer star Son Heung-min in Fortnite. Heung-min was also added to PUBG Battlegrounds a few years ago and featured in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ea-sports-fc-25/">EA Sports FC 25</a>.</p><p>The Son Heung-min bundle will be released in the game store and includes his official uniform, the Forward Edge accessory that changes style according to time, the Goal Getter wrapping sheet with a soccer motif, and his iconic Snap Ceremony emote.

            <p>Developer Build A Rocket Boy has shared details on an upcoming hotfix for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mindseye">MindsEye</a>.</p>
<p>Admitting the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-launches-with-myriad-of-glitches-and-issues-as-developer-promises-performance-update">game's launch "hasn't been without its challenges" for many players</a>, the studio now says "game performance" is its top priority. As such, a patch is planned for the end of this week for those playing on PC, while the team hopes to roll it out for those on consoles "as soon as possible".</p>
<p>This upcoming hotfix for MindsEye will include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Initial CPU and GPU performance improvements, along with memory optimisations</li>
<li>Reduced difficulty for the CPR mini-game</li>
<li>A new setting to disable or modify Depth of Field</li>
<li>A fix for an issue with missing controls for the MineHunter and Run Dungeon mini-games</li>
<li>Pop-up warnings for PCs that have Hardware Accelerated GPU Scheduling disabled, and PCs with CPUs that have potential crash issues</li>
</ul>

<p>Build A Rocket Boy said this fix will be the first of a series of updates for MindsEye. Future updates will be aimed at "enhancing your experience," the developer said, promising to keep us up to date with information on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Patches will need to have the internet to load, the team reminded players, asking them to "please ensure [the] game is updated regularly to enjoy the benefits of the latest improvements".</p>
<p>The studio additionally added that Build.MindsEye - that is to say, the game's creation platform designed to help creators share interactive experiences - is now "fully accessible" for those on Steam.</p>
<p>"Thank you again for your incredible support. This is just the start of a long-term vision to make MindsEye the best possible game for you," the team closed.</p>

            <p>Epic Games has announced publicly it has filed a lawsuit against an individual it alleges has developed and sold cheats for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>.</p>
<p>This latest venture in Epic Game's ongoing war against those who create, sell, and use cheats was announced via <a href="https://x.com/EpicNewsroom/status/1932485822445666348">the company's own Twitter account</a>. There, the company posted:</p>
<p>"We filed a new lawsuit against an individual who developed and sold cheating software that helped players see through walls and auto aim. We're also going after people who helped sell this software. Creating and selling software to help others cheat is against the rules and we'll keep fighting to keep it out of Fortnite."</p>

<figcaption>A new Fortnite season was revealed recently. Check it out!<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_zzh-g2a4M" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p><a href="https://www.polygon.com/fortnite/606086/epic-games-sues-fortnite-cheat-maker">According to Polygon</a>, the lawsuit has been filed in the U.S. District Court for the eastern district of North Carolina where the company is headquartered. It alleges Ediz Atas, also known as  Sincey Cheats and Vanta Chearts, has been making and selling cheats since "at least January 2023".</p>
<p>Epic alleges in the lawsuit that after DMCA takedowns were issued to YouTube videos featuring these cheats, "Sincey Cheats sent multiple emails to YouTube's designated copyright agent impersonating an Epic employee and falsely claiming that Epic wanted to 'formally reverse [its] claim of copyright infringement'" by using fake Epic Games email addresses.
</p>
<p>Epic also claims its has issued tens of thousands of bans against Fortnite accounts that used cheats from Sincey Cheats since 2022, including over 15,000 bans on US-based Fortnite accounts.
</p>
<p>The lawsuit is also asking for compensation for damages from five unnamed individuals who distributed these cheats over platforms like Discord and Telegram. The amount is unknown.</p>
<p>In case you didn't know, Epic Games has proven especially litigious when it comes to Fortnite cheaters.  In 2022 Epic <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-cheater-forced-to-pay-up-after-epic-lawsuit-damages-will-go-to-charity">forced a cheat creator to pay up in Australian court following a legal victory</a>, donating the winnings to charity.</p>

<p>The company is not alone in its struggle against cheats. Activision has also been fighting against cheats, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/activision-wins-113m-in-lawsuit-against-call-of-duty-cheat-maker">winning £11.3m in court against a Call of Duty cheat maker</a>. Bungie has been in those trenches too, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-wins-44m-lawsuit-against-destiny-cheat-seller-aimjunkies">winning a $4.4m lawsuit against Destiny cheat seller Aimjunkies</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The moon has always been a spot of interest and wonder that humankind has dreamed about reaching and finally setting foot on, if briefly. Establishing moon bases and creating a permanent foothold on the barren landscape is something that humanity still has not completely mastered in this day and age. In science fiction, when you leave Earth and set up a colony elsewhere, there’s probably a good reason for leaving God’s green Earth. In <a href="https://wccftech.com/pragmata-new-trailer-provides-new-look-at-gameplay-confirms-2026-release-window/">PRAGMATA</a>, the journey is about doing the exact opposite: escaping the confines of the lunar stations and returning to Earth, not just by yourself but with a young girl/android named Diana along with you.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.capcom-games.com/pragmata/en-us/">PRAGMATA</a> is much more than an escort mission. While the playable astronaut controls all of the movement and offensive capabilities, the young Diana riding piggyback along the way has some serious hacking prowess. As players dodge and shoot their way through autonomous death machines and androids, Diana can simultaneously hack through the enemy’s defenses. On paper, this sounds arduous with having to juggle between moving on one analog stick, aiming with another, firing with the shoulder buttons, and trying to navigate through a hacking minigame with Diana on the face buttons. In practice, it all flows very intuitively. The actual hacking minigame is about moving through a grid, bypassing traps, collecting nodes, and targeting the enemy core. In practice, the earlier hacking segments only took a second or two to move your little avatar around and collect the requisite nodes in order to disable the enemy shields.</p>
<p>There is a few weapons at the player’s disposal in PRAGMATA early on, each having its own mechanics and capabilities beyond just shooting and dealing damage. The player’s signature pistol has infinite ammo and takes time to recharge, while other weapons picked up off the ground might only have a clip or two before they’re discarded and replaced with something else. There’s a variety of energy weapons, and I leaned more into the energy shotgun type when it came to blasting my way through the brief demo.</p>
<p>It’s not all linear hallways and shooting gallery corridors in PRAGMATA. The player astronaut can jump and glide about briefly to reach far-off platforms, or shoot security locks and open up new elevators to help traverse the lunar station. Taking a step off the beaten path rewards the players with fresh weapons and even permanently increases the number of healing items they can carry at a given time.</p>
<p><iframe title="PRAGMATA - First Contact Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Idx9z6ke3tc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>PRAGMATA’s demo only ran about fifteen minutes or so after getting an initial introduction to the setting and reintroduction to a game that Capcom has revealed and talked about only briefly since the initial reveal <a href="https://youtu.be/xoxCboik0Is">five years ago today</a>. During my entire session, I kept getting these uncanny Lost Planet vibes through the gunplay and overall technology used in the construction of the world. However, I’m sure this is just a personal take on the world of PRAGMATA.</p>
<p>There’s still some time to go before this adventure is ready for players’ hands as PRAGMATA will launch on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and PC sometime in 2026.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://embracer.com/releases/lars-wingefors-proposed-to-be-elected-as-executive-chair-of-the-board-of-embracer-phil-rogers-appointed-new-ceo/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a> on its official website, Embracer says that Wingefors' departure and Rogers' appointment are both part of the "transformation process", which will see Embracer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-group-splitting-three-companies" rel="nofollow">becoming three separate entities</a> in charge of different aspects of the current company structure later this year.</p>

<p>That ongoing process also saw Embracer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-fellowship-entertainment-coffee-stain" rel="nofollow">renaming itself to Fellowship Entertainment</a> last month, with current subsidiary Coffee Stain also due to spin off into its own entity sometime later this year.</p>

He then says his move away from the CEO position will allow him to focus on "strategic initiatives, M&amp;A, and capital allocation", which I can't imagine was his response when asked what he wanted to be as a child.</p>

<p>Despite his departure, Wingefors won't be completely absent from Embracer (or Fellowship Entertainment, as it will be known by the end of the 2025 calendar year). He'll take the position of the board's executive chairman, with current chair Kicki Wallje-Lund moving to the deputy chair role.</p>

<p>Changes in Embracer's management come after a fairly turbulent time for the company. As part of a company-wide restructuring effort, Embracer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-has-laid-off-8-of-its-employees-and-it-isnt-done-yet-despite-record-quarter" rel="nofollow">laid off hundreds of employees</a> last year, additionally closing studios like&nbsp;<em>Saints Row&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Agents of Mayhem&nbsp;</em>developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-shuts-down-saints-row-developer-volition" rel="nofollow">Volition</a>.</p>

<p>Despite this, Embracer has enjoyed a couple of recent successes, most notably Warhorse Studios'&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</em>, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sales-3m" rel="nofollow">managed to sell three million copies</a> in its first three months on sale.</p>

In 2020, BioWare pivoted back to the single-player RPG that would eventually launch on Halloween 2024, but according to <em>Bloomberg</em>’s story, the developer was forced by EA to restructure the live-service version of the game into a single-player, story-driven RPG, rather than being able to go back to the drawing board and start fresh.</p><p><em>Bloomberg </em>says that early playtesters lamented a lack of distinct choices and consequences in earlier builds, and this led to the late implementation of key moments like choosing between <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-save-minrathous-treviso-choice-1851686168&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-save-minrathous-treviso-choice-1851686168">saving either Minrathous or Treviso</a></span> from a dragon attack, leading to the other metropolis being overtaken by the Darkspawn’s blight for the remainder of the game. Another collection of substantial and consequential choices appeared in<em> The Veilguard</em>’s finale, where the player’s decisions can possibly result in the deaths of their entire party. Apparently, this segment came after BioWare brought in the studio’s <em>Mass Effect </em>team to help get the game across the finish line, which resulted in an “overhaul” of the game’s final missions.</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p><em>As the Mass Effect directors took control, they scoffed that the Dragon Age squad had been doing a shoddy job and began excluding their leaders from pivotal meetings, according to people familiar with the internal friction. Over time, the Mass Effect team went on to overhaul parts of the game and design a number of additional scenes, including a rich, emotional finale that players loved. But even changes that appeared to improve the game stoked the simmering rancor inside BioWare, infuriating Dragon Age leaders who had been told they didn’t have the budget for such big, ambitious swings.</em></p></blockquote><p>This aligns with previous reporting and statements from BioWare veterans, who have stated that the <em>Dragon</em> <em>Age</em> and <em>Mass Effect</em> teams <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-mass-effect-bioware-david-gaider-anthem-1851776055&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-mass-effect-bioware-david-gaider-anthem-1851776055">had a tense relationship,</a></span> and the fantasy team felt it <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-anthem-mark-darrah-youtube-bioware-1851779569&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-anthem-mark-darrah-youtube-bioware-1851779569">didn’t receive the same level of support</a></span> as the sci-fi team from BioWare and EA leadership.
