			<p>Work on the Cyberpunk 2077 CyberMP multiplayer mod is proceeding at an impressive pace, culminating in a recent closed test that has reportedly exceeded all development team expectations.</p>



<p>The primary goals of this highly successful test were crucial for improving the experience, including checking improved synchronization between vehicles and players, introducing a new overlay, and evaluating the overall stability of the platform under load. Judging from new footage shared online by the development team, the test appears to have been a resounding success. A Race Event held during the test ran notably well and, honestly, looks like a ton of fun, demonstrating smooth vehicle handling and client-side synchronization.</p>



<p>The new Cyberpunk 2077 multiplayer mod footage also provides a quick look at a PvP event set on a wide map not available in the vanilla game. Much like the race event, this looks intense and engaging, showcasing the potential for large-scale player conflicts within Night City. It is clear that while the core system is solid, further work will be needed to iron out the remaining issues.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Although the project has been in the works since before 2024, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-multiplayer-mod/">Cyberpunk 2077 CyberMP mod was officially announced only last year</a>. The team is stepping in to address the lack of an official multiplayer mode, which was <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-multiplayer-mode-was-canceled-due-to-the-games-rough-launch/">being developed by CD Projekt Red but was ultimately canceled to focus entirely on the single-player experience. </a>It's worth noting that the mod does not allow players to complete story quests together via a co-op mode. Instead, it leverages the game's mechanics to offer diverse multiplayer experiences, such as the racing and PvP events highlighted in the latest footage.</p>



<p>Hopefully, it won't take much longer for the community to experience the solid work the CyberMP mod development team is doing.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/outward-2-preview-dying-was-never-so-fun</link>
            <guid>1370497</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nine Dots Studio is hard at work on <em>Outward 2</em>, but studio founder, CEO, and Creative Director, Guillaume Boucher-Vidal, took a few moments out of his busy schedule to give us at TechRaptor a look at the current game. Giving us a tour of the new character creation, the ins and outs of Haboob, and what begins your adventure in Aurai, the preview was just the beginning. I also got to play a part of&nbsp;the title, feeling my way through the different areas you can explore. Here's all I learned in my&nbsp;<em>Outward 2</em>&nbsp;alpha preview.</p>

<h2><em>Outward 2</em>&nbsp;Alpha Preview | No Hand Holding Here</h2>

<p>I spent a significant amount of time diving into the nooks and crannies of<em> Outward 2. </em>While I can safely say no Trog is safe around me, I died more times than I can count to Recluses, Thespians, Manticores, and falling into the water. I harvested and ate more mushroom soup than anyone probably should. Through it all, I explored most of the Bellowgale, kept finding more stairways in Haboob than I thought possible, and discovered most creatures will absolutely maim you when given the opportunity.</p>

<p><em>Outward 2</em>&nbsp;is currently in alpha phase. There’s still a lot of work to be done on the title, and everything I played through can completely change by the time it’s released in the summer of 2026. I’m going to focus more on the general mechanics, how it compares to the original<em> <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="bc51a462-aeac-4113-b056-c6680d213c23" href="https://techraptor.net/games/outward" rel="nofollow">Outward</a></em>, and what is to come for the RPG.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/outward-2-playtest-save-your-house.jpg?itok=hBQ3V8ep 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/outward-2-playtest-save-your-house.jpg?itok=0e01NbTk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This also means I won’t be commenting too heavily on bugs, missing dialogue, game crashes, and other issues that are current works in progress for Nine Dots Studio. Though these issues can have an impact on your gameplay in the upcoming alpha playtest, they should be eradicated by the time launch comes around. These issues should be reported to the dev team so they can be addressed.</p>

<p>To start at the beginning, Character Creation has been significantly expanded. Not only do traits and backgrounds impact character origins, but they also affect starting stats, where you begin your adventure, recipes you inherently know, and can offer unique dialogue choices. On top of that, you’ll no longer have a potato for your face unless you want to. There are multiple options for hair style, eyebrows, face structure, acne, scars, makeup, and more.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/character-creation-outward-2-alpha-playtest.jpg?itok=pEcyV3e9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/character-creation-outward-2-alpha-playtest.jpg?itok=SE9HwAKI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>When it comes to getting into the meat of the game, there are a few mechanics that have stayed the same from <em>Outward</em>. Your health and stamina maximum decrease when you get injured, dying results in a random event bringing you somewhere else on the map, an equipped bag slows down your dodges, and some quests are timed. You'll meet NPCs from the original, and may even be saved by Gep, again.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are plenty more examples of things that have remained the same that you’ll stumble upon as you play, especially the difficult and brutal combat you’ll encounter. Many were worried that combat would begin to follow RTS mechanics, but fans can rest assured that the combat is the same as&nbsp;<em>Outward</em>. You have to unlock mana to use magic, skills are taught by trainers, and your attacks depending on how often you get to swing your weapon.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/outward-2-alpha-playtest-saved-by-gep.jpg?itok=13asAOOq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/outward-2-alpha-playtest-saved-by-gep.jpg?itok=0HXijLdL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>While you only have a single city to begin from during the playtest, there are hours worth of content you can experience. You’ll be able to take on multiple quests, explore at least three distinct areas, and visit a Leyline. If you make it back into Haboob, you'll even see the city change from when you were exiled. After playing through the region three times, spending at least 18 hours in the wilderness of the Bellowgale, I'm still discovering new areas and interactions with NPCs.</p>

<p>What’s available of the narrative has ensnared me completely. I want to know more about the Symposium and their research, see the different regions, and learn why you were framed in the first place. There are two other starting cities to play through their beginning adventure. The story is there in the right portion to not inform me about the world and my current situation, while keeping me on the hook for future narrative.</p>

<p>There’s so much left to uncover, and I am 100% eagerly awaiting <em>Outward 2</em>’s release so I can experience it all. Combat was exciting, exploration kept me on my toes, and completing objectives consistently felt rewarding. Once it releases, I plan on this game taking over my life for quite a while.</p>

<hr><p><em><strong>Outward 2</strong> was previewed on PC over the course of 20 hours with a code provided by Nine Dots Studio. All screenshots were taken during the course of the preview.</em></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/hbo-rolls-out-the-red-carpet-for-mad-men-by-leaving-the-barf-machine-in-2000649617</link>
            <guid>1370482</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Mad Men</em> is probably one of the best 10 television shows ever made. It’s certainly one of the most important. It came to define a late aughts “golden age” of TV when the internet was full of <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/mollylambert/115625706564/the-almost-complete-ml-mad-men-recaps-s1e1-smoke">show recaps and essays</a> and aspiring networks were racing to land prestige TV hits that would win awards and convince critics that movies were no longer the most important medium for visual storytelling. So it’s equally fitting, in a way, that 4K re-release of <em>Mad Men</em> on HBO includes sloppy oversights that make it emblematic of media’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/hbo-max-password-sharing-price-zaslav-warner-bros-2000624901">current enshitification</a> in the streaming era.</p> <p>The <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/mad-men-stream-hbo-max-4k-1236581005/">ultra-HD makeover</a> of AMC’s period drama about an advertising agency straddling the cultural revolution of 60s became available on HBO Max on December 1 and it includes some unique artistic choices. The most viral of those is leaving in the barf machine for one of the series’ most memorable moments. In season 1, episode 7, “Red in the Face,” Don Draper suckers his boss, Roger Sterling, into a late lunch break filled with booze and oysters and then races him up the Manhattan high-rise stairs when the elevator goes out of commission.</p>

 <p>Sterling gets back to the office just in time to puke in front of the entire agency, including important clients. It’s an important moment that underlines a bunch of conflicting fault lines within their relationship. It’s also very gross. In the new 4K version, viewers are treated to the actual puke machine that hurls clam chowder out a pipe next to Sterling’s face, as well as the stage hands deploying it. It’s beautifully absurd and also kind of undercuts the entire scene.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">the new 4K transfer of mad men on HBO somehow does not have any of the post-production edits added in, which means you get stuff like this where you can see the crew member manning the puke machine after Roger has too many oysters lmao <a href="https://t.co/HNgPRNOsla">pic.twitter.com/HNgPRNOsla</a></p> <p>— johnny (@bigrackspart7) <a href="https://twitter.com/bigrackspart7/status/1995756905755549751?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 2, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“This is hilarious, and the extra hand on the crew member’s shoulder is killing me,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/madmen/comments/1pbqafk/red_in_the_face_hbomax_4k_shows_staff_operating/">wrote</a> one commenter on Reddit. “Like someone else is giving him extra emotional support while he shoots fake vomit from a tube.” We’ve seen this sort of thing happen before, but it’s usually when <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/paddypadman.bsky.social/post/3m6z3bnqxjs2u">older shows get updated to newer aspect ratios</a> and stuff that wasn’t originally intended to be part of the scene makes it into the frame.</p>

 <p>The fact that the apparatus and its handlers weren’t scrubbed out in post-production, as they were for the original version of the show, raises bigger questions about just how carefully HBO handled the re-release of one of modern TV’s most storied series. What kind of penny-pinching apathy lets the barf machine skate through the review process unscathed, and in the first season no less?</p>

 <p>I casually started re-watching &nbsp;while doing other stuff just a couple weeks ago and made it through the first two seasons in no time. Who at Warner Bros. Discovery thought it was a good idea to bring <em>Mad Men</em> back to a major streaming platform for the first time since it left Netflix back in 2020 and not skim it for issues? Especially since it was being upscaled to 4K? If they didn’t even catch the barf machine, what else did they miss?</p> <p>Well, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/madmen/comments/1pc20pw/season_one_out_of_order_on_hbo_max/">the episode order for one</a>. At least some users, including myself, tried to watch season 1, episode 7 only to find that it had swapped places <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/madmen/comments/1pbth6b/red_in_the_face_replaced_with_5g_on_hbo/">with episode 6</a>, which had swapped places with episode 5. I guess David Zaslav didn’t want to pay someone’s nephew to sit in a room and do a final view test before releasing the 4K cut. Too busy thinking about Scrooge McDucking his way through mountains of cash if as Netflix and Skydance <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/warner-bros-discovery-new-bids-netflix-comcast-paramount-1236439442/">get into a bidding war</a> over Warner Bros.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsung-doesnt-care-about-profit-on-galaxy-tab-a9-plus-priced-like-budget-android-tablet-2000649277</link>
            <guid>1370479</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div dir="auto" data-message-author-role="assistant" data-message-id="72447a38-387f-40b8-a390-2b9e2ddb309a" data-message-model-slug="gpt-5-1">
<p data-start="0" data-end="371">With Black Friday and Cyber Monday behind us, you may think the time to save has come to an end. You couldn’t be more wrong. Lots of brands are keeping their discounts hanging around a little longer past the biggest sales event of the year. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6175/">For instance, the Samsung Galaxy Tab A9+ is currently available for a drastically reduced price of $150.</a> The Samsung tablet normally sells for $220, so this 32% discount represents a savings of $70. Get it for as low as $150 for a limited time.</p>
<p data-start="0" data-end="371">The design of the Galaxy Tab A9+ is both slim and lightweight, making it perfect for on-the-go use. It’s durable enough to withstand daily handling, whether you’re commuting, working at a café, or just moving between rooms at home.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6175/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h3 data-start="373" data-end="414">Exceptional Display and Sound Quality</h3>
<p data-start="416" data-end="960">For under $150, you get an 11″ touchscreen with an LCD display boasting a 1200p resolution and a 90 Hz refresh rate. Whether you’re streaming videos or just browsing the internet, the visuals are sharp and smooth. The tablet’s built-in speakers deliver clear, rich sound, enhanced by Dolby Atmos technology to give you “cinema-like audio your ears will love.” Now those are Samsung’s words, not mine. Marketing fluff. In practice, the only similarity between the sound when watching something on this tablet and watching something in a movie theater is that they are both indeed sound. So while it’s a bit of a stretch to compare tablet sound to a full cinema experience, it certainly provides better audio than most tablets in its class.</p>
<h3 data-start="1293" data-end="1342">Storage Options and Multitasking Capabilities</h3>
<p data-start="1344" data-end="1675">When it comes to storage, the Galaxy Tab A9+ offers two options: 64 GB in the more affordable model and 128 GB in the higher-end version. This gives you plenty of room for apps, photos, and videos. However, given the rise of streaming services, you might find that you rely more on streaming content rather than downloading media. In which case, the 64 GB model should suffice.</p>
<p data-start="1677" data-end="1996">Powered by Android OS, the tablet makes it easy to multitask and switch between apps. You can view multiple apps side by side—great for when you’re managing multiple tabs in your browser or just keeping an eye on your email while working.</p>
<p data-start="1998" data-end="2273">File transfer is also a breeze thanks to Samsung’s Quick Share feature. It allows you to easily send files to another device, whether it’s running Android or iOS. Transferring photos, documents, or videos between your devices is quick and convenient.</p>


<h3 data-start="2275" data-end="2299">Perfect for Families</h3>
<p data-start="2301" data-end="2673">One feature that parents will appreciate is the Samsung Kids app. If you’re not ready to buy a dedicated tablet for your child, the Galaxy Tab A9+ offers a safe, fun, and educational environment for younger users. With its playful interface and age-appropriate content, it’s a great way to keep kids entertained while ensuring they’re using technology in a safe way.</p>
<p data-start="2699" data-end="3001" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node=""><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6175/">If you’re looking for a deal, now is the time to grab the Samsung Galaxy Tab A9+.</a> The 64 GB model is priced at just $150 after the 32% discount. Don’t miss out on this limited-time offer, available on Amazon in this post-Cyber Monday opportunity.</p>

As a result, Square Enix has launched various projects to celebrate the classic RPG. This includes a <a href="https://www.jp.square-enix.com/music/sem/page/chrono/piano_soundscape/en/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>brand new album</u></a> featuring piano arrangements of character themes, a character popularity poll (Frog took the top spot, as reported by <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202511/59024" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Famitsu</u></a>), and <a href="https://www.jp.square-enix.com/music/sem/page/chrono/concert/30th/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>orchestral concerts</u></a> to be held in Japan next January.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, this sudden celebration of Chrono Trigger after very little fanfare about the cult classic has prompted speculation that Square Enix is leading up to a bigger reveal of a Chrono Trigger remake.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Hopes were reignited again among Japanese-speaking fans on November 30, when Yuji Horii was directly asked in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq1II1jaiuA" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>discussion program</u></a> on YouTube if all the recent Chrono Trigger 30th Anniversary projects and events are hinting that a remake is in the works. Horii did not outright deny it, responding with "I can't say," "You shouldn't ask that!" and "I'll get told off!"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This and publishing executive Kazuhiko Torishima's jokey follow-up cries of "There is! There is (a Chrono Trigger remake)!” have led to Japanese speaking fans hoping, once again, that a remake is in the works despite the fact Square Enix hasn't made any announcement. “I wonder if it will be announced next year?” <a href="https://x.com/kasago_p/status/1995458296199667729?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>users</u></a> wondered on X.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Chrono Trigger was originally released for the Super Famicom/SNES in 1995. With the involvement of Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi, Dragon Quest creator Yuji Horii, and Dragon Ball creator Akira Toriyama, the RPG is beloved by fans and is considered by many to be one of the greatest games of all time. Although an upgraded version is currently available to play through Steam and on smartphones, fans have been calling for Chrono Trigger to get the remake treatment for years.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">25 Games That Still Deserve A Sequel</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The recent Dragon Quest HD-2D remakes have also got Chrono Trigger fans hopeful about seeing the SNES game recreated in the same style. “I want to play Chrono Trigger with beautiful graphics like these!” said <a href="https://x.com/rus_08F/status/1994982553292607650?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a user</u></a> on X. “Please, Square Enix!” Official posts by Square Enix accounts about Chrono Trigger anniversary merch have also attracted similar enthusiastic <a href="https://x.com/qvjB3Fkf25tsQVV/status/1993542117134942602?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>comments</u></a> like, “If there’s a remake I’ll definitely, definitely buy it!” In November, Japanese game news site<a href="https://dengekionline.com/article/202511/56445" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u> Dengeki Online did a poll</u></a> of games readers most wanted to see get the HD-2D treatment, and Chrono Trigger topped the list.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The situation is similar to that of Final Fantasy IX, with the game’s 25th anniversary celebrations this year also <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/official-final-fantasy-9-25th-anniversary-website-set-tongues-wagging-on-potential-switch-2-nintendo-direct-remake-reveal"><u>stoking fans’ hopes</u></a> that Zidane and Garnet’s adventures are in line for the remake treatment, although in IX’s case the rumors were backed up by the infamous 2021 Nvidia leak, which showed that a FFIX remake was possibly on Square Enix’s to-do list at one point. However, it seems that for both games, the anniversary celebrations were simply a chance to revisit these classic games through events and new merch. Until an official announcement is made, all fans of both games can do is continue to express their enthusiasm for these classic RPGs to Square Enix.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Verity Townsend is a Japan-based freelance writer who previously served as editor, contributor and translator for the game news site Automaton West.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond tries to be so many different things. There were moments where I thought it might be the strongest Prime since the very first, and others where it felt like the weakest. An outdated open-world hub connects breathtaking areas that brilliantly revisit the classic first-person exploration and lock-on shooting the series is known for. Talkative companions drop a few too many hints and one-liners, but they’re redeemed by some memorable story moments and mostly charming personalities that even a crotchety Metroid fan like me warmed up to in the end. And, thankfully, Retro Studios still mostly understands it’s important to give Samus her alone time, with a relieving amount of exploration in total isolation. While some of what it attempts just doesn’t work, far more of it does, resulting in an uneven but overall impressive revival that reaches incredible heights in its best moments.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The story begins with Samus mysteriously teleporting to the planet Viewros, where she works to find a way home while also uncovering the history of the ancient Lamorn race. The hook this time around is Samus’ new psychic abilities bestowed upon her by the Lamorn. These purple-hued powers allow you to telekinetically manipulate certain objects, while also adding a new wrinkle to Samus’ standard arsenal that includes her Charge Beam, Morph Ball, bombs, and more. They lead to all sorts of different challenges that involve shifting platforms around, directing charged shots to hit multiple targets, cool momentum-based Morph Ball platforming, or searching for enough psychic energy sources to power a nearby device.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Metroid Prime 4 Beyond Switch 2 Edition Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The puzzles and suit upgrades are great overall, if a little familiar. I really enjoyed using the psychic abilities to find every last hidden item, even though they’re mostly slight remixes of returning powers rather than something truly original. I can only recall a few times where a solution felt particularly novel – but that does include one awesome cinematic moment that <em>really </em>stands out. And when we’re talking about the long-awaited continuation of one of the most acclaimed video game trilogies of all time, it’s not a major complaint to say it’s sticking relatively close to the script.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Combat also feels exactly like you’d expect from a modern return to Metroid Prime. You lock onto enemies and fire shots or missiles while strafing around aggressive monsters and machines. It’s not just a straight retread though; Samus feels amazing to control, with a swift forward and backward dodge, improved maneuverability when popping out of the Morph Ball, and snappier access to your visor, which is more useful than ever thanks to its psychic properties. You’ll also gain flashy elemental beams that are helpful in both combat and exploration (and also change the look of Samus’ arm cannon when they’re equipped, which is a nice returning detail). </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The puzzles and suit upgrades are great overall, if a little familiar.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Choosing your weapon and fine-tuning your aim is still fun all these years later despite its relative simplicity. Prime’s combat has always fared best when sparse encounters are supplemental to exploration, which is the format Prime 4 follows most of the time. It introduces new foes that require different tools to beat, like a swarm of hovering robots protecting three weak spots you need to fire a slow-motion charged shot at to destroy. The combat’s low points are when it does its best impression of a mid-2000s corridor shooter, occasionally focusing a bit too much on repetitive waves of enemies. At least those sections always end with something exciting, as the great lineup of boss battles is a nice mix of towering monsters and one-on-one shootouts. An early highlight is a giant plant protected by petals that thrashes its vines at you.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I played almost entirely with dual-stick controls on the Switch 2 Pro Controller, which also has optional motion aiming for fine tuning when locked on to an enemy, like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/splatoon-3-multiplayer-review">Splatoon</a>. This is my favorite setup, but I dabbled with the Wii-inspired separated Joy-Con control scheme, which is also a totally viable option. The Switch 2-exclusive mouse controls are functional, and it’s neat that you can swap to them on the fly just by placing your controller on a flat surface. But I don’t see many people using them given how physically awkward the Joy-Con 2 is to use as a mouse for any extended period of time, especially when the more traditional control schemes already work so effortlessly well.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Samus’ new motorcycle also controls well, and the way it’s woven into the plot feels surprisingly natural, but what you’ll actually use it for is one of Prime 4’s biggest fumbles. You’ll mainly ride the bike in Sol Valley, a desert hub that serves as the middleground between each major location on its edges, sort of like what Hyrule Field was for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/1998/11/26/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time-review">Ocarina of Time</a>. It’s mostly empty and devoid of many interesting activities, as the same few enemy types pop up when you’re riding and all you do is fire a basic projectile or charge into them to destroy them. The desert isn’t that big, so it at least doesn’t take too long to get from point A to point B. The problem is that it’s designed as if that N64 Hyrule Field saw the Great Plateau from Breath of the Wild and said, "I can do that, too!"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Almost like it’s trying to justify the motorbike’s inclusion, Prime 4 goes to great lengths to ensure you spend multiple hours riding across this drab desert just to reach the credits. It sprinkles an extremely small number of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/02/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review">Breath of the Wild</a>-like shrines on the map that house optional upgrades. The bite-sized puzzles inside those shrines are fine, but there’s absolutely no joy in discovering them when they’re just haphazardly strewn across the visually unimpressive sand, and it feels like a surface-level attempt to recapture Zelda’s open-world magic that doesn’t really work.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>A runtime-padding main objective is tied to the repetitive desert.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This wouldn’t be a huge deal, but Prime 4 ties a main objective to its repetitive desert. Samus has to collect enough green energy to preserve the history of the Lamorn civilization before it’s lost to time, which is a very cool setup. But in practice, all that entails is mindlessly driving around the desert and crashing into any green crystals you see. It’s the type of runtime-padding filler that had already outworn its welcome the <em>last </em>time a Metroid Prime game came out, and Prime 4 would be so much tighter without this quest, or even without its half-baked desert at all. It’s far from a dealbreaker since this mission is given to you very early on, meaning you can chip away at it while you’re riding to your next destination, but it’s certainly not fun regardless.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>In Prime Form</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The good news is that the places you’re riding toward are full of the strong Metroid Prime atmosphere and gameplay you came for. And Prime 4 is at its greatest when playing into the same strengths that have defined this subseries since the GameCube: lonely, haunting exploration through gorgeous, fully-realized areas that each have their own detailed backstory to uncover. Structurally, the individual maps take after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2004/11/12/metroid-prime-2-echoes-2">Prime 2</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/08/27/metroid-prime-3-corruption-review">Prime 3</a>’s more self-contained approach rather than <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2002/11/11/metroid-prime">Prime 1</a>’s interconnected spiderweb that required revisiting areas several times over with multiple entrances and exits to each. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There is some backtracking involved, of course, but each region has just one entrance from the desert, and you’ll finish <em>most </em>of its main objectives on your first visit. I was delighted to find that this format fills the traditional 3D Zelda-shaped hole in my heart, as each zone essentially acts like a huge dungeon: explore, find a key upgrade, kill the boss with it, and leave. That’s not to say it doesn’t feel like Metroid – there are a few main quests and plenty of optional items I needed to come back for later. It’s just that these two series have always shared a lot of the same DNA, and Prime 4 lands closer to the Zelda style.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Every location stands on its own, which allows Retro to give each a unique tone: sometimes Samus is completely alone and it leans hard into the tense sci-fi horror isolation of Alien, and sometimes she’s accompanied by Galactic Federation companions through more scripted scenes that call upon the action tropes of its sequel, Aliens. This constant genre-shifting across levels keeps things fresh for <em>most</em> of its roughly 15-hour runtime, at least until it’s time to finish collecting all those green energy shards.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In these dedicated areas, Prime 4 makes a case for itself as the best-looking game Nintendo has ever published. Its fantastical art direction is jaw-droppingly gorgeous at times, with incredible lighting, beautiful backgrounds, ornate architecture, and nicely detailed environments. It sounds great, too, with dramatic choral melodies fused with electronic sounds that fit Prime’s atmosphere extremely well. Samus’ iconic visor effects return, like the way it fogs up in extreme temperatures, or how rain droplets patter against it in a storm. Its art direction goes hand-in-hand with its world design, as the way rooms are intentionally framed upon blasting open their doors is often spectacular. To be clear, Prime 4 doesn’t reach the visual heights of the best-looking games on PC or other consoles, but a game this stunning running at a flawless 4K 60 fps on Switch 2 – with a smooth 120 fps option that lowers the resolution – is a huge step forward for Nintendo. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some locations stand alongside my favorites in the series, and when you’re methodically tiptoeing your way through each one, Prime 4 more than lives up to the trilogy’s legacy. Without giving too much away, an early highlight is Volt Forge, a gothic, futuristic factory set to a powerful rock soundtrack. It’s impressive how its rich history is intertwined with its level design: you <em>can</em> just work your way through each room and enjoy the intricate layouts at face value, or you can scan every machine and learn why they exist and what they were used for, which provides fascinating context that makes complete sense when you see it all in motion. These places feel big, important, and carefully plotted out. That worldbuilding remains an incredibly special piece of Metroid Prime.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each region is fairly linear, with usually just one correct way to go, even if multiple choices are presented. When you stumble into a room with three doors, for example, it’s most likely that one is a save room, one is blocked until you get a new upgrade, and one is the way forward. I actually think this choice suits the Prime series very well, allowing it to focus more on mood, handcrafted tension, and distinct sequences, but it’s a very different flavor than the nonlinear design the Metroid series helped pioneer more than 30 years ago. I never felt <em>truly</em> lost, even when poking around its most freeform parts. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Prime 4 makes a case for itself as the best-looking game Nintendo has ever published.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">A positive outcome of this decision is that Prime 4 feels like the best entry point into this series for new folks, easing them in to better prepare them for something like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metroid-prime-remastered-review">Prime Remastered</a>’s more complex labyrinth. It also smartly follows in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metroid-dread-review-nintendo-switch">Metroid Dread</a>’s footsteps by letting you mark your map to remember which rooms have powerups you can’t get yet, streamlining the endgame collectible cleanup.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>You’ve Got a Friend</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Most regions contain one of several Galactic Federation companions who temporarily travel with Samus before heading back to base camp. Each has their own personality and light backstory, ranging from a nerdy engineer who can barely handle a gun, to a sniper with a broken leg who is questioning his decision to join the military. Thankfully, these characters are far less intrusive than I initially feared after a particularly obnoxious tutorial section I saw in my preview demo. Their limited presence means they don’t have amazing character arcs – a more than acceptable side effect – but they do have mostly likeable personalities and provide a few highlights that give Prime 4 its own identity. I have to admit I smiled when a Samus superfan geeked out after seeing her idol transform into the Morph Ball, and it helps that the great voice acting and facial animations are another step forward for Nintendo. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">They could still use some work in the writing department, however, as they often fall back on well-worn clichés or commentary that feels out of place in Metroid, like, “There’s too many of ‘em!” during an action scene, or cracks like, “Piece of cake! Red velvet cake,” upon solving a puzzle. I’m grateful that they generally don’t outright spoil specific puzzle solutions, but they do chime in a little more often than I’d like about where to go or what to do next. Specialist Myles MacKenzie is never as overbearing as in his initial introduction, but he does frequently contact Samus on the radio to tell you the general area you need to search for your next upgrade. Prime 4 lets you toggle on-screen tips that nudge you in the right direction, so I really wish I could turn companion hints off, too. When you’re with someone on a mission – which is a major part of the campaign – certain aspects can feel outdated as well, like waiting for someone to help you open a door, hearing repetitive combat dialogue lines, or reviving them whenever they go down.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Logan Ranks the Metroid Series</h3><p>I reviewed Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, and it's great! Here are my favorite 2D and 3D Metroid games, ranked.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Prime 4 keeps these portions in check by smartly knowing when to leave you alone entirely, with multiple lengthy segments where Samus loses radio signal and no one can bother her. You spend over half of the runtime on your own, so if you’re a longtime Metroid fan who craves ambience and isolation, there’s plenty of that here, too. Overall, the companions are tolerable: while there are still several moments that probably would’ve been more epic if Samus was alone, their inclusion does lead to some fun cinematic events that wouldn’t be possible otherwise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One character who I actually wish was included more is Sylux, Prime 4’s big bad that doesn’t play nearly as big a role in the story as I expected based on Nintendo’s marketing. It’s another underdeveloped part of Prime 4 – Sylux’s amiibo figure has more detail than his personality – and it feels like he’s only here out of reluctant obligation to Prime 3’s post-credits tease from 2007. Instead, this story focuses far more on Lamorn history, which is very fascinating on its own, but doesn’t entirely make up for the disappointing feeling that something’s missing.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-review]]></content:encoded>

<p>That's par for the course at this point. FromSoftware is notorious for releasing DLC that expands on its games with an even higher level of challenge.</p>
<p>Still, director Junya Ishizaki has discussed the difficulties of balancing the game for both casual players and experts, based on player feedback.</p>

<p>"The main takeaway we had post-release was just there was a lot of trouble trying to get the balancing right," Ishizaki told <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-forsaken-hollows-dlc-has-reignited-my-interest/1100-6536543/">Gamespot</a>.</p>
<p>"I think balancing is just so subjective, so a lot of our thoughts post-release working up to the DLC were how can we get the balancing in mind with what we were initially envisioning, and also with that balancing set, how can we take a different approach and devise new enemies, new characters, and stuff like that to play into that and utilise the new balancing that we are working with."</p><p>The studio didn't want the game to be "so hard that new players can't get into it" but even veterans required time to figure out the intricacies of Nightreign. "So whenever people who have played the main game extensively go into the DLC content, they'll be able to have a bit of that feeling like they had when they first played Nightreign, where there's still a bit that they're trying to figure out," said Ishizaki.</p>
<p>The Forsaken Hollows is "definitely a little bit harder," he admitted, "but it's not ridiculous or anything like that, but that's still within what we would consider to be a fair challenge."</p>
<p>Perhaps the most infamous DLC for its difficulty was Elden Ring's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Shadow of the Erdtree</a>, with the final boss in particular imposing a massive challenge.</p>
<p>Ishizaki also discussed the influence of that DLC on The Forsaken Hollows, even if it's not directly intentional. For instance, the new Shifting Earth event has more verticality than previous events, just as Shadow of the Erdtree was more vertical than Elden Ring.</p><p>"[The] idea behind that was that the original map was definitely very horizontally-focused, and when looking at that through the lens of working on DLC, we were thinking where else [was there] to go but up, right?" said Ishizaki. "We can add verticality to this and do it in a way that doesn't detract from the horizontal aspect of the map. So that was where that came from; trying to figure out how we can add to it in such a way that it expands upon the verticality.</p>
<p>"It's one of those things [where] a lot of our staff have also been playing Shadow of the Erdtree as the development for Nightreign has been going on. So there's probably a little bit of influence there, but I don't think [Erdtree's influence is] necessarily intentional. It might even be almost like subconscious, but there's definitely, I think, a bit of that for sure."</p>

<p>The Forsaken Hollows also adds new poison swamp areas, which are surprisingly missing from the base game.</p>
<p>"We're definitely aware of the [swamp] meme," said Ishizaki. "It's not like there's a rule or any sort of policy here where it's like we have to have a swamp in there, but it always seems to be [that before you realise] someone's come up with the idea, it's already sort of in there, and it's just sort of taken a life of its own."</p>
<p>The Forsaken Hollows launches this week on 4th December, adding two new Nightfarers to play as - the Scholar and the Undertaker - along with other additions, including the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreigns-the-forsaken-hollows-dlc-will-see-an-iconic-dark-souls-boss-return">return of an iconic Dark Souls boss</a>.</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/one-of-the-best-looking-games-on-switch-2-digital-foundry-dives-into-metroid-prime-4</link>
            <guid>1370428</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>

<p>If you can believe it, we are very, <em>very</em> nearly at the official launch of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>. It's a cross-generation release, but we always knew that this was going to be a big player for the Switch 2, making the most of the new hardware's beefed-up specs to squeeze the most out of the space adventure. The question is, how does it hold up?</p>
<p>Our good friends over at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVJ_P6dzFg">Digital Foundry</a> are here to answer just that. In the above video, the tech experts break down everything you need to know about the game's performance, and we've got the full rundown for you to read through below. So, let's dive right into it.</p>
<p>Kicking things off with the visuals, DF states that the game is "truly beautiful". With crisp visor reflections, rain droplets and light peeking through cracks, the game is packed with more detail than ever before, and it's used to great effect.</p>
<p>In terms of performance, we all know that MP4 offers two different options — 'Performance' and 'Quality' — though, according to Digital Foundry, things are a bit more nuanced in actuality. In Quality, the visor 'frame' and main image appear to be rendered separately, and while the real meat of what you're looking at "generally does read as a native 4K image", it's still "very much 1440p" (1080p in handheld). The sharpness is right where you'd want it, though, with DF calling it "the best image quality I've seen from a Nintendo game on Switch 2 thus far".</p>
<p>'Performance' mode drops the resolution down to 1080p (720p in handheld), giving everything a slightly softer look. That said, the presentation remains "sharp enough" and is still sharper and clearer than <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_remastered">Metroid Prime Remastered</a> was on Switch 1 by a "significant margin".</p>
<p>But what about the much-discussed frame rate? You'll be pleased to hear that the 120fps promise (in the relevant mode) is delivered on, locking to 120, and holding it "with complete consistency" — bar the very odd, tiny dip when riding around the open world. And yes, the same level of smoothness applies to the 60fps mode.</p>
<p>The truly "mind-blowing" feature, according to DF, is the HDR, which stacks up as "one of the finest HDR presentations I've seen in years, standing shoulder-to-shoulder with the very best". So, expect those highlights to pop, and the shadows to deepen in docked. The same can't be said for handheld, mind you, where the Switch 2's native screen can't keep up.</p>
<p>And finally, the load times are right where you'd want 'em, with door opening times much reduced from the previous entries.</p>
<p>You can find the full tech review in the above video or over on <a href="https://www.digitalfoundry.net/">Digital Foundry's new site</a>. As for us, we were absolutely blown away by MP4, calling it "quite possibly the boldest, most well-realised Metroid game to date" in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">our review</a> — read all about it below.</p>

<p>Reviews for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> are live, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">including ours</a>, although you may have noticed that it's focused on the Switch 2 Edition, and MP4 is <em>also</em> launching on Switch 1.</p>
<p>If you're looking for impressions on the original Switch version, they are coming - please bear with us. We weren't able to test on the older hardware prior to the review embargo, but we do now have access and we'll be posting our Switch 1 review just as soon as we're able to give it a thorough look.</p>
<p>It's been a long ol' wait since the game was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2017/06/metroid_prime_4_confirmed_for_nintendo_switch_but_retro_studios_isnt_involved">revealed back in 2017</a>, and with development restarting from scratch <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/01/metroid_prime_4_development_scrapped_will_be_restarted_alongside_retro_studios">in 2019</a>, everyone's understandably itching to find out every last detail about how Retro Studios' return to the Metroid universe holds up <em>on the hardware it was announced for</em>.</p>
<p>The NS2 Edition cart also works on your original Switch, so we're as eager as you to see how it compares to the 4K, 120fps version Ollie's been enjoying.</p>
<p>So, watch this space, and we'll get our verdict live as soon as we can.</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/games/835325/metroid-prime-4-review-nintendo-switch</link>
            <guid>1370422</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>When <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em> is good, it’s <em>good</em>. The latest in Nintendo’s sci-fi exploration franchise, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22710468/metroid-dread-review-nintendo-switch">the first since <em>Metroid Dread</em> in 2021</a>, <em>Beyond</em> captures the moody sense of isolation and discovery that has been so core to <em>Metroid</em> since it debuted in 1986. Those quiet moments truly make you feel all alone on a harsh alien planet, punctuated by intense action set pieces and some incredible boss fights. At its peak, the game is among the best in the series. The problem is that Nintendo added a whole bunch of stuff on top of that — including chatty companion characters and a boring, empty hub world — which gets in the way.</p><p>Despite the 4 in the title, <em>Beyond</em> is a largely standalone experience. The latest in bounty hunter Samus Aran’s many adventures starts in the midst of a war with some space pirates, before she finds herself mysteriously transported to a faraway world. The planet is typical <em>Metroid</em> stuff: Once home to an advanced civilization, it’s now covered with ancient technology lying in slumber, and all kinds of dangerous creatures. Early on Samus learns that the only way to get home is to find a series of “transporter keys” and take them to a giant tower. Oh, and the dead alien race, which look like talking axolotls, view her as a chosen one meant to fix the mistakes that led to their downfall, which expands her quest even further.</p><div><div><p id="got-any-burning-metroid-prime-4-questions"><h2>Got any burning Metroid Prime 4 questions?</h2></p></div><p>Join me and <em>Verge</em> games reporter Ash Parrish for a subscriber-exclusive AMA on December 3rd at 1PM ET. We won’t get into story spoilers for the long-gestating game, but we can tell you if mouse controls are any good.</p></div><p>Doing all of this involves the standard <em>Metroid</em> formula. You start out with only a few abilities — a gun and the ability to turn into a little ball — and steadily gain new ones, which let you further explore. The joy in a <em>Metroid</em> game comes from unraveling its intricately designed levels, spaces full of secrets and connections between them that usually only become apparent once you have the right ability or knowledge. You’ll regularly see doors that can only be opened with a weapon you don’t have yet, or ledges too high to reach with your current abilities.</p><p>Rather than mess with what works, <em>Beyond</em> just does it really well. The levels both challenge your brain and are absolutely dripping with atmosphere. Sometimes that comes in the form of small details, like scurrying alien bugs or packs of wolves that watch your every movement. Other times, it’s more elaborate. In one abandoned factory level, you wander through eerie hallways filled with powered-down security bots. It’s very unsettling, and later, after you solve some complex technical challenges to get things up and running, the mood shifts completely as the bots come to life and attack you. <em>Beyond</em> has an excellent balance between solo exploration and action, with a handful of large-scale battles, including some white-knuckle boss fights. It also adds a few new tools to Samus’ arsenal with psychic powers that let her manipulate certain objects and slow down time to bend shots around obstacles.</p><p>If that’s exactly what <em>Beyond</em> was, it would be a brilliant game, and a welcome addition to the <em>Metroid</em> canon, one that was worth <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/13/15782806/metroid-prime-4-nintendo-switch-announced-e3-2017">the near decadelong wait from announcement to launch</a>. Unfortunately, Nintendo also decided to add some new and very un-<em>Metroid</em> elements to the game that dampen the experience.</p><p>First up are the new companion characters. It’s not like Samus has always worked solo — she previously had an AI guide in <em>Metroid Fusion</em>, for instance — but here the other characters are much more involved. Over the course of the game you’ll discover a handful of soldiers who were similarly transported to the planet, and you’ll spend much of the game working alongside them to get home.</p><p>This has a big impact on the game: While the story is usually background material in <em>Metroid</em>, where you can dig in as much or as little as you like, here it’s much more present because Samus isn’t alone. She’s still a silent protagonist, but her new crew — each of whom is a generic sci-fi archetype, ranging from nerdy gearhead to gruff sergeant — can be pretty chatty. This is mostly relegated to cutscenes in which people are constantly risking their life for Samus, though they’ll regularly chime in over the radio to provide hints as well. The dialogue doesn’t overwhelm the experience, but it also doesn’t add much to it; the characters are so forgettable that I found myself tuning them out.</p><p>More frustrating is the new hub area. While much of your time in <em>Beyond</em> is spent in those well-designed levels, connecting each of them is a vast expanse of desert, which you traverse on an <em>Akira</em>-style motorcycle. At first, it’s very cool; blazing across a highway while heavy metal blares and lightning strikes gothic alien towers in the distance is an excellent introduction to the bike. But eventually it becomes clear that the desert is a bare and boring place. There are some basic shrines where you can solve simple puzzles to unlock new power-ups, and some space junk and other points of interest to investigate. Mostly, though, you’re speeding across an empty place while getting stuck in tedious vehicular battles.</p><p>This problem becomes even worse as you progress because of the game’s structure, which necessitates lots of backtracking. So every time you need to go back to an area to use one of your new power-ups or talk to a character, it means a long trek through nothing. The game eventually devolves into an unavoidable collect-a-thon near the end, which really kills <em>Beyond</em>’s momentum as you approach the conclusion.</p><p>These parts of the game are especially frustrating because otherwise <em>Beyond</em> does so much well. While Metroidvania has become an inescapable genre, the <em>Prime</em> games are still unmatched when it comes to bringing that style of exploration-heavy gameplay into a 3D world. <em>Beyond</em> is a fitting follow-up, but you really have to push through some drab and unnecessary additions to see its best moments.</p><p><sub>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond <em>launches on December 4th on the Nintendo Switch and Switch 2.</em></sub></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTk3"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Webster</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/835325/metroid-prime-4-review-nintendo-switch]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/tech/836168/wooting-60he-v2-keyboard-gaming-hands-on</link>
            <guid>1370419</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Over the past couple of years, I’ve tried to switch to many different gaming keyboards and always ended up back with a Wooting 60HE. Wooting changed PC gaming with the 60HE, popularizing the use of Hall effect switches and a Rapid Trigger system that speeds up how quickly you can activate keys. Now it’s back with a v2 that upgrades the best gaming keyboard to improve its sound and feel.</p><p>I’ve been testing the $239.99 Wooting 60HE v2 over the past week, and I’m impressed with my early hands-on, but I don’t know if I would rush to upgrade from an original modded 60HE.</p><p>The Wooting 60HE v2 has the same 60 percent layout as the original, so there are no dedicated function keys or an F row. There are also no arrow keys, but Wooting has a clever “mod tap” system that lets you enable arrow keys in the right shift section of the board.</p><div data-product-filter="" id="product-card-dmcyOnByb2R1Y3Q6ODM2MTg0"><p><span>$<!-- -->240</span></p><div><p>Wooting’s 60HE v2 is an upgrade to the popular 60HE. It has true 8K polling, a new closed-bottom switch, and an aluminum case that together improve the sound and feel.</p></div></div><p>The big changes with the 60HE v2 are all about what comes as standard now. Wooting has really focused on improving the sound and feel of the v2 so it’s a lot closer to a modded 60HE with custom switches, dampening, and more.</p><p>Wooting has ditched the screws for the v2, opting for a pressure fit instead. I’ve been testing the aluminum case that looks and feels a lot like the alumaze cases Wooting sold as optional extras for the 60HE. The case includes a new silicon dampening option, or the regular EDPM foam.</p><p>I felt like the silicon option dampened the sound of the switches too much, so I preferred the EDPM instead. You can also just not use any dampening if you prefer that type of sound. Wooting is also using PET film to prevent the switches from making contact with the PCB, and a factory tape mod on the rear of the board. Both of these help improve the overall sound.</p><p>The switches on the 60HE v2 have also been upgraded to Wooting’s new “Lekker Tikken” switch, a closed-bottom Hall effect switch with a 4.0mm actuation range. Hall effect switches use a magnet so the board can track how far a switch has been pressed, but the sound profile has typically been worse than Cherry MX-style switches.</p><p>Wooting’s new switches have definitely improved the sound profile, but they use a longer 22mm spring that makes the switches feel a little heavier than the Geon Raws I’ve been using for months. I can usually adapt to different switches after a few hours of use, but I found myself quickly moving back to the Geon Raws as I preferred both the sound profile and feel. Wooting’s switches are still a great default switch though, and the stem wobble of the original switches has been greatly improved here.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>The new Lekker Tikken switches.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>The upgraded 60HE v2 is also faster than the original model, thanks to true 8kHz polling and a low input latency of just 0.125ms. That’s the same latency as the 8kHz USB polling on Wooting’s larger <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/18/24247911/wooting-80he-keyboard-gaming-hands-on">80HE that I reviewed last year</a>. I don’t think you’d actually notice this latency improvement unless you measured it, but it’s nice to have either way.</p><p>I opted to test the split-spacebar 60HE v2, and I’m still a bit undecided on whether I like it. It allows you to have three keys where you’d normally only have the single space bar. I like the idea in principle, but I found myself constantly hitting the button in the middle of the split space bar.</p><p>I found it better to assign that to a function key that would have to be paired with another key to activate, but if you can get used to this layout, then having that extra button right next to the space bar could certainly be useful in competitive games. The right-hand side of the split felt a little too far to reach to make it useful in a pinch, though.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>The aluminum case comes in silver or black.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>The biggest issue with a split-spacebar for me is just the lack of keycap sets that support it, but if you’re happy with the double-shot PBT ones that Wooting supplies, then it’s less of an issue.</p><p>Overall, the 60HE v2 feels like a solid upgrade to the original, but it’s not a revelation like Wooting’s first Hall effect keyboards were. The thing I like the most about the 60HE v2 is that it feels like a fully modded keyboard out of the box, so you don’t have to play around with different switch options unless you want to, and the sound dampening options are super easy to switch between, thanks to the friction fit.</p><p>At $239.99, it’s a premium PC gaming keyboard, especially now that Wooting has competition that has finally caught up. Logitech, Razer, SteelSeries, and plenty of Chinese brands now have more affordable Hall effect boards that aim to match Wooting both in terms of hardware and software. None are good enough to dethrone the 60HE v2, but if you’re on a tighter budget, then there are plenty of more affordable options now.</p><p>As I have a pair of fully modded 60HE keyboards, I’m not upgrading to the 60HE v2 just yet, but if you’ve been put off doing mods yourself and want the best gaming keyboard available today, then the 60HE v2 will be well worth the investment.</p><p><em>Photography by Tom Warren / The Verge</em></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTY0"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Tom Warren</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/836168/wooting-60he-v2-keyboard-gaming-hands-on]]></content:encoded>

              <p>In a suitably festive <a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/1995175995670777942?s=20">Holiday-themed trailer for <i>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</i>’</a> final 2025 updates, a cute and cryptic teaser for some upcoming content briefly interrupted associate game director Simon Lemay-Comtois’ rundown of everything coming to the stealthy ninja sim. Eagle-eyed fans of the series, however, were quick to point out a few interesting tidbits, namely the presence of what looks like a pirate ship.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Tis the season ❄️</p> <p>Free goodies will be waiting for you in your Hideout every day in December up until the 25th 🎁!<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AssassinsCreedShadows?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#AssassinsCreedShadows</a> <a href="https://t.co/ECo0kiD7yp">pic.twitter.com/ECo0kiD7yp</a></p> <p>— Assassin's Creed (@assassinscreed) <a href="https://twitter.com/assassinscreed/status/1995175995670777942?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 30, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Pirate ships are nothing new to <i>Assassin’s Creed</i>, of course. Perhaps one of the most celebrated titles in the long-running series, <i>Assassin’s Creed IV Black Flag</i>, was all about the life of a blade-wielding pirate named Edward Kenway. A remake of the classic entry has been rumored for some time, with indications that <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-ubisoft-sold-ai-2000646161">it might arrive sometime before spring of 2026</a>.</p>

While it’s a very busy image featuring murky objects in the distance and strange, abstract bright lights, it certainly looks like a ship. <a href="https://x.com/acinterface/status/1995193993760755720?s=20">Have a gander for yourself</a>:</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Wait a minute, that looks like a pirate ship, or are my eyes playing tricks on me?

Other folks on the internet are busy <a href="https://x.com/AccessTheAnimus/status/1995225976490627123?s=20">trying to crack the details</a> behind some of the text that appears briefly in the video. So far, there’s nothing definitive.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The recent Modern Day teaser for Assassin's Creed Shadows seems to imply a new puzzle that will involve some "Collective Decryption" as it happened for the previous Rift! <a href="https://t.co/ZD47FsZz3X">pic.twitter.com/ZD47FsZz3X</a></p> <p>— Access The Animus (@AccessTheAnimus) <a href="https://twitter.com/AccessTheAnimus/status/1995225976490627123?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 30, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><i>Assassin’s Creed</i> loves its mysteries, so we’ll have to wait to know for sure if there’s some piracy shenanigans on the way.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Nintendo has provided game file sizes for Metroid Prime 4: Beyond on Switch and Switch 2, letting console owners know how much space they need to download the first-person adventure game. On Switch 2, Metroid Prime 4 comes in at an estimated 31.6GB, while the original Switch version only takes up 26.3GB, per <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition-switch-2/">the Nintendo Store</a>. Intriguingly, though, the eShop accessed via Switch 2 showcases the Switch edition as taking up 28.9GB.</p><p dir="ltr">Regardless, it makes sense Metroid Prime 4 has a bigger download size on Switch 2, since <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-will-get-upgraded-original-switch-games-including-metroid-prime-4-and-pokemon-legends/1100-6530551/">the game offers 4K visuals</a> in quality mode docked and 120fps in performance mode docked. There is also HDR support <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-on-switch-2-will-let-you-swap-to-mouse-controls-on-the-fly/1100-6530602/">and mouse controls</a>, courtesy of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-confirms-switch-2-joy-cons-have-mouse-like-functionality/1100-6530529/">the Switch 2 Joy-Con controllers</a>. Both versions will launch this Thursday, December 4.</p>

      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The wait for the game has been almost two decades in the making, as Metroid Prime 3 released in 2007. Additionally, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/e3-2017-metroid-prime-4-announced-for-nintendo-swi/1100-6450893/">Metroid Prime 4 was originally unveiled at E3 2017</a>, months after the original Switch launched. Bandai Namco was initially developing the game, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4s-development-restarted-with-retro-/1100-6464593/">Retro Studios was brought on to reboot Metroid Prime 4</a> in early 2019. Retro was the studio behind the first three Metroid Prime games.</p><p dir="ltr">Nintendo revealed a new trailer for the game in November, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-metroid-prime-4-trailer-has-space-battles-samus-flips-and-an-akira-slide/1100-6535914/">showing off space battles, Samus flips, and even an Akira slide</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Helldivers is preparing to launch a dropship to a theater near you via an upcoming film adaptation, and it just landed a big-time director. Justin Lin, best known for directing several installments in the Fast &amp; Furious franchise, will helm the project.</p><p>Per <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/helldivers-movie-justin-lin-sony-1236438370/"><em>The Hollywood Reporter</em></a>, the Helldivers movie comes from Sony Pictures and PlayStation Productions, with Justin Lin’s Perfect Storm Entertainment helping produce. Lin’s credits include directing most of the installments in the Fast &amp; Furious series, starting with <em>The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift</em> (2006) and continuing with <em>Fast &amp; Furious</em> (2009), <em>Fast Five</em> (2011), <em>Fast &amp; Furious 6</em> (2013), <em>F9</em> (2021), and <em>Fast X</em> (2023).</p><p>According to <em>THR</em>’s sources, Lin is not a gamer and is leveraging this in his pitch to “find the humanity in the characters and weave timely themes into the story, while building out a world and mythology.” The script for <em>Helldivers</em> is penned by Gary Dauberman, the writer behind the It and Annabelle franchises, as well as <em>The Nun</em>. Dauberman also wrote this year's <em>Until Dawn</em>, so <em>Helldivers</em> will be his second video game adaptation.</p>

      <p>Helldivers 2</p>
  
</article>

<p>Given that Helldivers is essentially a video game version of the cult classic film <em>Starship Troopers</em>, turning it into a movie does feel like the snake eating its tail. Helldivers centers on soldiers hailing from Super Earth, an uber-patriotic managed democracy, who defend the planet in an intergalactic war against alien bugs, as well as killer robots and other threats. The first game was released for the PlayStation 4 in 2015, and Helldivers 2 arrived on PlayStation 5 in 2024 to widespread acclaim and popularity.</p><p>The Helldivers movie does not have a specific release date or window. In the meantime, check out our reviews for <a href="https://gameinformer.com/games/helldivers/b/playstation4/archive/2015/03/03/helldivers-review-game-informer.aspx">Helldivers</a> and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/helldivers-2/bullet-heaven">Helldivers 2</a>.

            <p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hideo-kojima">Hideo Kojima</a> is certainly a busy guy. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a> might be out the way, but the famed game designer still has his plate full with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojima-teases-xbox-horror-od-with-enigmatic-first-trailer">Xbox horror OD</a>, and beyond that, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojimas-metal-gear-like-physint-is-still-so-early-in-development-hes-currently-working-on-it-all-by-myself">Metal Gear spiritual successor Physint</a>. Then there's his spirited social media presence, his regular phone calls with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/geoff-keighley">Geoff Keighley</a>, and now it, turns out, a swerve into Disney voice acting as he takes on the role of a mole.
</p>
<p>
More specifically, Kojima has been cast as Paul Moldebrandt in the Japanese dub of Disney's Zootropolis 2, taking over from Josh Gad (Frozen's Olaf), who plays the character in the west. And if you're wondering how Kojima got involved, Famitsu <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202512/59427">reports</a> he was directly asked to play Zootopia Police Department's mole role by the movie's director, Jared Bush.

<figcaption>Here's the latest teaser for Kojima's OD.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHCqxLtwy5g" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
Speaking to Famitsu (via Google Translate), Kojima said he accepted the role "without hesitation" after being approached, noting that while he's had "experience with cameos in live-action films and games" Zootopia 2 marks his first time dubbing an animated feature film, "and it's from Disney, of all places!"
</p><p>
Describing the original Zootopia as his "favourite film", he explained he "only took part in a small scene [for the sequel], but even at the time of recording, the level of detail was impressive." And while the recording process "went smoothly", Kojima noted he "learned a lot from the experience of actually acting. It made me realise how much attention voice actors pay to basic things like turning the pages of the script and noise".
</p>
<p>
Kojima, of course, has been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojima-ponders-advancing-age-and-how-long-he-can-stay-creative-as-death-stranding-studio-enters-crunch">pondering his advancing years in recent times</a>, noting back in January that he "can't help but think" about how much longer he'll be able to stay creative. "I want to keep going for the rest of my life," he added, "but is it 10 more years? 20? Every day feels like I'm racing against the clock." But those concerns don't appear to be slowing him down; currently in the works is Xbox-exclusive horror OD, which he's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/like-marmite-hideo-kojima-says-you-will-either-love-or-hate-od">previously described</a> as "something totally different" and people are going to either "love it or hate it".

            <p>Another Mega Evolution has been revealed ahead of the Mega Dimension DLC for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-legends-z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, this time for a fan-favourite 'mon.</p>
<p>What's more, a classic Legendary will also be making an appearance.</p>
<p>To recap, the DLC will be released on 10th December and expands the story due to spatial distortions across Lumiose City, which appear to be resulting in more Mega Evolutions - superpowered versions of Pokémon.</p>

<p>Mega Lucario Z has now been announced as part of the DLC, with the fighting/steel type sporting a new fringe and colour scheme.</p>
<p>Now, Lucario already has a Mega Evolution in Z-A, but the DLC will include this new Mega Lucario Z variant. Z Mega Evolutions require less time to initiate moves but use much more power, so are better suited to quick battles.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the iconic Mewtwo will also be making an appearance in Pokémon Legends: Z-A. The game now has an extra side mission available, where players will receive a Mewtwonite X stone and Mewtwonite Y stone as mystery gifts.</p>

            <link>https://aftermath.site/how-do-we-relationship-yuri-manga-tamifull-viz-media/</link>
            <guid>1370389</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>There are countless ways to write romance manga. The least compelling are those that abruptly conclude the moment the central would-be couple finally gets together, as if all the effort—the meet-cute, the yearning, the indirect-kiss embarrassment, the interrupted fireworks confession, the euphoric kiss or handholding—was simply a prelude to a “happily ever after” with clear skies and no road bumps ahead.&nbsp;</p><p>These kinds of manga treat their relationships as if the chase were the only interesting part, not the teeter-tottering of a couple building a life together. Time and again, these stories end with the tacit assurance that simply being together—like a child deciding their favorite food will forever be mac and cheese because it was their first—guarantees happiness, offering no proof beyond a wedding photo and a couple of kids.&nbsp;</p><p>Tamifull’s <a href="https://www.viz.com/vizmanga/chapters/how-do-we-relationship?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>How Do We Relationship?</u></em></a><em> </em>is different.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Tamifull/Viz Media</span></figcaption></figure><p>Tamifull’s serialized manga—loosely adapted from her earlier web comics—dives headlong into what unfolds when a lesbian couple comes together out of convenience, endures the storm of hard-earned and battle-tested love, and ultimately emerges as people worth rooting for far beyond the easy cheer of “yay, gay.”</p><figure><figcaption><span>Tamifull/Viz Media</span></figcaption></figure><p>The series focuses on Miwa, an introverted, soft-spoken queer college-aged woman, who meets a new, outgoing, outspoken woman friend, Saeko. Like stand users in <em>JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure</em>, being among the only queer (yet not totally out) people in their growing friend group (expedited by the onboarding process of getting drunk first), they joke around their way into becoming a couple. In its early chapters, much of the story centers on the couple's unsuccessful efforts to hide their obvious relationship from friends, only to be asked questions by straight classmates that reduce them to either exoticism or latent prejudice—common experiences for many queer people from close friends and family who see their identity as just a phase.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Tamifull/Viz Media</span></figcaption></figure><p>My early gripe with <em>How Do We Relationship?</em> was mainly that Miwa was a whiny pushover and Saeko was a pervy asshole, and I didn’t enjoy seeing them tiptoe over eggshells around each other. The foundation of their relationship was the constitution of a Nature Valley bar crumbling into a mess right out of the wrapper. The excitement had faded, and it felt like the effort wasn’t worth it whenever real problems and insecurities started to surface. But the sex was good, and they cared about each other enough to fear losing each other, so that was enough until it wasn’t.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Tamifull/Viz Media</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Spoilers for that.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Eventually, the two break up in what I’d call the first act of the series’ three-act-in-medias-res structure, and it's really messy. Like, I’m talking “go see your first crush whom I’m totally not insecure that you might cheat on me with, confess to them, get rejected, and then spiral into a toxic fuckbuddy relationship with me where we’re slaves to our carnal desires but still can’t bring ourselves to talk to each other as people” kind of bad. It reads like a slow-motion car crash.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Tamifull/Viz Media</span></figcaption></figure><p>Over time, though, they drift into being closer than ever as friends. They settle into a rhythm as playfully catty exes, trading barbs only a close friend who has the jester’s privilege of uttering without swinging at the gallows can. At the same time, each tries to spark new romances while carrying the trauma their own relationship left behind. And that’s not even counting the familial and platonic ties they still have to wrestle with, along with all the societal prejudice. Still, they stumble through their own attempts to make new relationships <em>technically </em>work while resigning themselves to existing perpendicular to one another forever.&nbsp;</p><p>When one is floundering, the other seems to be thriving—or at least pretending to. Ultimately, Miwa and Saeko want to be in as good a spot as they perceive the other to be, yet they can’t help but see through each other’s bullshit and “grass is greener” posturing. Yet, despite having proverbial roaches in their own homes, they are the only ones able to call each other out and, in their own way, help each other through whatever unspoken relationship woes plague their houses.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Tamifull/Viz Media</span></figcaption></figure><p>By this point, the series snuck up and stood alongside Ai Yazawa’s <a href="https://www.fanbyte.com/legacy/nana-teaches-readers-how-to-mourn-a-friendship?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Nana</u></em></a> and Veritable Joy Studios’ <a href="https://kotaku.com/validate-queer-dating-game-person-of-color-romance-1849480800?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>ValiDate: Struggling Singles in Your Area</u></em></a>, other brutally honest examinations of love and relationships in my personal pantheon. After a while, I began joining in on months-old forum posts, witnessing the relationships Saeko and Miwa built become a reflection of my own unsuccessful, shaky connections. All because Tamifull challenged the genre’s typical romantic clichés and was brave enough to offer readers something genuine to think about.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Tamifull/Viz Media</span></figcaption></figure><p>This story goes beyond their college days, following the two women from uncertain university years into just as uncertain adulthood as they navigate the roguelike hellscape of job hunting while dealing with the fires of their own relationships. Along the way, the manga becomes more complex as it sheds light on the unspoken insecurities that relationships sweep under the rug, causing them to fester and eventually explode.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Tamifull/Viz Media</span></figcaption></figure><p>Brutal insecurities like Saeko’s need to make herself smaller—throwing herself into people-pleasing despite being a pessimist who doesn’t want every gripe to seem like a major crisis—while still wanting to be relied upon by her new partner, even as she struggles to express when she needs help. Or Miwa’s worry that her recently-discovered sexual awakening and high sex drive might cause her new partner to see her as disgusting. Inversely, the exhaustion Miwa’s new partner feels from routinely being asked for sex—especially when she doesn’t believe that’s the only way to have fun together—can leave both parties feeling like they are compromising themselves just to keep their relationship going.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Tamifull/Viz Media</span></figcaption></figure><p>In that same vein, and to my surprise, <em>How Do We Relationship?</em> explored the nesting doll of how my initially reluctant favorite character, Saeko—the steadfast service top—might not trust another to help her climax because she a) prefers not to be touched, b) is haunted by the fear that their partner might not be able to satisfy her, and c) has unaddressed body dysmorphia, all of it handled so brilliantly that I forgot I probably shouldn’t be reading this on the CTA.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Tamifull/Viz Media</span></figcaption></figure><p>Throughout all this, Tamifull’s queer manga series remains tender, messy, hilarious, vulnerable, unflinchingly honest, and deeply human. All 133 chapters exhaustively celebrate how growth and learning are the foundation of any relationship, rejecting easy answers and instead emphasizing the difficult, complex truths of love as the path to understanding.&nbsp;</p><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/green-yuri-nana-shojo-girls-love/"><div><p>The Guy She Was Interested In Wasn’t A Guy At All Is the Answer to Your Queer Manga Prayers - Aftermath</p><p>If Nana left you broken and queer baited since its 15 year hiatus, The Guy She Was Interested In Wasn’t A Guy At All will leave you whole.</p><p><span>Isaiah Colbert</span></p></div></a></figure>

Retro is, after all, the original developer of the Prime series, and while many of the veteran team members have since left, the sheer quality of the fourth entry on Switch 2 demonstrates that the studio is still one of the very best in the business.</p>
<p>The folks over at Retro didn't do it alone, though. As highlighted in the game's credits sequence, many separate companies lent their talents to the development of Prime 4, including Next Level Games and Virtuos.</p>
<p>Next Level Games, as you may know, is already familiar with the Prime series, having worked on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/metroid_prime_federation_force">Metroid Prime: Federation Force</a> for the 3DS in 2016. As of 2021, it's a wholly-owned subsidiary of Nintendo alongside Retro Studios itself. The specific developers at Next Level Games credited as helping out on Prime 4 were Matt McTavish, Cavin Yen, Mark Blanchin, and Christopher Rice.</p>
<p>Here are the teams listed in the credits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Retro Studios</li>
<li>Next Level Games</li>
<li>Virtuos</li>
<li>Territory Studio</li>
<li>Waterproof</li>

<li>Mock Science</li>
<li>Cup of Tea</li>
<li>Formosa Interactive</li>
<li>House of Moves</li>
</ul>
<p>Meanwhile, longtime producer Kensuke Tanabe at Nintendo also provided the text for the in-game scans, while Samus herself is now voiced by Erin Yvette with motion capture by Krystle Martin. Fans of the series will know that Jennifer Hale had previously provided the voiceover for Samus in the original Prime trilogy.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">our review</a> for Metroid Prime 4: Beyond for the Switch 2, we said that it "manages to replicate that magical sense of discovery from the GameCube original while pushing the series in some incredible new directions", awarding it a score of 9/10.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Review: Metroid Prime 4: Beyond - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition (Switch 2) - Samus Returns In Prime Form]]></title>
            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition</link>
            <guid>1370368</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<p>I’ve been waiting a long time for this. Ever since <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/metroid_prime_3_corruption">Metroid Prime 3: Corruption</a> ended on a slight cliffhanger (provided you obtained the 100% completion rating) back in 2007, I’ve been wondering where exactly Nintendo and Retro Studios might take the series next. 18 years would follow, and that’s an awful long time to formulate an idea of what the perfect sequel might look like.</p>
<p>Now that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> is finally here, it’s absolutely nothing like I’d imagined – and that’s a good thing. What Retro Studios has delivered might well be the studio’s finest work yet, and it’s certainly up there as one of the very best Metroid games of all time.</p>
<figure><a title="Metroid Prime 4: Beyond - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 1 of 10" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160798/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>I should say, however, that I think this game may prove divisive. Retro has successfully replicated that magical feeling of discovery from the GameCube original, but it’s also taken some pretty wild swings with Beyond’s new open-world hub, high-speed motorbike traversal, and yes, Galactic Federation companions. I’m not sure everybody is going to get along with it like I did, but what I do know is that Beyond feels like a natural evolution of Corruption. The Prime games have set themselves apart from the rest of the series by expanding Samus’ world to introduce more and more side characters, and this latest entry takes this concept further than ever.</p>
<p>To illustrate, Beyond kicks off on the planet Tanamaar, with Samus fighting alongside a host of Federation troopers against an attack from Sylux and their Space Pirate cronies. It’s a great sequence to get reacquainted with your beam attacks, missiles, morph ball, and double jump before most of it gets ripped away in classic Metroid style. Y’see, following a confrontation with Sylux, Samus gets transported to the mysterious world of Viewros, seemingly alone in a hostile environment stuffed with creatures looking to kill you.</p>
<p>What follows is an intriguing mystery that introduces the brand-new Lamorn race, which is essentially Prime 4's Chozo. Uncovering what happened to the Lamorn is a joy, and you don't need any prior series knowledge to enjoy this story. Phazon's out, Dark Samus is out, and Sylux gets enough screen time as the new Big Bad. Fans will adore it, but newcomers can get right on board, too.</p>
<figure><a title="Metroid Prime 4: Beyond - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 2 of 10" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160793/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The first thing that leapt out when wandering around the lush opening section of Fury Green was just how beautiful Beyond really is. Environments and creatures are brought to life like never before, with accompanying lighting and particle effects making this the best-looking game Nintendo has ever published. The art design is simply astonishing, constantly compelling you to just stop and soak it all in, which was easy given how much there is to uncover with the Scan Visor. Go back to (the lovely-looking) <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_remastered">Prime Remastered</a> and you'll see just how much of a step up this is.</p>
<p>The visuals are augmented by the incredible soundtrack, which is comfortably the best since the original Prime. You've likely already heard the Fury Green theme from trailers, but every major biome rocks its own awesome variant, from the thumping, electrically-charged Volt Forge to the calming, ethereal Base Camp. I quite literally sat for about 10 minutes just vibing in the latter, and with the combined effects of the art style and audio, it was the first of many moments where I thought, <em>'Okay, yes, this is a really special game.'</em> It's the kind of thing you just know you'll be going back to in 10, 20 years' time.</p>
<figure><a title="Metroid Prime 4: Beyond - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 3 of 10" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160794/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The enemies and boss characters are comfortably some of the best, most grotesque in series history, and the battles that ensue are equally thrilling and challenging. Even better, they're all completely new and don’t lean on nostalgia – sorry Ridley, maybe next time. There are <em>loads</em> of different enemy types, including the ferocious Grievers, the exploding Pyremite, and the deadly Psy-Bots. I only wish there was a 3D model feature like Prime Remastered to better appreciate their incredible designs.</p>
<p>Provided you have the right setup, you can choose between two performance modes on Switch 2: Quality at 4K/60fps (1080p handheld) or Performance at 1080p/120fps (720p handheld). The bump up to 120fps in Performance Mode is certainly noticeable, but not half as much as the resulting downgrade in resolution. As such, I spent the vast majority of the time in Quality Mode; it looks absolutely gorgeous in 4K while docked, with performance that appeared locked at 60fps with no noticeable dips. Trust me, you’ll want the highest resolution possible for this game.</p>
<figure><a title="Metroid Prime 4: Beyond - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 4 of 10" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160799/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>You've also got several different control methods from the off, including dual-stick aiming and motion aiming. Opt for the former, and you use the analogue sticks for your movement, while gyro aiming can help with fine-tuning. Mouse controls are also featured for both options, so if you're playing with the Joy-Con 2 detached, you can put the right controller side-down to immediately activate mouse mode. It's a little erratic at first, so you'll probably need to bring the sensitivity down a bit, but it feels pretty great. Overall, my control method of choice remained dual-sticks with a Pro Controller, but all options feel perfectly viable.</p>
<p>In typical Metroid fashion, you’ll be exploring various biomes throughout the world of Viewros, including the luscious forest of Fury Green, the frozen laboratories of Ice Belt, and much more. In addition to familiar abilities and armaments — missiles, grapple beam, morph ball — Samus gains a host of new psychic powers early on. This includes the ability to move devices remotely and open up paths, hurl your morph ball bombs at enemies and bomb slots from a distance, and directly manipulate the direction of your ‘Control Beam’ to hit multiple targets at once.</p>
<figure><a title="Metroid Prime 4: Beyond - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 5 of 10" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160796/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>In pre-release trailers depicting the psychic powers, I was worried that they might prove gimmicky, but this isn’t the case. It makes for some really cool sequences, including (but not limited to) the new Psychic Boost Rails, which hurl you around the environment on an almost-but-not-quite invisible path; perfect for locating those coveted Missile Expansions. Think of the Magatsu Rail from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/shin_megami_tensei_v_vengeance">Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance</a>, and you’re on the right track.</p>
<p>Of course, you’ll also gain new weapons on your travels, and these work a little differently this time. In the past, you’d acquire new beams while your standard missiles would remain the default sub-weapon. In Beyond, your Power Beam is maintained throughout, while elemental beams — specifically Fire, Ice, and Thunder — are mapped to the missile input and require their own ammo called Shots.</p>
<p>So, in addition to Missile Expansions, you’ll also be on the lookout for Shot Expansions. I was concerned this might limit my approach to battles if I’m constantly worried about running out of ammo, but truthfully, you’ll find so many expansions on your travels, depleting your supplies is never a major concern.</p>
<figure><a title="Metroid Prime 4: Beyond - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 6 of 10" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160797/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Travelling from one biome to another is also a little (a lot) different this time around. A few hours in, you’ll gain access to Vi-O-La, an awesome futuristic motorbike that comes equipped with boost abilities and projectile weapons. It controls like a dream, too, with light touches of ‘L’ allowing you to slide and turn sharp corners at will. Upgrades found in the environment add more boosts to your arsenal, and soon you’ll be racing from one end of the hub world to the other in no time at all.</p>
<p>Sol Valley itself is a pretty vast area, and at first it felt completely empty, but looks can be deceiving. In addition to connecting the major locations necessary to progress the story, Sol Valley also includes a bunch of Shrines (yes, there’s that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Breath of the Wild</a> influence), Galactic Federation debris sites, and dozens upon <em>dozens</em> of Green Crystal clusters that you simply drive through at speed to collect.</p>
<p>Ultimately, including such a meaty open world amongst the usual labyrinthine biomes is a stroke of genius on Retro's part. Think about how previous Metroid games (or really <em>any</em> Metroidvania titles) work: completely different environments will be separated by a mere door or an elevator, and while this works perfectly well from a gameplay perspective, logically it doesn't make a whole lot of sense.</p>
<figure><a title="Metroid Prime 4: Beyond - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 7 of 10" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160791/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>What Sol Valley demonstrates is that these games don't need to be confined to dense corridors for the duration of the experience. You can open up the world, make the biomes link together more logically, and still maintain the essence of that classic Metroid experience. I can't wait to see how it influences the genre going forward.</p>
<p>Like the missiles, energy tanks, and whatnot, those Green Crystals found in Sol Valley are a finite resource. You’ll need to nab the whole lot to bag some sweet rewards, but the game introduces some neat little perks later on that make this a lot easier than you might think. Truth be told, this is possibly the most approachable Metroid game ever, since hidden Scout Bots located in each environment can also ping their radars and reveal the locations of any undiscovered items on your map. Granted, you won’t be able to activate these until much, <em>much</em> later in the game, but it makes chasing that 100% completion rating a lot more digestible than ever before.</p>
<figure><a title="Metroid Prime 4: Beyond - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 8 of 10" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160795/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>As you make your way across Viewros, you’ll also run into a handful of Galactic Federation troopers: Myles Mackenzie, Reger Tokabi, Nora Armstrong, Ezra Duke, and VUE-995. Honestly, none of them are even remotely as irritating as previews suggested, and I genuinely came to enjoy their presence. There are brief moments where one or two might join you in the fight, but these are kept to a minimum, and Retro wisely ditches them before they outstay their welcome. Overall, the dialogue is a lot stronger than anything seen in Corruption, and the voice actors do a wonderful job at bringing them to life.</p>
<p>But this is also where my one little nitpick comes in. While exploring Sol Valley, Myles will occasionally ping you on the radio to let you know what you should be doing next. Whether it’s making your way to your next objective or heading back to Base Camp to activate a new beam upgrade, Myles is essentially Prime 4’s Navi from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/legend_of_zelda_ocarina_of_time">Ocarina of Time</a> - always there to nudge you in the right direction.</p>
<p>It’s not as frequent as you might fear — once you’ve heard him once, that’ll be it until your next major outing on Vi-O-La — but I’d love it if Retro Studios could add the ability to mute him completely. Sometimes I just want to ride around in peace, y’know?</p>

<p>I did find myself longing for a couple of extra features: namely, the ability to change the bike's colour and to listen to some custom music while roaming about. Well, these are both here... if you buy the amiibo.</p>
<p>The Vi-O-La figure unlocks skins for your ride, while Samus adds the Vi-O-La Radio, letting you toggle through a small selection of banging Metroid-themed tunes. It's frankly irritating that Nintendo decided to lock these features behind amiibo; they should have been in the game by default, no question. The Sylux amiibo apparently unlocks a specific cutscene early, which you'll otherwise need to 100% the game to see. All other Metroid series amiibo just play a random Metroid-themed jingle.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, I’ve beaten the game with 100% items and 97% logbook scans, and this has taken me roughly 16 hours (don’t worry, I'm already looking for that remaining 3%). Keep in mind that I’ve sped through for review, so playing through at your own, slower pace could nudge your time to over 20 hours if you’re after absolutely everything; mainlining the story may shave it down to around 10 hours.</p>

<p>I’d recommend finding all collectibles if you can, though, since this will uncover everything in the game’s Gallery section, which is filled with concept art from Beyond’s development – it’s a lovely behind-the-scenes look at a game that’s been heavily shrouded in mystery for years.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>After 18 years of waiting, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond manages to replicate that magical sense of discovery from the GameCube original while pushing the series in some incredible new directions. Separating the main biomes with a vast open world sounds ridiculous on paper, but the slick traversal provided by Vi-O-La makes exploration more satisfying than ever.</p>
<p>Combine this with the stunning art direction, ferocious new boss characters, and a surprisingly endearing squad of Federation troopers, and Beyond is quite possibly the boldest, most well-realised Metroid game to date. Make no mistake, the long wait has been more than worth it. Welcome back, Samus.</p></section>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The original Outward was well received by players with its offering of an RPG with survival elements, where the world was dangerous and you had to use your wits to survive and make progress. Outward 2 looks to continue on and build on those foundations, making for a more densely packed and more dangerous experience as a result, and still without the compromises of fast travel or quest markers.&nbsp;We sat down with Guillaume Boucher-Vidal, the CEO and creative director of Nine Dots Studio, and producer Natasha Collin to play the alpha build of Outward 2, and find out what is in store for players.</p>
<p><iframe title="OUTWARD 2 - Official Release Window Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PKSH4d-iN-k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>“One of the four pillars of what we wanted to improve in Outward 2 was character creation, increase the the role play opportunities and like being who you wanted. And part of it is that we have three starting areas and they all come with a very different Quest that explains how a regular person ends up living a life of an adventurer.”, said Guillaume as we checked out the creation screen.</p>


<p>Players of Outward will be happy to know there are a lot more options available when designing your character to allow you to make them more personal, from body shape, skin colour, hair colour, styles, and various body markings. Once you have crafted how your character looks you then pick their base skill set and attributes. For those of you who really want a challenge, Deadbeat will provide you with the weakest and most vulnerable character build. While it is Guillaume’s favourite, he steered me away from that, so I settled on a book loving brute instead. Your choices will impact the dialogue options open to you and how some quests may play out, as well as your general survival skills in the world. When it comes to factions, you can only join one out and that is your faction for life. You can also not become an expert in every ability, so the decisions you make on which skills to learn need to be carefully thought through so you focus on a particular playstyle.</p>


<p>For this playthrough of Outward 2, we started in the new location of Haboob, a city which was cut off from the world for centuries surrounded by large flora and a persistent sandstorm. Only those who are exiled seem to leave the walls of the city, and for good reason. There is danger pretty much everywhere outside the walls for anyone unprepared. What you notice about Haboob is its distinct style of interesting architecture pierced with a purple lighting interspersed around, and a perpetual sandstorm above the vast cave system in which the city is located. This is one of three starting areas and depending on your choices you may not see Haboob until much later in the game.</p>
<p>You have your own apartment in Haboob, a market nearby where you can purchase items and weapons, and an opportunity to make a name for yourself, except that all comes crashing down after your first night because of Sebastian. In this story, you wake up to find a guard in your chambers looking for something only for Sebastian to kill him and place the smoking gun in your hands before disappearing. This is where the clock starts ticking as you only have 18 in-game days to track Sebastian down and prove your innocence or lose everything. Each day lasts an hour, so 18 hours seems like plenty of time to save your home, except Outward 2 is not forgiving when it comes to time. If you sleep, which you will need to, you will lose those hours. If you lose a fight and get knocked unconscious, you will lose time and have to deal with whatever situation you have woken up in.</p>
<p>There is no death in Outward 2, unless you play the Hardcore mode, where losing consciousness comes with a 20% chance of your save being permanently deleted. But for a regular playthrough, just because there’s no death doesn’t mean there’s no challenge. Depending on where you fall and your luck you may wake up in a friendly situation or in a dangerous one. In one situation I was found by the Menders, a group of helpers and healers that travel Auriel. They are also one of the factions you can join. They mended me up and even gave me information about Sebastian that I could use.</p>
<p>This was actually the first time Guillaume and Rebecca had seen this scenario play out, which was exciting for them too. I asked about how many different defeat scenarios would be in Outward 2. Guillaume responds, saying, “Hey, it’s a tough question. Like a lot, really? A lot. We need them because we die often and so if you keep seeing the same things it eventually gets frustrating. And we need different defeat scenarios for every dungeon as well. So like, that’s why it’s not a cutscene or something. It’s just a little bit of text.”</p>

<p>Two of the criticisms that were levied at Outward included combat being stiff and the world itself be relatively sparse leading to prolonged sections of nothing happening. Guillaume and the team took those comments to heart, and the world in Outward will be more exciting to explore while retaining a similar size to the original’s map. On map Guillaume says, “The emptiness is one of those four pillars. The first one was character creation. The second one is making a world which is more alive. And so to do that, it has to be a bit more filled. You need to have a bit more random events, to have encounters that are not hostile, to populate visually the world a bit more. It will never be as packed as, say, one of those Ubisoft type worlds where you’ve got, like, every 30 seconds you got something coming at you. We’re not trying to do that. But even as you walk around in the city, I feel like it’s luscious. It has lot of places to visit, and when you’re outside, it is more dense than the first. We’ve got it similar in scope, but because it is more packed, it feels significantly bigger.</p>
<p>“[There are] four regions, four cities, lots of dungeons spread across regions. Normally, we calculated we have a budget of about six to eight dungeons, like major dungeons per area, and then we have many, what we call micro dungeons, so interesting destinations that might not take you an hour to just go through.”</p>
<p>Combat in Outward 2 has been improved with weapons have a wider variety of moves depending on direction inputs, and you can carry different combinations of weapons to inflict damage on enemies. For my playthrough I had a small axe in one hand and an ice pick in another, allowing for quicker attacks. Later, I equipped a trident that allowed slower but more powerful attacks, while also providing ways to evade incoming attacks. Locking on to enemies and moving around them gives a fluid feel to fights, but for some fights you do need to prep.</p>
<p>At one point, we came across a ghost in a cave, which could not be defeated with conventional methods. Guillaume took old clothing, tore it into linen, attached it to a stick, doused it in oil, and set it on fire, as the ghost was susceptible to fire magic. Outward 2 is a game where you have to think logically to come up with solutions or suffer the consequences. I drank straight from a stream which gave my character indigestion, but had I boiled the water, I would have been fine. Magic is another viable combat route in Outward 2 with various spells to equip and learn, but is not something that I saw in the alpha build.</p>

<p>Outward 2 has had its development challenges with Guillaume saying that one of the biggest was switching engines from Unity to Unreal 5 partway through development – a decision made when Unity pitched the idea of the Runtime Fee which would have seen a charge applied to developers for game installs after a certain revenue point. “We were a specialist studio with 10 years of experience in Unity. Starting with Unreal was even worse, having to migrate the work that we had already done. So there is something that is lost in the process because the structure, the architecture of the game has to be thought of in terms of what are the strengths of the engine. So now we are kind of trying to massage it back into a shape that fits these strengths and weaknesses of Unreal Engine.”</p>
<p>Outward 2 is a project that clearly means a lot to Guillaume and the team at Nine Dots Studio, so I asked what kind of legacy do they want Outward 2 to have? Guillaume takes a moment to think before saying, “I want Outward 2 to prove that Outward was not a fluke and I want this game to be a complete expression of architecture. We’re not trying to be more accessible, but we want to attain a level of execution where the people who were not receptive to the first one. Now, we’ll know is it because we didn’t execute it well? Or was it because the vision is not for them?</p>
<p>“For Outward 1 I understand that some people like it was too rough for me – that’s valid. I want Outward 2 to be very tight. It’s the first game in a very long time that we are self-publishing. So it is a game that is about the emancipation of Nine Dots, and taking having more control over how we sell the game, how we communicate with players, how do we collaborate with other developers because we are acting as publishers as well.</p>
<p>“We were very successful with Outward, so we used some of that money to fund another studio called Ever Curious Entertainment and their game called Witherbloom. And we can just keep doing more of that if Outward 2 is successful, even a fraction of the success of Outward. Because we are self-publishing, we would keep so much of that success for ourselves and we would share that success.”</p>

<p>Outward 2 is a game that will appeal to those that want an RPG with survival elements, where no quest log tells you what to do, no markers to pinpoint exactly where you are, and where you deal with cold, heat, hunger, and thirst as well as the dangers around you. It is a tough experience but Outward 2 comes across as a game that will reward those who persevere. If it is successful it could also see more studios benefit as Nine Dots expands into publishing, allowing for a more varied game industry at a time when it is needed.</p>

			<p>The journey to get here has been as long, challenging, and convoluted as many of Samus Aran’s own adventures. The last original release in the Metroid Prime series came out over 18 years ago, with the fourth entry in the series being announced in 2017 when the Switch was in its infancy. <a href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-retro-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A complete development reboot</a>, which saw original series creators Retro Studios taking back control of the project, followed, and numerous delays got stacked on top of that, so it’s honestly hard to believe <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/metroid-prime-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> launches this week. No, really. It’s happening.</p>



<p>Has the lengthy wait for Samus' latest adventure been worth it? Or is this series past its prime? Suit up and roll on for the answer.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/WCCFmetroidprime49.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond opens in the midst of a chaotic attack on a Galactic Federation base orchestrated by the mysterious bounty hunter Sylux, who has harnessed Metroids to take control of his own Space Pirate crew. Of course, our trusty heroine Samus Aran steps in to kick some Space Pirate ass, but when a mysterious artifact is disturbed in the melee, she finds herself transported to an uncharted corner of the galaxy. And thus, Samus finds herself marooned on Viewros, a sprawling, beautiful planet once ruled by a technologically-advanced civilization known as the Lamorn. Samus must figure out why exactly she's been summoned to Viewros and how to get home. As an extra complication, Sylux has also been transported to this new world and is plotting trouble.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/WCCFmetroidprime410.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>However, Samus is also joined by some new allies. As anybody following the pre-launch coverage of Metroid Prime 4 has no doubt heard, the game has friendly NPCs – a quintet of Galactic Federation soldiers who pop up throughout Samus’ journey, eventually congregating at a home base and helping her through various missions. The reaction to the previews that first revealed the existence of these NPCs, particularly the nerdy, self-effacing engineer Myles MacKenzie, was... mixed, to say the least. Alarmist takes that Metroid — <em>Metroid, of all things!</em> — had been dealt a game-destroying dose of Whedonesque snark ran wild.</p>



<p>Well, I'm here to say, you can calm down<em>. It's okay</em>. While Myles comes on strong, the sequence that previewers reacted so negatively to literally lasts around 20 minutes. After that, Myles continues to be the guy you go to for certain upgrades, and he will chime in via radio from time to time, but he's much more subdued once he settles in. The rest of the Galactic Federation crew, while all a bit trope-ey, are generally less jokey and potentially annoying.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/WCCFmetroidprime411-1.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Don't get me wrong, I get the initial knee-jerk reaction. I <em>never</em> liked Buffy and tapped out on Marvel movies well before most people (how was Avengers: Endgame?). As somebody sensitive to cringe, let me assure you, Metroid Prime 4 is <em>not that cringe</em>. Samus is still a lone wolf for the large majority of the game, and hey, what's so wrong with her having friends for once? The only issue I have with Samus' new crew is that, at a certain point, the game asks that we actually care about them, and I never really did. They didn't annoy me terribly, they didn't ruin the game, I just found them forgettable for the most part.</p>



<p>Broadly speaking, "forgettable" is the best word to describe the Metroid Prime 4 plot. While some of the backstory of Viewros and the Lamorn is interesting, the game doesn't weave its various threads into a particularly satisfying whole. Of course, Metroid Prime games have always had relatively uninteresting stories, and nothing here descends to the dire storytelling lows of something like Metroid: Other M, but there was potential for something a bit more engaging here. What if, for instance, Samus had actually been allowed to have some back-and-forth interactions with her new crew (she's given the Nintendo silent protagonist treatment here)? What if this story felt more interconnected with previous Prime games or the larger Metroid mythos? Alas, these are mere pipe dreams.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/WCCFmetroidprime420.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>But again, this franchise has never really been about story, and on the gameplay front, Metroid Prime 4 delivers. If you've ever played a Metroid Prime game before, this entry feels pretty much identical — the silky-smooth movement, the surprisingly solid-feeling first-person platforming, the fun Morph Ball physics. This time around, there are more control options than ever, with players being able to make use of gyro aiming, flip their Joy-Con 2 controller on its edge for well-implemented mouse controls, or go old-school with Gamecube-style lock-on aiming. <span>The newer control options aren't really&nbsp;<em>required;</em>&nbsp;the series is built around lock-on aiming, and that's largely what I used during my playthrough, but it's nice that those who want to play this game as a more traditional shooter have valid options.</span> Also lovely is Metroid Prime 4's impressive level of technical polish, offering both 4K/60fps and 1080p/120fps modes, with the former never dropping so much as a frame as far as I noticed.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/WCCFmetroidprime412.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Metroid fans will be familiar with most of the abilities Samus gains this time around, from the Space Jump to Super Missiles, with the main addition being the new "psychic powers." Most of these powers essentially complement existing abilities, with, for instance, Samus being able to move bombs she produces in Morph Ball mode with telekinesis or direct shots from her arm cannon to hit tricky switches. Psychic abilities don't radically alter that classic Metroid Prime gameplay, but they do open up some new level design avenues.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/WCCFmetroidprime413.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>And really, Metroid Prime 4's world and level design is where it truly shines. This game is all about scope. If most Metroid games to this point were obviously inspired by the claustrophobic feel of the early Alien movies, Metroid Prime 4 feels inspired by Ridley Scott's (underrated in my opinion) prequel, Prometheus. In contrast to past Metroid entries, this is a game about dramatic, imposing openness and size. You see that in the stark, rolling dunes of the game's desert hub as well as its various "dungeons," which are all grandiose in their own ways, offering up large-scale, immaculately-designed architecture set amongst beautiful skyboxes.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/WCCFmetroidprime414.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Make no mistake, while it may not be designed for the strongest hardware on the market, Metroid Prime 4 is one of the most striking-looking games I've played in recent memory. Again, the focus here is more on bold, beautifully designed structures and open spaces rather than the cramped approach of past Metroids (although the game is often dark and atmospheric when it chooses to be). On Switch 2, this is easily the sharpest-looking game Nintendo has ever offered, with even the publisher's usual lack of anti-aliasing being much less obvious than usual.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/WCCFmetroidprime415.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>The scope of Viewros is reinforced by <a href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-vi-o-la-motorcycle-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Samus's bitchin' new motorbike, Vi-O-La</a>, which is fun and easy to control, whether you're cruising around the world's central desert area or the paths that connect different sections of some dungeons. There's also been a fair amount of concern about Metroid Prime 4's central desert, Sol Valley, with some worrying it’s a huge, all-encompassing open-world similar in scope to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild's Hyrule, but that's not really the case. Granted, Retro has borrowed somewhat from recent Zeldas, as Sol Valley is dotted with a handful of shrines to explore and other collectibles to find, but the reality is, you can drive from one edge of the desert to the other in maybe 2 or 3 minutes and can largely ignore it for much of Metroid Prime 4's runtime (although you shouldn't, for reasons I'll explain soon).</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/WCCFmetroidprime416.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>As good as Metroid Prime 4’s overall world design is, it’s in its traditional exploration-focused “dungeons” that it reaches its zenith. These parts of the game are perhaps the most fun and engaging Metroid Prime has ever been, and while each dungeon has a predictable elemental theme (fire, ice, electric, forest, etc.) they all have a unique secondary theme and often a backstory that defines them. For instance, the electric-themed dungeon is an automated factory where Vi-O-La bikes are manufactured and the ice area is actually a horror-tinged experimental bio lab where shadowy experiments were conducted.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/WCCFmetroidprime417.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Almost all the dungeons are designed in a "there and back again" format, with players pushing downward into their furthest depths, upon which, you usually battle a boss and the area transforms, resulting in a completely different experience as you try to extract yourself. And then, the dungeons often change again as you backtrack to them later.</p>



<p>Yes, classic Metroid backtracking is still very much a thing here. While the early hours of Metroid Prime 4 feel relatively on rails, around a third of the way in, the game really opens up, freeing the player to unravel how to progress through the rest of the game. There is a specific path you have to follow (although I'm sure clever folks will be able to sequence-break) and the game is refreshingly willing to let you find your own way. Myles will occasionally chime in over the radio to give you high-level pointers on what to do next, but it's up to you to figure out how exactly to get there, and once in dungeons, you're fully on your own.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/WCCFmetroidprime418.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>During the middle stretch of Metroid Prime 4, as I was happily hacking through one intense, magnificent-looking dungeon after another and figuring out where to backtrack to next, I was fairly sure I was playing the Nintendo game of the year, and quite possibly the best Metroid Prime title to date. Unfortunately, Metroid Prime 4 does lose some of the momentum that it previously built so expertly in its last few hours. Retro doesn't outright fumble the ball, but it does kind of feel like they're running out the clock near the end.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/WCCFmetroidprime419.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Without giving too much away, Metroid Prime 4 makes a mistake that seems to be endemic to this series -- sending players on a last-minute scavenger hunt just when the game's story seems to be reaching its climax. This portion of the game is largely focused around Sol Valley, which is why I suggest you try to make some piecemeal progress there throughout the game, but even if you do, you're still looking at a fairly significant diversion just when you're eager to move full speed ahead. As for the climax itself, it’s solid, but compared to other big 2025 Nintendo games, it doesn't land the epic knockout blow that, say, Donkey Kong Bananza delivered.</p>



<p>That said, while Metroid Prime 4's final hours left me a bit flat, there's no diminishing how great the first three-quarters of the game are. Metroid Prime fans still have a mostly-tasty meal to look forward to, and the portions are generous. This is a solid 15-hour campaign and completionists could probably spend at least twice that time getting to 100 percent, so warm up your scanners.</p>

				<p>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond ascends to higher peaks than any previous Prime entry, delivering an impressive sense of scale, breathtaking visuals, and classic Metroid level design at its most immersive and riveting, but a few missteps, including an unengaging story and flat final act, may exclude it from best-of-series conversations. That said, those who have been waiting for this game for nearly two decades needn’t worry too much, as Metroid Prime 4 largely locks onto the core of what made this series great.</p>

			<p>ROUTINE has been a long time coming. Not that I would have known, or at least realized. Watching old trailers from its 2012 reveal didn't help me remember whether I had seen the trailer at the time (at first). In the decade-plus since Lunar Software put out its first trailers, I had entirely forgotten about them and <a href="https://wccftech.com/routine-comes-back-from-a-ten-year-slumber-with-a-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ROUTINE's development</a> when I started playing through this new-old horror game.</p>



<p>Needless to say, I had a lot of questions when I started. First of which being 'what took so long.' According to Aaron Foster, ROUTINE's art director and project lead at Lunar Software, in an interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/routine-is-an-indie-horror-game-over-a-decade-in-the-making-developer-interview-ign-first">IGN</a>, it was just personal reasons. They had to stop working on the game, and only came back to it in 2020, eight years after ROUTINE was one of the highlights of Gamescom 2012. </p>



<p>Lunar Software also essentially had to start from scratch. It couldn't exactly keep making the game in Unreal Engine 3 if it wanted to stand out on modern platforms. So the decade-plus since reveal isn't down to development hell, just regular life reasons, and then needing to essentially restart and overhaul the whole thing. Altogether, you'd probably be more accurate in saying ROUTINE took about six or seven years, instead of fifteen.</p>

<p>But anyone who does remember the 2012 Gamescom trailer has been waiting for fifteen years. So, has it been worth the wait? Well, I can't answer that question because even after eventually remembering that I did see the trailer when it first debuted, I haven't spent the last fifteen years wondering where ROUTINE is. So, from where I'm sitting, I'm just so goddamn glad we have another horror game shooting for, and frankly, nailing, all of the same targets Alien: Isolation was aiming for.</p>



<p>I'm not going to spend the entire review comparing ROUTINE to Alien: Isolation, but the comparison is, at least partially, unavoidable. Part of this comes from how both games strive for a retrofuturistic aesthetic, with ROUTINE showcasing the best VHS-era designs Lunar Software makes pass for technology capable of bringing you to the moon and maintaining a base there for years.</p>



<p>Besides some of the practical facts like both games forcing you to hide from all manner of enemies and both games featuring robots, what invites the comparison to Alien: Isolation is the unique ways in which Lunar Software builds a dense, rich atmosphere in ROUTINE. Little details like how you seamlessly transition from looking around to interacting with the many terminals you'll need to use to read the emails and diary entries that contain the core of the game's storytelling make the world feel all the more real.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ROUTINE_SS_003_August.png"></a><figcaption><em>ROUTINE. Image credit: Lunar Software</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Or how the game takes the very old-school approach and gives you absolutely no help at all. No waypoints, no map markers; you can't even use the only tool you have in the game while crouched, which also means you can't use a flashlight. You're meant to slow down, to remember your limitations, and try to use your own common sense to solve the many, many puzzles that you'll have to work your way through across six chapters. </p>



<p>It's almost funny in a way that ROUTINE arrives over a decade later than it would have if Lunar Software didn't have to pause for personal reasons, and in that same year, Rouge Faction tries to front the same 'no hand-holding' philosophy for <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hell-is-us-review/">Hell is Us</a>. And ROUTINE does it better in almost every way. I'd still say Hell is Us might be the better game overall, but there's a simplicity to ROUTINE that makes its environmental guidance work so well that I was never truly lost.</p>



<p>I'm getting ahead of things here. Backing up a bit, ROUTINE opens with you waking up on a lunar base to find that everyone is gone - or dead, and you have to figure out which it is if you don't want to end up the same way. Once you get yourself situated with how to bend down and grab something on the floor (a mechanic that is singled out in the early game and grossly underused afterwards), upon walking out your room door, you notice there are some pretty heavy-duty robots walking around.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ROUTINE_SS_001_August.png"></a><figcaption><em>Don't let the gun-like shape of your C.A.T. tool fool you; you can't actually take the robots down permanently; you can only stun them. Image credit: Lunar Software</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>These are Type-05s, or 'T5s' for short. You learn through the aforementioned emails, diary entries, and more than a few voice recordings found at key intervals that these robots used to help run the base, and now they've started killing all the humans in it for some mysterious reason.</p>



<p>I'm not going to get much deeper into the plot for spoiler reasons. Not because the plot is central to the core experience. Unfortunately, I found the general plot of the game difficult to follow, not just because of the disjointed way in which it was told, but because you're liable to take well over an hour in any given chapter, and because you can't go back and re-read/re-listen to the emails, diary entries, a voice notes that tell the story, it's easy to forget where you are in it.</p>



<p>It's especially easy to forget all the little lore details that are trying to clue you in on what's going on underneath the surface. It's all very interesting, and I'm looking forward to playing ROUTINE again to pay more attention to these aspects, but it's difficult to keep track of in a first playthrough, because you have to keep track of all the practical elements you see.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ROUTINE_SS_002_August.png"></a><figcaption><em>ROUTINE. Image credit: Lunar Software</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>You begin to learn your way around the base and the few levels you get to see of it, since you'll be running around them enough times, hiding from your would-be killers at every corner. The constant game of hide-and-please-don't-seek-me in the circles you create in each area as you solve puzzles to unlock new elements of the environment actually felt a bit overwhelming at times. It can also create a frustrating loop where you can't figure out where to go next because you don't have time to look around and you don't have time to look around because you'll get caught and die if you're focusing on looking around and not hiding but if you want to survive you have to hide but then you're not looking around and not figuring out where to go etc.</p>



<p>But you only stay in that loop for as long as you allow yourself to. ROUTINE is balanced by the fact that anything looking for you will give up relatively easily if you hide, and while there are many robots to be found in the abandoned base, only one of them is active at a given time, so you're not just bombarded by enemies you can't kill. The second method feels cleverer than the first, especially because it's something you have to figure out based on the robot's actions, but both together get the job done, so no complaints there.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ROUTINE_SS_004_August.png"></a><figcaption><em>ROUTINE. Image credit: Lunar Software</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Finding your way around is only one of the puzzles you'll constantly be asked to solve in ROUTINE. This game is filled with puzzles, but some of the smaller, more contained puzzles are far more interesting than their large-scale siblings, and most of those bigger puzzles that involve multiple steps are more about tedium than they are interesting puzzle-solving.</p>



<p>At least there's a lot going on as you run back and forth between terminals to try and unlock a specific door because, my goodness, this is such a thrilling horror game to play. ROUTINE is a tense game, for almost every second you're on the moon. It's a huge amount of emotional pressure to sustain for ten hours, but its unrelenting nature without being overly drawn out is what makes all ten of those hours the most tense you'll feel from a horror game in 2025.</p>



<p>As a horror fan, I can't help but feel electrified by just how terrifying ROUTINE is. Its jump scares are thoughtfully placed, its visual design is wonderfully retro, and I'd argue it's best enjoyed at a lower resolution than you'd play most modern games, almost made to look like you're playing a game off of a VHS.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ROUTINE_SS_006_August.png"></a><figcaption><em>ROUTINE. Image credit: Lunar Software</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>What cinches it all, like any other classic horror game, is the soundtrack. DOOM, Prey, and Wolfenstein composer Mick Gordon and the rest of Lunar Software's audio team deserve all the credit in the world for creating an extremely terrifying soundscape. From the heavy thuds of T5s walking, to the ways their necks creak with sounds of old technology, not to mention the sounds they make while scanning their environment, and of course, the sounds they make during your death scene.</p>

					<h2>ROUTINE</h2>

						<section>
				<p>ROUTINE is an excellent puzzle-focused first-person horror game that, despite its slow pacing, is able to keep you at the edge of your seat for 10 hours straight, with a tense, rich atmosphere created by wonderful execution of its retro futuristic aesthetic and stunning soundscape that immerses you in its world and gets you listening for the sound of a pin drop to avoid getting caught. Its narrative may be unable to shine through, but at the end of the day it is altogether an interesting game, a game worth playing again, and the game that Alien: Isolation fans should play while we all wait for Alien: Isolation 2.</p>

Thankfully, you won’t have to buy the $30 DLC to get this one, as Mewtwo and its two Mega Evolutions are coming to </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>as a free Mystery Gift side mission.</span></p> <p><span>Mewtwo and its Mega Stones are available now in </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>, and they’re totally free. To capture this Legendary Pokémon, you’ll have to download a new side quest through the game’s Mystery Gift feature. Open up the Link Play option in the pause menu, then click on Mystery Gift, and then the “Get via Internet” option. Here, you’ll find a new side quest called “Project M,” which will add the psychic legend to the game.&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p><span>With this addition, </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>is one step closer to hopefully adding every Mega Evolution-capable Pokémon to the roster with </span><i><span>Mega Dimension</span></i><span>. As of right now, the base game has just about all of them, with around a dozen or so still missing in action. Most of these are legendary Pokémon like Mewtwo, Latios, Latias, and Rayquaza, but a few of the old starters like Blaziken, Sceptile, and Swampert are also missing in action.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>is also introducing several new Mega Evolutions that weren’t in the base game, including Mega Raichu X and Y. Also today, Game Freak announced Mega Lucario Z, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-evolution-lucario-z-2000649602"><span>a new form for Lucario</span></a><span>, who previously had a Mega Evolution prior to the DLC. So it sounds like even some Pokémon who already had these superpowered transformations might be getting more. Outside of new Megas, the DLC is also introducing a roguelike mode that will </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-dlc-level-cap-100-2000641765"><span>break the series’ long-established level 100 level cap</span></a><span>.</span></p>

<p>Shovel Knight developers have revealed that Mina the Hollower is going to be their ‘make or break’ moment. </p>



<p>A new <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-02/creator-of-hit-game-shovel-knight-is-at-make-or-break-moment?srnd=homepage-asia" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">report</a> by Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier reveals that Shovel Knight dev, Yacht Club Games, might be in trouble if their next title, Mina the Holler, doesn’t perform well. For those unaware, Mina the Hollower was delayed indefinitely last month, just weeks before its previous release date. </p>







<h2 id="h-mina-the-hollower-s-performance-can-make-or-break-it-for-them">Mina the Hollower’s Performance Can Make or Break It for Them</h2>



<p>The new report first describes how the developers invited Schreier over to showcase their title, only for the conference room to fill with smoke. The game was still demoed after, to show where the developers stand at the moment and why they have to delay the game further. </p>



<p>The report reveals that only in the past weeks has the game reached a point where the Shovel Knight developers were able to play all the content from start to end. During this process, they have identified several areas that need improvement. However, they have only identified all the problems and will need some more time to fix them. </p>



<p>Shovel Knight developers can only remain independent if Mina the Hollower is a success. The dev studio has already undergone downsizing and now has only 15 employees left, with finances at a low point as well. The co-founder, Sean Velasco, has stated, “It’s make-or-break for sure,” adding that if the game sells 500,000 copies, they are golden; if it sells 200,000, they are still happy; however, if they sell only 100,000, that could be a problem. </p>
