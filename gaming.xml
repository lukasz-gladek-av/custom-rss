<p>In a post on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/hiddenvariable.com/post/3ljotvjtpnk2o" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a> (spotted by ResetEra user <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/hidden-variable-ceases-development-on-skullgirls-ip-payment-dispute-publisher-autumn-games-seemingly-owes-1-2-million-to-hidden-variable.1126731/#post-136658811" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">dgamemaster</a>), Hidden Variable says it is "no longer involved" in developing any&nbsp;<em>Skullgirls&nbsp;</em>game, including&nbsp;<em>Skullgirls 2nd Encore</em>,&nbsp;<em>Skullgirls Mobile</em>, and "other&nbsp;<em>Skullgirls&nbsp;</em>IP-related efforts".</p>

<p>The studio says it's in the middle of a dispute with Autumn Games which has been escalated to "litigation filed in the Los Angeles County Superior Court", and that it won't be providing further comment on the matter until said issue is resolved.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/skullgirls-2nd-encore-hidden-variable.jpg?itok=ipJVsscE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/skullgirls-2nd-encore-hidden-variable.jpg?itok=l5GLWkQ9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Skullgirls&nbsp;</em>studio Hidden Variable is embroiled in a legal dispute with publisher Autumn Games.</figcaption></figure><p>Although Hidden Variable says it won't be commenting on the matter, dgamemaster sought out the <a href="https://trellis.law/doc/240911937/complaint" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">legal document</a> filed by the studio, and it looks as though the dispute comes down to missed payments.</p>

<p>Specifically, Hidden Variable appears to be alleging that Autumn Games failed to pay it a number of times between November and now, with payments amounting to $1.23m due to Hidden Variable on Autumn Games' behalf.</p>

<p>The developer says Autumn's actions were intentional, and that the publisher was intending to find a new developer for the&nbsp;<em>Skullgirls&nbsp;</em>games after it "unsuccessfully sought to sell its business".&nbsp;Ouch.</p>

<p>According to dgamemaster's post, Autumn Games has said that it intends to continue updating&nbsp;<em>Skullgirls&nbsp;</em>despite the dispute, but it hasn't specified which of the games it will be updating, nor when new updates will be made available.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/skullgirls-2nd-encore-hidden-variable-beowulf-painwheel.jpg?itok=r2hSSRn3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/skullgirls-2nd-encore-hidden-variable-beowulf-painwheel.jpg?itok=XiFBQ8T7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It looks like&nbsp;<em>Skullgirls&nbsp;</em>might still get updates, although we don't know when.</figcaption></figure><p>This isn't the first time&nbsp;<em>Skullgirls&nbsp;</em>has run into a spot of bother. Back in 2020, Autumn Games <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/skullgirls-publisher-kicks-lab-zero-games-off-project" rel="nofollow">kicked original developer Lab Zero off the IP</a>&nbsp;following <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/More-Victimized-Employees-Leave-Lab-Zero-Mike-Z" rel="nofollow">allegations made against that studio's head Mike Zaimont</a>.</p>

<p>Following those allegations, Zaimont subsequently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mike-z-lays-off-all-remaining-lab-zero-games-employees" rel="nofollow">laid off all remaining Lab Zero employees</a>, with former staff going on to create a new studio by the name of Future Club. That studio would then work on&nbsp;<em>Skullgirls&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/former-lab-zero-devs-partner-with-hidden-variable-for-skullgirls-content" rel="nofollow">DLC</a>, thus completing the cycle.</p>

<p>The future of the&nbsp;<em>Skullgirls&nbsp;</em>franchise is currently unclear, although it sounds like Autumn Games intends to continue working on at least one of the games in the series. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra">Marvel 1943: Rise Of Hydra</a> might release at Christmas according to Khary Payton, who voices the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/black-panther">Black Panther</a> in the upcoming World War 2-set action game. It's the first morsel of release info we've garnered for Rise Of Hydra since its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/uncharted-directors-black-panther-and-captain-america-game-revealed-as-marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-out-2025">announcement last March</a>, which tantalised with the prospect of playing USO Show-era Steve Rogers and Azzuri, great-grandfather to the current Black Panther.
</p>
<p>
In the works at Skydance New Media alongside <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/amy-hennig-is-making-a-new-star-wars-game-again">an untitled Star Wars game</a>, Rise Of Hydra had been slated to launch in 2025. Speaking to <a href="https://thedirect.com/article/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-game-release-khary-payton-exclusive">The Direct</a>, Payton suggested that it might be a holiday release, landing after Call Of Duty season and just in time for the nostalgic yuletide period. "We're still working," he hummed and hypothesised. "We're planning on 2025... We're thinking like a Christmas situation. But I'm so excited." 
</p>
<p>
I'm not wildly keen myself to play another Marvel game. The expanded Marvel universe as it stands is a kaleidoscopic hangover following the success of the Avengers movies, with no clear heir to the throne just yet. Nor am I especially happy to be back in the shoes of OG Steve Rogers, a recruitment poster character rescued from his own can-do heroism by Chris Evans knowing how to do comedy. Yeah, you comicbook readers probably have a more nuanced take on Marvel's current activities. By all means come at me.
</p>
<p>
I'll forgive Rise Of Hydra all that, though, because Skydance New Media's president is former Naughty Dog creative director Amy Hennig, and she directed <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/soul-reaver">Soul Reaver</a>. I will forgive Amy Hennig anything, because she directed Soul Reaver. If Amy Hennig were to brain me with a vase, filch my debit card and blow my life savings on Fantastic Four figurines, I would tell the police not to stress about it, because she directed Soul Reaver. If Amy Hennig were to tunnel back through time and humiliate me elaborately by inviting my favourite Sonic The Comic artist to come see me fall into a cauldron of stale baked beans while being rejected by my primary school sweetheart, I would sob gratefully in the knowledge that one day, Amy Hennig is going to direct Soul Reaver. 
</p>
<p>
Perhaps she will even work on another Soul Reaver game, if we can only get her through the Marvel period in her career.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/biggest-horror-games-coming-in-2025/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/8-biggest-horror-games-coming-in-2025.1126806/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/biggest-horror-games-coming-in-2025/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The horror game market continues to thrive and 2025’s schedule is lining up a multi-course meal of fear-inducing, hair-reducing cowering and crying. 2025 has a myriad of big horror games from well-known sequels to potential breakout hits.</p>



<p>I find horror in games makes films look like child’s play—and I don’t mean any dangerous dolls. A movie forces you to watch what happens, whereas in a game, <em>you </em>are responsible for the action unfolding. <em>You </em>have to push your character along, advance the narrative, and trigger jumpscares and premeditated psychological horror.</p>



<p>It’s daunting when you think about it, yet players can’t get enough. To appease the morbid curiosity in all of us, here’s a list of the biggest upcoming horror games in 2025, sure to scare and scar you one way or another.</p>



<h2 id="h-biggest-horror-games-releasing-in-2025">Biggest Horror Games Releasing in 2025</h2>



<p><strong>Many of these 2025 horror game release dates could be subject to change.</strong> The volatility of the game industry and sudden technical problems means any title is a delay away from a 2026 or 2027 release date. That being said, let’s get into it.</p>



<h3 id="h-directive-8020">Directive 8020</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Unsettling. Credit to Supermassive Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Supermassive Games is one of the pioneers of the horror genre in the last 15 years. The acclaimed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/until-dawn-movie-teaser-released-ahead-of-first-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Until Dawn</a> kickstarted this Hall of Fame-worthy horror march. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/directive-8020-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Directive 8020</a> is the latest in The Dark Pictures Anthology—featuring The Quarry, Little Hope, and others—and features the series’ trademarks. Expect to tackle sudden quick-time events and critical story-changing decisions while you explore the unknown of the Cassiopeia.</p>



<h3 id="h-dying-light-the-beast">Dying Light The Beast</h3>



<figure><figcaption>We’re ready for more mutations. Credit to Techland</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dying-light-the-beast-gamescom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dying Light The Beast</a> brings back OG protagonist Kyle Crane as we embark on another adventure of parkour and parasitical purgatory. The Beast is a separate sequel from Dying Light 2, and <a href="https://techland.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Techland</a> is looking to bring together a more compact and equally chaotic experience. As before, Dying Light The Beast’s world is a terrifying ordeal during the day and almost unsurvivable at night. You’ll need to unlock the beast within to help Crane rise high.</p>



<h3 id="h-killing-floor-3">Killing Floor 3</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Can’t we be friends? Credit to Tripwire Interactive</figcaption></figure>



<p>Imagine Call of Duty Zombies’ renowned round-based gameplay, but with even faster, more vicious, and grotesque enemies. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/killing-floor-3-release-date-platforms-editions-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Killing Floor 3</a> is the meaner and nastier undead sibling in the zombies family and builds on Killing Floor 2’s good work. The M.E.A.T system is back to delight and disgust, and the new Zed design is likely to put you off your tea—sick bags on stand by.</p>



<h3 id="h-little-nightmares-3">Little Nightmares 3</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Phew, someone by my side. Credit to Supermassive Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>2025 is proving to be a big year for Supermassive Games as the developer is pulling double duty. Developer Tarsier Studios has moved onto pastures new, and someone needed to pick up the remnants of the beloved franchise. In steps Supermassive Games to deliver <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/little-nightmares-3-release-platforms-editions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Little Nightmares 3</a> and bring <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-little-nightmares-3-multiplayer-co-op/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">co-op multiplayer</a> in a series first. We have a new developer, new main characters in Low and Alone, and reasons to be thankful and fearful.</p>



<h3 id="h-reanimal">Reanimal</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Excited for this one. Credit to Tarsier Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>We segue nicely to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tarsier-studios-new-game-reanimal-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reanimal</a>—the new IP from Little Nightmares 1 and 2 developer Tarsier Studios. Even from the screenshot above you can see an uncanny resemblance and deliberate inspiration for the horror title. Unsurprisingly, you need to solve puzzles, escape and avoid unspeakable enemies, and it also includes co-operative play in case you need to squeeze the hand of the person next to you.</p>



<h3 id="h-state-of-decay-3">State of Decay 3</h3>



<figure><figcaption>It’s been long enough. Credit to Undead Labs</figcaption></figure>



<p>Full disclosure: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/state-of-decay-3-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">State of Decay 3</a> MIGHT not be releasing in 2025.</p>



<p>It’s currently the only entry on this list in serious jeopardy of this deadline. A potential delay to 2026 or <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/state-of-decay-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2027</a> is on the cards, so bear this in mind, but no one truly knows. If it releases in 2025, developer Undead Labs has likely put all its infected blood, sweat, and tears into it. There’s a healthy development cycle between each State of Decay release, and the 2024 Xbox Showcase footage we saw of State of Decay 3 heightens survival, and the game demands your time, respect, and attention. </p>



<h3 id="h-the-midnight-walk">The Midnight Walk</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Got a light? Credit to MoonHood</figcaption></figure>



<p>Just looking at The Midnight Walk makes me anxious. It’s ingenious, stop-motion clay-orientated horror works so well because it’s seldom seen. Its art styles alone make me want to play it. If you dare to jump into The Midnight Walk, you’ll need to do more than walk around to survive the antagonistic threat of monsters.</p>



<h3 id="h-the-sinking-city-2">The Sinking City 2</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Why do I even bother? Credit to Frogwares</figcaption></figure>



<p>The Sinking City 2 is a sequel and another special loveletter to Lovecraftian themes. Unlike escape and survival, like many entries on our best and biggest horror games 2025 list, you can attack in The Sinking City 2. But you also need to venture into the deepest recesses of your brain to engage your deductive reasoning senses. The sequel builds upon the original’s detective mechanics, and happens to throw a 200ft monster or two at you in the process. Sherlock Holmes didn’t have to deal with this!</p>

            <p>
Technology giant Samsung has shown off a working concept for a foldable gaming handheld - and it's essentially a Nintendo Switch that you can bend in half. 
</p>
<p>
Ever tried to snap your Switch in rage? Well, now you can do that with the Samsung Flex Gaming concept and (hopefully) not break the device in the process.
</p>
<p>
While just a concept, Samsung had workable units on show at the MWC mobile technology event in Barcelona this week, with foldable OLED screens up and running. Just ignore the big crease down the middle.

<p>
Perhaps just as notable, the Samsung Flex Gaming concept also includes two giant holes in each of its not-Joy-Con. These are designed to allow the control stick in each side of the handheld to fit snugly inside the other half.
</p>
<p>
Cleverly, the face button and D-Pad have been built into the edges of each hole - again replicating the placement of these buttons on Nintendo Switch.
</p>
<p>
The device even has different colours for each half, as the original Switch had for its model with Blue/Red Joy-Con. Samsung's choices are lime green and yellow though - not as attractive, though very Norwich City FC.
</p>
<p>
Nintendo is expected to not offer an OLED screen in its upcoming <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Switch 2</a> (or allow you to bend it in half). The Mario maker is set to unveil more details of its next handheld in a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-announces-timing-of-its-dedicated-switch-2-direct">special Nintendo Direct presentation scheduled for 2nd April</a>.

			<p>Sometimes, it's really hard to let some things go, even for a legendary game creator such as Hideki Kamiya, who seems to have some trouble forgetting the <a href="https://wccftech.com/action-rpg-scalebound-cancelled/">canceled Xbox exclusive Scalebound.</a></p>
<p>In a new studio update video from Clovers, Kamiya-san's new development studio, which is currently working on an Okami sequel in collaboration with CAPCOM, the creator of the Devil May Cry and Bayonetta series, among other excellent action games, was shown reminiscing about Scalebound while looking at footage and trailers shared online back when the game was still in active development. Despite the project having been canceled eight years ago, it still holds an important place in Kamiya-san's heart, as he would love to make it again someday.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Let’s do it, Phil ! 😀 <a href="https://t.co/BLdBs3hxGt">https://t.co/BLdBs3hxGt</a></p>
<p>— 神谷英樹🍀 Hideki Kamiya🍀 (@HidekiKamiya_X) <a href="https://twitter.com/HidekiKamiya_X/status/1896473842950041682?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 3, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Given how Microsoft seems interested in resuming old partnerships with Japanese development studios, as shown earlier this year with the announcement of <a href="https://wccftech.com/ninja-gaiden-4-announced-for-pc-and-consoles-with-a-fall-2025-release-window-ninja-gaiden-2-black-now-available/">Ninja Gaiden 4 and the release of Ninja Gaiden 2 Black</a>, there could be some interest from the publisher in working together with Hideki Kamiya's new studio for another project which could incorporate some of the features that the legendary creator liked so much in Scalebound. Since the project has only been briefly mentioned a couple of times since its cancelation, and not in <a href="https://wccftech.com/scalebound-rough-development-missed-milestones-stopped-payments-kamiya-takes-time-health/">the best of lights</a>, however, it definitely feels like that ship has sailed, never to come back.</p>
<p>As already mentioned, Hideki Kamiya's new studio, Clovers, is working on a new entry in the Okami series in collaboration with CAPCOM. The game, which will be released on PC and consoles on a yet-to-be-confirmed release date, will be powered by the <a href="https://wccftech.com/okami-2-re-engine/">RE Engine</a>, which is allowing the studio to fully realize Kamiya-san's vision.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/marvel-rivals-update-brings-new-clone-rumble-mode-and-more.1126779/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-update-clone-rumble<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>NetEase has released a new&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>update, and it's bringing a chaotic new game mode along with it, as well as a new Galacta-themed event and plenty of balance changes.</p>

<p>The update was released earlier today, but two of its biggest additions won't be going live until tomorrow: the Galacta's Cosmic Adventure event and the Clone Rumble game mode.</p>

<p>First up, Clone Rumble is a new mode that allows you and your teammates all to play as the same hero. If you've ever wondered what six Mr. Fantastics or six Rocket Raccoons could accomplish in a <em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>match, this mode is for you.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-rivals-clone-rumble-update-punisher.jpg?itok=Ux31xIdJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-rivals-clone-rumble-update-punisher.jpg?itok=V38OQTBO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Marvel Rivals</em>' new Clone Rumble update looks set to cause chaos.</figcaption></figure><p>The mode will only be available across three distinct three-day time periods, though. You'll be able to check it out between tomorrow and March 10th, and it'll then be available again from March 14th-March 17th and March 21st-March 24th.</p>

<p>As well as Clone Rumble, you can also check out the new Galacta's Cosmic Adventure event, which launches tomorrow as well. Joining the event will net you an exclusive Black Widow outfit for free, and this event runs until April 11th, so the time period isn't as limited as Clone Rumble.</p>

<p>Of course, you can also expect plenty of optimizations and gameplay tweaks in this update. It's well worth checking out the full&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/gameupdate/20250304/41548_1215931.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">patch notes</a> for the Clone Rumble update so you can stay up-to-date on what's going on.</p>




<p>It's been a strange few months for&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>. The game launched back in December and reached <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-player-count-10m" rel="nofollow">10 million registered players</a> within just 72 hours, going on to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-player-count-40m" rel="nofollow">break the 40 million barrier</a> by NetEase's last count.</p>

<p>However, that didn't stop the Chinese gaming giant from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-studio-shockingly-closed-by-netease-laying-off-everyone" rel="nofollow">unexpectedly closing down the Seattle studio</a> responsible for developing the game. I guess nobody is really safe from the recent wave of industry cuts and layoffs, unfortunately.</p>

<p><em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>is available to play right now for free on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2767030/Marvel_Rivals/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10010451" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/marvel-rivals/9n8pmw7qmd3d" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.</p>

            <p>
Xbox owners enrolled into the Xbox Insider program are reporting that their consoles are being reset back to factory settings by a new update.
</p>
<p>
The Xbox Insider program allows users to receive new system features early, and is split into various 'tiers' for how new and/or buggy they want these features to be when they receive them. 
</p>
<p>
Users in the earliest Alpha and Alpha Skip-Ahead tiers say the latest console update is removing their Xbox profiles, console settings and Quick Resume data (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/xboxs-latest-system-update-for-xbox-insiders-is-removing-their-user-profiles/">VGC</a>) - and has now been made a mandatory download, so cannot be skipped.

The Xbox Insider program has been running for 15 years, but an issue this big is extremely rare. The scheme's <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxinsiders/">dedicated reddit is awash with complaints</a>, with <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxinsiders/comments/1j4n9bj/serious_preview_update_bug_factory_reset/">one user calling it</a> the "biggest bug I've ever seen release in all my years of being in the preview program".
</p>
<p>"This one actually factory reset my Series X," another user wrote. "It must've updated today and now my console is requiring me to set it up as brand new."
</p>
<p>"Light a candle for the guy here with a broken HDMI port and relies on remote play," wrote another. "Update messed everything up and now I cannot remote to my Series X, can't even see what is going on."</p>
<p>
While users can re-sign into their profiles and manually change back their settings, anyone impacted will lose time (and need to remember their passwords, including to any media apps).

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-announces-uk-ps5-rental-scheme-from-11month<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>You can now lease a PS5, along with the likes of a PS VR2 set and Sony's handheld remote player PlayStation Portal, here in the UK.</p>
<p>This leasing service debuted in Japan, and quickly became a hit. As Ed reported this morning, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-popularity-means-japans-ps5-rental-service-is-fully-booked">GEO's PS5 rental service in Japan is fully booked across its 400 stores nationwide</a>. It's been a monster (hunter) success, you could say.</p>
<p>And now, it is our turn. Sony's <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-gb/leasing">PS Direct UK website</a> lets you rent a digital-only PS5 for £11/month, or a PS5 with a disc drive for £12/month. Stump up £19/month and you can rent a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a>. If you want a PS VR2, it's £18.50/month - or £20/month if you want access to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/horizon-call-mountain">Horizon: Call of the Mountain</a> too. PlayStation Portal is £6.50/month.</p>

</figure>
<p>Those interested in going down the lease route can choose a 12, 24, or 36-month term contract, although there is also a rolling monthly option if that's more your thing. As for the products available through the service, you will be able to rent the following PlayStation items:</p>
<ul>
<li>PlayStation 5 Pro Console</li>
<li>PlayStation 5 Digital Edition Console (model group - slim)</li>
<li>PlayStation 5 Console (model group - slim)</li>
<li>PlayStation 5 Digital Edition Console - Two DualSense Wireless Controllers Bundle (model group - slim)</li>

<li>PlayStation VR2</li>
<li>DualSense Edge Wireless Controller</li>
</ul>
<p>In a <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-gb/support/leasing">FAQ section on the website</a>, Sony states all lease agreements are made exclusively with Raylo. "All transactions, communications, and support services related to your device lease will be provided directly by Raylo," the page reads. "If you've signed up to a lease through PlayStation leasing and you have any issues with your device or your lease, you should contact Raylo for support in the first instance."</p>
<p>It also states Raylo offers a fair wear and tear policy on the leased hardware.</p>
<p>"Don't worry, Raylo offer a fair wear and tear policy," Sony states. "It's ok to return your device with obvious signs of use such as a couple of deep scratches, small dents, discolouration or changes in the paintwork."</p>
<p>So, are you tempted?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-making-rare-creature-previously-locked-to-city-events-available-to-all<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a> developer Niantic has now announced official details for this summer's Go Fest event series, which will include the global release of a Pokémon previously locked behind paid City Safari meetups.
</p>
<p>
As detailed previously, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-fest-2025-to-be-held-in-paris">Go Fest 2025 will hold in-person events in Paris, Jersey City and Osaka</a> through late May and June. These will lead to the game's global Go Fest, which is now confirmed to take place on 28th and 29th June.
</p>
<p>
Today, Niantic confirmed Go Fest this year will see the release of Crowned Sword Zacian and Crowned Shield Zamazenta, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-gos-next-mythical-pokemon-teased-in-go-fest-logo">which players had deduced from this year's leaked Go Fest logo</a>. In a surprise, the event's main Mythical creature will be Volcanion, however - not Megearna as previously suspected. 
</p>
<p>
And in another surprise, it's been confirmed that Pokémon Go Fest Global will include the wider release of Skiddo, the cute goat creature you'd previously need to travel to City Safari event to capture. 
</p>
<p>
Through 2023 and 2024, Skiddo was only available if you visited Seoul, Barcelona, Mexico City, Tainan, Jakarta, Hong Kong and Sao Paulo at specific times. 
</p>
<p>
2025's City Safari events - so far confirmed for Milan, Singapore and Mumbai - now feature donkey Pokémon Mudbray as their new exclusive, signalling a wider release for Skiddo was on the cards.
</p>
<p>
This year may well include other changes to Pokémon Go, depending on the outcome of the game's reported sale. Last month, it was reported that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-fans-launch-campaign-to-protect-games-future-as-concerns-mount-over-sale">Niantic was planning to sell Pokémon Go to Monopoly Go maker Scopely</a> - a move which has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-developer-close-to-selling-games-for-35bn-to-saudi-owned-monopoly-go-maker-report">stoked concern amongst players due to Scopely's aggressive monetisation strategy</a> seen after it has taken over other mobile games.

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> maker Epic Games is suing a player accused of stealing and selling countless user accounts, and profiting further by flogging details of his tactics to other wannabe thieves.
</p>
<p>
Epic is seeking unspecified damages from Illinois Fortnite fan Isaac "i5aac" Strock for fraud, copyright infringement and unjust enrichment.
</p>
<p>
Strock is named in a <a href="https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/2025-02-27-epic-v--strock-complaint-5a69b553b2a2.pdf">legal filing dated 27th February</a>, which <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-anti-cheat-update-february-27-2025">Epic Games has also publicised via a recent blog post</a> - its latest move to name and shame those who target Fortnite with unscrupulous practices.
</p>
<p>
"Strock is in the business of stealing access to other players' Epic Games accounts," Epic Games wrote in its court filing. 
</p>
<p>
"He uses illicit means to discover the players' usernames and passwords and in some cases even the login credentials for the players' email address associated with the players' Epic Games account. He then sells access to these accounts to the highest bidders."
</p>
<p>
Epic Games estimates Strock has sold "hundreds" of player accounts and says he has boasted online about reaping "thousands of dollars in profits".
</p>
<p>
Strock is said to have even offered a guide on how to cheat Epic Games' player support and steal more accounts - again, for a price. 
</p>
<p>
Epic Games detected Strock on multiple occasions trying to bamboozle its player support with requests to change log-in details and gain access to accounts with valuable cosmetics or that had already been pre-loaded with Fortnite in-game currency.
</p>
<p>
Strock also used email and password combinations acquired in data breaches via the dark web to further add to his stolen account haul, the legal filing states.
</p>
<p>
The online trade in Fortnite accounts is lucrative, and accounts with rare skins are highly prized. Epic Games notes that some individual accounts sell for over $1000 each.
</p>
<p>
"Strock's actions harm Epic and the Fortnite community," the company concluded. "Epic has spent substantial resources investigating and working to prevent Strock's conduct. Strock's conduct also directly harms Fortnite players who no longer have access to the accounts they spent time and money on.
</p>
<p>
"Epic is entitled to all remedies available at law or equity, including injunctive relief, compensatory damages and/or other equitable or monetary remedies."
</p>
<p>
Last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-games-sues-fortnite-cheater-takes-back-winnings-and-forces-them-to-post-humiliating-public-apology-video-as-a-stark-warning-to-others">Epic Games announced its victory against a Fortnite competitive cheater who had tried to sneak their way into the game's biggest tournament</a>. Epic took back the player's winnings, forced them to post humiliating public apology video and then donated the prize money to charity.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-hunter-wilds-new-mod-addresses-stuttering-issues-caused-by-anti-tamper-tech.1126728/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mod-addresses-stuttering/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Many of the Monster Hunter Wilds performance issues on PC may have become a thing of the past, thanks to a new version of a popular mod available for all games powered by CAPCOM's RE Engine.</p>
<p>A few hours ago, modder Praydog released a new version of the REFramework mod, which significantly reduces the micro-stuttering issues caused by the game's anti-tamper tech by preventing constant scanning. The mod also addresses some crashing issues caused by DRM as well. You can find this new version of the mod on <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterwilds/mods/93?tab=files" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nexus Mods</a>, but if you're having issues with it like other users are reporting, you can use any of the previous nightly builds available on <a href="https://github.com/praydog/REFramework-nightly/releases" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a> that seem to be more stable as of now.</p>
<p>Performance issues aren't the only issues that impact the Monster Hunter Wilds experience, as the low challenge level for the story and a good portion of the postgame High Rank can be a little offputting for those who mastered previous generation games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-world-iceborne-ps4-review-experienced-hunters-only/">Monster Hunter World</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-rise-sunbreak-the-flame-of-kamura-burns-ever-hotter/">Monster Hunter Rise</a>. Thankfully, some mods are already available to address the low challenge level of the game, allowing hunters to<a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-new-mods-address-biggest-issues/"> increase both monsters' health and attack power.</a></p>
<p>The above issues aside, Monster Hunter Wilds is undoubtedly among the finest entries in the series. You can learn more about the game, now out on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S, by checking out my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/">review.</a></p>

            <p>One of Japan's biggest retailers began offering a PS5 rental service last week, but it's already fully booked thanks in large part to the popularity of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>.</p>
<p>GEO began offering the service on 28th February, neatly timed with the release of Capcom's latest monster hunting game. It's surprisingly cheap too, with a week's rental at around a fiver and two weeks for under a tenner.</p>
<p>However, the availability is completely blocked out until mid-April across all regions, as <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/japans-new-ps5-rental-is-massively-popular-with-service-fully-booked-across-all-regions/">Automaton</a> reported.

<p>Japanese players are notorious for maintaining the quality of their gaming tech, but I'm not convinced a similar service would work here in the UK. Too many sticky controllers.</p>
<p>GEO hasn't stated how many consoles are available for rental, but the service is being provided across its 400 stores nationwide - the fact it's booked up proves the service (and Monster Hunter Wilds) are extremely popular.</p>
<p>In fact, it's yet another example of the impact Capcom's game is having over in Japan.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Eurogamer reported <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-delectable-cuisine-causes-cheese-naan-sales-to-surge">cheese naan sales are on the rise thanks to Monster Hunter Wilds' delectable food scenes</a>.</p>
<p>One Tokyo-based Nepalese restaurant thanked Monster Hunter directly for boosting its cheese naan sales.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-has-a-truly-wild-debut-smashing-series-player-numbers-on-steam">Monster Hunter Wilds reached the highest concurrent player numbers on Steam for the series</a>, quickly reaching over 1.3 million players just a couple of days after launch. That's over four times higher than <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-world">Monster Hunter: World</a>, which reached more than 300,000 concurrent players.</p>
<p>Not only that, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-is-capcoms-fastest-selling-game-ever">Monster Hunter Wilds is Capcom's fastest-selling game ever</a>, reaching over 8m units sold in just three days across PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S.</p>

		<p>The unconfirmed but widely reported on Gears of War Collection is expected to be revealed Xbox Direct but ahead of that we may have some bad news as it seems like the pack will include co-op, but not multiplayer.</p>
<p>This all started yesterday when a Twitter user <a href="https://xcancel.com/DetectiveSeeds/status/1897091375457542358">Detective Seeds</a> posted “Gears of War collection should be releasing early to mid August. It is PS5 pro enhanced, but I have been told NO Multiplayer PVP, campaign focus only.” He then added “For further on Gears of War collection. The game is loaded onto PS storefront on the back end (this is the same with others I have said in the past). It shows 1 player and does not show support for additional players. I asked about co-op, but no clarification on that yet.”</p>


<p>As Detective Seeds has a relatively small Twitter following and no track record, this claim was widely dismissed. However, the following day, Window Central’s Jez Corden became aware of the claim and backed it up: “I too have heard no multiplayer.&nbsp;I’m not sure why they did it this way.”</p>
<p>As&nbsp; the posts suggest, we are expecting Gears of War to arrive on PlayStation for the<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/10/rumours-suggest-more-xbox-games-will-be-coming-to-ps5-and-switch/"> first time ever</a>, and with Forza arriving this April that just leaves Halo as the last big Microsoft exclusive to make the jump.</p>

<p>Elsewhere, there are rumours that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/09/gears-of-war-e-day-revealed-prequel-to-the-original-series/">Gears of War E-Day</a> is now scheduled for 2026.</p>
<p><em>Source: Reddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1j3zj7p/gears_of_war_collection_is_loaded_onto_ps/">1</a>/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1j4efhz/jez_corden_confirms_theres_no_pvp_multiplayer_in/">2</a></em></p>

			<p>A new Final Fantasy VII Rebirth patch is now live on PC, introducing a fix for an AMD Radeon GPUs-specific issue and some improvements.</p>
<p>The 1.00.3 patch, which is around 18.3 GB big for the Steam version of the game, introduces game stability improvements, fixing several unspecified bugs. The new patch also fixes an issue that caused crashes while playing the game using certain AMD Radeon GPUs and reduces the package size when downloading on Steam Deck, which is a great improvement for those who have limited storage space on their systems. Unfortunately, this seems to be <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2909400/view/527588008025654786?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noopener">everything the patch does</a>, so it's yet another minor patch that doesn't address the performance issue that many are experiencing.</p>
<p>Considering how the main development team seems to have fully moved on to the development of the third and final part of the Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy, it's not surprising to see Final Fantasy VII Rebirth not getting any new features. Thankfully, modders have come to the rescue once again, adding features not available in the vanilla game, such as a <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-mod-cid-vincent-party/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">special menu</a> that allows quick editing of the combat party and even adding Vincent and Cid to the party, although the two characters are not playable.</p>
<p>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is now available on PC and PlayStation 5 worldwide. You can learn more about the game by checking out our<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/"> review.</a></p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/until-dawn">Until Dawn Remake</a> players are still sharing bug reports with UK developer Ballistic Moon, but there's apparently no one left to respond. “The studio has effectively closed now," one anonymous source told <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/until-dawn-remake-developer-ballistic-moon-effectively-closed/">Insider Gaming</a>.</p>
<p>An undisclosed number of layoffs were <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ballistic-moon-layoffs/">publicly announced last September</a>, shortly before the Until Dawn remake's launch in October. According to IG's source, these amounted to "roughly 40 employees". "Around 20" developers were allegedly kept on for post-launch support until they themselves were laid off last December, leaving a handful of employees "at most" alongside studio founders. "There are no employees in public relations, marketing, or development left."</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Ballistic Moon were reportedly unsuccessful in their attempts to secure funding or publishers for new projects, despite pitches. New Until Dawn projects with publisher Sony were reportedly "discussed but never came to fruition". That's despite actors Peter Stomare and Hayden Panettiere both <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/until-dawn-actors-hint-at-a-sequel-but-theres-reason-to-be-sceptical">making possible hints toward a sequel last year</a>. Original Until Dawn creators Supermassive - who <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/until-dawn-devs-supermassive-announce-layoffs-with-150-jobs-reportedly-at-risk">went through a round of cuts last January</a> - have yet to make any announcements.</p>
<p>"Most who spoke said that it was a generally good place to work," write IG, although one of their sources claims that the layoffs followed overtime, and “weeks” of unpaid development work. “Nice reward for our hard work,” they said.</p>
<p>Ahem. Pay your workers. Pay your fucking workers. It's better that no-one does overtime but if they do, pay your fucking workers and pay them well. If you don't pay your workers, you shouldn't ever be allowed to be in a position of power as long as you live. Pay your workers. It would be better if nobody got laid off but if it happens, make sure you've paid your workers. Pay your fucking workers. Pay them. If you don't pay your workers they should be legally allowed to climb in through your window at dinner time and eat the chicken off your plate every night until they've eaten enough chicken to settle the debt. Pay your workers.</p>
<p>Sony and Ballistic Moon have yet to comment on IG's report. We've reached out for comment ourselves.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Minecraft developer Mojang has announced a new Minecraft Live event, to be held on 22nd March at 6pm UK time, and teased that it will contain "new game drops".
</p>
<p>
Does this mean new "drops" in existing Minecraft games, or the dropping of new Minecraft games entirely? The event's brief teaser video does not say.
</p>
<p>
Interestingly, however, the teaser does note that "exclusive movie content" is also on the way, separate to the ambiguous dropping mentioned above.

Mojang's Minecraft Movie tie-in is likely the A Minecraft Movie Hero Pack which leaked online last week. It contains character skins for the upcoming film's main roster - including a beardy Jack Black as Steve, and Aquaman in a pink jacket.

At <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecraft-live-digital-showcase-returns-later-this-month-with-news-about-our-games-and-more">the last Minecraft Live, in September 2024</a>, Mojang announced it was ditching its singular big summer update for multiple updates spread throughout the year. The next of these, presumably, will be revealed later this month.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/295k-minecraft-fans-criticise-lack-of-new-content-in-stop-the-mob-vote-petition">Minecraft Live has also now ditched its long-running mob vote</a>, after the process for voting on new creatures became too controversial, and some fans complained about their choices getting sidelined. Democracy!
</p>
<p>
In case you missed it, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecrafts-final-movie-trailer-is-more-of-the-same-but-at-least-jennifer-coolidge-is-in-it">Minecraft film's final trailer arrived last week and features Jennifer Coolidge being Jennifer Coolidge</a>, which is something to recommend about this movie at least. The film itself is out on 4th April.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/netflixs-witcher-casts-first-game-exclusive-character.1126701/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/netflixs-witcher-casts-first-game-exclusive-character<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>The fourth season of Netflix's Witcher adaptation is on its way, and we've now got word of a new character for the show. That's not <em>too </em>exciting in itself, but this particular addition to the show marks a notable change. You see, this is the Netflix series' first game-exclusive character to pop up on the small screen.</p>
<p>Since its conception, Netflix's Witcher team has refrained from adapting anything particularly game-specific, sticking instead with characters and beasties based on Andrzej Sapkowski's novels and short stories. Of course, there has been the occasional reference back to CDPR's own Sapkowski-based works, such as Henry Cavill's Geralt taking a nice, steamy bath (see header image above).</p>
<p>That's changing for the show's fourth season, however, with the reported addition of actor Jack Myers. According to Witcher fan site <a href="https://redanianintelligence.com/2025/03/01/netflixs-the-witcher-casts-its-first-character-from-the-games/">Redanian Intelligence</a>, Myers - who has starred in the likes of The Crown and Call the Midwife, as well as lending his vocal talents to games such as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> and Dying Light 2 - has landed the role of Roderick de Wett, a character from the original Witcher game.</p>
<figure>
<p>
<a aria-label="Horror Games Used To Be Scarier, Here's Why" data-lightbox="false" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PTnVyB1BkvQ?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">

<p>Now, if you haven't heard of Roderick de Wett, don't worry - he didn't exactly have a huge role in the first Witcher. He was a Nilfgaardian Count, and member of the religious knightly order known as The Order of the Flaming Rose (or sometimes just The Order).</p>
<p>Roderick isn't an especially nice chap, and Geralt isn't a fan of his. To give you an idea of his personality, here is what his <a href="https://www.playgwent.com/en/decks/61e8445b4b99d146d6c747b9631a83ce">Gwent card reads</a>:</p>
<p>"Count de Wett is exceptionally loathsome and arrogant, but at least he enjoys a little dice poker on the side."</p>
<p>While Roderick only - thus far - appears in CDPR's video game, there is a potential link to Sapkowski's written Witcher work. A Nilfgaardian noble by the name of Joachim de Wett pops up in books Time of Contempt, The Tower of the Swallow and The Lady of the Lake. Meanwhile, <a href="https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Joachim_de_Wett#Trivia">Joachim's skull can also be found in The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</a>. Given the name and both characters' backgrounds, it seems likely they are related in some way.</p>

<p>Myers won't be the only new face on the scene when The Witcher season four makes its debut. He will be joining newcomers <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-casts-laurence-fishburne-for-fourth-season-of-netflix-show">Laurence Fishburne as Regis</a> and Danny Woodburn as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflixs-the-witcher-series-adds-seinfeld-conan-star">Geralt's dwarf friend Zoltan Chivay</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witchers-liam-hemsworth-hadnt-watched-netflix-show-or-read-the-books-before-geralt-casting">Hunger Games star Liam Hemsworth is set to take on the mantle of The Witcher's white-haired monster hunter</a> for the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-confirms-the-witcher-season-5-will-be-its-last">show's final two seasons</a>, following the departure of Henry Cavill.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/throne-and-liberty-gets-wilds-of-talandre-expansion-today-new-zone-dungeons-systems-and-more/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>As <a href="https://wccftech.com/throne-and-liberty-gets-free-wilds-of-talandre-expansion-on-march-6/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promised</a> a while ago, NCSoft and Amazon are launching the Wilds of Talandre expansion for the MMORPG Throne and Liberty today in Western territories.</p>
<p>This free update adds a ton of new content to the game, starting with the titular new zone of Talandre, which expands the playable space with a region filled with new challenges and rewards. Players can explore the Temple of Truth, face off against powerful new field bosses, and advance their characters to level 55 while new events are slowly unlocked.</p>
<p>Talandre has long been inhospitable to settlement due to its rugged terrain and unusually rampant demonic beasts. However, it later became home to refugees fleeing the oppression of the Crimson Family, who founded the village of Herba. Still, due to the harsh environment and deadly monsters, much of the natural world remains untouched.</p>
<p>The Wilds of Talandre expansion adds Solo dungeons where players can hone their skills before going into Group dungeons, which are also being expanded with the new, more challenging 3-Star dungeons. There are three of them: Rancorwood, Hall of Tragedy, and Chapel of Madness, all of which are unlocked at the new level cap of 55.</p>
<p>If you're more into PvP, the new inter-server Nebula Island is a place where players can engage in PvP and PvE activities in six different regions, including one peaceful zone (Fog Forest) and four war zones where PvP is always enabled. Players can spend up to 7 hours per week on the island, with additional time available through Nebula Charge Stones. Nebula Island will be enabled in a week from now.</p>
<p>The Wilds of Talandre patch also revamps the Weapon mastery system and adds the new Artifact system. With regard to the former, Weapon mastery is now gained independently of which weapon the player has equipped; instead, they now have the option in the UI to select which weapon will receive the Weapon Mastery points. Mastery experience can also be increased through Weapon Mastery Seals acquired from various content. Lastly, Weapon mastery can now grow up to a maximum level of 200 per weapon.</p>
<p><iframe title="THRONE AND LIBERTY: Wilds of Talandre Deep Dive" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rHkOc0xoyy4?start=2&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As for Artifacts, they can be obtained from Nebula Island and the Abyss dungeons in Talandre. The system consists of six parts: 4 Talistones, a Solarstone and a Lunarstone, each with unique stats and effects. There are 14 different sets across three levels (2 Common, 4 Uncommon, and 8 Rare), with some stats randomly determined upon acquisition. Players can trigger set bonuses by equipping 2, 4, or 6 matching items from the same set. The Solar Stone grants an active ability, while the Lunar Stone grants a passive ability when equipped. Lastly, there are a few additions to the Lifestyle content featured in Throne and Liberty, such as 24 new fish, 10 new cooking recipes, and additional collectibles like the Cornelian Cherry Tree.</p>
<p>The Wilds of Talandre update also improves some aspects of combat and movement in Throne and Liberty. The basic attack range of short-range melee weapons was increased, the movement speed reduction that applied to characters while using attack skills was removed, the player character will be more responsive after using movement skills, and the camera can be rotated when executing skills that previously locked the camera.</p>

<p>According to a reliable insider, the Gears of War collection will not feature PvP but include campaign co-op.</p>



<p>Yesterday, new details about the Gears of War collection surfaced through Detective Seeds on <a href="https://x.com/DetectiveSeeds/status/1897139827772170355" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a>. Their post stated that the game was seemingly added to the PlayStation Store backend, revealing new information about it. The leaker reported that the game will arrive in mid-2025 (August) and will not include multiplayer PvP content; the focus will be only on the campaign. A reliable insider has now corroborated the information about the Gears of War collection not featuring multiplayer PvP.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jez Corden took to <a href="https://x.com/JezCorden/status/1897334037204946947" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> later to reveal what he knows about Gears of War Collection’s PvP status. In his recent thread on X, Corden stated, “I, too, have heard no multiplayer.” In the same thread, Corden was asked whether the collection would include campaign co-op, and he replied, “Yeah, co-op, but not PvP, is what I heard.”&nbsp;Corden has <a href="https://x.com/JezCorden/status/1897535168300163490" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">stated</a> that he is “looking into the Gears collection rumors” to find something concrete. </p>



<p><span>In his recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7FO40pCi8Y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YouTube video</a>, another leaker, eXtas1s, also revealed some details about the Gears of War Collection and E-Day</span>. According to him, the Gears of War collection will be revealed during the Xbox Showcase later this year, and the game will be available for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and PC on Day One. Gears of War E-Day is reportedly scheduled for 2026 but has a “slim” chance of being postponed to 2025.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/people-can-fly-is-co-developing-gears-of-war-e-day/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">People Can Fly</a> has been announced as the co-developer of Gears of War E-Day. Also, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gears-of-war-e-day-dimaggio-and-ferro/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">original voice actors for Marcus Fenix and Dom Santiago</a> are returning for the latest instalment in the series.

<p><a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/ea-play">EA Play</a> offers trials of "select new games" and unlimited access to "a collection of top EA titles" for £5.99 a month, while the pricier Pro version offers day one access to full, premium editions of "select new games" and unlimited access to a "library of premium edition EA titles" for £16.99 a month.</p>
<p>But Split Fiction - released under the EA Originals label - won't be included in either tier as a "select new game". Hazelight's previous games <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/it-takes-two">It Takes Two</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/a-way-out">A Way Out</a> are both included.</p>
<p>"It certainly seems like false advertising," wrote one forum user. "This is so unfair, EA Play Pro even increased the price and we still can't get the latest games," wrote another.</p>
<p>The latest additions to the service are <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ea-sports-fc24">EA Sports FC 24</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/f1-24">EA Sports F1 24</a>. The available game trials are all sports games.</p>
<p>Another of EA's other most recently published games, Dragon Age: The Veilguard, is also not available on the subscription - though it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-is-in-playstation-plus-next-month">added to PS Plus this month</a>. A trial was included at launch, but is no longer available.</p>

At least one paid copy of the game is required - unless you're playing the free demo together.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-review">Split Fiction received five stars in Eurogamer's review</a>. "Fantastic from start to finish, Split Fiction is one of the most inventive and joyful co-op games to date, and a testament to the power of human imagination," it reads.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>We don't score reviews at Rock Paper Shotgun. Some might tell you this is because we view numeric scores as stifling oversimplifications of the wonderful, strange, and personal experiences videogames can offer, but it's really because the refurbished work keyboards we're assigned when hired all have their number keys gummed up with Marmite and none of us want to touch them.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I have scored games in the past, however. Pay attention, because I'm about to divulge a tale of corruption so vile and petty that I fear my career will never recover: I have, on occasion, reluctantly docked 0.2% of a point from a game's review score for being awkward to alt+tab out of so I can take notes. I will not apologise. This is an accessibility feature. It's vital that I can access my notes doc at all times, lest I fail to capture some choice impression like "more like ASSassin's Creed: BOREigins lmao lol".</p>
<p>I've just today found out that <a href="https://youtu.be/e8jv24NjOWQ">Steam added a feature a year ago</a> that lets you pull up a notepad from the overlay tab and jot down thoughts, and I've only found out because a new update lets you now <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/notes/list">access these notes from the web</a> (cheers, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/software/platforms/steam-users-react-ecstatically-to-update-that-lets-them-access-their-heaving-game-notes-via-the-web-also-it-fixes-monster-hunter-wilds-video-recording/">PC Gamer</a>). People <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/1j3z2pt/notes_are_officially_on_web/">are apparently chuffed</a> about it! My first thought was "how is this useful to anyone except me specifically?".  Then I remembered those blank sections you'd sometimes get in the back of game manuals. Then I thought about recent games like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lorelei-and-the-laser-eyes">Lorelei And The Laser Eyes</a> or even <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/suikoden-i-and-ii-hd-remaster-gate-rune-and-dunan-unification-wars">Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remastered</a>. There are thankfully still games that embrace notetaking, and this feels like a reasonably untaxing feature on Steam's end.</p>

<p>There are, I'm discovering, plenty of other use cases. "I wish we could add notes to games on the wishlist. I have so many games that I've added over the years and can't remember why," Redditor bugfix00 writes. 

</p><p>Other redditor Madnesis adds: "Trying to paste a screenshot into my notes while using the Steam overlay would result in pasting a “⍰” instead of the actual screenshot. Man, I’m so glad I got a workaround but would have appreciated it sooner - so I could’ve saved all those STALKER 2 artifact spots in my notes Steam notes directly."</p>
<p>Alongside the web notes feature, the latest <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/545602406545622946">Steam beta update</a> also offers "improved display of notifications for in-progress achievements," in big picture mode, a fix to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> video recording, and support for the <a href="https://www.8bitdo.com/micro/">8BitDo Micro gamepad</a> - a tiny lozenge of a controller that looks fun to own but awkward to use, especially if you just had to type '8' and now have Marmite on your fingers.</p>

			<p>Despite having had a sort of blueprint for decades, top-down action role-playing games are a little hard to get right. Ever since the release of the original Diablo and its wildly more popular sequel, many games have attempted to replicate the experience crafted by Blizzard, and only a handful succeeded at providing satisfying experiences powered by the simple core gameplay loop of exploring dungeons, defeating enemies, obtaining new loot, improving character build to take on even more difficult challenges. Still, <a href="https://wccftech.com/path-of-exile-2-early-access-hands-on-the-arpg-that-could-rule-them-all/">Path of Exile</a> and a few other games proved that it is possible to challenge the dominance of the Diablo series by offering what ARPG players really want, which often involves a good wealth of customization options.</p>
<p>While it is too early to say if Eko Software's Dragonkin: The Banished will indeed be able to offer an experience that will please fans of the genre, the potential is most definitely there. The Early Access version currently only features the very first chapter of the adventure and some endgame activities that will likely get expanded once the game hits its 1.0 version, but what can be experienced is definitely promising, even in its current rough state.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250304135423_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>As those who tried the game's recent demo already know, Dragonkin: The Banished offers right from the beginning the chance to see the power level that the game's four characters will be able to reach, taking advantage of a prologue that sets the story up, detailing how the world was corrupted by the blood of dragons that is causing monstrous creatures to rise from the depths of the earth. While these characters do fall into the ARPG archetypes that are found in pretty much every game in the genre, they feel diverse enough. The Knight, for example, combines offense and defense for a varied playstyle; the Oracle utilizes elemental magic with different ranges and AOEs while also offering surprisingly good mobility options; the Barbarian hits harder and harder when the Rage value increases, showing his true strength when overwhelmed by enemy hordes. A fourth character that falls into the Ranger/Rogue archetype is also briefly available during the prologue but is not yet available for the main adventure.</p>
<p>While dominating enemies in the prologue using these prebuilt godlike heroes is fun for a short while, the prologue alone doesn't do a great job at highlighting some of the features that set Dragonkin: The Banished apart from similar games, as it only becomes possible to access the main menu, and thus the many customization options the game has to offer, only a few minutes after selecting the character among the Knight, Oracle and Barbarian, and reaching the City of Montescail, which serves as the main hub. One of these features is the Ancestral Grid, a massive grid that comes with different shapes that depend on the character it belongs to, and a huge number of nodes that are progressively unlocked as the character levels up, where it is possible to place Fragments, items collected from enemies that represent character skills and modifiers. What makes this system very interesting is how modifiers all have some pretty unique shapes that fit into multiple nodes and can affect multiple character skills depending on the placement, turning skill customization into a sort of engaging puzzle game that requires some serious optimization to get the best out of any modifier. The modifiers themselves look varied enough, as they grant tons of different properties to skills, including damage and speed boosts, so it definitely feels like the system has a ton of potential, even in its very first iteration.</p>
<p>Another feature that sets Dragonkin: The Banished apart from other ARPGs is the ability to bring a Wyrmling along, a small companion dragon that can be chosen among four different ones that come with their own unique elements, bonus attributes, and skills. Interestingly enough, the Wyrmlings' skills are also placed on the Arcane Grid and can be influenced by regular modifiers, further increasing customization options. In addition, when a character skill is affected by 8 or more modifiers, it enters Symbiosis with the currently equipped Wyrmling, increasing its power and granting it the elemental properties of the companion dragon. Achieving this requires perfect optimization of the Arcane Grid, which further makes the customization system way more involving than simply equipping skills and activating modifiers.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250304172246_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Even when it comes to its main hub, Dragonkin: The Banished attempts to do something slightly different from the norm. Instead of offering every possible service right at the start of the game, the City of Monstescail will evolve based on its Prosperity Level, which is increased by visiting the world and defeating major Dragons. Besides the Jeweler, who can produce rings with items looted after defeating enemies, the Apothecary, who can upgrade potions, and the Dark Merchant, who buys from the player unwanted items, more services will be added in future versions of the game to give players even more reasons to fully explore the world and increase the city's prosperity.</p>
<p>Despite being in Early Access, Dragonkin: The Banished already offers plenty of replay value, with multiple difficulty levels that also increase rewards and quality of loot, and proper endgame activities like hunts, unique quests of variable durations, difficulty, and rewards, and Dungeon Purification, where the player has to close a rift at the end of dungeons. All of these activities allow the player to push the limits of the current gameplay systems to the maximum, allowing them to get their hands on powerful loot and Fragments, although, with potentially huge changes on the horizon, spending too much time on these activities may not be very worthwhile right now.</p>
<p>The potential big changes coming to Dragonkin: The Banished in the future aren't the only thing that may not make it worthwhile for most players to start playing the game right away in its first iteration. The unfinished user interface, plenty of bugs, including some progression blockers that, at least, are not critical, textures loading in seconds after a new area is loaded, missing resolution options suddenly becoming available, wonky controller support and general lack of the most basic polish are only some of the issues that suggest the game wasn't exactly ready for even an Early Access release, so it may be wise to wait for a few patches before diving in.</p>
<p>In its first few minutes, Dragonkin: The Banished gives off a feeling of "been there, done that already", but the gameplay systems that come into play as the player sets off in the game's corrupted world hint at greater things to come, even in their current rough state. Eko Software is committed to updating its game with new features, and I'm really interested to see how the game's decent foundation will be improved in the future before its proper 1.0 release and if all the improvements will truly be able to set the game apart from the likes of Diablo IV and Path of Exile 2.</p>

It is a curse of death that consumes the continent. A Warlock who coveted Death, devoured people and animals and enveloped the world in despair. For thousands of years the line of kings has sealed the Abyss. But now, the king has vanished, and the world is being consumed by death, moment by moment. Resistance itself is meaningless. There is naught but to perish.</p><p><strong>Overview</strong></p><p><em>Wizardry Variants Daphne</em> is a 3D dungeon RPG, a completely new addition to the <em>Wizardry</em> series. The game system follows the play cycle of the traditional 3D dungeon RPGs, with players progressing deeper into dungeons called Abyss, by repeatedly getting stronger, resupplying in towns, and battling and collecting items in dungeons. Battles with enemies proceed in a command battle system, and a formation of up to six characters, including the player, can enjoy highly strategic battles that make full use of spells and skills.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
