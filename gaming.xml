			<p>PlayStation Plus is about to celebrate 15 years this coming June 29, after the service was first launched on June 29, 2010. We've already heard about some of the celebratory actions the company is taking to commemorate the milestone that went along with the announcement of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-celebrates-ps-plus-15-year-anniversary-reveals-july-2025-ps-plus-essential-games-including-diablo-iv-and-jusant/">July 2025 monthly PS Plus Essential games</a>.</p>
<p>Also part of the commemoration, Nick Maguire, vice president of global services at Sony Interactive Entertainment, spoke with <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/playstation-plus-15th-anniversary-interview-ghost-of-tsushima">Game File</a> about the previous 15 years and where the service currently is.</p>
<p>After SIE president and chief executive officer Hideaki Nishino revealed that more players are choosing the PS Plus Extra and Premium tiers, Maguire backed up Nishino's comments, and added that "<em>Engagement in Plus has never been higher than it is right now,</em>" which is due in part to the restructuring of the service PlayStation announced in 2022.</p>
<p>The switch from the old PS Plus model to the current tiered model "<em>surpassed our expectations</em>," Maguire said. "<em>It's really given us a new way to reach the audiences with these games, and it's given new value to partners to find new people to play their titles. And just the engagement we see from it is really positive, in terms of the number of people choosing that Catalog and coming back month after month</em>."</p>
<p>Magurie did not talk about how the prices have gone up, only saying "<em>I think we just want to invest in Plus. We want to invest in the proposition, bring more value to users. And we're seeing high growth in Extra, Premium</em>."</p>
<p>When Nishino was asked about the price increases just a couple of weeks ago, he said the increases were part of Sony "<em>increasing value we bring to the players</em>," and it's clear from how many players continue to choose the Extra and Premium tiers that the increases aren't exactly hurting subscriber numbers.</p>
<p>On a separate matter, Maguire did make it clear that Sony has no intention of adding its first-party, PlayStation Studios-developed titles to the PlayStation Plus service on day one. Instead, PlayStation will continue to add third-party titles on day one where it sees a good fit, like how <a href="https://wccftech.com/fbc-firebreak-and-battlefield-2042-headline-june-2025s-ps-plus-extra-and-premium-game-catalog-additions/">FBC: Firebreak</a> recently launched into the service.</p>
<p>"<em>We've sort of stayed true to our strategy across the board, where we're not looking to put games in day and date. Our strategy of finding four or five independent day-and-date titles - and using that to complement our strategy of bringing games in when they're 12, 18 months old or older - that balance for us is working really well across the platform</em>."</p>
<p>And, if the opportunities are there, Sony wouldn't stop at just four or five independent games. "<em>If there were six or seven great opportunities, then we would go for them as well</em>," Maguire added.</p>
<p>Maguire also declined to comment on whether he thought that adding first-party multiplayer games like Concord to the service would be a benefit, and if Concord might've had a better chance were it launched directly into the PS Plus service.</p>
<p>"<em>I think Plus has proven itself to be a great way to introduce new players to franchises. So I think there's always going to be a moment for any game where there's the right time for it to go into Plus, when it's ready to reach a wider audience or...to find new fans or new parts of our platform that it hasn't already reached</em>," said Maguire.</p>
<p>Beyond the price increases, and the lack of first-party games added to the service day one, Game File also had Maguire address, as much as he was willing, the other big topic of conversation players have around the service, <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-is-removing-20-games-from-ps-plus-including-some-first-party-titles-just-after-the-latest-ps-plus-price-hike/">games being removed from the catalog</a>.</p>
<p>He doesn't directly address the removal of older first-party titles, like how the Resistance games were recently taken off the PS Plus Game Catalog list, but said "<em>We've got 80 collections of games across the catalog, so we want to keep it fresh and bring in new games. Sometimes that means taking a few games out at the same time to keep the proposition interesting and help people find new games as well</em>."</p>
<p>The modern day subscription service is shaking up its offerings all the time. Whether its PlayStation Plus, Xbox Game Pass, Netflix, etc., things are added and taken away from them on a regular basis. But it remains mind-boggling that PlayStation would remove its first-party titles, especially when they're games that are difficult to play any other way if you don't have original hardware.</p>
<p>At the very least, Maguire says that he does read the comments players leave on PS Plus-specific posts, and that he thinks "<em>It can be helpful to understand where people are at, and, if we can, take that into our learnings in the future</em>."</p>
<p>"<em>I think we'll continue to listen and learn about what gamers want and try to bring more value in for them. We're very proud of what we've delivered in the last few years. And excited to sort of see the response and the engagement we get from players coming in</em>."</p>

			<p>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II Enhanced will launch on PC and consoles on August 12, Microsoft <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/06/25/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-enhanced-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> today.</p>
<p>The enhanced edition of the second entry in the series, released <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-the-perfect-game-pass-experience/">last year</a> on PC and Xbox Series X|S, will launch as a free upgrade for owners of the original release. On PlayStation 5, users will be able to purchase either the Standard Edition for $49.99, which includes the base game with some additional features, or the Deluxe Edition for $69.99, which includes the base game as well as a PS5-optimized version of Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice. Owners of the PlayStation 4 version of the first entry in the series will receive a free upgrade to the PlayStation 5 version.</p>
<p>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II Enhanced has some new features over last year's release, making it the definitive edition of the game, no matter the platform. One of the biggest additions is Performance Mode on Xbox Series X, offering 60 FPS gameplay for the first time on consoles. On PC, the Enhanced edition will introduce a Very High preset to push visual fidelity further. The Enhanced edition will also make the game a Steam Deck Verified title, with optimizations aimed at delivering a smooth experience on the handheld system. Also coming with the new edition of the game is a new optional play mode that sees the return of the Dark Rot, an enhanced photo mode, and developer commentary.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Team Ninja and Xbox have announced the PS5 release date for&nbsp;<em>Senua's Saga: Hellblade II</em>, as well as the new enhancements current owners on Xbox and PC can expect.</p>

<p>Per a <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/06/25/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-enhanced-update/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on Xbox Wire, the followup to 2017's&nbsp;<em>Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice&nbsp;</em>will <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-ps5" rel="nofollow">arrive on PS5</a> on August 12th. This won't be the first time the franchise has appeared on PlayStation, of course;&nbsp;<em>Senua's Sacrifice&nbsp;</em>got itself a PS4 release, after all.</p>

<p>Still, the game's release on PS5 marks an increasingly friendly approach to PlayStation on Xbox's part. Many of the studio's games are making their way to PlayStation now, including upcoming titles like&nbsp;<em>The Outer Worlds 2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gears-of-war-reloaded-announced" rel="nofollow"><em>Gears of War: Reloaded</em></a>.</p>

<p>Those include a new Performance Mode, which will allow you to play at 60fps on PS5 and Xbox Series X (but not S, unfortunately). The PC version will also include a new Very High graphics preset, allowing you to push more powerful rigs to their limit.</p>

<p>Additionally, Xbox and Team Ninja say that when the enhanced version of&nbsp;<em>Senua's Saga&nbsp;</em>launches, it'll be Steam Deck Verified, so you'll be able to enjoy it on your handheld PC as well.</p>

<p>A new Dark Rot mode, which makes its return from the first game, will also be added to the sequel. Every time you fail, the Dark Rot will advance, and when it reaches Senua's head, you'll fail your run and all of your progress will be lost.</p>




<p>If you pick up the Deluxe Edition of&nbsp;<em>Hellblade II</em>&nbsp;on PS5, you'll also get a version of&nbsp;<em>Senua's Sacrifice&nbsp;</em>enhanced for the PS5, so if you haven't played that game yet, now's your chance.</p>

<p><em>Senua's Saga: Hellblade II&nbsp;</em>is, believe it or not, the sequel to 2017's&nbsp;<em>Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice</em>. It once again follows Senua, who's on a quest to rescue her countrymen from the Northmen.</p>

<p>You can pick the game up right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2461850/Senuas_Saga_Hellblade_II/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/senuas-saga-hellblade-II" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and it's coming to <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10012536" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS5</a> on August 12th.</p>

Now, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S owners are getting their chance to play I Am Your Beast.</p><p>On June 25, I Am Your Beast will officially go live on PSN and Xbox Live. In the game’s story, Harding has left his life of espionage and action behind him, even when his former employers at the Covert Operations Initiative try to entice him back for one final mission. When Harding turns down COI, it responds by sending countless agents to put him in an early grave.

Nine new levels were added to the game, as well as an epilogue that gave players even more ridiculously over-the-top action. The epilogue is taken from the accounts of the few COI agents who managed to survive Harding's wrath, and in their retelling he has superhuman abilities that break the laws of reason and physics.</p><p>I Am Your Beast was ported to iOS earlier this year without the added features that were included in the expansion. However, the mobile version of the game is also receiving a major update that will make it "feature-complete" with all of the material included with its PC and console ports.

                <p>Microsoft releases its own first-party Xbox games on Game Pass at launch, but Sony does not do this--and it's not planning to change that strategy going forward.</p><p>PlayStation services executive Nick Maguire told <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/playstation-plus-15th-anniversary-interview-ghost-of-tsushima" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game File</a> that Sony has "stayed true to our strategy across the board," and that means no day-one new releases on PS Plus. "We're not looking to put games in day and date," Maguire said.</p><p>Back in 2022, PlayStation boss Jim Ryan--who has since left the company--said the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-boss-on-why-it-wont-launch-games-day-one-on-ps-plus-like-xbox-game-pass/1100-6501975/" data-ref-id="1100-6501975">"virtuous cycle"</a> of Sony's business plans for gaming would be "broken" if Sony launched its new games into PS Plus.</p><p>"The level of investment that we need to make in our studios would not be possible, and we think the knock-on effect on the quality of the games that we make would not be something that gamers want."</p><p>The cycle, as Ryan described it is that, "the investment delivers success, which enables yet more investment, which delivers yet more success."</p><p>However, Ryan also acknowledged at the time that Sony wasn't married to this idea and would be open to changing its stance based on market conditions. In the three years since Ryan said this, however, Sony has not changed its stance, and the new comments from Maguire make it sound like it's not changing soon.</p><p>Also in the Game File interview, Maguire was asked if Sony's ill-fated live-service shooter Concord may have fared better had it been released on PS Plus at launch. Maguire declined to comment on that game specifically, but he said PS Plus has "proven itself to be a great way to introduce new players to franchises."</p><p>Maguire said the calculus comes down to finding the "right time" for a game to enter PS Plus to help it reach a wider audience after its initial debut. This could help a game "find new fans" or reach "new parts of our platform that it hasn't already reached," he said.</p><p>While Sony doesn't plan to launch its own games into PS Plus day-and-date, the company is partnering with third-party studios to debut new titles into the subscription service. FBC: Firebreak was a recent example of this. Going forward, Maguire said Sony aims to find four or five games each year to launch into PS Plus day-and-date, with Sony's own games coming to the service after a year, 18 months, or longer.</p><p>"That balance for us is working really well across the platform," Maguire said, adding that the four-to-five day-one third-party games each year is not a strict number but a ballpark estimate.</p>

<figure><a title="level 5 AI" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/bb882ca401494/level-5-ai.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Level-5</em></figcaption></figure><p>We've been seeing the AI-related opinions a video game creator bandied about a bit already over the past few days, with Smash Bros' director Masahiro Sakurai being ever-so-slightly <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/smash-bros-director-sakurai-laments-unsustainable-aaa-game-dev-discusses-ai-and-uncertainty">mistranslated in his thoughts</a> over the use of the new tech in artistic endeavours.</p>
<p>Now Level-5's CEO, Akihiro Hino, has been put in a bit of a similar situation, it seems. According to some reports that have popped up online in the past day or two, Hino had said that "Right now, around 80~90% of games are made by AI" when asked about the technology during an interview.</p><p><figure data-videoid="vhRubWa3khQ" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vhRubWa3khQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vhRubWa3khQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vhRubWa3khQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed598179xrtvlg&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>824k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhRubWa3khQ">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>However, and as explained thoroughly by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ninpatentswatch.bsky.social/post/3lsgcnhens22r">Nintendo Patents Watch</a> in a social media post, Hino's statement was taken right out of context for the sake of drama.</p>

<p>Indeed, reading through Nintendo Patents Watch's translation, it sounds like Hino isn't particularly keen on AI as a creative tool at all, whilst acknowledging its uses. As the translation of Hino's words put it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"...creativity cannot be completely handed over to AI, it is more of a tool for communication and efficiency improvement. For example, some planners who don't know how to draw can use AI to generate sketches to help express ideas and facilitate communication with artists."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The key here is that AI is more of an assistant, something which helps rather than actually <em>does</em>. He backs this further in the article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"But the very content generated by AI will not be directly used in the game...AI can help us handle certain things more efficiently … but to complete the enormous game volume it requires the creatives to produce and direct the final content output."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hino also addresses fans who complained about game delays, such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Fantasy Life i</a>, despite the studio reportedly using AI. However, that's "not the case". And given the size of that game, well, it's not surprising it took so long to come out. And it's fantastic.</p>
<p>So, that actually sounds fairly reasonable, or as reasonable as one can be when seeking to hold AI up in a positive light, we guess. Much as was the case with Sakurai, this is just another situation where cherry-picked quotes have been taken out of context.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-tips-tricks">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>’s next Enhanced boss is Fulghor, Champion of Nightglow, developers From Software have confirmed. You’ll be able to get your teeth into him from June 26th at 4pm Central European Summer Time, 7am Pacific Daylight Time, or 11pm Japan Standard Time.</p>
<p>These timezone distinctions are meaningless, of course, because there is only one timezone in which Fulghor operates, and that timezone is Butt Kicking Time. He’s one of the co-op <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>’s harder scraps, and he’ll be all the worse for being Enhanced.</p><!--more-->
<p>From and Bandai Namco <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/surprise-elden-ring-nightreigns-first-enhanced-boss-has-arrived-kicking-off-weekly-big-baddie-visits">released the first Enhanced Nightreign boss</a> - aka, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-everdark-sovereigns">Everdark Sovereign</a> – earlier this month. They got the ball rolling with a hulked-up version of Gaping Jaw, who is an absolute pushover next to Fulghor - third easiest in the game, according to our recommended <a elden-ring-nightreign-main-boss-order"="" href"https:="" www.rockpapershotgun.com="">Elden Ring Nightreign boss play order</a>.</p>
<p>You’ll need to defeat the base edition of each boss before you can take a pop at the Everdark variety. Beat an Everdark Sovereign before they're taken out of rotation, and you’ll earn <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sigil">Sigil</a> tokens to spend on special relics. Whether this is worth the terrible tingling sensation of repeated defeat is a question only you, a Gamer, can answer. </p>
<p>Fulghor, then. According to our intrepid guides wrangler John Schutt, you’re best off duelling him with a lightning weapon and some kind of status effect capacity. You’ll want to keep a dispersed formation because Fulghor’s swings cover a lot of ground. But you’ll also want to be close enough to stagger him when he threatens to do his spear-slamming routine. Read more in our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-how-to-beat-fulghor">Elden Ring: Nightreign - how to beat Fulghor guide</a>.</p>
<p>It’s not yet clear how the New &amp; Improved Fulghor differs, but <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreigns-new-enhanced-boss-fights-have-leaked-early-thanks-to-nosy-modders">past reporting</a> has pointed to a third combat phase. “Third time’s the charm,” I hoot and holler to myself, as I am impaled from below by golden spears. Who's next for Everdarkening? Sentient Pest, apparently. Ah, that's not so bad.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-latest-elden-ring-nightreign-enhanced-boss-is-plenty-tough-enough-without-the-everdark-treatment]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">UK Games Expo, Britain’s biggest tabletop gaming convention, is a delicious smorgasbord of every kind of physical game imaginable. But if there’s one thing that’s dominating this year’s event, it’s Star Wars. And no wonder: it’s a hugely popular franchise that’s currently enjoying a gaming renaissance with multiple titles getting ongoing support. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Expo is showcasing the newest and upcoming releases for three <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-star-wars-board-games">Star Wars board games</a> and card games: the collectible card game Star Wars: Unlimited, the miniature skirmish game Star Wars: Shatterpoint, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cooperative-board-games">cooperative board game</a> The Mandalorian: Adventures.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Featured in this article</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-the-mandalorian-adventures-board-game-review">The Mandalorian: Adventures</a> has a new expansion, Clan of Two, based on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-mandalorian-season-2-review">season two</a> of the TV show that inspired the game. “As big Star Wars fans, we wanted to make sure players feel like they're experiencing the episodes right  on your tabletop,” said Josh Beppler, who co-created the game alongside veteran designer Corey Konieczka. “An expansion was something we always had hoped to accomplish because there is such lovely source material to pull from. Season two of the show was such a massive success, we were eager to get to work on the new characters that were just immense fan favorites.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Clan of Two adds some new playable characters from the wider Star Wars universe such as Ahsoka Tano and Fennec Shand alongside legendary foes like the Krayt Dragon. But of course, that’s one of the joys of the franchise: there’s so much of it to draw on for inspiration. “What we choose to add is based on a lot of different factors,” Shatterpoint’s lead designer Will Shick explained. “Sometimes it's just a character that we really love in the office and have a great idea for. Sometimes it's based on inspiration for a sculpt. A lot of times it's based on whatever’s really popular among fans.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’ve looked at the release schedule for the game, you might have noticed that diversity has led them to some slightly surprising places. “We’re going to do a shark man from space,” Shick grins. “It’s so cool.” He’s talking about Riff Tamson the Karkarodon, who’s included in the upcoming Terror from Below set. It’s also an opportunity for the team to introduce a new keyword to the game, 'Aquatic,' unlocking new possible builds. Shatterpoint is noteworthy for nudging players toward taking thematic teams by using these shared keywords to create powerful combos, and this is no exception.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/24/1-1750793364296.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">“That’s a totally deliberate design,” Shick continues. “We found the best way to develop games is to bake in soft bonuses. Or little guideposts that say, hey, this character does something really cool, but if you take this character with another thematically paired character, they both do something even better. It doesn't force the player's hand. It’s just that if you play thematically, those bonuses might be more valuable than you taking a min-max approach.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Keywords are also a part of collectible card game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-unlimited-card-game-review">Star Wars Unlimited</a>. But as a system that needs a lot of new cards dropped with each new set, they’re used differently. There was already an existing “Force” keyword for Jedi and Sith, but for the newest set, Legends of the Force, the designers built on that by making the Force use a distinct mechanic. Some of the game’s starting bases allow you to gain a Force token which you can spend to unlock powerful abilities on particular cards, while others give you the chance to regain the token.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a mechanically interesting system, although not necessarily that well tied-in with Star Wars lore, but the designers are open about wanting fun to come first. “We tried a lot of different iterations of this mechanic,” designer Joe O’Neill explained. “Some that required you to use your deck to draw cards that gained you the Force, but that often felt very inconsistent. One piece of gameplay that is always in play is your base. So using that allowed us to create this as an opt-in decision that didn't require any re-writing of rules, didn’t require you to draw specific cards, and then feel like you’re missing out by not drawing the right thing.”</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/24/4-1750793379203.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Using the base also leans into what many collectible game players love most about their systems: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deck-building-board-games">deck-building</a>. “If you're choosing to run a heavy Force deck that means you don't get access to energy conversion bases,” O’Neill continued. “So you have to choose between some of the strongest abilities in the game. You don't get to run everything and we think that choice is really meaningful and an interesting deck-building decision.” His co-designer John Leto finished up by pointing out that “there are other ways to gain the Force throughout the set which feel thematic. A lot of the bases we chose were places that were important to the Force, like the crystal caves.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While collectible games like Star Wars Unlimited want to cram as much variety into new material as possible, less malleable formats often use expansions as a way to respond to player feedback from the original game. The Mandalorian, which some fans felt was too short in only offering four missions, is no exception. “The expansion adds four more, so it doubles the amount of maps,” says Beppler. “All the missions can be played on the new maps. It’s all interchangeable. You can take any of the new characters, team them up with base game characters, finding new synergies and combos. I think exploring old missions with these new abilities will give the game a lot of new life.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He’s hopeful that other tweaks might win over some gamers who passed on the original. “The biggest example is probably the duel deck,” he offered. “It's such a cinematic way to experience a fight. And it really helps make the theme of these characters stand out.” He’s also included new options that substantially increase the challenge if you found the base game too easy. “We've added conditional ongoing events which sit in an action slot and give you a negative consequence until you clear it,” he continues. “We also created deadlier versions of some of the weaker events from the first game. It’s all optional – you can stay in novice mode, and you’re going to have a great time but you will miss some of the deep strategy that emerges from the gameplay.”</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/24/shatterpoint-1750794975737.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Similarly, some of the upcoming Shatterpoint material helps answer a common gripe that the scenarios aren’t varied enough. “We’ve just had a brand new key operation drop, they add a thematic campaign mode that you can play,” explained Ross Thompson, the director of marketing at Atomic Mass Games. “And we're getting ready to release new tournament kits, too, which will include promo cards, posters and that kind of stuff. Then we’ll have galactic legends coming later this year where you can play as one character that you really want to get into.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Shick fills in with more detail on this new play mode. “One player will get to control a super-powered main character,” he explains. “So Darth Vader as we see him on screen, not balanced for the game. Then two other players take squads of primary or secondary and supporting characters. It's a really interesting narrative because one player gets to feel super powerful, while the other player gets that experience of being like, oh my gosh, I'm going against the big guy, how do we come out on top?”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Most ongoing miniatures games encounter the need to tweak and rebalance characters as the game goes on, and Shatterpoint is no exception. However, in the age of online material and army-building apps they’ve taken the unusual step of releasing updated cards and encouraging players to print out the updates. “<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-print-and-play-board-games">Print and play</a> offers the flexibility to make those changes and offer them to players widely, ensuring that they're free and not behind a paywall,” said Shick.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This feels like a remarkably forward-thinking attitude in a sector that’s dominated by power creep and “fear of missing out” marketing. “We're not too proud to admit the fact that, like game development, design is a craft,” says Shick. “Once a game goes out into the wild, players might do different things to what you anticipated. So we want to make sure that we’re honoring people’s collections, that we’re bringing that value and making the best game possible, both going forward and looking back. If a player picks up a starter box and gets massively appealing characters like Anakin and Ahsoka, they better feel good. We want to ensure they play just as well as they did when the game came out." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Talk like this is undeniably inspiring. It’s refreshing to talk to designers and feel like they’re truly invested in what they’re doing. It’s true of all the creatives on these games: their enthusiasm for their work and from Star Wars radiates off them as we speak. The Star Wars Unlimited team even collects their own product from booster packs. “We have an entire Teams channel at work just for trading within the studio,” O’Neil laughed. “People post their wants list and when the set comes out we all sit down and all crack our boxes, then set up trades.” And you know that a game design team is doing good work when they’re eagerly looking forward to finishing the day and going on to eat their own dog food.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Thrower is a contributing freelance writer for IGN, specializing in tabletop games.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II Playstation 5 Official Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>PS5 owners looking to experience the full story can grab a deluxe edition of Hellblade 2 for $70, which includes Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice optimized for the console and its original soundtrack. If you already own the PS4 version, you can upgrade to the PS5 edition for free.</p><p>For the new features, players can once again take on the malicious Dark Rot in an additional challenge mode, and in the upgraded photo mode, several improvements have been made and an all-new "Motion" tab for custom cinematic video capture has been added.</p><p>The commentary tracks from the developers also sound interesting, as there's over four hours of audio from the game's cast, the Ninja Theory team, and people who helped the team to respectfully convey Senua's experience of psychosis. It's not known if studio founder Tameem Antoniades is included, as he is no longer with the company.</p><p>Microsoft has had many successful releases on PS5 lately, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-game-hellblade-2-coming-to-ps5-soon/1100-6531706/">as several of the best-selling games for April 2025 on PlayStation</a> in the US were all published by the company. Forza Horizon 5 and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle have been big winners on Sony's platform, and Hellblade 2 won't be the only game arriving in August.</p><p>It'll be joined by Gears of War Reloaded--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gears-of-war-reloaded-remaster-coming-this-august-to-xbox-playstation-and-pc/1100-6531314/">which launches on August 26</a>--and the game will support cross-play and cross-progression on all platforms that it launches for.</p>

            <p>Sony has revealed the line-up for PlayStation Plus this July. These games land during the 15th anniversary of PlayStation Plus, a big milestone for the service.</p>

<p>The PlayStation Plus games for July are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Diablo 4 (PS5, PS4) - available 1st July</li>
<li>Jusant (PS5) - available 1st July</li>
<li>King of Fighters 15 (PS5, PS4) - available 1st July</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, the following activities will be available throughout July, until early August:</p>
<ul>
<li>A trial version of WWE 2K25 will be available to PS Plus Premium members (available 25th June)</li>
<li>A trial version of Monster Hunter: Wilds (available 30th June)</li>
<li>Discounts on select games like Sniper Elite: Resistance, Sid Meier's Civilization 7 and Star Wars Outlaws (running during the weekend starting 27th June)</li>
<li>Free Valorant pack for all PlayStation Plus members, including: two Prelude to Chaos Gun Buddies, a Kohaku and Matsuba Player Card, an Imperium Spray, a Chronovoid Spray, and ten Radianite Points.</li>
<li>Special PlayStation Plus PlayStation tournaments for EA Sports FC, NBA 2K, UFC, Madden NFL, College Football, Tekken 8, and more (available 28th June) </li>
<li>A 15 percent discount on Sony Pictures Core for all PlayStation Plus subscribers (available 25th June until 12th August)</li>
<li>A free multiplayer weekend, where those without PlayStation Plus memberships can play online for free (available 28th June)</li>
</ul>
<p>It's wild to think PlayStation Plus is 15-years-old! The service, alongside Xbox Game Pass, has absolutely changed the game development marketplace. Not only has it shifted the perceived value of games (arguably for the worse), but it's also offered another way for developers to survive in what has been a damn awful few years in the industry.</p>
<p>As for this line-up, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/diablo-4-review-richness-luxury-and-compromise">Diablo 4 is clearly the star of the show</a>. A massive, ambitious sequel to a gaming giant, the game went back to its violent horror roots in a powerful and moreish way.</p>
<p>That's not to say the other two games are stinkers! <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/jusant-review">Jusant is by all accounts a lovely game to spend your evenings playing</a>, while King of Fighters 15 is a superb fighter filled with equal parts style and quality design.</p>
<p>Those 15th anniversary events are a nice touch too! <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-suffering-an-influx-of-overwhelmingly-negative-steam-reviews-can-capcom-turn-around-monster-hunter-wilds-with-the-upcoming-title-update-2">Monster Hunter: Wilds has been in a better place sure</a>, but if you were ever curious to see what all the noise was about now is as good a time as any to try it out. Those PlayStation tournaments are rad too, a good chance to battle it out online in your favourite competitive game.</p>
<p>Full details on this month's PS Plus offerings can be found on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/06/25/playstation-plus-monthly-games-for-july-a-big-thank-you-to-players-for-15-wonderful-years/">PlayStation Blog</a>. </p>
<p>All in all, a solid offering this month! Meanwhile, you'll find more details on what else is on offer via the service in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plus-games-list-premium-extra-this-month-6300">our full PlayStation Plus guide here</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/here-are-our-ps-plus-games-for-july]]></content:encoded>

<p>Nintendo recently hosted a special Direct presentation for Donkey Kong Bananza, during which it introduced a number of new gameplay features, including the ability to transform into new 'Bananza' forms, a special in-game shop to purchase costumes, and the 'DK Artist' mode where you can sculpt and paint objects and characters.</p>
<p>It's looking pretty sweet, and we seriously can't wait to get our hands on the final game next month.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The three PS Plus Essential-tier games that subscribers can add to their library for free with their subscriptions for July 2025 have been announced, headlined by Diablo IV, and supported by Jusant and King of Fighters XV.</p>
<p>Along with these games being part of PlayStation's monthly routine to add more games to its PS Plus service, they're also part of the company's celebrations for the 15-year anniversary of <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-will-continue-to-adjust-playstation-plus-pricing-says-more-players-are-choosing-the-extra-and-premium-tiers/">PlayStation Plus</a>, which launched on June 29, 2010.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>"<em>We hope you can join us for a number of celebratory activities we have planned this summer to commemorate this incredible milestone,</em>" wrote Nick Maguire, vice president of global services, global sales, and business operations at Sony Interactive Entertainment, in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/06/25/playstation-plus-monthly-games-for-july-a-big-thank-you-to-players-for-15-wonderful-years/">PlayStation Blog post</a>.</p>
<p>Diablo IV, Jusant, and The King of Fighters XV will all be available for PS Plus subscribers beginning on July 1, though there are more benefits and discounts subscribers can take advantage of this week as part of the PlayStation Plus anniversary celebrations.</p>
<p>One of the more notable aspects of the celebrations is that this weekend, June 28-29 will be another free online multiplayer weekend, where all PlayStation players, whether they have a PS Plus subscription or not, will be able to hop online and play with their friends.</p>
<p>Some of the benefits are exclusive to the PS Plus Premium tier, with Premium subscribers getting access to a 15% discount on films available through the Sony Pictures Core app. Premium subscribers also get access to a Monster Hunter Wilds game trial and a WWE 2K25 game trial.</p>
<p>All PS Plus subscribers will get access to a weekend offer of discounts on the PlayStation Store, and be able to download a Valorant PS Plus Pack which includes cosmetics that players can show off in their Valorant matches.</p>
<p>That's all Maguire shared on the PS Blog for now, though there will be more to come throughout the month of July, beyond the announcement of the PS Plus Extra and Premium-tier monthly additions. Maguire also points players to the <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-ca/ps-plus/whats-new/#15th">PlayStation Plus section</a> of the PlayStation website to find out more about the 15 year anniversary celebrations.</p>
<p>"<em>In the last 15 years we have been focused on providing access to quality game experiences through PlayStation Plus, along with key benefits such as exclusive PlayStation Store discounts, online multiplayer access, Cloud Game Streaming and more. Since the launch of our Monthly Games benefit (previously known as Instant Game Collection), more than 500 monthly games have been offered.</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>Thank you for coming on our PlayStation Plus journey. There's plenty more to look forward to, including many more great games to come</em>."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bandai Namco has announced the&nbsp;<em>Little Nightmares III&nbsp;</em>release date, with the third installment in the spooky cinematic platformer series set to arrive in the most appropriate month for its release.</p>

<p>As revealed in a <a href="https://x.com/LittleNights/status/1937588067579101399" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X,&nbsp;<em>Little Nightmares III&nbsp;</em>will be arriving across PC and consoles on October 10th. Alongside news of the release date, the publisher also revealed that a Nintendo Switch 2 version of the game is on the way as well.</p>

<p>This third installment in the&nbsp;<em>Little Nightmares&nbsp;</em>series was originally slated to launch in 2024, but <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/little-nightmares-3-delayed" rel="nofollow">in May last year</a>, Bandai Namco and developer Supermassive Games delayed the game to 2025 in order to give it "the care and love it deserves".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/little-nightmares-iii-release-date-walking.jpg?itok=TUpjmv9W 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/little-nightmares-iii-release-date-walking.jpg?itok=wUpmU3F1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Little Nightmares III&nbsp;</em>is launching in October.</figcaption></figure><p>In addition to&nbsp;<em>Little Nightmares III</em>'s release date, Bandai Namco also revealed that an enhanced edition of the original&nbsp;<em>Little Nightmares&nbsp;</em>is on its way to PC and current-gen consoles.</p>

<p>It's coming on the same day as&nbsp;<em>Little Nightmares III</em>, but unlike that game, this one's not coming to the PS4 or the Xbox One, nor is it heading to the original Switch. You'll have to play it on current-gen machines.</p>

<p>For your trouble, though, you'll get enhanced visuals and performance, as well as "additional helpers" that have been added to give you an "overall better experience". Otherwise, though, it'll be the same&nbsp;<em>Little Nightmares&nbsp;</em>you may already know and love, and if you don't, this seems like the perfect way to experience it.</p>




<p><em>Little Nightmares III&nbsp;</em>will revolve around two new characters, Low and Alone, who must work together with one another in order to escape a nightmarish realm known as the Nowhere.</p>

<p>You'll be able to check the game out when it launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1392860/Little_Nightmares_III/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/little-nightmares-3/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/little-nightmares-iii/9PMWB693ZK7X" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and both Nintendo Switch consoles on October 10th. That's also when the enhanced version of&nbsp;<em>Little Nightmares&nbsp;</em>will launch.</p>

However, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/netflix-team-blue-bungie-blizzard-sony-closed-1851678075&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-team-blue-bungie-blizzard-sony-closed-1851678075">that didn’t survive for long</a></span>, with the studio closing late last year having not released anything, not even a potential game’s name.</p><p>It was only this time last year that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/netflix-games-hades-dead-cells-gta-1851600876&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-games-hades-dead-cells-gta-1851600876">Netflix declared it was developing an enormous 80 new games</a></span> to be added to the 96 already hosted by the service. And it’s important to note that there are some all-time classics among what’s already there. <em>GTA San Andreas</em>, <em>Oxenfree</em>, <em>Dead Cells</em>, <em>Kentucky Route Zero</em>... These are games people want to play.</p><p>However, it’s now known that their numbers are in fact going to drop by 20, with names like <em>Hades</em>, <em>Braid</em>, <em>Monument Valley</em> and <em>The Case of the Golden Idol</em> to be lost throughout July. Even more notably, some of the games listed as leaving were until now exclusive to the service, such as <em>Rainbow Six: SMOL</em> and <em>Monument Valley 3</em>. It’s unclear at this point what will happen to these games, and whether they will be made available to play anywhere else.</p><p>This move follows not only the closure of Team Blue last November, but also the  move that same month to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/netflix-interactive-movies-shows-black-mirror-removed-1851690321&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-interactive-movies-shows-black-mirror-removed-1851690321">delist 20 of Netflix’s interactive television programs</a></span>. Four remained, however, including popular experiments like <em>Black Mirror</em>’s episode “Bandersnatch,” and <em>Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt: Kimmy vs. the Reverend</em>, but even these are now gone as of May 2025. (For some reason Bear Grylls’ <em>You vs. Wild</em> remains available.)</p><p>While there’s been no official announcement, it does seem somewhat unlikely that Netflix’s previously announced plans to release a new internally developed game every month will be met. These, however, are mostly intended to be tie-ins with new shows and movies, so perhaps the company will push ahead with them as promotional material.</p><p>It does seem safe to say that Netflix’s ambitions to break into original gaming, however, look to be pretty much over. Here’s the full list of games departing the service next month, most of which are gone by July 14:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><em>Battleship</em></li><li><em>Braid, Anniversary Edition</em></li><li><em>Carmen Sandiego</em></li><li><em>CoComelon: Play with JJ</em></li><li><em>Death’s Door</em></li><li><em>Diner Out: Merge Cafe</em></li><li><em>Dumb Ways to Die</em></li><li><em>FashionVerse</em></li><li><em>Ghost Detective</em></li><li><em>Hades</em></li><li><em>Katana ZERO</em></li><li><em>LEGO Legacy: Heroes Unboxed</em></li><li><em>Ludo King</em></li><li><em>Monument Valley</em></li><li><em>Monument Valley 2</em></li><li><em>Monument Valley 3</em></li><li><em>Rainbow Six: SMOL</em></li><li><em>Raji: An Ancient Epic</em></li><li><em>SpongeBob: Bubble Pop F.U.N.</em></li><li><em>TED Tumblewords</em></li><li><em>The Case of the Golden Idol</em></li><li><em>The Rise of the Golden Idol </em></li></ul><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><em>Vineyard Valley</em></li></ul><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/netflix-gaming-hades-monument-vally-golden-idol-braid-1851785038]]></content:encoded>

                <p>The CG animation and motion capture company Nintendo Pictures, formerly known as Dynamo Pictures, has been revealed to have worked on Sony's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-2-story-theories-and-everything-we-know/1100-6516214/" data-ref-id="1100-6516214">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendo-owned-company-worked-on-death-stranding-2/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC spotted</a> the company's name in the Death Stranding 2 credits. While it might seem surprising to see a Nintendo-owned company work on a PlayStation game, it's not totally unexpected. Prior to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-buys-cg-studio-dynamo-will-rename-it-nintendo-pictures/1100-6505485/" data-ref-id="1100-6505485">Nintendo's acquisition of Dynamo in 2022 and re-branding to Nintendo Pictures</a>, the company worked on the original Death Stranding.</p><p>Since 2022, Nintendo Pictures' work on game projects has focused on Nintendo games, including Super Mario Bros. Wonder and The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. But it's possible the work Nintendo Pictures did on Death Stranding 2 was done prior to Nintendo's buyout, or that a previous contract was in place to allow the company to work on Death Stranding 2 even as a company owned by Nintendo.</p><p>Another theory is that Nintendo Pictures' work beyond games is allowed to go forward for animation projects. After all, Nintendo Pictures did work for the Pretty Cure anime from Toei Animation following Nintendo's buyout of the company.</p><p>In any event, this isn't the first time Sony and Nintendo will work together, as the two companies are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-legend-of-zelda-movie-release-date-trailer-story/2900-6252/" data-ref-id="2900-6252">partnered up for the live-action The Legend of Zelda movie. </a> Sony Pictures and Nintendo are co-financing the movie, which was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/live-action-zelda-movie-delayed-by-nintendo/1100-6532279/" data-ref-id="1100-6532279">recently delayed a bit. </a></p><p>As for Death Stranding 2, it's available now for people who pay more, while the standard edition unlocks on June 26. GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/death-stranding-2-review-tied-up/1900-6418377/" data-ref-id="1900-6418377">Death Stranding 2 review</a> scored the game a 7/10. Reviewer Diego Nicolás Argüello wrote, "Death Stranding 2: On The Beach is fixated on revisiting past ideas, which limits its impact to being a good but not great sequel."</p>

Maybe.</p><p>What is certain is that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/john-cena-heel-turn-bad-guy-cody-rhodes-wrestlemania-41-1851767373&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/john-cena-heel-turn-bad-guy-cody-rhodes-wrestlemania-41-1851767373">John Cena</a></span>’s heel run is making fans feel all kinds of ways, which couldn’t be more appropriate for the most polarizing figure in the history of professional wrestling.</p><p>A little over halfway through the 17-time champ’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/john-cena-retirement-tour-wwe-cody-rhodes-the-rock-1851732028&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/john-cena-retirement-tour-wwe-cody-rhodes-the-rock-1851732028">retirement tour</a></span>, we’re pausing to take stock of what we like and what we don’t like about Bad Guy Cena so far. If you want some, come get some.</p></div></div><div><p>You can betray the fans who looked up to you. You can punt the hell out of Cody Rhodes’ coin purse. You can even <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOg7P3QM3nI&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOg7P3QM3nI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cuckold Zach Ryder</a></span>. But you will NOT turn your back on cameraman Stu and get away with it.</p><p>The devil is in the details for Cena’s heel entrance; its evolution (including ignoring <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.facebook.com/reel/649578350863396/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.facebook.com/reel/649578350863396/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stu, whom he used to salute</a></span>) has ever so slightly changed his former entrance, but made it all the more impactful.</p><p>Instead of a typical highlight reel, the Attitude Adjuster’s titantron is black with his name bolded in big white letters. The arena lights turn off, and the spotlight is completely on the GOAT as the crowd is hidden by the darkness. It signals that Cena matters and the fans don’t.</p><p>On the Raw after WrestleMania 41, the newly crowned, record-breaking champion forced ring announcer Mark Nash to read from a script to introduce him. It mentions Cena as the “never seen 17” champ—a slick nod to the titles he’s won and “You can’t see me” moniker.</p><p>Of course, the pop that the new heel receives while all of this happens is generational. The boos are so deafening that they drown out his theme song, and “John Cena sucks” chants become the de facto lyrics.</p><p>A good entrance props up the baddest of men, and in that category, heel Cena shines.</p></div><div><p>On March 5, 2024, the script for a John Cena heel turn was leaked…by John Cena.</p><p>In an interview with wrestling reporter Chris Van Vliet, the then 16-time champ revealed that he was “real close” to joining the dark side when he feuded with The Rock in 2012. (Skip to around 30:18 in the above video.)</p><p>Had he turned, he would have flipped “Hustle, Loyalty, and Respect” on its head: show up less, malign the fans who love him, and disrespect his opponents. Sound familiar?</p><p>He also apparently created a new theme song and designed low-cut wrestling singlets with accompanying boxing robes in preparation.</p><p>Almost one year later to the date, Cena pulled off the stunning turn, but his music and ring gear haven’t changed. Why?</p><p>A heel’s job isn’t to provide fan service. They’re supposed to get under our skin and not let us have fun things. In the words of another all-time great, it doesn’t matter what we want.</p><p>John Boy’s time (for himself) is now, and he’s going to profit off of his colorful, campy t-shirts and hats whether we like it or not. At least we’ve got <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XD-vzaRENY&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XD-vzaRENY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube</a></span> to live out our heel Cena theme song fantasies. </p></div><div><p>  <strong>​</strong></p><p>Going into Cena’s retirement tour, if you were told it would feature multiple matches with R-Truth, you might ask, “What’s up?” Or more likely, “What the fuck?”</p><p>The WWE has blessed us with a series of dream bouts for the GOAT before he rides off into the sunset, which includes the WrestleMania main event with Rhodes (his modern-day equivalent) and rivalry renewals with his greatest in-ring foes, Randy Orton and CM Punk. </p><p>There’s also his unexpected, low-key banger of a feud with R-Truth—a classic tale of a superhero disappointing his biggest fan, only for the fan to seek revenge. It was a real Syndrome-Mr. Incredible moment.</p><p>The good news is Cena has half a year’s worth of opponents left. Is a rematch with Roman Reigns on the table? Could we see him set his sights on the new era guys, like Bron Breaker, Gunther, or LA Knight? It would likely require an eventual face turn for those first two to make sense, which we are certainly here for.</p></div><div><p>Three words have followed John Cena throughout his career: “You can’t wrestle.”</p><p>The WWE Universe hurled the chant at Big Match John, particularly from 2005 - 2012, when he ruled the WWE landscape. He wasn’t the smoothest or most athletic in the ring, and his moveset was limited to the infamous five moves of doom. Not to mention, he won matches in improbable, yet nauseatingly repetitive comeback fashion.</p><p>In 2015, Cena silenced the critics.</p><p>He instituted the United States Championship Open Challenge, welcoming anyone to fight him for his title, week in and week out. He ripped off a series of excellent, closely contested bouts in which he introduced impressive new maneuvers while elevating the likes of Kevin Owens, Cesaro, Sami Zayn, and more.</p><p>A decade later, Cena is limited once again in the ring. It’s hard to blame him since he’s 48 years old and a Hollywood actor that relies on his face and frame. Still, it’s painfully obvious that opponents are handling him as if he’s made of glass, and the matches themselves feel like they’re moving at 0.5 speed.</p></div><div><p>Like Ric Flair, Steve Austin, and The Rock before him, mic work elevated John Cena to super-duper star status.</p><p>As the Doctor of Thuganomics, Cena rapped his enemies into submission and won over the WWE Universe. He <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxlSWOSINGk&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxlSWOSINGk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">belittled and exposed The Final Boss</a></span> for writing promos on his wrist. He <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36cLMYMrOTk&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36cLMYMrOTk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">called out Roman Reigns</a></span> for forgetting his lines and not inspiring the WWE’s confidence to anoint him face of the company.</p><p>No matter who verbally swung at his head—including fans—including fans, John had an ingenious response,. aAll while taking the high road and serving as a role model for kids.</p><p>Now, Cena is masterfully unleashing 20+ years of pent up heel energy. He seamlessly mixes fiction and reality, expressing frustrations (that maybe he always had?) with the WWE Universe for treating him like shit when he gave them his life.</p><p>He breaks the fourth wall by insisting that he’s not a face or a heel, but a human being. He weaponizes the criticisms fans launched at him, declaring that he’d bury Cody Rhodes at WrestleMania like he’s done to countless other opponents.</p><p>You could argue his promos are redundant and at times overacted, which might be true. However, his <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExQYm6gintE&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExQYm6gintE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post-Elimination Chamber masterclass</a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47otpATArSM&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47otpATArSM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reverse Pipe Bomb</a></span> were instantly classic—two of his best promos to date. You can’t ask for much more than that. </p></div><div><p>John Cena finally decided to sever his (as he described it) “abusive,” “dysfunctional,” and “toxic” relationship with the WWE Universe. Therapists everywhere smiled.</p><p>Still, it begs the question: After 20-plus years of loving fans unconditionally, why would the former Leader of the Cenation have such a sudden change of heart—without any build or breaking point moment? That needed to be addressed more effectively.</p><p>Picture this: Instead of kicking Cody Rhodes in the nads at the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/wrestlemania-41-john-cena-cody-rhodes-the-rock-1851769430&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/wrestlemania-41-john-cena-cody-rhodes-the-rock-1851769430">Elimination Chamber</a></span>, the GOAT remained a babyface and lost cleanly to the American Nightmare at WrestleMania 41. Then he would narrowly lose to Cody again at Backlash. And then he would be inches away from grabbing the Money in the Bank briefcase but fall short.</p><p>Cena’s days would be numbered; his opportunity to capture a record-breaking 17th championship shrinking with each appearance.</p><p>At SummerSlam, Cody would grant Cena one last title shot. As the match unfolded, Cena just couldn’t put Rhodes away—Attitude Adjustment after Attitude Adjustment, from the top rope, and maybe a piledriver for good measure. Kick-out.</p><p>Conflicted, Cena ultimately would decide to smash Rhodes in the head with the belt when the ref isn’t looking to pick up the 1-2-3.</p><p>Over the next few weeks, John would explain his actions and attempt to celebrate with the fans, but they would reject him. That would cause Cena to snap and lead to him violently attacking Rhodes (putting him on the shelf), then admonishing the WWE Universe for spitting in the face of his crowning achievement and treating him like shit all these years.</p><p>This would set up three to four months of supervillain Cena—much like the guy we’re seeing now—whose reign was built on rock-solid motivation, courtesy of Kotaku.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/john-cena-heel-cody-rhodes-r-truth-night-of-champions-1851785024]]></content:encoded>
