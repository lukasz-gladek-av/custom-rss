            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>After its launch on PC, PlayStation and Xbox earlier this year, Dead Mage and Humble Games have announced that the magic roguelike sequel, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/wizard_of_legend_2">Wizard of Legend 2</a>, will be appearing on Switch on <strong>25th November</strong> (from a puff of smoke, presumably).</p>
<p>Much like its predecessor, Wizard of Legend 2 will see you building magical loadouts from a wide range of elemental arcana, and casting spells to take out waves of enemies, navigate elemental hazards and tackle bosses.</p>
<p>All this can be played alone or with three friends in local or online co-op, and the dev promises "refined controls for Joy-Con and Pro Controllers, and optimised performance across both handheld and docked play" in this Switch version.</p>
<p>Here's a rundown of the game's key features and a handful of screenshots from Humble Games:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>4-player Co-op:</strong> Play solo or with up to three friends in seamless online or local multiplayer. The Switch release incorporates refinements introduced during 1.0, including faster Arcana responsiveness, improved camera tracking, adjusted boss HP scaling, and streamlined item interactions for smoother co-op runs.<br>
<strong>Diverse Biomes and Bosses:</strong> Each region presents new elemental hazards, enemy archetypes, minibosses, and area bosses. From the heights of the Sky Citadel to the depths of the Chaos biome, every area features distinct mechanics and rewards for players to uncover.<br>
<strong>Elemental Arcana System:</strong> Experiment with 77 Arcana spanning Fire, Water, Earth, Air, and Chaos elements. Mix and match to discover synergies, from chain lightning combos to earth-based crowd control, and adapt your spell kit to each Trial’s demands.<br>
<strong>Expansive Language Support:</strong> Support in 13 languages, including English, Brazilian Portuguese, Chinese (Simplified), French, German, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Russian, Spanish, Persian, and Turkish.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/wizard_of_legend">The first game</a>, developed by Contingent99 launched to much acclaim back in 2018, quickly racking up thousands of '<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/445980/Wizard_of_Legend/#app_reviews_hash">Very Positive</a>' reviews on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/445980/Wizard_of_Legend/">Steam</a>. With Dead Mage now in the dev seat, its sequel has not been as well-received since it first launched in ver. 1.0, though the promise of playing on the go might be enough to bring some people around to the idea.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The YouTube channel People Make Games has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9nOwjeznjI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published a video interview</a> with several workers who were suddenly fired by Rockstar Games earlier this month and have been protesting outside Rockstar North ever since. Right away, the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB) <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-developer-accused-union-busting-after-firing-dozens-of-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stated</a> that it was a pure act of union-busting, as the workers had just secured a 10% agreement from the workforce at the Edinburgh office to unionize. Rockstar <a href="https://wccftech.com/rockstar-says-fired-gta-developers-had-been-leaking-information/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">replied</a> that they had been leaking information on a public forum; however, the employees <a href="https://wccftech.com/anonymous-rockstar-employee-says-there-were-no-leaks-layoffs-union-busting/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claim</a> there was no evidence of that, and that they were rushed out with no due process or representation.</p>



<p>The author of the video notes that they had already been contacted about the new union, which was set to be announced shortly, and planned to create a video about it before the layoffs occurred. Throughout the interview, the employees express their dismay at the circumstances of their termination, which could also negatively impact their resumes due to the studio's claim of 'gross misconduct' as the cause. But they would also like to be reinstated into Rockstar and get back to work to finish Grand Theft Auto VI (<a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delayed-to-november-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">now slated for November 19, 2026</a>, following another delay). Bran said:</p>



<p><em>If I have gross misconduct on my CV, on my resume for the rest of my life, that is a huge detriment to any future career prospects. Something important to notice as well is you feel shame to be kicked out of work this way. Like, all of us still want to be here. We want our jobs, we want to finish what we were working on. And now the internal shame feel of having this gross misconduct with you forever, it's hard to explain.</em></p>

</p></figure>



<p>What's happening next? Fred, an organizer from the IWGB, explains it:</p>



<p><em>The immediate goal here is very clear. It's the reinstatement of all 31 workers in the UK who've been fired and the three workers in Toronto. We know that our sister union in Canada is working to support. It's a reinstatement for those workers. It's full compensation for pay lost during this period. It's clear accountability for the way these dismissals have been handled, these very clear, unfair dismissals without procedure, without evidence. So clear accountability from the company, and a commitment to following employment law in the UK in the future.</em></p>



<p><em>What happens next is up to Rockstar. I just wanna be really clear. [...] We've just submitted our legal claim. The ball is in their court to respond. We hope they'll resolve this with us amicably, right? This is, in the end, egregious, and to be honest, shocking. I have never seen a thing like this, not just in the game sector, but in UK trade union organising in the last 20 years. This is the moment where Rockstar can make that right. These are workers who just want to go back to work, to work on a game that they love. If they don't, they've seen what they have to contend with. The force of public feeling is against them on this, and we'll continue to put pressure on them through legal, through demonstrations, speaking about what these workers have experienced.</em></p>



<p>The layoff timing would seem odd if you consider that the studio wouldn't want to part with experienced workers while finishing a project of the magnitude of Grand Theft Auto VI. However, the UK is currently on the verge of passing the <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/67f6711f555773bbf109e21a/employment-rights-bill-overview.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Employment Rights Bill</a>, which will enhance security for workers starting next year, making this the best time to lay off people if someone really wanted to.</p>



<p>For his part, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-ceo-says-our-culture-is-extraordinary-amid-accusations-of-union-busting-at-gta-6-dev-rockstar-games">told IGN</a> that the work culture at the publisher and at Rockstar is 'extraordinary', though he did not make any further comment on the actual layoffs.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-hidden-bunker-data-download-trials-2000642994</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/arc-raiders%E2%80%99-hidden-bunker-mystery-might-not-be-so-mysterious.1350148/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>First, I’m telling you to <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-ledge-grab-spaceport-exploit-movement-tech-2000642966">stop exploiting the ledge grab</a> in <i>Arc Raiders</i>, and now I’m telling you to stop obsessing over something that probably isn’t worth your attention. Sorry to be “mom” here, but I’m pretty sure the Hidden Bunker mystery in Spaceport isn’t really a mystery at all.</p>

 <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-ledge-grab-spaceport-exploit-movement-tech-2000642966"><i>Arc Raiders</i>’ Ledge Grab Exploit Is Bad, Actually</a></p> <p>Each map in <i>Arc Raiders</i> will see various timed events come and go. Some just see the map swapped over to a night theme, while others have dangerous electrical storms. Most recently, a mysterious hidden bunker underneath the Spaceport map was thrown into the rotation. It works like this: After an activation sequence on the surface, players can explore the corridors beneath the map to find some decent loot as well as some computer terminals to download data from. You get 500XP for downloading the data, and earn progress on your weekly Trials, but not much else happens. Fans, however, are not convinced that’s all there is to it (<a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/arc-raiders-new-hidden-bunker-puzzle-has-players-completely-stumped-3281779/">h/t <i>Dexerto</i></a>).</p>

 <p>As <a href="https://youtu.be/yhQIigWZcZ4">documented by YouTuber The Gaming Merchant</a>, downloading the data in the Hidden Bunker <i>feels</i> like it should make something happen somewhere else or deeper in the Bunker, or like it’s part of a larger puzzle. You press a button, a meter fills up, a light turns green and you get XP, but if you walk away without doing this, the light turns red. There are multiple computer terminals that do this within the Bunker, which has led some to believe that they all either need to be activated at the exact same time or in some unknown sequence. There are more terminals than players the game allows for in a single party, so you’d have to gather together a bunch of randos to fully exhaust the options here, but I’m pretty sure that earning XP and making progress on your Trials is the whole point here: Activate the terminals and defend the room until they’re finished downloading.</p>

 <p>Downloading the data is not as easy as just flipping a switch and walking away. <a href="https://youtu.be/2oTiy1D6l6Q">Gamers Heroes’ video on the Hidden Bunker</a> documents this well. There’s a bit of <i>Siege</i>-esque Defend-The-Room™ required as the Hidden Bunker is likely to be swarming with players looking for other loot.</p>

  <p>Do this successfully, and you earn three stars in your Trials progress.</p> <h2>Is there a secret beneath the Spaceport?</h2> <p>Some folks are not convinced the XP and Trials progress is the point here. They’re running around trying to crack sequences they think exist, or they’re trying to activate them all at the same time, but to no avail.</p>

 <p>Honestly, I think too many folks still have their spinfoil hats on from <i>Destiny</i>.</p> <p>A megathread on the game’s subreddit is presently documenting some <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1orwml1/comment/no81af1/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">borderline Charlie-Day-meme</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1orwml1/comment/no379fo/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">theory crafting</a> about what’s going on here.</p>

   <p>The biggest piece of evidence, in my opinion, that there’s no <i>there there</i> is in a lone comment indicating that the download progress of each computer is different for each player, which would mean it’s a different instance for players outside of your squad and that timing the downloads is nigh impossible because, well, they’re not designed that way. You get your data, you get your XP, you get your Trials progress. That’s it!</p>

When you download the data, a light on the computer turns green. That light, as it turns out, is the same model as found on <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-field-depot-crate-off-radar-down-to-earth-2000642525">Field Depots</a>, of which <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1orwml1/comment/no2j64j/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">there is one sitting right on top of the Hidden Bunker’s location</a>. Another theory concerns the language found on <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ official website describing the event, particularly that “whatever is inside [the Bunker] must be worth the static.” This has folks obsessing over what “static” means.</p> <p>Comments in the megathread indicate that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1orwml1/comment/no2hhan/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">a variety of attempted solutions</a>, such as downloading everything at the same time, or downloading the data and then <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1orwml1/comment/no66rp9/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">racing to a suspicious location on the map</a>, offer no alternative outcomes. Also, while exploring the Hidden Bunker, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1orwml1/comment/no299el/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">someone managed to fall through the map</a> and, based on their screenshots, there doesn’t appear to be any secret sublayer below. So, various activation methods don’t trigger anything and there don’t appear to be any unlockable portions of the Hidden Bunker.</p> <p>But curious minds aren’t so easily dismayed. Even the fact that the data downloads are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1orwml1/comment/no57p16/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">required for this week’s Trials</a> has folks suspicious: “I feel like this could either mean that collecting the data for that 500 XP is its own reward,” one reply says, “or this is to incentivize people to run it more and more until someone figures it out.”</p> <p>I think ya had the answer right the first time there.</p> <p>But maybe I’m just a wet blanket of a skeptic as always. I’d like to believe!</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/fortnite-loot-boxes-gambling-roblox-2000642980</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fortnite-opens-the-loot-box-flood-gates-in-its-race-with-roblox.1350145/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Epic Games ended controversial loot box purchases in<em> Fortnite</em> back in 2019, but it’s bringing them back <a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-simpsons-mini-season-review-changes-new-map-short-2000640868">to the battle royale platform</a> as an option for creators in the form of “paid random items.” While there are rules in place about disclosing odds and not targeting minors, loot boxes are essentially back on the menu for the larger <em>Fortnite</em> creator island platform as Epic tries to compete with <em>Roblox</em> for players’ attention and wallets.</p>

 <p>A new developer blog post details Epic’s rules for “<a href="https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/in-island-transactions-restrictions-in-fortnite">In-Island Transactions Restrictions</a>” that will be available in creator islands in the future, including transactions fueled by RNG. “In addition to your responsibility to comply with laws, you must comply with certain restrictions that apply when offering Paid Random Items,” the company, which makes billions a year from microtransactions, writes. “Failure to utilize the functions described below will constitute a violation of Epic policies. ”</p>

 <p>The policies governing how creators can deploy loot boxes in their games are as follows:</p> <ul> <li>Paid Random Items are restricted in Singapore, Qatar, Australia, Netherlands, Belgium, and the UK/Brazil for players under 18 years old.</li> <li>Developers must “disclose the actual numerical odds of what the player may receive before the player makes a purchase.”</li> <li>They must “ensure the language you use relating to transactions is not misleading or overtly pressuring.”</li> <li>They can’t “directly prompt a minor” to buy something.</li> <li>Bundled items in Brazil must be available to purchase individually.</li> </ul> <p>And that’s it. Outside of those restrictions, or any other legal requirements unique to individual countries, <em>Fortnite</em> creators have free rein to design and sell loot boxes however they want. With no shortage of imagination, I’m sure some of them could design very clever and very lucrative systems for both entertaining players and extracting lots of V-Bucks from their virtual wallets.</p>

 <h2>Epic promises it’s not promoting gambling</h2> <p>But Epic Games is adamant that none of this will amount to gambling and that random paid items themselves do not count as such. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-adding-gambling-in-future-update-leaks-reveal/"><em>Insider Gaming</em> reports</a> that the company reached out to the outlet to ask it to remove references to gambling in a recent article covering leaked info about the update, noting that gambling is against <em>Fortnite</em>‘s rules.</p>

 <p>“Don’t implement playable gambling content, raffles, or casino-style games. These are prohibited whether or not they involve real money or virtual currency,” read Epic’s <a href="https://legal.epicgames.com/en-US/fortnite/developer-rules">developer terms of service</a>. “Islands that teach or prominently feature images or activities that are typically associated with real-world gambling, casino style games, or games of chance that offer a prize, even if they are not directly simulating a gambling experience, are not permitted in any form.”</p>

 <p>Epic and other companies have been making this argument about loot boxes <a href="https://kotaku.com/esrb-says-it-doesnt-see-loot-boxes-as-gambling-1819363091">for years</a>, claiming that if odds are disclosed and the items can’t be easily resold for actual money, then they don’t count as gambling, even though they otherwise perfectly mirror the experience of a lottery scratch-off. No matter how you define gambling, though, it’s clear loot boxes are <a href="https://kotaku.com/loot-boxes-are-designed-to-exploit-us-1819457592">designed to exploit people’s psychology</a> to get them to spend money they wouldn’t otherwise part with.</p>

 <h2>The race to keep up with <em>Roblox</em></h2> <p>Why is Epic Games tip-toeing back into a pond that was once so controversial it <a href="https://kotaku.com/u-s-senator-introduces-bill-to-ban-loot-boxes-and-pay-1834612226">led to Congressional hearings and legislative proposals</a>? The most obvious reason is that it’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/17/arts/grow-garden-roblox-record.htm">currently competing with Roblox</a> to operate the platform of choice for user-generated games and the millions of people who play them. It paid out over $350 million <a href="https://create.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-ecosystem-2024-year-in-review-celebrating-creators-and-looking-ahead?team=personal">to its island creators last year</a>, and announced <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-developers-will-soon-be-able-to-sell-in-game-items?lang=en-US">plans in September</a> to let them start selling in-game items just like regular <em>Fortnite </em>does.</p>

 <p>Roblox, of course, was already doing this. <em>Grow a Garden</em>, one of its biggest surprise hits with concurrent players peaking at over 22 million, is essentially a farming sim with a daily shop that refreshes and where you can spend Robux on microtransactions to acquire rare seeds or make harvesting more efficient. The game isn’t popular in spite of the pay-to-win mechanics underlying it, but in part because of them. The success of gacha games like <em>Genshin Impact</em> and card pack modes like <em>EA Sports FC</em>‘s Ultimate Team shows this isn’t isolated to UGC games either.</p> <p>Epic is currently trying to beat Roblox with a more generous cut of the profits. <em>Fortnite</em> creators can earn 74 percent of in-game sales through the end of the 2026, after which it will drop down to 37 percent. That’s still substantially more than the cut creators are currently getting at Roblox, which only pays out 25 percent of in-game sales. I’m sure none of this will create perverse incentives for what <em>Fortnite</em> creators make moving forward.</p>

<p>The Game Awards continue to grow, and have a new broadcast partner to show for it. Show creator and host Geoff Keighly announced on Tuesday that The Game Awards 2025 will stream on Amazon Prime Video for the first time.</p>



<p>In addition to being on Prime, The Game Awards will continue to stream on YouTube, Twitch, and other platforms. </p>







<p>Speaking with <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/game-awards-streaming-amazon-prime-video-twitch-1236574939/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Variety</a> about the news, Keighly said that the fact it’s an additional platform instead of a replacement makes it a “really exciting” addition for the show.</p>



<p><strong>“We’ve had lots of conversations with people over the years, and we’re like, there’s no way, there’s no world where we could ever really take the show off YouTube and Twitch — where it was born back in 2014,” </strong>he said.</p>



<p>Keighly also said that despite being on a large platform like Prime Video, it won’t change how the show is produced and air. He also said that Amazon was receptive about a non-exclusive deal with the show.</p>



<p><strong>“It’s important people know it doesn’t change our show at all,”</strong> he said. <strong>“We’re still making the same show. I came out of a life of working on television networks. And you had television folks that would give opinions and things on what you want the show to be. </strong></p>



<p><strong>“This is still The Game Awards. It’s the exact same show. They’re really just another distribution outlet, and they’re really letting us build the show the way we always do. We’re not changing anything about the show to accommodate a new platform.”</strong></p>







<p>As mentioned, The Game Awards 2025 will air on Twitch and YouTube like always. On Twitch, however, another first will happen as the show will air in 2K. There will also be Twitch Drops for those watching on the platform.</p>



<p>Are you going to watch The Game Awards on Amazon Prime Video this year, or stick with a traditional platform like YouTube or Twitch?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Players already knew that Rogue and Gambit are coming to Marvel Rivals Season 5, but a new trailer has made it official. </p>



<p>Marvel Rivals Season 5 is something players have been looking forward to a lot, especially after knowing which two characters will be taking the center stage in the new season. Rogue and Gambit were already revealed through several leaks and an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-ad-rogue-gambit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">advertisement on TikTok</a>. Now, players have received an official trailer, providing a background for the upcoming season’s plot. </p>







<h2 id="h-marvel-rivals-rogue-and-gambit-revealed-through-new-trailer">Marvel Rivals Rogue and Gambit Revealed Through New Trailer</h2>



<p>The official <a href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1987913327197016501" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> account (formerly Twitter) for Marvel Rivals teased yesterday that something new was coming with an invitation to Rogue and Gambit’s wedding. This invitation was followed by a new trailer, where we see the duo gearing up to tie the knot; however, their plans are met with an unforeseen roadblock as a timestream entanglement tears their world apart before Gambit and Rogue can say “I do” on Krakoa. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>However, Gambit will not let this go so easily and will set forth on a “daring cosmic heist to steal the universe’s rarest ring – and win back the moment time itself stole from them.” The new trailer offers no gameplay details or abilities for the upcoming characters; instead, it features a cinematic video that primarily sets up the narrative for the next season, “Love is a Battlefield”. Marvel Rivals Season 5 is set to release on November 14, 2025, and we can expect to receive more details about the two characters leading up to this date. </p>







<p>In other news, Marvel Rivals’ PvE Zombies mode helped provide <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-steam-player-count-spike-pve-mode-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a major player spike on Steam</a> recently.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/routine-the-final-preview-%E2%80%93-ign-first.1350118/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/10/ignfirst-routine-3-finalpreview-banner-1762810914943.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">As a lover of puzzle games, what can elevate my puzzle-solving experience more than having horrifying monsters breathing down my neck and ready to snap said neck if I fail to solve their puzzle in time? I love these types of games that keep me on edge for hours on end, so Routine is exactly the type of aesthetically pleasing and brutally tense kinds of horror experience I’m always on the lookout for. And with a deeply cool 80’s-tech lunar setting and the beginnings of a story that has me interested in seeing more, I’m willing to overlook some of the things I was less impressed by during the roughly 90-minute demo, like the fact that the monsters searching for me were about as bright as the desks I hid behind and underneath. It remains to be seen if the story will pay off as much as its promising setting and compelling vibe might imply, but I’ll definitely be diving deeper in the future to see how it shakes out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Routine is one of those horror games where you’re forced to run around solving little puzzles while absolutely horrifying monsters stalk the halls, ready to kill you on sight if you fail to avoid their notice – you know, in the same vein as something like Alien: Isolation or My Friendly Neighborhood. That comes with  all the same pros and cons as its genre peers, where you have these really tense moments as you manage to solve a puzzle and rush through a door just before the bad guy you can’t possibly hope to kill catches up with you. But you then also have plenty of instances where you’re stuck in a room waiting for the dumb bad guy to turn around and walk away, leading to lots of moments where the tension sours into a monotonous waiting game. I tend to really enjoy these kinds of protracted hide and seek sequences, even if they do occasionally involve a bit of waiting, so this was right up my alley.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In this particular case, I found myself on a moon base that had been taken over by killer humanoid robots, whose lidless, unblinking eyes searched for me as I repaired various broken electrical systems and tried to get through each area unnoticed. The ambience of this dilapidated lunar base with an ‘80’s tech aesthetic really worked for me, clearly drawing inspiration from fellow retro-tech science fiction worlds like Alien. But Routine also brings with it a unique sense of humor, with silly arcade games to play in between sweat-inducing horror sequences and cheeky, non-murderous robot helpers to find along the way. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Routine's immaculately creepy vibes, unique retro aesthetic, and tongue-in-cheek jokes in between bouts of utter terror, all coalesce in a way I haven’t seen before.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This is one of the biggest ways in which Routine sets itself apart, as its immaculately creepy vibes, unique retro aesthetic, and tongue-in-cheek jokes in between bouts of utter terror, all coalesce in a way I haven’t seen before. I didn’t get a very strong sense of whether or not the story will deliver something worth all the stress and jump scares along the way, but hopefully all this neat worldbuilding will translate into something as awesome as the setting. With some solid environmental storytelling and hints at some kind of mysterious viral disease at work, it has certainly piqued my curiosity.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The areas I explored ranged from= fairly unremarkable metallic hallways filled with busted droids and signs of something catastrophic having happened recently to really neat areas like an abandoned arcade with janky retro games to play and a shopping mall littered with debris. And, of course, since the whole thing takes place on a base on the moon, they take every opportunity to give you a nice view of the beautiful majesty of good ol’ Selene. Gotta love that. I’m a tad skeptical that they can manage to keep things interesting when you’re stranded on a fairly generic space station on a barren rock in outer space, but hey, so far so good.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although much of the demo I played featured some fairly by-the-numbers puzzles, like finding codes around the world to enter into a keypad to unlock a door, it also had some neat mechanics built around the C.A.T device you’re given early in the story. This tool is basically just a handheld camcorder that can also do things like fire an electrical bolt at targets in your path. What’s cool, though, is that it evolved as I progressed, like when I unlocked an ultraviolet mode called the Ultraview Module that allowed me to see trace substances like bloodstains that helped me solve some of the space station’s more unintuitive riddles. I only unlocked two modes in my time with it, but it’s clear that upgrading this bad boy is going to be the primary way in which you power up, and so far I like that idea quite a bit. It’ll be interesting to see what clever new uses they find for it.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While you upgrade your C.A.T., read snippets of lore around the space station, and solve puzzles, you’ll find yourself almost constantly hunted by extremely violent robots that chase after you on sight with intent to kill. Naturally, that makes even the most simple brain teasers that much more stressful, as you spend every other second double-checking over your shoulder, or wincing when you hear a robotic sound come from somewhere nearby. It’s not exactly an original premise, but it’s certainly the classic type of horror gameplay I’ve come to know and love over the years – and something we could definitely use more of.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One thing that was a bit disappointing, at least during my extremely early time with the story, is just how easy it was to outsmart the fairly dim robots hunting for me, to the point where I never actually was killed during my time playing. They make a ton of noise as they march around electronically, give up the chase as soon as you start running away since they can’t hope to compete with your speed, and don’t do a very thorough job searching for you if you’re hidden in an obvious corner they haven’t bothered exploring yet. What’s more, one of the abilities you unlock for your C.A.T. early on, is a mode where you can tase the robots chasing you, shorting them out for a second or two to buy valuable time you need to get away, as if it weren’t already easy enough as-is. But that doesn’t mean they aren’t still as intimidating as hell – the robotic shrieks they make every once in a while made my skin crawl, and the few times where they were able to get close without me noticing sent me screaming in the opposite direction. They may not actually be very deadly killers (at least early on), but they’re still pretty damn stressful to be around nonetheless.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/routine-the-final-preview-ign-first]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-pokopia">Pokémon Pokopia</a> will cost $70 and only be available physically as a Game-Key Card, it appears — something that has stunned some Nintendo fans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Following <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-pokopia-nintendo-switch-2-release-date-confirmed">confirmation of the game's March 5, 2026 release date</a> earlier today, store pages for the highly-anticipated Pokémon life simulation have now gone live, detailing its price and status as a Game-Key card game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the U.S., Pokopia is <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/pokemon-pokopia-switch-2/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">available</a> to pre-order now for $69.99. In Japan, meanwhile, Pokopia costs 8,980 yen — the same price point as Mario Kart World ($80 in the U.S.), and more than other Nintendo-published titles such as Donkey Kong Bananza and even Pokémon Legends: Z-A.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo's Japanese <a href="https://www.pokemon.co.jp/ex/pocoapokemon/ja/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a> specifically lists Pokopia's physical edition as a Game-Key card, and while the same information isn't shown in the U.S., Nintendo has simulataneously published a YouTube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ldQYMwzWrY&amp;t=15s" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a> instructing users on how "Game-Key Cards on Nintendo Switch 2" work — which uses Pokémon Pokopia as an example. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Game-Key Cards have proven controversial among Nintendo fans who dislike the fact that the cartridges only contain a prompt to download the game, rather than its full game data. That means you do need to connect your Switch 2 online after buying the game, and then also need to wait while it downloads. However, Game-Key Cards differ from digital downloads as they can still be re-sold or shared with others — just like a regular game cartridge.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo previously <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/nintendo-has-no-plans-to-use-game-key-cards-for-first-party-developed-titles" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stated</a> that it had "no plans to use Game-Key Cards for Nintendo-developed titles" — something some fans today have pointed to as a broken promise. But, of course, Pokémon is not a solely Nintendo-owned franchise and Nintendo does not develop Pokémon games. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, Nintendo <em>is</em> publishing Pokémon Pokopia, and this does appear to be the first Nintendo-published game offered on a Game-Key Card. But this is also a game developed by Koei Tecmo — which, last time we checked, was not a Nintendo development studio.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier today, Nintendo announced a new trailer for Pokémon Pokopia will debut later this week on Thursday, November 13 at 6am Pacific, 9am Eastern, or 2pm UK. Eagle-eyed fans believe the video will feature over 10 minutes of gameplay — suggesting Nintendo is confident in what it has to show.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Former President of Sony Interactive Entertainment Worldwide Studios, indie game and PS Vita champion, and much-missed industry star Shuhei Yoshida has appeared on the <a href="https://shows.acast.com/my-perfect-console" target="_blank" rel="noopener">My Perfect Console with Simon Parkin</a> podcast and revealed his top five games.</p>
<p>Before we get into those, can I recommend you check out the full podcast at some point, it’s a really great listen with lots of wonderful stories about PlayStation and game development. You can find the podcast on <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/my-perfect-console-with-simon-parkin/id1665581266" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iTunes</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/6PzHHkwpOs8YFgzqoKRXAi" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spotify</a> and all the usual places.</p>


<p>On to his game choices and the first title he picked was PlayStation 3 and Vita classic,<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/journey/"> <strong>Journey</strong></a></p>
<p>“The impact the game had to human emotions was so powerful,&nbsp;I don’t remember any other game (doing that) before Journey,” said Shu. “People played the game and had tears in their eyes, so that shows the power of the medium and at the same time power of indie games.”</p>
<p><iframe title="JOURNEY | 10 Year Anniversary Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2FZkTXs3Td8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Next up was another PS Vita game, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/sound-shapes/"><strong>Sound Shapes.</strong></a></p>

<p>“What was brilliant about the game was it allowed ou to create your own levels. As you play the game, you gain these objects and you are free to lay out and draw things. That was such a creative game,&nbsp;especially when you play on PS Vita. (PS Vita) has touch, so it is very easy to lay out your level and because you play with headphones and the music, it’s really kind of perfect on PS Vita.”</p>
<p><iframe title="Sound Shapes™Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zfPbJE6XDxg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>His third choice is<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/inscryption/"> <strong>Inscryption</strong></a>, a PC game published by Devolver Digital that eventually made it to PS4 and PS5.</p>
<p>“It’s very hard to talk about the game because I don’t want to create a spoiler,” said Shu. “I really want people to try this game without any knowledge. This is one of the games that makes me want to erase my memory so I can replay the game.”</p>
<p>“I played through the game twice because I really, really loved it, but the first time I played, I went, “What?”, you know, “What’s going on?” It’s such an amazing creative work by this, you know, young individual Daniel Mullins, and it was really fun.”</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Inscryption | Accolades Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aneRbQGRIMc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The fourth game is another indie title, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/before-your-eyes/"><strong>Before Your Eyes</strong></a>. The game is the story of a young boy and it has a unique method of control, the game advances when you blink. Shu explained how he convinced the young developers to bring the game to PS VR2.</p>
<p>“I met them at a BAFTA pre-event gala. Everybody is dressed up and there are these two youngsters who looked like the didn’t know what to do, and so I talked to them! Because PSVR 2 has the eye tracking it’s the best way to play Before Your Eyes because you are put in exactly the position of the boy and you’re able to see the scene from boy’s perspective. I want every single human being to try this game because this game’s amazing.”</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Before Your Eyes - Launch Trailer | PS VR2 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/v9OhfCk51Mo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Finally is a PC and console game from last year, <strong><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nine-sols/">Nine Sols.</a></strong></p>
<p>“It was my Game of the Year game last year,” said Shu. “There are many Souls-like games and Metroidvania game but they came up with unique, secular-like, 2D action game with beautiful graphics and really interesting stories and amazing, amazing gameplay.”</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="NineSols - Console Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NYJLa2HOQhI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Shu also revealed that his degree in Economics is probably not worth the paper it is written on.</p>
<p>“I majored in economics,” he explains. “Not that I was interested in economcs, but I knew that it’s so easy to graduate from university if I major in economics. Especially at Kyoto University, it was notorious that they just let people graduate. I didn’t even have to attend the classes.”</p>
<p>“There’s only one exam per year for each class and it was pre-announced so people who attended the classes created the ideal answers, and that was distributed. We just copied that into our paper and submit it!”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>

<p>In the last year or two, Microsoft has been very vocal about its desire to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/xbox-reiterates-its-support-for-switch-2">support Switch and Switch 2</a>. We've seen a couple of examples of this on the new hardware with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-plus-4">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4</a> and the soon-to-come <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, but where's the <strong>Gears</strong>? Where's the <strong>Call of Duty</strong>? Where's the <strong>Halo?</strong> As it turns out, we're not the only ones who are a little surprised by the lack of support so far.</p>
<p>Reggie Fils-Aimé recently took a break from playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/animal_crossing_new_leaf">Animal Crossing: New Leaf</a> on his Nintendo 3DS to sit down with <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/we-interview-reggie-fils-aime-about">The Game Business</a>' Christopher Dring and talk all things Switch 2. Microsoft's pledged support was one of the topics that cropped up in conversation, and the former NoA president confessed that he'd expected to see more.</p>
<p>"I'm surprised that Xbox has not yet fully embraced Switch 2 from a software perspective," Reggie said, "Certainly some games could easily be ported over to the Switch 2". He even went more specific with his predictions, stating, "I thought there would be much more, especially during this timeframe leading into the Holiday. All through the fall, I was fully expecting some dedicated announcement. And I'm surprised it hasn't happened."</p>
<p>Recent months have seen <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/gears_of_war_reloaded">Gears of War: Reloaded</a> blast onto PS5, and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/halo_campaign_evolved">Halo: Campaign Evolved</a> will be making a similar leap at some point next year. Phil Spencer has said, time and again, how keen he is to support Nintendo systems, so it makes sense that Reggie might have been expecting more, particularly with two of the studio's biggest franchises already venturing to pastures new.</p>
<p>This isn't to say that Mr. Fils-Aimé has necessarily been disappointed with the Switch 2's software slate so far, though he admits that he's found Nintendo's output a little confusing: "From a business perspective, when I first saw that lineup, I scratched my head a little bit" — come on, who honestly had <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> on their launch year bingo card?</p>
<p>"What I underestimated was the enhanced Nintendo Switch 1 content, which I think has been compelling," he continued. "The stuff that you get for free as part of the Nintendo Switch Online subscription, I think that has helped drive some of the momentum. And then certainly, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Bananza</a> was a key driver for them.”</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the interview, Reggie discusses the console war, Switch 2's meaty sales numbers and what the future of the industry might look like. You'll find a video version at the top of this article, or you can check it out in writing over on <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/we-interview-reggie-fils-aime-about">The Game Business</a> website.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pok%C3%A9mon-pokopia-will-arrive-on-nintendo-switch-2-in-march-2026-seems-to-be-another-game-key-card-release.1350073/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The cozy farming Pokémon spin-off game from Koei Tecmo, Pokémon Pokopia, finally has a release date after being <a href="https://wccftech.com/pokemon-pokopia-pokemon-spin-off-cozy-farming-game-nintendo-switch-2-2026/">announced this past September during a Nintendo Direct event</a>. At the time, it was slated to arrive sometime in 2026, though now we know it'll arrive on Nintendo Switch 2 on March 5, 2026, and that it appears to be a game-key card release.</p>



<p>Pokémon Pokopia, if you need the reminder, is the game where you play as a Ditto that transforms itself into an imitation of a human, who then begins to operate a Pokémon farm and create a paradise for its fellow Pokémon, while those Pokémon help plant, water, maintain crops, and carve out a peaceful life.</p>



<p>Nintendo did not initially clarify that Pokémon Pokopia would be a game-key card release, but in a new video published today showcasing how game-key cards work, it was featured as one of the examples. If it is a game-key card release, then, as spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/pokemon-pokopia-appears-to-be-the-first-nintendo-published-switch-2-game-to-be-on-a-game-key-card/">VGC</a>, this would mark the first Nintendo-published title to be a game-key card version.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Though game developers have spoken out about <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-game-key-cards-forced-choice/">game-key cards as a means of overcoming the limits that come with using cartridges</a>, that hasn't stopped the feature from being controversial among players, with many decrying game-key card releases on the grounds of game preservation, since they are physical cartridges that do not contain any actual game data.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Nintendo has claimed its first-party titles, like <a href="https://wccftech.com/physical-nintendo-switch-2-mario-and-zelda-games-wont-be-game-key-card-versions-nintendo-says/">Mario and Zelda games, would not be game-key card releases</a>, but the distinction of what will be released as a game-key card and what won't be now seems to be between Nintendo first-party developed titles and titles Nintendo is simply publishing. Pokémon Pokopia is developed by Game Freak and Koei Tecmo, with The Pokémon Company publishing it in Japan, and Nintendo publishing it globally.</p>

            <p>Last week, <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/the-game-awards-confirms-its-future-class-program-will-remain-on-ice">Game Developer</a> reported that the organisers of Geoff Keighley-fronted industry awards show/advertising extravaganza The Game Awards had revealed that they've got no plans to do anything with their Future Class initiative this year. That's left the programme, founded in 2020 with the goal of highlighting up and coming talents in and around game development, facing a black hole of a future. Even worse, those featured by the initiative during the years it did run have been left feeling frustrated and unable to access the webpage which confirms they were ever part of the programme.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>A number of developers featured by the Future Class initiative and who remain part of its dedicated Discord server have now spoken to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/nov/11/future-class-gamings-oscars-game-awards">The Guardian</a> about how the programme's fate's left them feeling. They've also documented some back-and-forths between themselves and The Game Awards' organisers, including face of the games man Geoff Keighley, over improvements the members wished to see made to the programme and a desire for the 2023 edition of the show to acknowledge <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c8641wv0n4go">Israel's ongoing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza</a>.</p>
<p>The former push was reportedly rooted in negative experiences nominees in the early years of the Future Class had when attending the show. "We were effectively props," game producer and 2020 class member Dianna Lora said, with examples like a Starbucks meetup which the members felt sidelined them, seats for the main show being camped behind camera risers that obstructed views, and mentorship programmes over the following year being limited to brief Zoom chats with industry figures.</p>
<p>While that advocacy has resulted in generally more positive experiences for more recent nominees according to the report, members' efforts to convince Keighley and co to read out a statement during 2023's Game Awards expressing support for Palestine and calling for a ceasefire in Gaza resulted in their <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-game-awards-israel-palestine-open-letter-future-class/">open letter</a> being ignored. Keighley, who didn't respond to The Guardian's request for comment (I've also reached out), is alleged by one of the members to have sat looking "incensed" during a subsequent call in which some members recommended the awards ceremony feature the likes of more female presenters and acknowledge that year's mass developer layoffs.</p><p>Many members have been left frustrated, especially after the Future Class archive of inductees was removed from The Game Awards' site, while some have also been left questioning whether their efforts to advocate for improvements to the programme and acknowledgement of key issues might have contributed to the initiative being left in limbo. "Ever since [we pushed back] it was like, ‘This is too much trouble, might as well peace out’," Lora said, while community manager Natalie Checo added: "As a result of advocating for ourselves (the very thing that we were inducted for), we were punished for doing the same thing that they ostensibly celebrated us for."</p>
<p>A silver lining to the situation is that the members have apparently stuck together as a Discord community and continue to do so. So, as flawed and cynical as The Game Awards' Future Class has reportedly been, at least it's seemingly helped bring some like-minded folks with noble goals together.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>It is exhausting seeing how many aspects of the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>experience people try to exploit as part of some money-making scheme. The cards are obviously the most prominent example of this, as </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scalper-reseller-trading-card-van-gogh-pikachu-1850925900"><span>scalpers and the content creation mill</span></a><span> have turned the act of buying and selling packs into a lucrative business at the expense of players being able to derive </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-card-tcg-vendor-scalper-reseller-stream-shows-2000630658"><span>any joy from the hobby</span></a><span>. But people selling </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>-related stuff</span> <span>for a profit isn’t limited to physical goods. Nowadays, you can find someone asking for real-world cash for a Shiny Pokémon in games like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i></a><span>.</span></p>

 <p><span>Despite </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-shiny-hunting-despawn-sound-effect-2000636142"><span>how much easier </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>makes it</span></a><span> to find the rare, alternate-colored ‘mons in Lumiose City, some folks would rather just fork over some of their hard-earned money to save themselves a few hours of grinding to make one of them spawn. At least, that’s what some sellers on places like eBay are banking on. If you search for Shiny Pokémon on the site, you’ll find dozens of listings, some selling specific creatures and others letting people specify the Shiny they’re seeking. One of the most expensive offerings includes a </span><a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/167871843921?_skw=pokemon+legends+z-a+shiny&amp;itmmeta=01K9SS6250KZXESVT648WYM062&amp;hash=item2715f10e51:g:qrYAAeSwNkRo-Pgk&amp;itmprp=enc%3AAQAKAAAA4FkggFvd1GGDu0w3yXCmi1cmZMWT%2BJmOrrmcpCm9OPCOq%2F6C5X%2FOvRyhCN6Xbr3piM4Xf0yos%2Bgp99jZhgqUClMlqLGYsp%2Fijcj6Fn92F5x8KzHOf%2BYl6iTUbSbF67RqNNpK2soagMaN3RJ3fd%2BLuzrXiris2fOv5f9FwaYiG4IUgsCYY35bTh354GI2XLjyRcZnn%2BC6VAfT1oLyhUq%2Bt2gyS9DOMuwqTv8AVsDe8gKXlah20yBDsXzsouFU%2FpRLVXX4XcR7e7D%2FrHAT4dZZFEfjtuW1nAo3YDWCSnNJj59y%7Ctkp%3ABk9SR9SimLnOZg"><span>full “Living Dex” of every Shiny Pokémon in </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span> for $300</span></a><span>. There’s also a cheaper (but still very expensive) </span><a href="https://ebay.us/m/kYPhJ1"><span>$80 listing for every Shiny Mega Evolution Pokémon</span></a><span> in the game thus far. That’s more than it costs to buy the game itself.</span></p> <p><span>I understand that for a lot of people, the joy of shinies is not in the exhausting hunt and they just want to put these rare creatures in their party or in a box so they can say they have them. But man, I can’t imagine being that devoted to Shiny Pokémon that you’d be willing to fork over real-world money for one, especially when they aren’t limited-time offerings. I wasn’t surprised when scalpers were </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-shiny-koraidon-miraidon-gamestop-codes-scalper-2000629926"><span>selling free Shiny Miraidon and Koraidon codes</span></a><span> because GameStop had made that an issue of false scarcity. But people are often willing to spend money to save themselves time. So I guess this isn’t that different from spending money on microtransactions to skip through a waiting period in an app. But at least with those, you don’t have to haggle and negotiate on something that was never meant to have a real-world monetary value. Go with Arceus, friends. Make responsible decisions.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>10 years ago this week, <a href="https://kotaku.com/bethesda-fallout-4-switch-2-2026-anniversary-edition-trailer-xbox-ps5-2000638638"><em>Fallout 4</em></a> launched across console and PC. It’s a big milestone for the open-world RPG. And Bethesda has decided to celebrate it by pushing out a new update that seemingly breaks the game for a lot of people and releasing some overpriced and confusing DLC. Yay?</p>

 <p>First announced in October, <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/377160/announcements/detail/814714767715337534">the <em>Fallout 4</em> Anniversary Update</a> is now live across all platforms. <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-4-anniversary-bethesda-update-mods-creation-2000641340">This update fixes an old issue in VATS</a>, makes a few other tweaks, and, more importantly, adds Creations to<em> Fallout 4</em>. This is Bethesda’s cross-platform mod solution that is already present in <em>Skyrim</em> and <em>Starfield</em>. It lets people create content for<em> Fallout 4</em> that can then be downloaded on consoles and PC. Some of this content costs money, but a lot of it is free. It’s a fine system, but when the<em> Fallout 4</em> update launched on Monday, it was completely broken.</p>

 <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/fo4/comments/1ou1p8a/thanks_todd_i_really_hate_you_now/">Over on Reddit,</a> players began <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/1otjmcr/already_off_to_a_great_start/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">sharing screenshots of the Creations menu in <em>Fallout 4</em> failing to load anything</a> or just spitting out error messages. This is a problem for content that costs money, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/1otx4yt/8_pipboy_skin_no_preview_image/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">like an $8 Pipboy skin</a> that had a broken preview window, making it impossible to actually see what it looked like before buying. Not great! Thankfully, Bethesda seems to be aware of the issues with the Creations menu and has reportedly fixed things, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/fo4/comments/1otkr3p/official_discord_statement_on_dropped_ball_for/">according to an official comment from the publisher on Discord</a>.</p>

 <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/1oubg15/all_my_dlcs_got_deleted_and_the_option_to_install/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">However,</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/1otn1cw/fallout_4_anniversary_update_breaks_game_and_adds/">the update itself is still causing lots of players headaches</a>. People are reporting that<em> Fallout 4</em> save games are being destroyed. Others are reporting that after the update, they can’t play because <em>Fallout 4</em> requires the installation of previously purchased DLC, even though it’s already installed. My brother had this happen to him when booting up<em> Fallout 4</em> on Steam and gave up trying to play. Others are dealing with new bugs, glitchy menus, and more. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/fo4/comments/1ou1p8a/thanks_todd_i_really_hate_you_now/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">And these problems exist on both PC and console.</a></p>

 <h2><em>Fallout 4</em>‘s new DLC is being trashed by Steam users</h2> <p>Beyond the bugs, the<em> Fallout 4 Anniversary Edition</em> is also causing some confusion. There are now three versions of <em>Fallout 4</em> that you can buy: The base original game, a<em> Game of the Year Edition</em>, and now the<em>&nbsp;Anniversary Edition.</em> But, despite the name of that last edition, you don’t need to buy it to access the new Anniversary update, which is free to all <em>Fallout 4</em> players. And confusingly, there’s an Anniversary Edition upgrade for people who already own <em>Fallout 4 a</em>nd its DLC. But you can also just buy the newly released <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/1oti07g/fyi_for_steam_users_the_anniversary_edition/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">$20 Fallout 4 Creations Bundle separately</a> from all of this and gain access to the new content included in the <em>Anniversary Edition.</em> Does any of this make sense to you?</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000642968" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000642968"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000642968">©</figcaption></figure> <p>Yeah, somehow, Bethesda has made buying a 10-year-old video game a complicated and confusing mess that now requires research and a fucking chart. And even if you figure it all out, some players are reporting that <em>Fallout 4</em> might not even load the new bundle properly due to various bugs.</p>

 <p>This all likely explains why <em>Fallout 4</em> on Steam has seen an influx of negative reviews. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3868650/Fallout_4__Creations_Bundle/">Meanwhile, the Creations Bundle on Steam has a completely negative review status,</a> with people furious over the price tag, how broken everything is, the fact that the new update broke many mods, and the confusion around all of this.</p>

 <p>“Hot garbage. My advice is to avoid buying this out of spite. Not only is this going to break your game, but the content itself is broken,” says one negative Steam review.</p> <p>And making all of this more frustrating is that just last year, Bethesda broke<em> Fallout 4</em> in a whole bunch of <em>different</em> but similarly annoying ways with the <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-4-ps5-ps-plus-steam-mods-game-pass-bugs-1851438302">controversial “next-gen update.</a>” At this point, I think Bethesda needs to just fix <em>Fallout 4</em>‘s current mess, say sorry, and never, ever, ever update the game again. Just move on. Let it be.</p>

<p>You can purchase and wear the Exoskeleton from Death Stranding 2 starting in December 2025; however, limited stock is available. </p>



<p>As players wait for Death Stranding to reach new mediums, with A24 set to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/death-stranding-film-a24-original-story/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tell an original story</a>, and another <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/death-stranding-animated-movie-brings-on-raised-by-wolves-screenwriter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">animated film</a> in the works as well, players can look forward to something tangible in the coming months. Kojima Productions has partnered with Dnsys to bring a co-branded DS2 Exoskeleton, and here’s all you need to know about it. </p>







<h2 id="h-death-stranding-2-exoskeleton-works-similar-to-the-ones-in-the-game">Death Stranding 2 Exoskeleton Works Similar to the Ones in the Game</h2>



<p>The collaboration between Kojima Productions and Dnsys for the Death Stranding 2: On the Beach limited edition exoskeleton was revealed through an official post on <a href="https://x.com/KojiPro2015_EN/status/1987884067178852705" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter).

                <p>Sony has shared its latest update for investors, and it's largely good news for PlayStation 5. According to Sony, an additional 3.9 million PS5 consoles were sold in the last quarter, bringing its lifetime total to 84.2 million consoles sold since the system launched in 2020. That puts the PS5 into a virtual dead heat with its predecessor, PlayStation 4, at the same point in its life cycle.</p><p>The complete breakdown of Sony's latest fiscal quarter is <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">now online</a>, and its sales chart shows the remarkably similar trajectory of the PS4 and PS5 sales. However, Sony noted that it only projects 15 million additional PS5 console sales during its current fiscal year, which runs through March 31, 2025. If so, that would potentially allow PS4 to retain its crown as Sony's second best-selling console, because it sold 17.8 million systems at that point in its life.</p><p>Regardless, Sony CFO Lin Tao suggested that the PS5 may have a longer lifespan than the traditional seven-year cycle.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/Genki_JPN/status/1988200080101569014" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Sony CFO Lin Tao says the PS5 is only in the middle of its lifecycle and they want to expand the lifecycle even further!<br>"Our view is that compared to conventional console lifecycles.

"Sony is now clearly dominating the high fidelity console gaming space, and just watch what happens to their numbers once GTA 6 is out."</p><p>Sony's report also revealed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ghost-of-yotei/" data-ref-id="5000-645132">Ghost of Yotei</a> has sold 3.3 million copies since its debut just over a month ago. Unfortunately, the latest word from Sony about Bungie and Destiny isn't as good.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>Happy Bloodborne remake day! Wait let's not get ahead of ourselves. Sony's delivering a State of Play broadcast this evening from 10pm UK time and we'll be covering all of the announcements, as they happen, right here in this article. It's like magic and it's very handy for if you're out but don't want to miss out.</p>
<p>What's more - and as if you needed any encouragement - you can chat along with us. Tell us what you think and how you think the show is going. Give it a rating out of 10 if you like. You don't even have to use a star system.</p>
<p>So what's Sony's plan for the evening? The show will be 40 minutes long and focus on PS5 games made in Japan and Asia, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-state-of-play-announced-for-tomorrow">Sony said yesterday</a>, "alongside a few other exciting updates". The PS5 is just turning five years old, incidentally, which could provide Sony with a moment for a meaningful announcement.</p>
<p>And what more meaningful announcement is there to make, you say, than a Bloodborne remake? What indeed, fair reader, what indeed! After all, wasn't Bloodborne made in Japan? The stars are aligning. The stage is set. Do it, Sony, you cowards - do it!</p>
<p><em>Ahem.</em></p>
<p>PlayStation at 10pm, then. Join us (or risk missing a piece of history!).</p>

<figure data-uuid="ef23178a376c2"><a title="Lego Zelda" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ef23178a376c2/lego-zelda.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has released a short teaser video confirming a new <strong>Legend of Zelda</strong> Lego set in <strong>2026</strong>.</p>
<p>There's not a whole lot to go on for now, but it seems to indicate that we'll be getting some sort of incarnation of Ganon. The shadow rising up from the bottom of the screen to confront Lego Link appears to be pretty large and takes the rough shape of the pig-like villain. We wouldn't be surprised to see Ganondorf either, though.</p>
<p>It's likely that the new set will be based on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/legend_of_zelda_ocarina_of_time">Zelda: Ocarina of Time</a>, with a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/rumour-new-zelda-lego-set-rumour-links-it-to-fan-favourite-entry">previous rumour pointing to a potential release in March 2026.</a> The video also showcases what looks to be Navi floating beside Link, and we can also see Zelda herself in the background.</p>

<p>Lego fans can already get their hands on the Great Deku Tree 2-in-1 set, which originally launched in 2024. We gave it a score of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/lego-the-legend-of-zelda-great-deku-tree-2-in-1-a-superb-debut-with-one-minor-irritation">8/10 in our review</a> and said that while "details and nods to the games are plentiful, but with no easy way to convert one to the other, you’re going to have your work cut out for you if you want to get the most out of this one".</p>
<p>We'll be sure to keep an eye out for a proper reveal in the days and weeks to come, but for now, colour us excited!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We need more puzzle games in the hands of the people. Forget the daily Wordle, or those insipid color sort games, you gotta say to yourself that "the day doesn’t start until I complete this <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/baba-is-you" rel="nofollow"><em>Baba is You</em></a> level", or until you figure out what gets wetter as it dries. Thank goodness Enhance have got this in mind also, as <em>Lumines Arise</em> has, well, risen.</p>

<p>This is the latest game from Enhance Games, the Japan-based studio fronted by Tetsuya Mizuguchi, who was also the director of the original <em>Lumines </em>in 2004. With Enhance, Mizuguchi and co. have been refining a certain transcendental experience that collides with almost menial puzzle gameplay, whether it’s <em>Rez Infinite</em>, the widely revered <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/tetris-effect" rel="nofollow"><em>Tetris Effect</em></a>, or the bustling nature of <em>Humanity</em>.</p>

<p><em>Lumines Arise</em> sees itself neck-and-neck with the likes of <em>Tetris Effect</em>, not just because of its block-based gameplay, but the way it presents itself; almost hoity-toity in fashion. Let it be stated for the record that I personally don’t see what the gift is in <em>Tetris Effect</em>, as its aesthetic clashed way too much mechanically with what <em>Tetris </em>is, and indeed became. What was once 5 minutes on the john with a Game Boy was now lampooning as an artistic endeavor, embarrassed to provide flow.</p>



<p>By contrast, the gameplay of <em>Lumines </em>is simplistic to the point of oversight. You are given two different tones of blocks that always come in the shape of 2x2, and it’s your job to create other 2x2 squares of one tone or the other. Sometimes they spawn in as such, a free point bonus if you will, but you also have to time your drops to the beat of the song playing. It's a very delicate dance, one that surprisingly punishes brute force quite often.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Still, there is a lifeline in the form of a “linker”. Say you have a long 1x1 line of one tone that snakes across your messy board, and a linker of that tone is able to connect to it? That entire line is completely erased, leading to a major reset of the board's opportunities. Despite a much more stilted execution of combos, it's very similar to<em> <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/puyo-puyo-tetris-2" rel="nofollow">Puyo Puyo</a></em> in that regard.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There is also a new power-up similar to the “Zone” bonus in <em>Tetris Effect</em>, in the form of “Burst”. Like with Zone, a square of one tone will form and expand, with each single 1x1 square added with the same tone, making it grow and eat any other squares. With that monstrous square formed, a new one spawns of the other tone, and boom, another major reset.</p>



<p>It’s an exceptionally powerful ability, one which seems almost negligible since the linkers work to the same effect, but it works with the visual design brilliantly. Each board blossoms with the progression, and with much broader strokes than the underspoken developments of <em>Tetris Effect</em>’s backgrounds and songs. Still, with time, <em>Lumines Arise</em> effectively evolves into something very different.</p>

<p>While the painting of <em>Arise </em>is similar to <em>Effect</em>, the painter in question is one much more indebted to how <em>Lumines </em>came to existence to begin with. This was always meant to be “transcendental”, to instill a purity through new-age affirmations, even back in 2004, when Mizuguchi’s Sega experience influenced every part of <em>Lumines</em>’ Y2K aesthetic. As it stands, <em>Lumines Arise</em> IS the game that should define Enhance as a studio.</p>

<p>The end result is absolutely magical. From the moment you begin to see yourself in the same shoes of holistic block-based puzzle gameplay, you begin to notice the songs are providing more influence on the board. It's not just that the background is thumping behind the actual action, but the blocks transform, they intertwine with those elements until it becomes what <em>Lumines </em>wanted to be from the beginning.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You’ll notice in the corner of gameplay that there’s a little individual reacting to your gameplay, and that’s your Loomii; a customizable avatar who adds a surprising amount of personality to proceedings. They’ll meditate, they’ll rave, they’ll float and interact with other Loomii’s you come across, and it’s nice to see that be the blueprint for <em>Lumines Arise</em>’s general connectivity.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As with any <em>Lumines </em>game, the songs are a huge part of the core experience, and here, they're all earworms. The ones that are purely instrumental are the heaviest hitters, with legitimate structure throughout, and the right amount of dynamic co-operation with each square clear and combo chain. It's a huge upgrade on the underspoken and otherwise one-note house music that <em>Lumines </em>tended to pair itself with.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Lumines Arise</em> also tries to expand how it plays with mission modes, which tries to extract the same amount of variety that <em>Tetris Effect</em> does with what it can do with its gameplay. In <em>Arise</em>’s case, it isn’t nearly to the same effect, largely choosing to test the player on timing, as opposed to gimmickry, but when it does provide a unique angle, <em>Lumines </em>Arise runs with it. The “Egg” challenge in particular is both humorous and invigorating to plow through.</p>



<p>With each level clear, you’re also subject to achieving points that can be used on the “Loomi-Pon”, a pseudo-gacha machine which can generate unlockables for your Loomii. These range from cosmetic heads and decorations for their body to different adjectives and titles for your profile. There’s a LOT to unlock, in what is <em>Lumines Arise</em>’s biggest problem, which is with general UX.</p>

<p>For something so welcoming and desperate, it’s surprising to see the GUI of <em>Lumines Arise</em> be an absolute nightmare to navigate. Trying to customize your Loomii with new items is an excruciating effort of trying to find the one item that doesn’t have a tiny lock symbol next to it, and the titles? Forget about it, sifting through hundreds of words on each side? Just grating to get through.</p>

<p>Still, this is <em>Lumines Arise</em>’s only true blemish, as the rest is a beautiful cacophony of particle effects of genuine awe-struck talent. Similar to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/once-upon-katamari-review-ureshii-matsuri" rel="nofollow"><em>Katamari</em></a>’s blissful exercises of saccharine joy, Mizuguchi’s baby has grown into something that looks back on its history, the way it communicated to players, and now we have a statement of pure intent. That statement? Enjoy yourself.</p>

<h2><em>Lumines Arise&nbsp;</em>Review | Final Verdict</h2>

<p>Despite a heinous UX, <em>Lumines Arise</em> genuinely finds itself leaps and bounds above Enhance’s previous titles, in what should become a mainstay title. The gameplay of <em>Lumines </em>is the pinnacle of the phrase “easy to learn, hard to master”, and nowhere is it better showcased than here. A beautiful sprawling entity of brilliant music, fantastic visual design, and worthwhile vibes.</p>

            <p>New browser game <a href="https://cxmi.itch.io/too-high">Too High</a> is about trying to form credible, humanlike sentences while absolutely whazzed on happy eggs at a party, but I think it also performs pretty well as a send-up of social anxiety at large.</p>
<p>Created by Christine Mi for the “Worst Nightmare” week of Itch gamejam <a href="https://itch.io/jam/prototype-studio-2025-week-9">Prototype Studio 2025</a>, it sees you ushering the words of a greeting together with your mouse, only for them to be knocked out of formation by other, rising and falling phrases such as “am I going to die” and “what did they just say”.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>You’ve got to herd those kittenish letters into coherence before your “Awkwardness” bar fills up. I was too frightened to learn what happens when your “Awkwardness” bar fills up, so I’ve got the game paused at about 90%, having successfully completed the utterance “I’m Christine super”. I’ve certainly said worse things at parties. Oh no, now I’m remembering things I have said at parties. Get ye behind me, New Year 2015.</p>
<p>I can well imagine an audio-based version of this game, with players fumbling towards the echo of a "hello" or a "hey", against a screenful of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iABq4JdaRIs">context-free Bocchi the Rock scenes</a>. Please don’t make that game, Christine. You have done enough. Perhaps even less pleasantly, I'd love somebody to mod this into a first-person <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> that simulates either woozy incapacity or just the mortal fear of being asked your name and job title. Socially anxious <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a>, now there's a concept.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-ledge-grab-spaceport-exploit-movement-tech-2000642966</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/arc-raiders%E2%80%99-ledge-grab-exploit-is-bad-actually.1350025/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Back in the day when I used to main <i>Call of Duty</i>’s extraction mode, DMZ, any time my plans to play sniper boss on a tall tower went awry and I had to skedaddle, I’d just leap off of a building and, without much thought or concern, hit the ground and run and hide somewhere. It was cheap. But also, there was an infinite parachute on my back. It was a part of the game. Am I supposed to not use it?</p>

 <p>Well, as we’ve now seen for a little bit, you can kinda sorta do the same thing in <i>Arc Raiders</i>. But instead of an infinite parachute, you can exploit how the game handles characters grabbing onto ledges to fall from incredible heights with basically no harm to your character. It’s not right. I don’t agree with it. You should stop doing it. Camp the extraction point? Fine. But if I see you do this ledge thing from somewhere ridiculous like the skyscraper-sized launch tower in Spaceport, I don’t care if you’re fighting a Leaper or are running from a Rocketeer. I’m hopping on the mic to have a conversation with you about unsportsmanlike conduct.</p>

 <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-embark-pvp-toxic-betrayal-leaper-2000640905"><i>Arc Raiders</i>: The Sickest, Silliest, And Most Spectacular Moments From The Game So Far</a></p> <p>I first caught sight of this little exploit back when I wrote up a montage of all the hijinks that <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-embark-pvp-toxic-betrayal-leaper-2000640905">unfolded during <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ first weekend</a>. I’d hoped that, amusing as it was to watch, it would be a little too tricky to pull off reliably. Well, no. As <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/third-person-shooter/arc-raiders-players-crack-its-movement-tech-wide-open-by-mastering-the-ledge-grab/">Morgan Park over at <i>PC Gamer</i></a> has documented, folks have figured out how to do this reliably. But unlike my colleague, I don’t find it amusing.</p>

   <p>It essentially works like this: Fall from a great height but be sure there’s a ledge to grab waiting far below. Hold down the jump key or button while you’re falling and you’ll grab the ledge, your character’s arm sockets apparently absorbing the impact of falling from terminal velocity to cancel out all of the fall damage you right earned.</p>

 <p><i>Kotaku</i> has reached out to Embark Studios for comment on this “movement tech.”</p> <p>Don’t get me wrong. I do enjoy a good movement exploit when it feels like it requires a bit of mastery to pull off. “<a href="https://youtu.be/5QYRCVS7ix4">Curb sliding” in <i>Halo Infinite</i></a> (RIP) was one such thing. After sprinting, you could slide off a ledge to get a boost in speed. It was tricky to do, especially amidst the chaos of a good <i>Halo </i>match.</p>

 <p>But I don’t see that kind of skill in this ledge grab trick in <i>Arc Raiders</i>. Being able to bail from a high vantage point without consequence feels a little too easy, and antithetical to the fairly grounded approach to combat <i>Arc Raiders</i> seems to be going for.</p> <p>Ledges and climbing are quite important in <i>Arc Raiders</i>, so much so that the game sometimes reminds me a little bit of <i>Uncharted</i>. As some folks have commented in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1kmrtjt/i_hope_this_doesnt_get_patched/">a Reddit post documenting the ledge-grab exploit</a>, grabbing onto a ledge from a great height is fine, but it shouldn’t cancel out fall damage. Especially when you’re jumping off something as tall as a skyscraper. Such silliness.</p>

              <p>Since the launch of the Nintendo Switch 2 in June, <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-key-card-game-cart-physical-list-confirmed-1851777742">players have been pretty miffed</a> to discover that the physical versions of many games don’t actually contain the game at all. Instead they’re so-called “game-key cards,” essentially a phony game cart that only contains an instruction to download the game from Nintendo’s servers. Until now, it’s something that’s only affected third-party titles, <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-elden-ring-digital-downloads-1851774694">albeit some very big-name games</a>. But now—with March 5, 2026’s <em>Pokémon Pokopia</em>—the phenomenon will seemingly affect a Nintendo-published game for the first time.</p>

 <p>While this isn’t fully confirmed, it’s all but certain after Nintendo simultaneously announced a March 5 release date for the <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-pokopia-animal-crossing-switch-2-nintendo-direct-2000625331">recently revealed <em>Animal Crossing-</em>like <em>Pokémon Pokopia</em></a>, and a video explaining how game-key cards work that used&nbsp;<em>Pokopia</em> as an example.</p>

  <p>Game-key cards have caused a huge amount of consternation among those who want to be able to simply buy and own a game, knowing it will be theirs and available to play forever. While Xbox and PlayStation consoles have long been plagued by shipping with discs containing just a fraction of a game’s code, or none at all, it’s not something that afflicted Nintendo consoles until the Switch 2. On every previous Nintendo device, if you bought a physical game for it, you can still install and play it today, going right back to the Game Boy. But no longer. And it’s seemingly happening for incredibly stupid reasons.</p>

 <p>For reasons no one but Nintendo seems to know, <a href="https://gamerant.com/nintendo-switch-2-cartridges-new-size-capacity/">the Switch 2 only offers 64GB carts to publishers</a> for their games to ship on, with the price (according to&nbsp;<em>Digital Foundry</em>) set at $23 a piece. That’s far bigger than most people need, and obliterates profits, so with Nintendo offering no other options, publishers are naturally picking the only other option, the fake carts. (In other cases, <a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-switch-2-game-key-card-2000623413">like&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws</em></a>, it’s about transfer speeds from the cart to the system without installing on the Switch 2’s SSD.)</p>

 <p>It’s absolutely fascinating that it’s only now that Nintendo intends to use a game-key card for the first time that the company has felt the need to explain them to its audience. In the jaunty video, it explains how it’s selling you an empty box as if it’s doing you a favor, using <em>Pokémon Pokopia</em><em>&nbsp;</em>as its example throughout. The game, which is “only” 10GB, would therefore also make using the 64GB carts extremely expensive, even for Nintendo, a fact which is likely driving this decision. But, you ask, why not just make cheaper 16GB and 32GB carts, too? Well, yes, great question.</p>

 <p>So why buy the boxes at all, if all you’re doing is adding an extra series of steps and a huge amount of wasteful plastic and shipping to what amounts to just downloading a game anyway? Well, the one advantage that remains is that you can—for now—use the same game-key card in a different Nintendo Switch 2, and thus share your game with your friends without having to go through that god-awful time-limited digital sharing feature that was added to the console. You can even (audible gasp) sell them when you’re done.</p> <p>However, it remains a massive disappointment that now even Nintendo is using this preservation-destroying option for its first-party titles. The day the servers are switched off, which we know will be far too soon, none of these carts will do a single thing and the game you bought will be lost forever.</p>

              <p>Is Jesus now canon in <em>Game of Thrones</em>? Will we get a surprise <em>Final Fantasy XIII</em> announcement at this week’s PlayStation State of Play? And why are video game genre names usually terrible? Welcome to the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture. I purchased <em>Star Wars: Rogue Squadron</em> last night and have been having the time of my life. I also re-watched <em>Episode 2: Attack of the Clones</em> and was much less impressed. It remains the worst <em>Star Wars</em> movie by far.</p>

 <h2>A Lannister always pays his AI</h2> <p>“So just to let y’all know the new [<em>A Feast For Crows</em>] illustrated edition is like almost definitely ai lol and id argue has taken pretty hard ’inspiration’ from existing fanart,” X user <span>novembernatten <a href="https://x.com/novembernatten/status/1986109371177181669">wrote</a> in a post that blew up last week (via <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/game-of-thrones-ai-art-controversy-a-feast-for-crows-artist-responds-denies/"><em>TheGamer</em></a>). They weren’t the only one throwing around accusations of generative AI, and now the publisher has stepped in to tell fans they’re wrong.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="ht" dir="ltr">lol. lmao, even <a href="https://t.co/YYwEO911nb">pic.twitter.com/YYwEO911nb</a></p> <p>— 2åse (@novembernatten) <a href="https://twitter.com/novembernatten/status/1986109385383330281?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 5, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“Recently there have been accusations floating around that the Penguin Random House’s illustrated edition of <em>A Feast For Crows</em> was produced using AI generative art,” Raya Golden, responsible for<em> Song of Fire and Ice</em> book materials, <a href="https://georgerrmartin.com/notablog/2025/11/10/ffc-art-accusations/">wrote</a> on George R.R. Martin’s blog yesterday. “To our knowledge and as presented by the artist who completed the work in question there was NO such programing used. While he is a digital multimedia artist and relies on digital programing to complete his work, he has expressed unequivocally that no AI was used, and we believe him.”</p>

 <p>Fans remain unconvinced, however. <a href="https://x.com/Mayham_H/status/1988054172613120286">They point to</a> an apparent crucifix that blurrily appears in the background of one of the scenes. “Uh. Then why are they all in blue?” <a href="https://x.com/andrewhunt_/status/1988046433899999721">wrote</a> one. “Why is there a cross on a wall? Why is Tywin obviously an AI recreation of Viserys? Why is there no heraldry? It genuinely could not be more obvious and no amount of lying is gonna work.” Is this a case of AI slop or just bad art?</p>

 <h2>Is <em>Final Fantasy XIII</em> finally getting ported?</h2> <p>That’s the wishcasting from some fans after discovering a <em>Final Fantasy XIII</em> voice actor will be <a href="https://x.com/Genki_JPN/status/1988112940428587350">MC-ing the PlayStation Japan State of Play</a> this week. It might just be cope, but a trilogy ported to PlayStation 5 (and Switch 2) would be pretty awesome. It’s the only major <em>Final Fantasy</em> arc that’s not playable on Sony’s current hardware.</p>

 <h2>Former <em>Marathon</em> dev thinks “extraction” is a bad genre name</h2> <p>Ex-Bungie production manager Chris Sides told the Shooter Monthly podcast it’s “dumb. “I hate the genre name of extraction shooter,” he said (via <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/marathon/extraction-shooter"><em>PCGamesN</em></a>). “When I was working on <em>Marathon</em>, I was working with marketing, dying to be like, ‘Can we please create a different genre name?’ because extraction shooter is so dumb. It’s the only genre where its name is a mechanic.”</p>

 <p>He continued, “I cannot stand the name of it. So I think that when you say the extraction genre, it should hit your spot. I think it’s really the fact that the genre doesn’t even know what it is. You, as a player, how do you know what you’re going to get? And I think that’s one of the real issues with the genre itself.”</p>

 <h2><em>Battlefield 6</em>‘s nasty drone glitch has finally been fixed</h2> <p>Players will no longer be able to <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-drone-glitch-fix-patch-ruining-matches-update-2000641355">take to the skies and rain down death</a>. “Fixed an exploit allowing players to ascend and access unintended areas when standing on a XFGM-6D Recon Drone by hitting it with the Sledgehammer,” EA’s developers confirmed in the <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/article/1987957508426608743">latest patch notes</a>.</p> <h2>Switch 2 gets some nifty new features</h2> <p>A <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68473/~/system-update-information-for-nintendo-switch%26nbsp%3B2">new firmware update</a> made small but notable tweaks to the new console. Those include updated game card icons to make it clear when an installation is from a physical or digital purchase, the ability to cancel multiple game downloads at once, and an option to keep the system from going into rest mode while GameChat is active. Most importantly, perhaps, there’s now an “Improved the screen display when using Adjust Screen Size to make it easier to adjust.” Hopefully, that makes it easier to fix the system’s poor HDR implementation.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/elder-scrolls-6-tes6-shadow-drop-todd-howard-release-date-fallout-3-2000642434">We’ll probably get <em>Fallout 3</em> remastered before <em>The Elder Scrolls 6</em></a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/goodnight-universe-review-before-your-eyes-webcam-baby-2000642517">The developers behind a radically innovative 2021 indie game are back with something more mixed</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/trap-plan-marketing-astroturf-warrobots-fake-reddit-accounts-posts-2000642503">A game company gloats about an astroturfed marketing campaign on Reddit</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It has been revealed that the release of Helldivers 2 on Xbox helped increase engagement as well as sales for the PS5 and PC versions. </p>



<p>Arrowhead Game Studios released Helldivers 2 for Xbox in August 2025, and that decision helped revitalise the game for a new platform of players. <span>It was also revealed earlier this year that Helldivers 2 sold more on Xbox than PlayStation&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-sold-more-on-xbox-than-playstation-in-the-first-six-days/" target="_blank">in its first six days,&nbsp;</a>and now, it seems that the Xbox port has also helped bolster&nbsp;</span>sales on other platforms. </p>







<h2 id="h-helldivers-2-xbox-port-helped-provide-a-significant-increase-in-sales-for-ps5-and-pc">Helldivers 2 Xbox Port Helped Provide a “Significant Increase in Sales” for PS5 and PC</h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://thisweekinvideogames.com/news/destiny-2-hasnt-reached-sonys-expectations-for-bungie-acquisition-says-cfo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">This Week in Video Games</a> (via <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/helldivers-2-xbox-port-boosted-ps5-pc-player-figures/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TheGamer</a>), Sony Group CFO Lin Tao spoke about Helldivers 2’s Xbox port contributing towards PS5 and PC sales during a Q&amp;A portion of the company’s earnings call. Tao first talked about how their live service titles “overall accounted for more than 40% of our first-party software revenue.” Even though performance is different for each title, they observed that live service games are “a recurring source of revenue” similar to the previous quarter. </p>



<p>Tao then spoke about Helldivers 2, stating that it was also released for Xbox in 2025 and “is doing extremely well.” The group CFO added that the Xbox port has not only helped bring in new players on Xbox but also increased engagement from existing users on PS5 and PC. This move has “resulted in a significant increase in sales of the title year on year.” Tao concluded, stating, “Building on this recent progress, we aim to strengthen our studio, business, and expand our IP franchises through continuous learning and improvement.” </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fallout-4-anniversary-edition">Fallout 4 Anniversary Edition</a> was meant to act as a celebration of Bethesda’s post-apocalyptic role-playing game on its tenth birthday. But it turns out that things haven’t exactly gone to plan as the update was met with a backlash on Steam.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The $59.99 Fallout 4 Anniversary Edition includes the six official Fallout 4 expansions and over 150 Creation Club items (paid mods). But there’s also a Fallout 4 Anniversary Edition upgrade Bethesda is selling to existing owners of the base game, priced $39.99.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Bethesda points out that this upgrade offers a discount on all the items sold separately, fans have hit out at the pricing for the Anniversary Edition, especially in the context of Fallout 4 itself being a decade old and what the Anniversary Edition actually gets you. It’s worth noting that the Fallout 4 base game is currently $19.99 on Steam (it launched at $59.99), and the Fallout 4 Game of the Year Edition, which includes the base game and all the six official expansions, costs $39.99.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Fallout 4 - Creations Bundle, which includes the 150 paid mods released as part of the Anniversary Edition, costs $19.99 on its own. And it’s the Steam store page for this bundle that has born the brunt of the backlash, with a ‘mostly negative’ user review rating.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Complaints there report crashing issues, glitches, and even a problem with getting the new mods to work. Meanwhile, it sounds like the Anniversary Edition is breaking prior mods, although <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesda-issues-fallout-4-mod-warning-ahead-of-anniversary-edition-release-patch-will-make-gameplay-and-performance-improvements-as-well-as-add-new-creations-menu">Bethesda warned this would happen when it came to mods that affect the new Creation Club menu</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Be a gamer in 2025,” reads the most helpful review, according to Steam. “You purchase the content. You don't get the content in game. Bethesda's update causes even more crashes. Trying to quit the game causes it to crash. GG.”</p><div id="fallout-4-perks-tier-list" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Fallout 4 Perks Tier List</h3><h3>Fallout 4 Perks Tier List</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">“It is bugging out like crazy and not giving out all of the creations that are mentioned in the bundle,” another review reports. “Game absolutely refuses to let you attempt to install anything involving the Creation Club and freezes upon launching and quitting the game to the point where you can’t even use task manager or Steam to force close. For the love of god Bethesda, this is worse than Skyrim's anniversary launch. Fix your game.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The reaction on the Fallout subreddit features a similar sentiment, and yes, the memes have begun.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The backlash has also spilled over into Steam reviews for the Fallout 4 base game, where negative reviews have flooded in following the Anniversary Edition’s release, causing recent reviews to plummet to ‘mixed.’</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“They just killed the game with this Anniversary update,” reads one negative review on the Fallout 4 base game. “Not going to sort my 400+ mods as it would take days. Goodbye Fallout, I would like to say I will miss you but I won't.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a disappointing start for Fallout’s big push ahead of the hotly anticipated December launch of Fallout Season 2 on Prime Video. A new Fallout: New Vegas bundle is also due out, with a Fallout TV show-themed update to Fallout 76 also coming in December. Hopefully Bethesda can sort these issues out sooner rather than later.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Fallout 4 - Creations Menu Update November 10 patch notes:</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Creations Menu</strong>: A new in-game Creations menu has been added, making it easier than ever to discover, download and enjoy content from professional developers and passionate enthusiasts alike.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Gameplay &amp; Performance</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>VATS Accuracy:</strong> VATS hit chances are now consistent across platforms and no longer drop to 0% or show incorrect values.
