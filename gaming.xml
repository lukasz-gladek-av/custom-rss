            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/15/why-nostalgia-is-this-years-most-popular-game-mode/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Sit back in your favourite armchair, brush down that dusty controller, and put on your glasses – no, not the ones for far away, the ones for reading – while I tell you a story about the days of yore. In my time, and probably your time, games came out that were ground-breaking, earth-shattering and occasionally even fun. Lots of people bought and played those games, and they became cemented in our psyches, like a good book, or that random interaction with a stranger seven years ago where you said “Hurgle” instead of “Hello”.</p>
<p>Seemingly, those games are better than the ones we’ve been given subsequently, and so we’ve been inundated with remasters and remakes over the past decade and a bit… but now even live service games are getting in on the action, making Sony’s trend of remaking PS4 games look like they’re unearthing great lost wonders of the world. Can you really pine for the good old days, when those are barely 5 years ago?</p>



<p>And yet, we do. In the past month alone, the nostalgia levels have hit an all time high. On the one hand you have Blizzard weighing up whether or not to undo the format changes of Overwatch 2, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/26/overwatch-2-could-be-going-back-to-6v6-as-blizzard-plans-gameplay-tests/">bringing back test modes with the original 6v6 battles</a> – <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/news/24146047/a-blast-to-the-past-begins-with-overwatch-classic">aptly branded as Overwatch Classic</a> – that made it an instant hit, and cemented it as the multiplayer shooter to beat. Given that everyone has argued that its shift to 5v5 ruined the game – “In my day sonny, we could have <em>two</em> tanks” – it’s strange that it’s taken this long, but Blizzard are never one for doing things quickly. Even when they make mistakes in a hurry, they’ll take their time to fix things.</p>
<p>But multiplayer gaming like it’s 2016 would feels like Ye Olden Days when compared to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/fortnite">Fortnite</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a>. Here are two of the biggest multiplayer shooters in the world, and they’re rolling us <a href="https://x.com/FortniteGame/status/1856351379838701691">right back to the original maps</a>, trying to recapture the point in time when they were at the cutting edge. It’s almost like they’re admitting that years of development, patches and updates have resulted in a creative cul-de-sac, where you’re faced with an array of familiar looking battle passes, meta tweaks, and over-the-top cosmetics.</p>

<p>Is this the result of creative bankruptcy? It’s been over half a decade since their respective launches, when they burst into the public consciousness, riding the wave of new and groundbreaking development, and it takes a lot to cling onto someone’s attention for that long. The fourth or fifth time that you blow up the map and launch a new one isn’t quite as exciting as the first.</p>

<p>These games are on very different paths, though. Blizzard and Respawn both seem to be trying to find or reimagine that original magic, but while in Overwatch 2’s case that’s potentially reverting its core, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/06/apex-legends-new-launch-royale-mode-rewinds-back-to-2019/">Apex Legends’ Launch Royale is a limited time mode</a>, while the game as a whole looks to push forward. EA aren’t looking for Apex 2.0, but ways to keep players hooked with things like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/25/ea-backtracks-on-some-apex-legends-season-22-battle-pass-changes/">the mid-season battle pass cuts</a>. Fortnite, meanwhile, has grown into something else entirely. It now supports user generated content, plays host to a whole LEGO experience, Fall Guys and a Rocket League racing mode, and regular live music events. Bringing back the original battle royale map, reviving the earlier battle passes and unlocks is sure to rekindle FOMO in anyone that missed out first time around, but it’s also kind of just another mode.</p>
<p>But while their goals are all somewhat different, they’ve all ended up at the same place: nostalgia.&nbsp;People loved all of these games in the beginning, so why not bring elements of them back? Nostalgia is a powerful emotion, a keen draw, and as we enter a time where older players have been gaming their entire lives, there’s a lot to draw on. Further to that, those older players are the ones with money. I can afford a good few Overwatch skins as an adult, while my children have to weigh up whether that’s a useful way to spend their pocket money. That’s a hard choice when Kinder Eggs exist.</p>
<p>Arguably, there are also players out there who won’t have experienced these things. For whom 2016, 2018 and 2019 was actually the distant past – especially given how 2020-21 felt like a decade. Will they find out that things were better? Or will they miss the changes, miss<em> their</em> version of the game? In some ways it’s a dangerous road to travel, appeasing part of the community while annoying another.</p>

<p>What is certain is that this era of nostalgia in gaming isn’t going to disappear. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/world-of-warcraft">World of Warcraft</a>, a game that’s never released its grip on the MMO genre it dominated from the moment it launched, is another one looking to the past in order to secure its future. With <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/09/06/world-of-warcraft-classic-review/">WoW Classic now five years old</a> and with its impending shift into becoming Kung Fu Panda the MMO again, Blizzard launching new servers to WoW Classic to let players start from the very beginning all over again – WoW Classic Classic, if you will.</p>
<p>So who’s next on the nostalgia list? Are we going to see Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Un-Reborn?&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a> roll back to a pre-<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/05/01/fallout-76-wastelanders-reviews/">Wastelanders</a> version? <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/halo-the-master-chief-collection">Halo: The Master Chief Collection</a> bring back the broken matchmaking from launch? <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/no-mans-sky">No Man’s Sky</a> launch edition? <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/call-of-duty">Call of Duty</a> reintroduce jet packs?</p>

<p>I’m obviously being flippant, but the problem with leaning on nostalgia like this is that it’s typically very fleeting. You can’t truly recapture that magic of experiencing something for the first time, or playing through it with a group of friends who you likely don’t see online anymore. Maybe you’ll raise the banner for a brief weekend or two, but people have moved on, things have changed, and you aren’t the same person you used to be. And when developers trot out their limited time nostalgia event for the third or fourth time, it’s not going to be anywhere near as impactful.</p>
<p>Does that hurt? Are we being emotionally manipulated? Of course we are. But no more so than a movie being re-released, or a book re-printed with flashy new covers. There is a comfort to be found in returning to the past, even if it’s only for a short while, and when game development is so cutthroat and competitive, this is one way for developers to keep the lights on, while feeding and pacifying a community that they’ve built over many years. Hopefully, it gives them time to look at what’s next, building characters, games and modes that will spark the same powerful emotions that the original ones did. It’s smart, it’s sustainable, and it sure as hell makes a lot of money.</p>
<p>So, for the moment, nostalgia is the best game mode, but we’d best drive back out of this creative cul-de-sac before we run out of petrol. Now, where <em>are</em> my glasses?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-impressive-8k-resolution-no-mans-sky/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro is capable of delivering impressive <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-is-an-incredible-feat-of-engineering-says-hello-games-no-mans-sky-8k30fps-mode/">8K resolution gameplay in No Man's Sky</a>, so much so that the game's 8K mode could begin to change minds about the viability of such a high resolution.</p>
<p>The tech experts at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DFClipsChannel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> took an in-depth look at the PlayStation 5 Pro patch of the popular game developed by Hello Games, highlighting how the game's 8K mode delivers extremely sharp visuals, thanks to PSSR, which upscales the game from a base resolution of around 2700p to 8K. The image quality remains impressive even in motion, proving once again how high base resolutions deliver much better upscaling results. Looking at performance, unlike what the in-game menus suggest, framerate is always capped at a properly paced 30 FPS in 8K mode, which makes the game absolutely playable in this mode. In addition, No Man's Sky seems to be the perfect showcase for an 8K resolution mode, as the game's high contrast and highly stylized visuals with long vistas suit such a high resolution incredibly well.</p>
<p><iframe title="No Man's Sky on PS5 Pro Has 8K Support... And We've Tested It" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CBjU3v67s_E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While the PlayStation 5 Pro is delivering impressive results in patched games like No Man's Sky, <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-god-of-war-ragnarok-pssr-framerate-down/">God of War Ragnarok</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-patch/">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a>, the system isn't delivering the touted 45% improvement over the base model in unpatched games. This is likely caused by <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-game-boost-falls-short-memory-bandwidth/">memory bandwidth constraints</a> that prevent games from taking full advantage of the system's power without a proper patch. Still, the improvements are there, making the system a worthy one to purchase for those who want to enjoy PS5 games at their possible best. You can learn more about the system in our<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/playstation-5-pro-hardware-the-next-gen-graphics-upgrade/"> review.</a></p>

As a first-party Microsoft game, Avowed launches day one on Game Pass.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s the Battle.net launch that’s of most interest here, because it means you’ll be able to buy the game with World of Warcraft gold.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s how it works: WoW Tokens can be exchanged for Battle.net Balance, not just game time, which means players can indirectly buy anything Blizzard sells for real-world money with in-game gold. Players can buy a WoW Token from Blizzard for $20 and either keep it for later or put it on the in-game auction house. Another player will (hopefully) buy that token from the auction house for in-game gold, then exchange it for $15 of Battle.net Balance (Blizzard effectively takes a $5 tax from the transaction). Battle.net Balance can then be used to buy anything Blizzard sells for World of Warcraft for real-world money, including video games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the time of this article’s publication, a WoW Token is going for 262,365 gold (the price fluctuates as demand rises and falls). At its cheapest, Avowed costs $69.99, which means you’ll need five WoW Tokens to exchange for enough Battle.net Balance to buy the game. That equates to 1.3 million gold.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s a lot of gold most players probably don’t have lying around. But with Avowed three months from launch, there is time to get that WoW gold grind going, if you’re determined to buy the game without actually buying the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, it’s worth noting that Microsoft is selling up to five days of early access to Avowed via the Premium Edition, which costs $89.99 and also includes two premium skin packs and access to the digital artbook and soundtrack.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

It then spotted a Reddit user called Archbox (Archbox was a moderator of r/SwitchPirates). Based on their posts, the law firm was able to identify Archbox as James Williams.

            <p>
The boss of GTA Trilogy developer Grove Street Games has spoken out on social media to blast the removal of "primary developers from credits" following the game's major update this week for PC and consoles.
</p>
<p>
Tuesday's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/three-years-later-gta-trilogy-finally-gets-pc-and-console-fixes-from-improved-mobile-port">GTA Trilogy patch finally brought over fixes</a> from the games' <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2023-grand-theft-auto-the-trilogy-the-definitive-edition-tested-on-iphone">better-received mobile version</a> (worked on by another studio, Video Games Deluxe) such as a Classic Lighting mode which restores the look of the games' original versions, plus improvements to character models and other visual tweaks. 
</p>
<p>
The update also aligned the GTA Trilogy's opening splash screen to that of the mobile version, with Rockstar simply mentioned as GTA's developer. 
</p>
<p>
It's this change which Grove Street Games' Thomas Williamson appears to be reacting to now on social media.
</p>
<p>
"Speaking entire hypothetically," Williamson <a href="https://twitter.com/TSWilliamson/status/1857124999045222581">wrote</a> on X, "it's a dick move to remove primary developers from credits in an update, especially when an update includes hundreds of fixes that were provided by those developers that stayed out of players' hands for years."
</p>
<p>
As pointed out by fans of the GTA Trilogy, however, the games' credits have not changed and Grove Street Games and its staff are still listed as before. 
</p> <div>

<p>
Ensuring <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/why-are-localisation-workers-regularly-left-out-of-game-credits">staff who work on games receive proper accreditation has long been a thorny issue</a>, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/100-staff-cut-from-la-noire-credits">Rockstar itself in the past heavily criticised for leaving staff members out</a> of credits. Here, however, Williamson's comments - hypothetical as they are - appear to be based on misleading media reports that suggested Grove Street Games was no longer credited at all. 
</p>
<p>
Williamson previously made headlines when GTA Trilogy first arrived, riddled with bugs, performance issues and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dataminers-discover-hot-coffee-code-in-gta-the-trilogy-the-definitive-edition">code for the illicit Hot Coffee sex mini-game</a>, to comment on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-inundated-with-refund-requests-as-grand-theft-auto-the-trilogy-the-definitive-edition-backlash-intensifies">enormous wave of backlash</a> against the game.
</p>
<p>
"It's so fun to see players out there really enjoying what we've put together for them," Williamson <a href="https://x.com/TSWilliamson/status/1458796005185531906">wrote</a> at the time, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-apologises-for-gta-trilogy-definitive-editions-unexpected-issues-re-lists-classic-versions-for-pc">Rockstar itself apologised</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pc-owners-of-the-gta-trilogy-remaster-can-claim-an-extra-game-for-free">offered a free game to PC owners</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-says-it-pulled-grand-theft-auto-the-trilogy-the-definitive-edition-from-sale-on-pc-to-remove-files-unintentionally-included">pulled GTA Trilogy offline for days</a>. "I'm honestly enjoying this unparalleled level of scrutiny on our studio. Today we are celebrating our monumental project launch, while we work on updates. :-)"

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/starfield-shattered-space-feedback-discussed-by-microsoft%E2%80%99s-phil-spencer.1036659/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/starfield-shattered-space-feedback-discussed-by-microsofts-phil-spencer/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Bethesda Game Studios released the Starfield Shattered Space expansion roughly two months ago. The reception, however, wasn't great. On Wccftech, the expansion got a mere six out of ten, whereas the base game was rated nine out of ten. Francesco De Meo <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-shattered-space-may-the-great-serpent-save-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a> about Starfield Shattered Space:</p>
<p><em>The Starfield Shattered Space expansion leaves a lot to be desired. While it introduces a more focused and engaging story compared to the base game, the average map and quest design, along with the lack of new features, turn the adventure in Va'Ruun'kai into a bit of a slog rather quickly. Although the tighter focus is welcome, the Starfield experience as a whole needs something more substantial to reach its full potential.</em></p>
<p>One of the complaints cited in the above quote was directly addressed by Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer in his recent interview <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/xbox-phil-spencer-blizzard-avowed-south-of-midnight" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with Game File</a> (where he also <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-wasnt-delayed-because-it-was-in-a-bad-shape-phil-spencer-confirms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discussed</a> the true reasons behind Avowed's delay). According to the executive, Bethesda will try to tune the development efforts for future expansions and free updates.</p>
<p><em>We're always learning. Todd Howard and I were talking about Shattered Space. Starfield is a game I put a ton of hours into and really love, but they've had this thing where they've added features throughout the year and then they had an expansion. I think some of the feedback on the expansion is: ‘We wanted more features.’ And he's like, ‘Well, should we have waited to put <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-land-vehicles-shown-in-leaked-video/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">buggies</a> out? And so, I think you're trying to tune both development effort and the impact of the expansion. And I think there will always be a balance to managing the game month to month.</em></p>
<p>Spencer was also quick to point out that Microsoft does not mandate the release of expansions for every game, despite the recent releases (beyond Bethesda's Starfield Shattered Space, Blizzard launched Diablo IV: Vessel of Hatred and World of Warcraft: The War Within).</p>
<p><em>Not every game will do expansions. It's really left to the creators what plan they have for their stories. I think it's a great way for us to reengage players who may be lapsed. I don't like expansions that are manipulative. I want it to have a unique point of view. I don't want it to be, like, the third level that you cut before you launched.</em></p>
<p>Bethesda hasn't yet spoken about what's next after Starfield Shattered Space, but we'll be sure to report it here as soon as we learn about it.</p>

<p>In recent years, the United Kingdom’s gaming scene has been shaken by a dwindling count of in-person events. It was tough coming out of COVID-19, but for a while, a decent spread kept gamers across the nation entertained. We had EGX, Insomnia, WASD, and a few other, smaller events scattered here and there.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, Insomnia disappeared following a round of layoffs at the event’s parent company. Now, after months of speculation, it has been revealed that WASD London, which first took place in 2022, has been struck from the schedule forever as the organiser enters liquidation.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-to-nothing">To Nothing</h2>



<p>In October, EGX surfaced as it does every year, but it was twinned with MCM, the nation’s biggest comic con event. It was suspected that this was to help keep both events afloat, and while the turnout was solid, the future of EGX is also under threat.</p>



<p>The Insomnia Gaming Festival, which celebrated its 25th anniversary this year, was due to take place in September, but the expected show dates came and went without a word being uttered.</p>



<p>Now, WASD London’s organiser has entered liquidation, with the firm’s co-founder lamenting the state of the scene:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>(The) increasing costs and less demand for stand space means running events is just not viable for us anymore.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>For a while, WASD London was becoming a spearhead event in the city. It welcomed both top-tier titles and indie developers, helping to cast a light on lesser-known games with small (or no) budgets while also allowing players to enjoy the next biggest games.</p>



<p>At past WASD events, I was fortunate enough to be one of the first people in the country to play Dead Island 2 and Lords of the Fallen. I maintain that when it peaked, WASD London was one of the best industry events in the United Kingdom.</p>



<p>In a comment posted <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5yxvxzp909o" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">on a BBC article</a>, one indie gaming aficionado expressed their concerns about the sustainability of these events:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Now that bigger gaming companies are running their own digital events, there’s no reason for them to spend time, money, and resources on being present at in-person events.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Pretty soon, all we’ll have that’s anywhere close to the UK will be Gamescom – but the saving grace there is that it’s effectively the world’s biggest gaming expo right now.</p>

<p>Obsidian has revealed the minimum and recommended system requirements for running Avowed on a PC.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Avowed is an upcoming fantasy RPG with a vibrant open world that you can experience from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/avowed-deep-dive-video-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first-person and third-person perspectives</a>. Many players have wondered what specifications they might need to experience the game as the developers intended. Fortunately, Avowed’s minimum and recommended PC requirements are <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2457220/Avowed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">out now</a>; check them out below.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-minimum-system-requirements">Minimum System Requirements&nbsp;</h2>



<ul>
<li>OS: Windows 10/11 with updates</li>



<li>Processor: AMD Ryzen 5 2600 / Intel i5-8400</li>



<li>Memory: 16 GB RAM</li>



<li>Graphics: AMD RX 5700 / Nvidia GTX 1070 / Intel Arc A580</li>



<li>DirectX: Version 12</li>



<li>Storage: 75 GB available space</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-recommended-system-requirements">Recommended System Requirements&nbsp;</h2>



<ul>

<li>Processor: AMD Ryzen 5 5600X / Intel i7-10700K</li>

<li>Graphics: Graphics: AMD RX 6800 XT / Nvidia RTX 3080</li>



<li>DirectX: Version 12</li>



<li>Storage: 75 GB available space</li>
</ul>



<p>The requirements aren’t too demanding, with players only needing an AMD Ryzen 5 2600 / Intel i5-8400 and AMD RX 5700 / Nvidia GTX 1070 / Intel Arc A580 to run the game. At the same time, 75 GB of storage space, 16GB of RAM, and DirectX Version 12 are essential for both Avowed’s minimum and recommended PC system requirements.</p>

Phil Spencer has stated that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/avowed-delay-wasnt-due-to-game-quality-phil-spencer-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the game wasn’t delayed due to quality concerns</a>.

        <p>"That's one of the ones that got away."</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>It's official - Ubisoft's beleaguered Splinter Cell movie has been cancelled.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://thedirect.com/article/splinter-cell-tom-hardy-movie-exclusive">The Direct</a>, the movie - which was announced over a decade ago and was set to star Tom Hardy - has been canned because the production team "just couldn't get it right".</p>

<p>"That movie would have been awesome... Just couldn't get it right, script-wise, budget-wise," said producer Basil Iwanyk.</p>
<p>"But it was going to be great. We had a million different versions of it, but it was going to be hardcore and awesome. That's one of the ones that got away, which is really sad."</p>
<p>Whilst undoubedly a blow to Ubisoft and Sam Fisher fans everywhere, not all is lost, as Ubisoft still has several TV and movie adaptations on the way.</p>

<p>Avowed is set to release on February 18, 2025, and the developers, Obsidian, have just revealed the title’s pre-order details and different game editions available for sale. A premium edition, which provides players with up to five days of early access and other content, is also up for grabs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Avowed’s pre-orders are live now, and players can purchase the standard edition for <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/avowed-standard-edition/9MSVPJCHHRPR/0017" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">$69.99</a>. It is worth noting that Avowed is also available on day one with Xbox Game Pass. The standard edition provides players access to the base game and no additional content.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Regarding the Premium Edition for Avowed, players have two choices for their pre-orders: digital or physical. The Digital Premium edition costs <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/avowed-premium-edition/9NFHQ2719J83/0017" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">$89.99</a> and provides five days of early access, two premium skin packs, and access to the Digital Artbook and Soundtrack.

For the price of $24.99, you can receive all the premium edition digital content and up to five days of early access, allowing you to enter the game from February 13.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Avowed Digital Artbook and Soundtrack consists of “behind-the-scenes artwork from the team and music by composer Venus Theory”. Players will receive the Eora Collection Set and Obsidian Collection Set for the two premium skin packs. Eora is a throwback set inspired by characters and regions from Pillars of Eternity. On the other hand, Obsidian is inspired by the developing studio, featuring sleek, black outfits.&nbsp;</p>

The idea Microsoft is trying to get across, which is in keeping with its previous messaging, is that Xbox is less about consoles these days and more about being able to play on any device capable of playing a video game. So, in this sense, a TV is an Xbox, a phone is an Xbox, etc.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/15/tiaxb-16x9-asset-r1-1-0f22101df1dfc3cb6000-1731666374471.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Microsoft's new 'This is an Xbox' advertising campaign is already a meme.

It was the Direct X box. What it’s grown into now is more accessibility. Xbox isn’t just one device, Xbox is on your smart TV, Xbox is on your PC, Xbox is on your phone, and we’re in the middle of that transition.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to Rolling Stone, Spencer acknowledged that some fans would be turned off by the campaign. Some people “long for the simplicity of a single box, single platform, single game,” he said, before insisting “today’s largest games are bigger than any of the individual platforms.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s a nod to the likes of Fortnite and Roblox, which have become enormous platforms with monthly player counts comparable to the likes of Xbox, PlayStation, and Nintendo consoles. For Spencer, then, the focus is on the games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think the thing that should really have longevity are the games, characters and world — and the platforms should enable us to experience those games where we want to play,” he said. “That’s how we think about Xbox today.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Image credit: Microsoft.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

<p>As spotted by our friends at Digital Foundry, "assault rifles effective ranges have been accidentally nerfed, causing much lower damage at most ranges".</p>
<p>That's not all, either. It seems the Ghost perk - which hides you from UAV and scout pulse - cannot be equipped at all anymore (although it can be duplicated from a class that already has it equipped).</p>

<p>The issue with assault rifles is that the damage you mete out is extremely low as the effective range has seemingly dropped from 40+m to 5.7m and 10.9m - which means you're essentially tickling enemy players to death.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/xbox-hardware-diminishing-returns/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-hardware-will-continue-to-be-made-says-phil-spencer-it%E2%80%99s-hard-to-show-the-benefits-of-new-gaming-hardware-due-to-increasing-diminishing-returns.1036608/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/xbox-hardware-diminishing-returns/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Despite Microsoft's current strategy suggesting otherwise, it seems like Xbox hardware will continue to exist in the future, although it may not be what players have come to expect based on previous console generations.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/xbox-console-future-cloud-ceo-phil-spencer-1235166597/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rolling Stone</a>, Xbox head Phil Spencer commented on future hardware and the console market, highlighting how the console space isn't growing across all systems. "<em>We love those customers,"</em> Phil Spencer added, <em>"but in terms of continuing to expand and grow Xbox, it's about PC, it's about cloud, and it's about making our games more available in more places."</em> Still, Phil Spencer has no doubt that they will release more consoles and more devices in the future, adding that they are trying to expand the concept of what Xbox means and reach success with multiple pieces of hardware, another not-so-veiled hint at the handheld system that has been confirmed to be in the works <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-red-line-porting-games/">this week</a>.</p>
<p>Asked about mid-generation refresh systems like the recent&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-game-boost-falls-short-memory-bandwidth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation 5 Pro</a>, the Xbox head made some interesting comments, implying in his answer not only that a system like that is no longer needed but also that they may approach future hardware in very different ways than before.&nbsp;The company thinks about hardware that can create unique value for the players and the creators on their platform and doesn't need to make a mid-generation console for their own benefit. Nowadays, it has become more difficult to show the benefits of a system like the PS5 Pro because of the diminishing return developers are seeing with increased power and the related difficulty of showing such benefits over previous generation consoles, where the jump in resolution and image quality was way bigger.</p>
<p>On mid-generation refresh consoles, the Xbox head is definitely on point, as it took multiple in-depth analyses to show how the PlayStation 5 Pro improves the vast majority of titles. As machine learning has entered the console space with the PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution, there's no doubt that <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-xbox-next-machine-learning/">AI will play a major role in future console generations</a> that will somehow address the diminishing returns issue that has become evident.</p>

</div><div>



            <p>Thunderful Games, the developers and publishers that make the colourful SteamWorld series of games, have announced a hefty number of layoffs at the company, with anywhere between 80-100 people losing their jobs. It's part of a "restructuring" that'll also see an unspecified number of game projects cancelled, said the company in <a href="https://thunderfulgroup.com/news-room/press-releases/2024-11-14-thunderful-group-implements-strategic-restructuring-program-doubling-down-on-third-party-game-publishing-and-scaling-back-internal-development-resulting-in-write-downs-of-220-240-msek">a press release</a> yesterday. As if this is not dispiriting enough, they also say it's an intentional move that'll see them making fewer games of their own and instead publishing more work by other developers. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>It's a "strategic move towards publishing games from external partners," according to CEO Martin Walfisz, who says he has let 80-100 people go with "great regret". It's not clear from the release which departments were most affected in this recent wave of layoffs, but judging from the language of the announcement I'm guessing many were employed on the development side of things.</p>
<p>"Shifting focus to external publishing will reduce the Group's fixed costs and allow for greater flexibility," they say, "enabling faster, diverse game releases by leveraging external talent and resources in a balanced manner, while still retaining some internal development capacity." </p>
<p>This isn't the first time the company has seen layoffs this year. The first round of job losses came in January and saw <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steamworld-publishers-thunderful-fire-20-off-staff-due-to-over-investments-made-in-the-last-few-years">20 percent of the company's staff laid off</a>. But the company, one of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_video_game_companies_by_revenue">the largest video games businesses in the world by revenue</a>, said this was not enough.</p>
<p>"Whilst significant reductions in cost levels were achieved this year, revenue targets have not been met and the Group is still struggling with negative cash flow."</p>
<p>That negative cash flow refers to the over-investment the company say they've made over the last few years. In May, Thunderful also <a href="https://thunderfulgroup.com/news-room/press-releases/2024-05-21-thunderful-group-ab-publ-to-divest-the-remaining-distribution-businesses-to-become-a-pure-play-games-company">sold off its distribution companies</a> (they basically distributed Nintendo games in Nordic countries) to patch more holes in their leaky finances. </p><p>What this means for the SteamWorld series, I don't know. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/steamworld-heist-2">SteamWorld Heist 2</a> was the latest of the studio's games to come out, and - like all SteamWorld games I've played - it was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steamworld-heist-2-review">thoroughly enjoyable</a>. When the company say they're keeping "some internal development capacity", they may mean they'll focus solely on the steampunky robot world, as regards their own projects. Whereas previously, the various studios now folded into Thunderful Development have made other games like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lost-in-random">Lost In Random</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wavetale">Wavetale</a>, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-gunk">The Gunk</a> (those studios previously being known as Zoink and Image &amp; Form). </p>
<p>Considering the habits of big games companies to take fewer and fewer risks in recent years, it's possible they're jettisoning these non-SteamWorld projects first. But that's just my best guess. I've asked Thunderful to tell us more about which projects have been canned, and will let you know if we find out.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
UK indie-focused game expo WASD has now been officially cancelled, as its organiser enters liquidation. 
</p>
<p>
The news is, sadly, no surprise to the industry or to fans, who had noticed the brand's website go offline earlier this year.
</p>
<p>
"Increasing costs and less demand for stand space means running events is just not viable for us anymore," WASD co-founder David Lilley told <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5yxvxzp909o">BBC News</a> today. "[I want] to take this oppurtunity to thank everyone who has supported us along the way."
</p>
<p>
WASD began life in 2022 as the spiritual successor to EGX Rezzed. It was run by largely the same team behind the scenes - now separate from current EGX owner Reedpop - while the main EGX event continued. (Eurogamer was previously also owned by Reedpop, until its sale this year.)</p><p>
The past few years have been particularly difficult for gaming events, with longer-term issues such as fewer games and the rise of online betas and early access mixing with wider issues such as the video game industry's downturn following a boom period during Covid lockdowns.
</p>
<p>
The past 18 months have been marked by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games-industry-layoffs-not-the-result-of-corporate-greed-and-those-affected-should-drive-an-uber-says-ex-sony-president">countless video games industry layoffs</a>, as corporations seek healthier margins by cutting wage bills.
</p>
<p>
This year's EGX, the UK's only remaining major video games event, notably ran as a mash-up with fellow Reedpop-owned expo MCM Comic-Con, meanwhile.
</p>
<p>There's hope for the video games industry in 2025, with a bumper release schedule that includes the launch of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a>, but all of this feels like it has come too late for some. We're sorry to see you go, WASD.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>As <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/blizzard-is-working-on-an-open-world-shooter.1036452/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spotted</a> by ResetEra's Uzupedro, Blizzard Entertainment is currently hiring personnel for an unannounced open world shooter game. The <a href="https://careers.blizzard.com/global/en/job/R024230/Associate-Design-Director-Innovation-Unannounced-Game" target="_blank" rel="noopener">job</a> is for an Associate Design Director of Innovation.</p>
<p><em>At Blizzard, we craft genre-defining games and legendary worlds for all to share. Through unparalleled creativity and storytelling, we create immersive universes and iconic characters that are beloved across platforms, borders, backgrounds, and generations - only made possible by building a work environment that nurtures the artistry of game development and unleashes the aspirations of our people.</em></p>
<p><em>As the Design Director of Innovation, you will be the vision holder and owner of key strategic innovations on an upcoming open-world shooter game. You stay current with the latest developments in both the indie and AAA space. David Bowie is quoted as saying, “Go a little bit out of your depth. And when you don’t feel that your feet are quite touching the bottom, you’re just about in the right place to do something exciting”–the idea of innovating in the deep end excites you, balanced with a pragmatic desire to turn dreams into reality that players can get their hands on and enjoy. </em><em>This role is anticipated to be a hybrid work position, with some work on-site and some work-from-home. The home studio for this position is Irvine, CA.</em></p>
<p>This isn't the first time Blizzard has attempted the creation of an open world shooter. I'm referring to project Titan, of course. The game should have been an MMO shooter, but after seven years of development, the studio was forced to cancel it. Some of its remnants were turned into Overwatch, which is, however, a session-based game.</p>
<p>More recently, Blizzard canceled another its survival game codenamed Odyssey. Perhaps it would be more accurate to say that Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/four-months-after-the-merger-with-activision-blizzard-microsoft-is-laying-off-1900-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">canceled</a> it, though. Anyway, the game reportedly <a href="https://wccftech.com/odyssey-blizzards-canceled-survival-game-reportedly-had-a-troubled-development/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suffered</a> from a troubled development phase. Let's hope the same thing won't happen with this new open world shooter.</p>

Delayed Obsidian role-playing game Avowed launches for most people on 18th February 2025, but those who pay £89.99 (or $89.99) for the game's Premium Edition can play five days early. 
</p>
<p>
Obsidian <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/11/14/avowed-release-date-pre-order/">detailed</a> the game's Premium Edition options last night and confirmed the game's PC version would launch on both Steam and, surprisingly, Blizzard's Battle.net. 
</p>
<p>
There's likely a good amount of crossover between Blizzard's audience and the folk Obsidian are hoping will pick up its new fantasy RPG and, of course, all of the companies involved are owned by Microsoft - so perhaps we shouldn't be too surprised at the corporate synergy.

<p>
For £90/$90 you'll get a copy of Avowed, five days early access, two premium skin packs and access to Avowed's digital artbook and soundtrack. 
</p>
<p>
That's an extra £20/$20 on top of the base game, which sells for £70/$70. Avowed is also available on day one on Xbox Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass, which will let you play via Battle.net if you link your accounts. 
</p>
<p>
Those cosmetic packs include the Eora Collection Set inspired by characters and locations from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pillars-of-eternity">Pillars of Eternity</a>, and the Obsidian Collection Set, which features black-coloured outfits.
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-collectors-edition-changing-due-to-delay">Ubisoft recently scrubbed its plans for Assassin's Creed Shadows early access</a> upon its own delay. It will now arrive within days of Avowed, on 14th February 2025.</p>
<p>I got to play a snippet of Avowed back in August, and enjoyed my time with it. "It plays like a funny Obsidian role-player where you buddy up with the voice of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a>'s Garrus," I wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/avowed-plays-like-a-funny-obsidian-role-player-where-you-buddy-up-with-the-voice-of-mass-effects-garrus">Eurogamer's Avowed hands-on preview</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in. This is a lie, of course. I haven’t been 'out' of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> autobattler <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mechabellum">Mechabellum</a> since I started playing around the 1.0 launch back <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/strategy-autobattler-mechabellum-has-hit-10-after-over-a-year-in-early-access">in September</a>. There I was, just starting to get to grips with the card-house-careful balance between each of its units when, bam, makers Game River dropped a Jenga block on top of it. It’s a stealth block, too. Didn’t even see it coming.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/669330/view/6904675658203398169">Update 1.1</a>’s new unit is the Phantom Ray, which Game River describe as "a medium-sized aircraft with high HP that excels at striking enemies at close range with high-damage missiles". It’s a mid-tier flier, costing 50 to unlock and 200 to field, and for that you get three of them per unit. As for default tech, you’ve got some range and fire rate unlocks, alongside an oil drop. The headliner here is the stealth buff, which cloaks the Phantom Ray by default until it attacks. When it does, it all gets a nice 40% bonus to damage.</p>

<p>As for how they perform, I’ll have to go ask Graham to give me the rest of the day to test them. For research purposes. And the rest of the patch? I have spent most of my games writing career doing anything I can to avoid the phrase “but that’s not all!”, but since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/please-help-me-mechabellum-is-ruining-my-life">I’ve already shilled</a> Mechabellum so hard as to resemble a frothing gameshow host gesturing at a selection of fabulous prices, I think it’s time.</p><p>But that’s not all! That patch also features various balance adjustments for units such as the Sandworm, Arclight, and my beloved Mustang. The latter is now better at intercepting missiles, and since a row of Mustangs was already pretty adept at making Stormcaller spammers weep, this sounds excellent. Stormcallers themselves now hit a bit harder, but have a longer attack interval. There are also a few bug fixes, notably an issue that would prevent sticky oil outside a shield also igniting sticky oil within a shield. <em>And a brand new tumble dryer! </em></p>
<p>Mechabellum was not on our review slate, but I have been slowly chipping away at a full review during downtime, because I feel it deserves one. If nothing else, it’s very solidly earned a place on my personal GOTY list. I would highly recommend looking into it if you’ve ever been curious about competitive RTS but lack the reflex skills for a more traditional pick. Or the time, honestly: you can get very competent at this one very quickly. Not as good as me though, obviously.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/todd-howard-wondered-if-starfield-should-have-delayed-buggies-for-shattered-space<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Xbox boss Phil Spencer shares one of Howard's key takeaways from the Shattered Space expansion.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Shattered Space hasn't fared terribly well among fans since releasing back in September, sitting at a Mostly Negative rating among fans on Steam. Most of the comments center around the quest's story, though there's plenty of broader criticism for Starfield itself. But Todd Howard seems to have his own theory on why Shattered Space might not have gone down as well as it should have.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an interview with the <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/xbox-phil-spencer-blizzard-avowed-south-of-midnight" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Game File newsletter</a>, Phil Spencer said "we're always learning" when talking about how to approach expansions, and mentioned a conversation he had with Howard about the release cadence for content. Howard focused in on the buggy, which was surprise released during <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gamescom-opening-night-live-2024-everything-announced">Gamescom Opening Night Live</a> ahead of the expansion.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Todd and I were talking about Shattered Space. Starfield is a game I put a ton of hours into and really love, but they've had this thing where they've added features throughout the year and then they had an expansion," Spencer said. “I think some of the feedback on the expansion is: ‘We wanted more features.’ And he's like, ‘Well, should we have waited to put buggies out?'"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He continued, "And so, I think you're trying to tune both development effort and the impact of the expansion. And I think there will always be a balance to managing the game month to month. But not every game will do expansions.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ultimately, though, Shattered Space was criticized more for its lack of space content than its lack of ground content. We wrote in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/starfield-shattered-space-review">review</a>, "As far as I can tell there’s absolutely nothing added for spacefarers other than now you have a way to legitimately acquire Va’ruun ships instead of stealing them from Zealots who attack you in space. That’s fine, as an expansion doesn’t always have to meaningfully expand every aspect of a game – but I was surprised that there wasn’t at least a token feature thrown in for space jockeys in an expansion with 'space' in the title."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Spencer, he shares various other thoughts about Xbox's game lineup in the interview, including some of the biggest surprises (Blizzard and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/south-of-midnight">South of Midnight</a> among them) and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/avowed-we-finally-played-obsidians-first-person-rpg-and-its-fantastic">Avowed's release timing</a>. Xbox also launched a new marketing campaign today called "This is Xbox," which highlighted various items that may or may not be an Xbox.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Kat Bailey is IGN's News Director as well as co-host of Nintendo Voice Chat.

Leading up to the big event, retailers will begin to open deals online. This usually <strong>starts in the last week of October</strong>, just before Halloween. Each week leading up to the event will slowly roll out more deals, which ultimately leads to massive discounts on Black Friday. Retailers will not reveal their biggest Black Friday deals until the big day, but most general deals will be available well in advance.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.

<p>According to a report by <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/11/sophie-turner-lara-croft-tomb-raider-phoebe-waller-bridge-amazon-1236173978/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Deadline</a>, Amazon’s Tomb Raider series could potentially cast Game of Thrones star Sophie Turner as Lara Croft.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The report states that the parties are negotiating to get Sophie Turner to play Lara Croft in Amazon’s upcoming Tomb Raider series. Their <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/10/tomb-raider-sophie-turner-lucy-boynton-lara-croft-1236161243/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">report</a> from last month stated that Turner was auditioning for the part along with Bohemian Rhapsody’s Lucy Boynton. Sophie Turner is currently working on two shows, Joan and Haven.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fleabag’s Phoebe Waller-Bridge is the writer and executive producer for Amazon’s Tomb Raider series. During the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tomb-raider-live-action-show-coming-amazon-prime-video/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announcement</a>, Waller-Bridge expressed her love for the franchise and how honoured she feels to be a part of the series. She stated, “I can’t wait to go on this adventure. Bats ‘n all.” Jennifer Salke, head of Amazon MGM Studios, also called the upcoming series “epic” and “globetrotting” during the reveal.</p>



<p>The series does not have a release window at the moment, and no plot details have been revealed. If the reports are accurate, securing Lara Craft for the upcoming live-action Tomb Raider series will be the first significant development for the show. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/most-wishlisted-upcoming-steam-games-november/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>My wife enjoys laughing at me because I spend time daily going through the most wishlisted upcoming Steam games on the digital storefront in search of anything new I might have missed. Something is launching daily, and new game announcements occur weekly, so it’s not outside the realm of possibility that my nearly 1,000-strong wishlist is missing something. I’m sure I’m not alone, which is why I’m sharing with you the ten most wishlisted upcoming games on the platform for November!</p>



<h2 id="h-top-wishlists-on-steam-for-november">Top Wishlists on Steam for November</h2>



<p>For the most part, the top ten <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/search/?filter=popularwishlist" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">wishlists on Steam</a> don’t change too frequently. Many of these games, like Monster Hunter, Deadlock, and Hollow Knight, remain in the top ten month after month. They likely will until launch. But it’s nice seeing titles like Delta Force, Arena Breakout, and the upcoming STALKER 2 make an appearance!</p>



<ol>
<li><strong>Monster Hunter Wilds</strong></li>



<li><strong>Deadlock</strong></li>



<li><strong>Hollow Knight: Silksong</strong></li>



<li><strong>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl</strong></li>



<li><strong>Delta Force</strong></li>



<li><strong>Marvel Rivals</strong></li>



<li><strong>Sid Meier’s Civilization VII</strong></li>



<li><strong>ARK 2</strong></li>



<li><strong>Light No Fire</strong></li>



<li><strong>Arena Breakout: Infinite</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>Just narrowly missing the top ten list are <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/everything-we-know-about-path-of-exile-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Path of Exile 2</a>, inZOI, and Unrecord. I imagine Path of Exile 2 will push into the top ten slot this month, following the developer’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-does-path-of-exile-2-early-access-start/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">upcoming livestream showcasing the launch-day build, classes, and end-game content</a>!</p>







<h2 id="h-upcoming-game-releases-in-november-worth-keeping-an-eye-on">Upcoming Game Releases in November Worth Keeping An Eye On</h2>



<p>Of course, just because something isn’t on the top wishlists on Steam doesn’t mean it’s not worth your time. November is chock full of hot releases, such as:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>LEGO Horizon Adventures</strong></li>



<li><strong>Metro Awakening</strong></li>



<li><strong>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl</strong></li>



<li><strong>Mario &amp; Luigi Brothership</strong></li>



<li><strong>Funko Fusion</strong></li>



<li><strong>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</strong></li>



<li><strong>Star Wars Outlaws (Steam)</strong></li>



<li><strong>Genshin Impact (Xbox Series X|S)</strong></li>



<li><strong>Towers of Aghasba</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Who could forget the recently released Farming Simulator 25? It launches with a few day-one issues that require a patch promptly from Giants, but it’s still a fun, relaxing experience!</p>



<p>What November release are you most looking forward to? Let us know in the comments below, or <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">visit the community forum</a> to discuss hot new releases with others!</p>

                <p dir="ltr">The dream of having an arcade inside your home is considerably more realistic these days thanks to the proliferation of consumer-grade cabinets, led by Arcade1Up. But unless you have a plethora of open space and the disposable cash to buy a bunch of cabinets, bringing the arcade home means maybe one or two machines. And unlike arcades, you're usually locked into a specific lineup of games; you can't take your quarters elsewhere when you have the urge to switch things up. Multiple cabinet manufacturers have tried to solve the space and boredom concerns by becoming arcade platforms. It hasn't really worked yet, but that could change with the arrival of one of the best pieces of gaming hardware in years: the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D5HQZ16W?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Evercade Alpha Bartop Arcade</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Officially licensed by Capcom and created by Blaze Entertainment, the Alpha offers an authentic arcade experience with full-size controls in a compact form factor for $250--a $20 discount is available if you complete your purchase before the Alpha's November 28 release. Two models, each with six preloaded games, will be available at launch: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D5HQZ16W?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Mega Man: The Power Battle</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D5HQQ34B?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Street Fighter II: Champion Edition</a>. But what makes these superbly realized bartop cabinets so exciting is support for the 535 (and counting) games in the Evercade library.</p><hr><p dir="ltr">For those unfamiliar with the brand, Evercade is a line of cartridge-based hardware that debuted as a handheld in 2020. Today, there are multiple iterations of the handheld as well as a home console. All Evercade devices share the same game library, which means the Alpha is launching with a massive catalog of over 60 cartridge collections featuring arcade, home console, and handheld classics.</p><p>We'll dive more into the overarching Evercade platform later in this review, as it's important to understand not just what's in the box, but the wide-ranging hardware and software options available to purchase separately. While the Alpha will inevitably elicit comparisons to Arcade1Up, including from me, it's more comparable to traditional consoles like the Switch and PS5. Sure, the Alpha is themed around Street Fighter/Mega Man--and some people will get it purely for those franchises--but it's not a countertop version of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/ARCADE1UP-Capcom-Fighter-Champion-Machine/dp/B0B94VCWG3?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Arcade1Up's Street Fighter II: Champion Edition standing cabinet</a>; the Alpha is a home arcade <em>platform</em> that happens to come with a half-dozen games to get you started.</p><table data-max-width="true"><thead><tr><th scope="col">Mega Man Edition Game List:</th><th scope="col">Street Fighter Edition Game List:</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Mega Man: The Power Battle</td><td>Street Fighter 2: Champion Edition</td></tr><tr><td>Mega Man 2: The Power Fighters</td><td>Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo</td></tr><tr><td>Strider</td><td>Street Fighter Alpha: Warriors' Dreams</td></tr><tr><td>Final Fight</td><td>Street Fighter Alpha 2</td></tr><tr><td>Knights</td><td>Street Fighter Alpha 3</td></tr><tr><td>Carrier Air Wing</td><td>Super Puzzle Fighter 2 Turbo</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 dir="ltr">Build quality: The alpha of compact arcade machines</h2><p dir="ltr">Evercade hardware has always punched above its price, but the Alpha's sturdy build quality, presentation, and overall feel still surprised me. Four rubber feet keep it firmly in place on solid surfaces, and at just 13 pounds, I comfortably played for hours on the couch with the cabinet on my lap. If you're familiar with Arcade1Up's countercades, the Alpha has a similar size profile. It's 16.1 inches tall (410mm), 9.6 inches wide (244mm), and 12.4 inches deep.</p><p dir="ltr">Despite its relatively small form factor, the Alpha is an eye-catching piece of tech. I tested the Mega Man edition, while my colleague Tamoor Hussain checked out the Street Fighter model. Both models feature artwork inspired by their original full-size counterparts. For Street Fighter II: Champion Edition, that means the granite-like pattern on the front, character panels along the bezel, and the logo on each side. And while it maintains the minimalist aesthetic, the new solid blue finish complements the speckled gray control deck nicely. The Mega Man cabinet has a more colorful and playful look, with a character collage matching the cover art for Rockman Power Battle Fighters for PS2 set against a space-themed background. The control deck and bezel are brushed with a streaky mix of blue and white. Taking cues from the Street Fighter model, you'll also find lovely little character panels flanking the screen.</p><p dir="ltr">Each model has a light-up marquee featuring the same artwork from the original release. The panel covering the art is so well integrated into the build that I wouldn't have thought the artwork could be replaced if no one told me. This added bit of customization is a nice touch, but sadly three-packs of official marquee art are sold out at <a href="https://funstock.co.uk/products/evercade-street-fighter-arcade-marquees-pack?variant=41543149125721" rel="nofollow ">Funstock</a>.

But that's not the case here, and it starts with the really impressive eight-inch HD IPS display. The 4:3 aspect ratio is ideal for many retro arcade titles and the vast majority of classic console and handheld games. The IPS technology is integral here, as it helps this small screen provide superb color accuracy, consistently smooth performance, and wide viewing angles. Evercade's handhelds have always had better screens than you might expect for the price, and the Alpha continues this trend. The picture is considerably more vibrant and rich than the Arcade1Up countercades I've used.</p><p dir="ltr">The cabinet comes pre-assembled and carefully cradled by form-fitting foam inserts to protect the wood. Protective film needs to be removed from the screen and marquee before playing for the first time. If your experience is anything like ours, the "pull here" tabs might instantly rip, and you need to be careful near the edges, corners, and screws. I had to loosen the screws to safely remove some of the film. While somewhat of an annoying introduction to the Alpha, the end result is all that really matters. Once I removed all of the film, the screen, just like the rest of the build, was in pristine condition. This should be the expectation with a piece of new tech like this, but I have purchased multiple arcade cabinets with protective film that were already scratched upon arrival.</p><p dir="ltr">Even more impressive than the beautiful display is the premium control deck. Both machines have identical layouts, just with different button colors and labels. Blaze smartly opted for the bat-top stick, which allows you to use a more relaxed grip than ball-top sticks. From a technical perspective, marketing the Alpha with "competition-grade arcade controls" doesn't really mean much. What's strange is the <a href="https://funstock.co.uk/products/evercade-alpha-street-fighter-deluxe-edition-bartop-arcade" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Funstock-exclusive Deluxe Edition</a> has high-end Sanwa controls, so these regular versions are supposed to be a step down. But if I didn't know that beforehand, I would've guessed these were made by Sanwa. The stick and buttons feel better than any other home arcade cabinets I own. It's not uncommon for a budget-priced arcade cabinet or even a fight stick to have a "loose" joystick. Not only does that make it feel cheaply made, but that looseness can cause inaccurate inputs. The Alpha's stick is fast and tight, with a satisfying click marking each input. I haven't had any issues with false diagonals or latency. I'd be curious to compare it to the Deluxe version with Sanwa components, because the "competition-grade arcade controls" are better than what's found on the cabinets in retail stores.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4400003-4396954-evercadecontrols.png" data-ref-id="1300-4400003" data-ratio="0.444" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4400003-4396954-evercadecontrols.png" data-ref-id="1300-4400003"></a><figcaption>Mega Man | Street Fighter</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4400003-4396954-evercadecontrols.png"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4400004-img_7324.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4400005-img_7325.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4400006-img_7326.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4400004,1300-4400005,1300-4400006" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4400004-img_7324.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4400005-img_7325.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4400006-img_7326.jpeg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4400004-img_7324.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4400005-img_7325.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4400006-img_7326.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The Alpha has six convex face buttons split into two rows of three. Fast and clicky without being too loud or loose, the buttons have the same premium-but-not-Sanwa quality to them as the stick. Above the face buttons are three smaller buttons: start, select or insert coin, and menu. One really interesting design choice is the slightly textured, matte finish on the control deck. Most home arcade cabinets have a glossy, laminate-type finish, but the Alpha's control deck surface provides a bit of additional grip and stability I didn't even know I wanted until I tried it.</p><p dir="ltr">For context on these comparisons, I have multiple Arcade1Up standing cabinets, an Arcade1Up countercade, the iiRcade (discontinued), AtGames Legends Ultimate, and two Quarter Arcades (with <em>very </em>tiny controls).</p><table data-max-width="true"><thead><tr><th scope="col">Specifications</th><th scope="col">Evercade Alpha Bartop Arcade</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Included Games:</td><td>6 built-in Capcom arcade games</td></tr><tr><td>Add-on Games</td><td>Dual cartridge slots for 60+ cartridges / 500+ games</td></tr><tr><td>Display:</td><td>8-inch HD IPS with 4:3 aspect ratio</td></tr><tr><td>Controls:</td><td>Bat-top arcade stick and 8 buttons</td></tr><tr><td>Multiplayer:</td><td>Supports two players with USB controllers</td></tr><tr><td>Processor:</td><td>RK3326 1.5GHz</td></tr><tr><td>Memory:</td><td>512MB DRAM</td></tr><tr><td>Sound:</td><td>Dual Stereo Speakers / 3.5mm headphones</td></tr><tr><td>Ports:</td><td>USB-A (x2) for controllers, USB-C AC adapter</td></tr><tr><td>Wi-Fi:</td><td>Firmware updates only</td></tr><tr><td>Dimensions:</td><td>16.5 x 9.6 x 12.4 inches</td></tr><tr><td>Weight:</td><td>~13 pounds</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 dir="ltr">Third-party controller support adds versatility</h2><p dir="ltr">Because multiplayer is such an integral part of the arcade experience, most full-size cabinets have at least two sets of controls. Arcade1Up has included multiple sets of controls on a few of its countercades, including <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Arcade-1Up-Arcade1Up-NBA-Player-Countercade/dp/B09B1D6P1H?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="nofollow ">NBA Jam</a>, but it's a cramped experience. Even standing home arcade cabinets can feel like a squeeze for multiplayer on the same control deck.</p><p dir="ltr">The Alpha takes a different, more versatile approach to multiplayer. Two USB ports flank the volume rocker, right below the cartridge slots. Though it's still listed as in beta, USB controllers can be enabled and fully remapped to your liking in the settings. In addition to Evercade-branded controllers, a wide variety of third-party controllers are compatible via a wired connection, including DualSense, DualShock 4, official Xbox controllers (Series X|S, Xbox One, and 360), Microsoft's Adaptive Controller, and many, many 8BitDo controllers. With certain Bluetooth receivers, you can establish a wireless connection.</p><p dir="ltr">I'd highly recommend grabbing <a href="https://www.amazon.com/8Bitdo-Wireless-Compatible-Controller-Bluetooth/dp/B09M8CVMYF?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">8BitDo's Wireless USB Adapter for $20.</a> This versatile little dongle works for numerous platforms, letting you sync Bluetooth controllers to normally unsupported devices.

As for even cheaper, wired options, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Switch-Fighting-Stick-Officially-Licensed-Nintendo/dp/B01AJSAAV6?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Hori's $50 Fighting Stick Mini</a> worked well for me.

Two people can't sit directly in front of an eight-inch screen, and without IPS technology, the picture wouldn't be as crisp when looking at it from an angle. Including two USB ports was a good move. When I played multiplayer with my kids, whoever was using the onboard controls sometimes blocked the bottom of the screen. That problem was solved when we switched to USB fighting sticks and controllers.</p><p dir="ltr">Controller support is a huge boon for the Alpha beyond multiplayer, too. The Evercade library has hundreds of console and handheld games, and while many of them play great with stick controls, the option to use the Alpha as a miniature home console with a built-in display is an awesome perk.</p><h2 dir="ltr">User-friendly interface</h2><p dir="ltr">Speaking of miniature consoles, the Alpha's menu systems and user interface are just as clean and straightforward as the mini consoles from Sega and Nintendo. All Evercade devices run on the same operating system with largely identical navigation systems, so if you already own an Evercade device, almost all of this will sound familiar.</p><p dir="ltr">From the moment you press the power button--which glows red and charmingly resembles the coin-return button on an arcade cabinet--it takes just under 40 seconds to fully boot. The home screen is a vertical carousel of the six preloaded games, represented by cover art and a screenshot, against a custom background themed around Mega Man or Street Fighter. You can switch the background to one of six other themes: dark, light, blue and gold, neon, radon, and neo (black with checkered boxes). Clicking on a game opens a menu with a blurb and pertinent details such as how many players it supports and the default controls (which you can remap). Each game can be loaded from scratch, or, if you've played it before and created a save state, you can load directly to that spot. It's a handy feature that exemplifies Evercade's pick-up-and-play mentality.</p><p dir="ltr">Cartridge games populate in a separate menu. If you insert a cartridge containing 12 games, 12 individual tiles will appear within a few seconds. Games can be sorted in alphabetical order or by release year, and when two cartridges are loaded, you can choose to separate the tiles or let them mingle as one big group. Below the cartridge menu you'll find Evercade's Game of the Month, which you can download and play for free with each monthly update. Firmware updates and occasional cartridge patches are the only features that utilize Wi-Fi; Evercade devices do not have online multiplayer or leaderboards. The Game of the Month is directly above a collection of nine hidden games. These are unlocked through various methods such as entering secret codes and inputting specific button combinations.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4400007-img_7334.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4400007" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4400007-img_7334.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4400007"></a><figcaption>Namco Museum Collection </figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4400007-img_7334.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Evercade was born from a place of love for playing and preserving physical media, and its library system is something I'd really like to see adopted by other hardware manufacturers. The library logs how many cartridges and the total number of games you own, not including preloaded, as well as upcoming releases.</p><p dir="ltr">By default, the Alpha displays games in their original aspect ratios, which fills the screen on the preloaded games. If you buy cartridges featuring games in genres such as vertically scrolling shooters with 3:4 aspect ratios, black borders will cover part of the screen. Alternate borders such as the game's cover art can replace the black bars. You can alter the display mode to Pixel Perfect to spruce up dull or muddied pixels. Some people like this, others, like me, don't really care for it. You can also force full-screen mode if you don't mind stretched pixels. If you love scanlines, you can add subtle or strong lines to mimic a CRT TV.</p><p dir="ltr">Sound customization is limited to master volume in games, but you can adjust BGM and SFX for the home screen. For such a small cabinet, the Alpha's stereo speakers are plenty loud enough--too loud, if you turn it all the way up. Speakers are typically located on the front of arcade machines, but the Alpha's speakers are on the sides. This could have become a design flaw, but the speakers efficiently disperse crisp, clear audio. The only downside to speaker location is that you won't want to place the cabinet directly next to anything that could muffle the sound. As usual, headphones can provide an even better audio experience. Sadly, the Alpha doesn't have Bluetooth, so you'll need to plug headphones into the 3.5mm jack below the left cartridge slot.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Built-in Capcom Games</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4399977-evercade_alpha_1.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4399977" data-ratio="0.76772082878953" data-width="917" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4399977-evercade_alpha_1.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4399977"></a><figcaption>Evercade Alpha - Mega Man: The Power Battle</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4399977-evercade_alpha_1.jpeg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4399978-evercade_alpha_4.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4399979-evercade_alpha_5.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4399980-evercade_alpha_7.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4399978,1300-4399979,1300-4399980" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4399978-evercade_alpha_4.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4399979-evercade_alpha_5.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4399980-evercade_alpha_7.jpeg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4399978-evercade_alpha_4.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4399979-evercade_alpha_5.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4399980-evercade_alpha_7.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Though the Alpha isn't the first Evercade device with preloaded games, the overt Capcom themes will probably make it hard for some to <em>not </em>see these as Street Fighter and Mega Man cabinets. Ironically, these have fewer Capcom games combined compared to the Evercade EXP, which came with 18 preloaded games and a plain white design. But arcade cabinets typically aren't viewed as platforms, and unless you've used a Neo Geo MVS, you've probably never played an arcade machine that takes cartridges. So, yeah, we're in largely uncharted waters here, but the Evercade Alpha is akin to a themed special-edition console. Some people buy those because they are splashed with art celebrating their favorite game franchise, but most want access to the platform.</p><p dir="ltr">As a longtime Evercade user with dozens of cartridges, the six preloaded games were merely a bonus. Those who are new to the platform may view the preloaded games as the deciding factor.</p><p dir="ltr">I think tying a purchasing decision to the built-in games would be a mistake, but let's say that's you: If the cartridge slots were removed from the Alpha, I'd probably only recommend this machine to <em>big </em>Mega Man fans. Emphasis on big because Mega Man: The Power Battle and Mega Man 2: The Power Fighters--the only two entries in the series developed for Capcom's CP System arcade boards--are fun but ultimately forgettable experiences that are about as niche as it gets for a major franchise like Mega Man. These are truncated boss-rush games that play similarly to the mainline series, just without the platforming stages leading into the bosses. One cool thing is that they support co-op, which I had more fun with than solo runs.</p><p dir="ltr">Since there are only two Mega Man arcade games, the rest of the list is occupied by a random assortment of Capcom games. The best games on the Mega Man edition are Final Fight and Strider, both of which were originally released in 1989 for the then-nascent CP System. Final Fight is a classic beat-'em-up that still holds up well today, while Strider is one of the pioneers of the hack-and-slash genre. Both games were ported to practically every home console under the sun in the years following their release, but these are the originals.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4396955-evercadealphagamelists.png" data-ref-id="1300-4396955" data-ratio="0.5" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4396955-evercadealphagamelists.png" data-ref-id="1300-4396955"></a><figcaption>Each Alpha comes with six built-in games</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4396955-evercadealphagamelists.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Only including Capcom's arcade games makes sense thematically, but it also means some of the games feel like stripped-down versions of home-console games from the same era. Mega Man: The Power Battle is a prime example of this, as I was left wanting to play a full side-scrolling stage rather than just boss battles that typically end each stage.</p><p dir="ltr">While I didn't personally test the Street Fighter cabinet, my colleague Tamoor Hussain expressed a similar sentiment: Playing the arcade versions with fewer features and modes made him want to play the complete experience.</p><p dir="ltr">If you were to buy one of these cabinets purely to play the included games, the Street Fighter edition is probably the better choice. It features a cohesive selection of Street Fighter games and Super Puzzle Fighter 2 Turbo, a stellar tile-matching game similar to Puyo Puyo. Plus, there's a reason why Street Fighter 2 has been the focal point of numerous home arcade cabinets. No offense to the Blue Bomber, but the same can't be said for Mega Man: The Power Battle. But the novelty of its existence might be precisely why longtime Mega Man fans pick it up.</p><p dir="ltr">All of the built-in games look and play great--the emulation is really solid--so if you love these classic Capcom arcade games, the Alpha offers an authentic arcade experience in a compact form factor. And maybe that's all you want out of this. Surely there's someone out there whose favorite Mega Man games are the lone two arcade releases from nearly 30 years ago. And if that's you, this is your moment.</p><p dir="ltr">With that said, if you own an Evercade device and only play preloaded games, you are missing out on <em>a lot</em>.</p><h2 dir="ltr">The bottom line: Evercade Alpha hardware</h2><p dir="ltr">From a hardware standpoint, the Evercade Alpha is exceedingly impressive. The control stick is the best not-Sanwa stick I've used, the buttons feel great, and the eight-inch HD IPS display offers a vibrant picture with wide enough viewing angles to make playing multiplayer games a pleasant experience for both players. Robust third-party controller support not only makes multiplayer possible, but also effectively turns the Alpha into a compact game console with a built-in display and a user-friendly OS reminiscent of Nintendo and Sega mini consoles. The Alpha takes up about as much surface space as a modern game console, but it's still an eye-catching device with a premium finish that's complemented by vibrant artwork, a customizable light-up marquee, and charming flourishes like the coin-return-inspired power button.</p><p dir="ltr">The Evercade Alpha carries a $250 MSRP, but an early-bird discount of $20 is available for those who preorder either model ahead of the Alpha's November 28 release. For comparison, it costs $100 more than the most recent Arcade1Up countercades with three preloaded games. The Alpha has six preloaded games and supports over 500 overall. Beyond the superb build quality, expandability is the Alpha's biggest strength. It also means $250 is the <em>starting </em>cost--unless you really do just want a compact arcade machine for a handful of Capcom classics.</p><p dir="ltr">The Evercade Alpha is the best bartop arcade machine I've used by a wide margin. Thanks to the evolving cartridge-based library, it's quickly become one of my favorite gaming devices, period, which isn't something I could say for other home arcade cabinets.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4400008-img_7329.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4400008" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4400008-img_7329.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4400008"></a><figcaption>Evercade Alpha logo during boot process</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4400008-img_7329.jpeg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr">The Evercade library</h2><p dir="ltr">Each Evercade cartridge retails for $20-$25. The number of games on each cart varies; some have over a dozen, while others only have a few. Based on current totals, the average is eight. All cartridges come in chunky, retro-style boxes with instruction booklets. The library is split into three series, each of which has its own case color: console/handheld carts are red, arcade carts are purple, and home-computer carts are blue. Initially, the catalog consisted mainly of publisher-themed carts such as <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Evercade-Atari-Cartridge-1-Electronic-Games/dp/B07XDB9FZT?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Atari</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Evercade-Namco-Cartridge-Electronic-sega-genesis/dp/B07XH9CHRR?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Namco Museum</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Evercade-Dataeast-Cartridge-Collection-Electronic-Games/dp/B07XDBBZ87?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Data East</a>, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Evercade-Interplay-Cartridge-Collection-Electronic-Games/dp/B07XC7BYFF?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Interplay</a>. Before long, we saw modern retro games such as the combo pack featuring the 2019 shooter Xeno Crisis and 2018 puzzle-platformer Tanglewood, both of which were developed for Sega Genesis. The contemporary throwbacks have become a compelling fixture. Last year, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Evercade-Goodboy-Galaxy-Witch-Atari-2600/dp/B0CHS8BXXK?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">brand-new GBA game Goodboy Galaxy</a> and popular NES puzzle-platformer Witch N' Wiz released as another combo pack.</p><p dir="ltr">Evercade even managed to secure exclusive remasters of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Evercade-Duke-Nukem-1-Atari-2600/dp/B0CHJL7X61?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">first two Duke Nukem games</a>, and they are pretty darn good. A second collection of Duke Nukem games moved Evercade into the world of 32-bit games for the first time. Just in the past few months, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blaze-Evercade-Raider-Collection-Atari-2600/dp/B0D1KWC8QD?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Tomb Raider Collection</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blaze-Evercade-Legacy-Collection-Sega-Dreamcast/dp/B0DDY9BHJ5?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Legacy of Kain PS1 duology</a> added to the burgeoning subset of 32-bit games. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blaze-Evercade-Piko-Collection-Atari-2600/dp/B0CTKZNC4Z?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Piko Interactive Collection 4</a> announced the arrival of 64-bit games with the Nintendo 64 platformer Glover, which was rebuilt from the ground up for Evercade.</p><p dir="ltr">On the arcade side, the library is filled with classics from Irem, Gaelco, Jaleco, Data East, Toaplan, Atari, and Piko Interactive. I tried both of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blaze-Evercade-Arcade-Collection-Sega-Dreamcast/dp/B0DH88R8Y9?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">new Data East</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Evercade-Toaplan-Arcade-Collection-Sega-Dreamcast/dp/B0DH8CFHBQ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Toaplan carts</a> that are releasing alongside the Alpha. Like previous Toaplan carts, if you like retro shooters, it doesn't disappoint. The vertically scrolling shmups Truxton II and Vimana are awesome. I've also enjoyed my time with the vertically scrolling run-and-gun games Out Zone and its spiritual successor FixEight. I had never played these games, which to me is part of the joy of Evercade carts. You may be drawn in by one specific game you have fond memories playing, but then you get to explore other games from the same developer for the first time.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4396962-evercadetoaplan.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4396962" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4396962-evercadetoaplan.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4396962"></a><figcaption>Toaplan Arcade 3 and Data East Arcade 2 release alongside the Evercade Alpha</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4396962-evercadetoaplan.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>Evercade Arcade Series Cartridge Collections:</strong></p><ul><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blaze-Evercade-Data-East-Arcade-Cartridge/dp/B094K946B3?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Data East Arcade 1</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blaze-Evercade-Arcade-Collection-Sega-Dreamcast/dp/B0DH88R8Y9?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Data East Arcade 2</a> | Releases Nov. 28</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blaze-Evercade-IREM-Arcade-Collection-Dreamcast/dp/B0BDBKYFZK?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IREM Arcade 1</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blaze-Evercade-Gaelco-Arcade-Cartridge-Nintendo/dp/B094KD3YQS?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Gaelco Arcade 1</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B2R1DMYK?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Gaelco Arcade 2</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Evercade-Piko-Arcade-Collection-Atari-2600/dp/B0C5XZ19TQ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Piko Interactive Arcade 1</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Evercade-Jaleco-Arcade-Cartridge-Sega-Genesis/dp/B09Z3C9G8M?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Jaleco Arcade 1</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blaze-Evercade-Toaplan-Cartridge-1-Dreamcast/dp/B0BDB8LXKC?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Toaplan Arcade 1</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Evercade-Toaplan-Arcade-Cartridge-Atari-7800/dp/B0BT55CGSK?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Toaplan Arcade 2</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Evercade-Toaplan-Arcade-Collection-Sega-Dreamcast/dp/B0DH8CFHBQ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Toaplan Arcade 3</a> | Releases Nov. 28</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Evercade-Toaplan-Arcade-Collection-Sega-Dreamcast/dp/B0DK7FR423?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Toaplan Arcade 4</a> | Releases Dec. 12</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blaze-Evercade-Atari-Arcade-Cartridge-Nintendo/dp/B094KFSKV1?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Atari Arcade 1 (Discontinued)</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blaze-Evercade-Technos-Arcade-Cartridge-Nintendo/dp/B094KCJC2M?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Technos Arcade 1 (Discontinued)</a></li></ul><hr><p dir="ltr">A decent chunk of Evercade games aren't available on other contemporary devices. That's part of the charm: the revival of games that have largely been lost to history. Of course, with 500-plus games in the catalog, there are some real clunkers, but out of the 40-plus carts I've tried, I've yet to encounter a compilation I didn't enjoy or appreciate for one reason or another.</p><p dir="ltr">At this time, the Evercade library is heavily weighted toward console, handheld, and modern retro games. The arcade series will eclipse 100 games with the release of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Evercade-Toaplan-Arcade-Collection-Sega-Dreamcast/dp/B0DK7FR423?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">fourth Toaplan compilation</a>, and 13th arcade cart overall, next month. For comparison, the console series will have 42 carts next month, with the latest double pack featuring modern <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blaze-Evercade-Dragon-Collection-Sega-Dreamcast/dp/B0DK7DZQJS?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Genesis games Life on Mars and Metal Dragon</a>. These figures are somewhat deceiving, as some of the console series carts include games predominantly thought of as arcade games. For instance, the two Namco Museum collections that were part of the original Evercade's launch lineup in 2020 contain some of the most iconic arcade games of all time: Galaga, Galaxian, Pac-Man, Dig Dug, and many others. Technically, these are the NES versions, but they are virtually identical to the original arcade releases.</p><p dir="ltr">Some classics from the console series may seem more natural with a conventional controller, but I tried a bunch of games never intended for arcades that play great with the Alpha's stick, including classic platformers like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Evercade-Sunsoft-Collection-1-Atari-2600/dp/B0CC23VXVZ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Mr. Gimmick, Aero the Acro-Bat</a>, and Earthworm Jim, as well as impressive modern indies like the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Evercade-Full-Void-Atari-2600/dp/B0CCRYRVRJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">cinematic platformer Full Void</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blaze-Evercade-Cathedral-Cartridge-Atari-7800/dp/B0B74S3D4W?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">metroidvania Alwa's Awakening</a>. Did I ever expect to play <em>and </em>reach the credits of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Evercade-Duke-Nukem-2-Atari-2600/dp/B0CHJLTGVR?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Duke Nukem Advance</a>, an actual FPS for GBA, on an arcade machine? No, and neither did you, but it held up better than I expected.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Evercade is one big platform</h2><p dir="ltr">The Evercade Alpha benefits immensely from the large library of existing cartridges released over the last four years for other hardware. All Evercade devices share the same library of games and run on the same easy-to-use operating system. If you like the Evercade Alpha but also want to play your carts on a travel-friendly handheld device or on your TV, multiple handhelds and a home console are available. Other Evercade hardware costs substantially less than the Alpha, so if you like the idea of cartridge-based retro gaming, but want a more budget-friendly introduction to the platform, you have multiple options.</p><p dir="ltr">Likely anticipating increased interest in the other Evercade hardware after the Alpha's launch, Blaze released the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Evercade-Gaming-Handheld-Console-Atari-2600/dp/B0D1VYPWLH?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="nofollow ">Evercade VS-R home console</a> in August, and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Evercade-Gaming-Handheld-Console-Atari-2600/dp/B0D1VZQ2VL?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="nofollow ">Evercade EXP-R handheld</a> releases November 29--one day after the Alpha. Both devices are refreshes of older hardware, now in black instead of white, and cost $100 each. As an added bonus, they come bundled with Tomb Raider Collection, which is $25 on its own.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4396961-0004_evercade_exp-r.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4396961" data-ratio="0.5453125" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4396961-0004_evercade_exp-r.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4396961"></a><figcaption>Evercade EXP-R</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4396961-0004_evercade_exp-r.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The Evercade VS home console is otherwise identical to the original white model released in 2021. The VS has been hard to find in the US for well over a year at this point. Like the Alpha, it has two cartridge slots. It connects to your TV or monitor via HDMI and displays in 1080p. While it only comes with one wired controller, just like the Alpha, you can connect third-party wired controllers and Bluetooth controllers with the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/8Bitdo-Wireless-Compatible-Controller-Bluetooth/dp/B09M8CVMYF?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="nofollow ">8BitDo Wireless USB Adapter</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">The original EXP retailed for $150 at launch, so the price has dropped $50 with the EXP-R. The change takes two notable omissions into account: The mini-HDMI port has been removed, so the EXP-R won't have the ability to play in 720p on a monitor or TV. The aforementioned 18 Capcom freebies found on the EXP are also gone. The EXP-R does, however, sport a new textured grip that could improve the already impressive ergonomics of the EXP. The Tomb Raider Collection is also probably more appealing than the IREM Arcade Collection that was included with the EXP.</p><p dir="ltr">I haven't tested the EXP-R, but the EXP is a lovely portable device with a sublime D-pad and spacious 4.3-inch IPS display with 800 x 480 resolution. It's also one of the best handhelds I've used for arcade games thanks to TATE mode: an optional play style where you turn the device on its side for games with vertically oriented aspect ratios, just as originally intended. To improve the ergonomics of this play style, Evercade is releasing the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blaze-Evercade-official-TATE-EXP-R-Dreamcast/dp/B0D2LP3CS2?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="nofollow ">TATE Grip</a> alongside the EXP-R.</p><hr><p dir="ltr">Blaze also has a spin-off brand called HyperMegaTech for its Super Pocket series of handhelds that debuted last year with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CB6DTMYL?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Capcom</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CB6DG8R2?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Taito Editions</a>. These $60 handhelds with Game Boy Pocket-esque form factors still support Evercade carts, but they also include preloaded software: 12 Capcom or 17 Taito games. The Super Pocket line expanded last month with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DBLMM94B?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Atari (50 games)</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DBLPWDLW?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Technos models (15 games)</a>. These legitimately pocketable handhelds have 2.8-inch IPS displays and more colorful themes. The D-pad and buttons are stiffer than the EXP, and the build is more toy-like and plasticky, but they offer tremendous value for the price--even if you do only buy them for the preloaded games.</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Super Pockets - $60 each  <ul><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CB6DTMYL?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Capcom - 12 built-in games</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CB6DG8R2?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Taito - 17 built-in games</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DBLMM94B?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Atari - 50 built-in games</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DBLPWDLW?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Technos - 15 built-in games</a></li></ul></li></ul><p dir="ltr">Every cartridge in the Evercade library is compatible with the Alpha, EXP, and Super Pocket.
