            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/new-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-dev-diary-explains-dialogue-choice-systems/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Chinese Room's Senior Narrative Designer and Writer, Sarah Longthrone, has explained more details about the dialogue choice systems in Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 in a brand-new dev diary.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/news/dev-diary-dialogue-choice-systems" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this dev diary</a>, The Chinese Room explains how the dialogue systems help shape the world and provide depth for the characters in the game by shaping them with conversation. The dialogue systems help players determine each character's preferences and biases and how they perceive different characters in <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-and-paradox-arent-showing-dragon-age-the-veilguard-and-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-at-gamescom/">the game</a>.</p>
<p>They discuss how you can play Phyre in multiple ways and how you get them to react to certain topics and characters, which is up to you. Whether you lean into their age, potency, and power to intimidate other characters around them, or you choose to let the other character think they have control in the conversation by being gentler with them and more inquisitive. Alternatively, you can confuse the other characters by answering questions with more questions to be able to pull back the curtains on other characters.</p>
<p>However, while you control a certain character and you can choose how they think and react in situations, other characters' will also begin to have their own perceptions, reactions, and interpretations of conversations.</p>
<p>They wanted to build on nuance in the conversation since, when you are in control of conversations in a game, sometimes they go on to say it in a completely different tone than what you intended, or the message is wrong. The Chinese Room wanted to avoid this in conversations within Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2.</p>
<p>The dev diary explains how you can jump to two extremes in conversation by either using your power and age to show off the big guns, but as stated in the dev diary, "throwing your weight around isn't always the best option, especially in a world overrun with big egos and at least thirteen different species of narcissist."</p>
<p>Instead, you can convince the other characters that they have the advantage and make them out to be stronger and superior, only to flip it on them when you need to. You can convince others that you can be trusted and give them a listening ear when they need it, which is a great way to gain more information that can benefit you in later situations.</p>
<p>You will be allowed to read more about your relationships as you play the game to see how members of your clan perceive you and whether you need to sweeten the deal with some of them throughout your game experience.</p>

			<p>The Outer Worlds 2 was <a href="https://wccftech.com/outer-worlds-2-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> at E3 2021 with a hilarious self-aware trailer. We haven't heard anything more about it until now. Obsidian Entertainment CEO Feargus Urquhart talked a bit about the RPG sequel as part of his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADkKzjY6j7Y" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interview</a> with YouTube channel Limit Break Network.</p>
<p><em>It's going really well. It's always very easy for us to say that because that's what we should say, but no, it actually is. I'm really impressed with the team. Whenever we have a big game being made, the studio gets together and we figure out how to ship a game. We're making sure it's everything that it needs to be, and we tried to create a pretty good semi-porous membrane between Avowed and The Outer Worlds 2 so we're really able to support that team.</em></p>
<p><em>Luckily, the lead programmer is the same lead programmer. Leonard Boyarsky is the same creative director, Brandon Adler is still the game director, and Matt Singh, who was a tester on New Vegas,&nbsp;he's the head of gameplay and content. We were very lucky, we have a lot of people on that game that get it and have worked on the first one and worked for us for a very long time. I've actually been really impressed.</em></p>
<p><em>We had a really hard time at the studio during COVID. We got acquired, and then COVID happened, and we're trying to get The Outer Worlds and the DLC done, and we're trying to move Avowed forward. We wanted to get The Outer Worlds 2 moving, Grounded was moving, and Josh was working on Pentiment. There was just all this stuff happening, and to be honest, we were kind of a crappy developer for about a year and a half.&nbsp;There was talk of, do we stop work on The Outer Worlds 2 and just throw the whole team on Avowed? I appreciate Microsoft, because we said no, we will get there with all these games. </em></p>
<p><em>Are they going to be on the timelines that we originally thought? No, but we're going to get there, and I think that's been proven. Grounded turned out awesome, Pentiment turned out awesome, Avowed is going to be great, The Outer Worlds 2 is looking incredible. We have a base now with everything we did for Avowed and The Outer Worlds 2 &nbsp;with how we use unreal and all the tools that we've been developing for years and years to go off and make the whole next generation of games.</em></p>
<p>The Obsidian CEO also <a href="https://wccftech.com/obsidian-ceo-would-love-to-make-a-shadowrun-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> he'd love to make a Shadowrun game.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/cosmere-rpg-community-creates-roll20-demiplane-rolling-tool</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/cosmere-rpg-community-creates-a-roll20-demiplane-rolling-tool.953412/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/cosmere-rpg-community-creates-roll20-demiplane-rolling-tool<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The tabletop community has been tucking into the preview materials of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/brandon-sandersons-cosmere-rpg-kickstarter-raised-5-million-in-one-day" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Cosmere RPG</a>. The officially licensed adaptation of Brandon Sanderson's work released playtest materials on the Roll20 and Demiplane VTTs. Now thanks to on savvy Reddit user, there is a community-made Roll20 Demiplane rolling tool available.</p>
<h2>The Roll20 Demiplane Rolling Tool Development</h2>
<p>As mentioned in the Cosmere RPG Kickstarter page, several VTTs are hosting different preview material. Fantasy Grounds has a beta rules preview. Roll20 hosts the prewritten adventure Bridge Nine. Lastly, Demiplane showcases a free character creator.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/roll20-demiplane-cosmere-rpg-screenshot.jpg?itok=dzvxEgXJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/roll20-demiplane-cosmere-rpg-screenshot.jpg?itok=XJvwlFar 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The development of the Roll20 Demiplane rolling tool happened due to one simple but frustration complication between these VTTs. Despite Roll20 <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/roll20-demiplane-acquisition-officially-announced" rel="noopener" target="_blank">buying Demiplane</a>, official integration of the two VTTs hasn't been rolled out yet. This means if you joined the Roll20 campaign with a character made on Demiplane and make rolls on Demiplane, those rolls will not show up on Roll20.</p>
<p>Enter <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cosmererpg/comments/1eqs5cd/new_tool_for_rolling_in_roll20_from_your/">Reddit user jackpoll4100</a>. This user wrote a tool that will allow Demiplane rolls to show up in Roll20 chat. Better still, it does not require a Roll20 Premium subscription or API and does not require any GM setup to use. Furthermore, the user made the tool work for all currently supported Demiplane character sheets – <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/world-of-darkness-nexus-embraces-partnership-with-demiplane" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Vampire: The Masquerade</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/paizo-and-demiplane-announce-pathfinder-nexus" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Pathfinder</em></a>, etc..</p>
<p>Generally, the Roll20 Demiplane rolling tool is a user script. This means you will need a browser extension like TamperMonkey or ViolentMonkey to have it work properly. It should be noted that this tool will only work if you are running both Roll20 and Demiplane in separate tabs on the same browser. This won't allow interactions with mobile devices.</p>
<p>Once installed, there should be an extra UI element in the Roll20 chat box labelled 'Enable rolls from Demiplane.' Turn it on and any roll made from any Demiplane character sheet on your browser will be "funneled" to the Roll20 chat.</p>
<p>The Roll20 Demiplane rolling tool even includes unique dice results from different supported systems. These include <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/vampire-masquerade-5th-edition-review-front-loaded-lore" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Vampire: The Masquerade's</em></a> Bestial Failure, Messy Critical, and Standard Critical, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/daggerheart-13-playtest-available-now" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Daggerheart's</em></a> Hope, Fear, and Critical Success, and <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/avatar-legends-brings-show-to-life" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Avatar Legends</a>'</em> Miss/Weak/Strong Hit results.</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/14/24220354/vr-meta-quest-roto-explorer-chair-virtual-reality</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-head-tracking-spinning-chair-could-make-vr-less-nauseating.953409/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/14/24220354/vr-meta-quest-roto-explorer-chair-virtual-reality<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The <a href="https://www.rotovr.com/products/roto-vr-explorer">Roto VR Explorer</a> chair is designed to make VR experiences feel more immersive (and less nauseating) by pairing real-world movements with what’s seen in a headset. By simply spinning a sitting user in place, it’s able to do that in a much smaller footprint than other solutions like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/1/7/7506249/virtuix-omni-vr-treadmill-consumer-version-ces-2015">Virtuix Omni treadmill</a> or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/20/24045268/what-if-omnidirectional-treadmill-but-for-multiple-people-at-once">Disney’s Holo Tile treadmill</a>.</p><p>It looks like an office chair, but the Roto VR Explorer is distinguished by an oversize wheeled base with an integrated electric motor that can spin a seated user at speeds of up to 21 revolutions per minute. The chair will automatically rotate left and right to match the head turns of a user wearing a Meta Quest headset, but instead of relying on movement data captured by the Quest, the Roto VR Explorer uses its own motion-sensing head tracker attached to a head strap.</p><p>The Roto VR Explorer comes with the <a href="https://www.meta.com/ca/made-for-meta/">Made for Meta stamp of approval</a>, meaning it’s “authorized by Meta to meet our high-quality standards,” but since the head tracking is all handled by a proprietary sensor, the chair should also work with other VR headsets, as long as you’ve got a head strap to attach it to.</p><p>The speed of the chair matches the speed and intensity of a user’s head movements. A small head turn will result in barely noticeable turns or, in some cases, no movement at all, but a fast head turn will have the chair quickly accelerating to its maximum speed.</p><p>The chair claims to reduce motion sickness — a long-standing issue for many users of devices like the Meta Quest — because it adds real-world movements that coincide with what’s seen in a VR experience so the brain is less disoriented. Could you recreate a similar experience by just rotating a regular office chair with your legs? Potentially, but the movements wouldn’t be as closely matched as what’s claimed here.</p><div><figcaption><em>The height-adjustable chair features a leather upholstered seat and backrest.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Rotovrltd</cite></p></div><p>The Roto VR Explorer won’t eliminate motion sickness entirely. Users may still experience it when moving forward or backward or quickly teleporting to other areas in a VR world using a controller. Being able to physically walk around while experiencing VR is still a better approach, but the chair is designed as a compromise for smaller spaces, where full-body movements may be restricted.</p><p>Other useful features include a rumble pack mounted under the seat, providing force feedback, a modular design for attaching other unannounced accessories, and a USB port at the base of the chair that rotates so users can keep a VR headset charged without cables getting wrapped up. Locking wheels also ensure the Roto VR Explorer doesn’t slide around during intense VR experiences.</p><p>It’s available for preorder now for $799 (or £799 in the UK), and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/14/check-out-this-800-rotating-vr-chair-for-meta-quest/">according to <em>TechCrunch</em></a><em>,</em> it’s expected to ship as early as October. If VR fans are experiencing a sense of deja vu, it’s because the company introduced a <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DZzHO-Yq8wMA">more complex version back&nbsp;in 2020</a>, which sold for over $2,000.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

However, in recent years <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/kingdom-hearts-steam-user-reviews-epic-games-store-1851554071&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/kingdom-hearts-steam-user-reviews-epic-games-store-1851554071">Steam store pages have become flooded by joke reviews</a></span> that are basically useless. Now, Valve has had enough and is making some changes that might  lead to fewer joke and meme reviews. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/news/?emclan=103582791457287600&amp;emgid=4326355263805583415&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/?emclan=103582791457287600&amp;emgid=4326355263805583415" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On August 14, Valve published a news blog</a></span> about its plans to update Steam reviews in an effort to make them more helpful. Valve says the “primary goal” of Steam reviews is to “help potential players make informed decisions” about games they might want to buy. But the current system, where players vote on which reviews are “helpful,” isn’t working. So Valve is going to start identifying “unhelpful” reviews and make them harder to see. </p><p>According to Valve, “one-word reviews, reviews comprised of ASCII art, or reviews that are primarily playful memes and in-jokes” will now be considered unhelpful and will be “sorted behind other reviews on the game’s store page.”</p><h2 id="h1649"><a id=""></a>How is Valve identifying unhelpful, joke reviews?</h2><p>Valve clarifies that players might still see “humorous, but unhelpful” reviews, but the goal is that they show up far less often when people are just trying to learn more about a game. The company says there will be an option you can toggle on for those who like these silly reviews and still want to see them. </p><figure id="" data-id="c9c2bc95f3ec7e46a1e74bca38245597" data-recommend-id="image://c9c2bc95f3ec7e46a1e74bca38245597" data-format="jpg" data-width="645" data-height="515" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Valve / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c9c2bc95f3ec7e46a1e74bca38245597" data-recommend-id="image://c9c2bc95f3ec7e46a1e74bca38245597" data-format="jpg" data-width="645" data-height="515" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>So how will Valve identify unhelpful reviews? The company says reviews will be marked unhelpful using Steam moderators, user reports, and some “machine learning algorithms.”</p><p>“Our team has found that a lot of the unhelpful reviews were easy to spot,” said Valve. “So we’re targeting those first. This is a work in process, and will likely take quite a while for our team to evaluate the existing reviews and newly posted reviews.”</p><p>You might be wondering, why even leave these unhelpful reviews up? Valve says that it’s found that “many players want to express an opinion about the game” but they don’t always have the right words to do so. So it says these sillier reviews are still “valuable data,” even if they aren’t traditional reviews. </p><p>There you go. You can still do your silly reviews, but now people won’t have to scroll through 200 of them making the same joke just to see if the game is good or not. This seems like a smart change and one which has long been overdue. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Andrew Garfield and Florence Pugh presented an award at the 2023 Oscars. Shortly after, it was revealed that they were starring in a new indie romcom together. Last month, a trailer for <em>We Live in Time </em>was released that revealed a quirky, intimate love story racked by mysterious tragedy that might have something to do with a life-threatening disease, failed pregnancy, weird sci-fi time loops, or all three. </p><p>But no one was really paying attention until today when a no-name Twitter account suspiciously created last month seemingly dropped a previously unreleased promo shot for the movie featuring a laughing Pugh, a smiling Garfield, and an absolutely unhinged merry-go-round horse. It was a recipe for engagement and it worked. A meme factory was born. Even video game companies tried to draft off the nightmare fuel:</p><figure id="" data-id="1c92f6e735ca21e89ace8da03838b240" data-recommend-id="image://1c92f6e735ca21e89ace8da03838b240" data-format="png" data-width="931" data-height="679" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Twitter / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1c92f6e735ca21e89ace8da03838b240" data-recommend-id="image://1c92f6e735ca21e89ace8da03838b240" data-format="png" data-width="931" data-height="679" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><figure id="" data-id="eb851a8c0a83eb8b7ea1cfee79651002" data-recommend-id="image://eb851a8c0a83eb8b7ea1cfee79651002" data-format="png" data-width="931" data-height="717" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Twitter / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="eb851a8c0a83eb8b7ea1cfee79651002" data-recommend-id="image://eb851a8c0a83eb8b7ea1cfee79651002" data-format="png" data-width="931" data-height="717" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><figure id="" data-id="a81c0b1eaab67a4ca6b6ec1ee3e5d45e" data-recommend-id="image://a81c0b1eaab67a4ca6b6ec1ee3e5d45e" data-format="png" data-width="943" data-height="653" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Twitter / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a81c0b1eaab67a4ca6b6ec1ee3e5d45e" data-recommend-id="image://a81c0b1eaab67a4ca6b6ec1ee3e5d45e" data-format="png" data-width="943" data-height="653" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><figure id="" data-id="c484846beaf06f6b6c6b32b650db00cc" data-recommend-id="image://c484846beaf06f6b6c6b32b650db00cc" data-format="png" data-width="916" data-height="694" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Twitter / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c484846beaf06f6b6c6b32b650db00cc" data-recommend-id="image://c484846beaf06f6b6c6b32b650db00cc" data-format="png" data-width="916" data-height="694" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>And it’s worked. Before today I had no idea what this movie was called, let alone what it was about. Now I am 100 percent going to watch the next trailer for it, not to find out the mystery haunting Pugh and Garfield’s ill-fated romance but for another glimpse of this mustard-yellow hellbeast to make sure it actually exists and made it into the final cut of the movie. </p><p>  <em>We Live in Time </em>is premiering at the Toronto Film Festival next month before coming to theaters in wide release on  October 11, 2024. It’s directed by John Crowley, who real heads know for the off-beat Irish dark comedy <em>Intermission</em>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/dustborn-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Have some patience and this punk comic book caper will win you over with its weirdos.</h2></div><div><section><p>The almost parodically melodramatic characters and odd combination of genres that make up Dustborn lead to an eye-rolling first impression, but as my crew of mutated misfits traveled across America whacking people with an upgraded baseball bat and talking about our feelings, I realized that there's a lot more to it than I first thought. Dustborn is tackling big ideas, and it's doing it with robots in bunny hats, broken-hearted biker queens, and science-fiction squid things. This mash-up of comic books, Telltale-inspired narrative adventures, and rhythm games is like a buffet of styles, story, and action, and it works better than it has any right to. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"></output><p>You play as Pax, an aloof conwoman transporting secret cargo to Canada with a gang of fellow superpowered smugglers posing as a punk band. It's set in an intriguing alternate version of America where JFK was never assassinated, Marilyn Monroe is referred to as Lady Justice, and a blast of concentrated information has gifted some people with powers. Not laser eyes or flying – think more gaslighting, controlling minds with your voice, illusion magic, and more. Dustborn is primarily about making choices through dialogue and actions that drive your character toward a specific end to that road trip. Will you snuggle up with your ex? Will you tell the rest of the crew about your plan? Will you eavesdrop on their calls? (I mean that last one, obviously.) </p><p>When you're not talking to your allies through cute conversations that sound like they should come with a mental health TikTok hashtag, there is some action too. Your punk songs at gigs will play out as timed rhythm games, you’ll capture floating entities called Echos by dragging them into place with a modded handheld, and you'll even fight various people and robots by swinging around a boomerang baseball bat and using your commanding powers to push, freeze, or confuse enemies. I can never resist a bit of button-mashing music action, and while the combat is simplistic, it looks dope. I'd have liked more of these sections to balance out all the talking, but there's a good chance I'm just impatient and emotionally stunted. </p><p>Either way, the pacing is Dustborn's biggest flaw. This campaign has a slow start with enough exposition to choke a donkey, leading with a seemingly endless amount of angsty conversations before you get a chance to do anything fun with these characters. It's particularly easy to get irritated when everything you're doing seems to involve people getting kind of mad at you. Eventually you learn more about each band member and how to navigate your conversations, and there's an emotional payoff to all the chit-chat, but at first Pax and the people she's dealing with just seem a bit lame. Turns out nothing brings people together like hitting robots with a baseball bat in combat combos or rocking out as a band, and it won me over too.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>To make Dustborn worthwhile, you need to embrace the whole package.</p></div><p>Those action sequences aren’t the deepest on their own, either, so to make Dustborn a worthwhile investment you're going to need to embrace the whole package. If you're in it for just one mechanic, say the music, you'll likely lose patience waiting for your next chance to jam out. Similarly, there's no way to speed run all the emotional stuff – even if you don't care about being a stone-cold bitch to your buddies and decide to cut them off whenever possible, you're still going to need to analyze those decisions to move a chapter forward. I stuck with it because every time I was ready to bow out some part of a narrative thread gently pulled me back in, and I'm a sucker for robots and relationship drama. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Whether it's in the story setup, the variety of its characters, or the way its conflicts are approached in conversations, Dustborn has clearly made a conscious effort to be as inclusive as possible. It’s to a degree that felt performative at first, and I say that as someone who is neither straight nor entirely mentally healthy, but that philosophy eventually becomes the driving force behind what makes both these characters and your decisions concerning them far more complicated and interesting. That positive message doesn't get in the way of gameplay, because the gameplay is all about being different and finding a place in society. X-Men did it in the 80s, and now Dustborn is doing it using the issues and visual language of 2024. </p><p>When that story hits its stride and shows the confidence to have more levity in its sometimes over-serious dialogue or give you bigger chunks of autonomy, I was all in. Investigating a sinister, robot-filled research lab with my bratty little sister; getting a perfect streak during a small-town performance of a punk track; taking a robot hat shopping in an abandoned mall; using increasingly weird combos of powers in combat; it all combined with the dialogue to give emotional consequence to my choices, good or bad. I won't be going back for a replay, but I will always think fondly of that time I went on a road trip with a bunch of weirdos and set fire to a gas station. </p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3>Verdict</h3><p>After the first hour, I was sure finishing Dustborn would be up there with folding laundry in terms of chores – but just a few hours later and I was invested in the welfare of all my little freaky friends as they played gigs, fought robots, and had sometimes melodramatic conversations. Its band of well-intentioned weirdos tells an absorbing story in an alternate-history America, and while I may have started by rolling my eyes, I was high on science fiction satisfaction and wondering if I was too old to get a neck tattoo and some neon accessories by the end.</p></div></div><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3><div><p>good</p><p>Dustborn brings angst to a comic book caper about an alternate-reality America, and you'll get an emotional ride with a few exciting punk performances if you stick with it through a slow start. </p><a href="https://www.ign.com/person/rachelsbrain" title="Rachel Weber"><span></span><figcaption><p>Rachel Weber</p><div><p>Reviewed on </p><!-- --><p>PlayStation 5</p></div></figcaption></a></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Some of the cosmetics include new outfits for Mercy, Doomfist, Sigma, Illari, and more, with highlights including a Dorothy/Tin Man skin for Ashe and a sleek, golden look for Echo. Juno is the real star of the show, though, as Blizzard teases her return following <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/overwatch-2-reveals-newest-support-hero-and-shell-be-playable-this-weekend">a weekend trial period</a> that allowed players to go hands-on last month. Overwatch 2 Season 12 launches August 20.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Reaper is the Hero to win the Mythic skin for Overwatch 2 Season 12. His Anubis outfit comes with three unique styles and what appear to be special voice lines and animations. That marks two seasons in a row that a Damage Hero has gotten the Mythic skin, but that doesn’t mean Blizzard won’t have more cosmetics to reveal as New Frontiers rolls on. Specifically, toward the end of the trailer, we get a sneak peek at a large, blue broadsword that looks remarkably similar to Frostmourne, the giant melee weapon that belongs to World of Warcraft’s Lich King. It seems Blizzard is teasing a full-on World of Warcraft collaboration following <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/overwatch-2-teases-transformers-collab-in-season-11-trailer">last season’s Transformers crossover</a>, with <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1es5onv/comment/li3dzy0/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>some keen-eyed players</u></a> noticing that the sword’s rockets suggest that Reinhardt will be one of the characters to get some love yet again.</p><p>Blizzard also oversees World of Warcraft, and with so many nods to it already polluting Overwatch 2, it’s no surprise to see the studio doubling down. What is a surprise is Overwatch 2 Season 12’s new game mode: Clash. In <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24116736/embark-on-an-out-of-this-world-voyage-in-overwatch-2-season-12-new-frontiers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a post on its website</u></a>, Blizzard describes Clash as “an adrenaline-pumping game mode that pits teams against each other in a relentless battle for dominance over multiple capture points.” It’s a straightforward, fast-paced mode that comes with new maps Temple of Anubis and Hanaoka, which might be familiar to fans who have been playing since 2016.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Overwatch 2 Season 12: New Frontiers Trailer Slideshow</h3></div></output><p>The former carries the same name as Overwatch’s first Assault (a.k.a. Two Capture Point) map, while the latter is clearly inspired by another fan-favorite location, Hanamura. They are both undeniably similar to areas fans have begged to see return since Assault was removed with the launch of Overwatch 2, but instead of simply plopping them back in, Blizzard has reworked them from top to bottom for Clash.</p><p>Overwatch 2 Season 12: New Frontiers is also bringing health reductions for a few Damage and Support Heroes, with updates coming for Lifeweaver, too. Players can also expect new Hero Mastery Missions for Zarya and Pharah, with the 2024 Anniversary Event scheduled to launch soon, too. While Blizzard continues to tweak Competitive, it’ll soon introduce a special Xbox promotion for Game Pass holders that nets subscribers a goodie bag come September 17. Included in the offering are 30 Mythic prisms as well as the fan-favorite Cardboard Reinhardt, Turtleship D.Va, Cyberdragon Hanzo, Street Runner Genji, Bee Mercy, and Cleric Lifeweaver. The company encourages players to link their Battle.net accounts as it promises additional rewards in the future.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Overwatch 2 Season 12 aims to take the strategic team shooter to new heights, and it’s part of a wider goal to regain player interest with a number of foundational changes. These include plans for Blizzard to begin <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/blizzard-is-looking-at-bringing-6v6-back-to-overwatch-but-it-wont-be-easy">testing a return to 6v6</a> without impacting queue times and on-screen clutter. For more, you can read our original <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/overwatch-2-review">Overwatch 2 review</a>. We gave the game an 8/10, saying, “Overwatch 2’s switch to a 5v5 format breathes new life into what was once the sharpest shooter around. It just hasn’t quite recaptured all of that glory – yet.”</p><p><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance contributor with IGN.

In the dungeon, they'll be able to place whatever items they want inside, such as weapons, structures, and even enemies. All of these can be changed whenever they see fit. Players will also be able to play the game that they made.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to that, they'll also be able to make decisions that allow players to introduce classes, such as Explorers and Mages. They'll also be able to introduce other mechanics to their game, which include Monster Catching and Fishing.</p><p dir="ltr">Let's Build a Dungeon doesn't have a release date yet, but it's expected to launch on PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/grand-theft-auto-iv-fast-traffic-stream-twitch-youtube<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It would not be unfair to call <a href="https://x.com/tomwalkerisgood" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tom Walker</a> a madman. It would probably be more fair to call him an Australian comedian who streams games on Twitch – because that’s what he calls himself – but actions speak louder than words. And the fact of the matter is, Walker has spent nearly half a year <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65s6_9-Gh30&amp;t=27s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">attempting to complete <em>Grand Theft Auto IV</em></a> with <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/warp-eleven-carmageddon-alternative" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a mod</a> that makes traffic move so quickly that it’s almost invisible to the naked eye. Any step onto a street could be his last. Cars ping off barriers, buildings, and each other with such intensity that they build into weather events, exploding tornadoes of twisted metal. Some missions have taken hundreds of tries, and yet he persists. Why? To affirm his humanity. And because it’s very, very funny.</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLI_N-KSDRamydGIKwJDLcLcC_VRH0g0-I" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Walker’s <em>GTA IV</em> playthrough</a> has proven to be a slapstick spectacle for the ages. The sheer carnage of vehicles screaming by at a million miles per hour pairs perfectly with his tentative demeanor each time a new mission begins. Walker will often map out a route that avoids traffic as much as possible, take a deep breath as he begins to shuffle in the direction of his objective, and then… immediately get hit by a car so hard that his ragdolling corpse departs the surface of the Earth. It never gets old.</p><div><figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">New video of me beating GTA 4 with every car set to 9999 km/h is up! The mission involves pulling over three individual vans and checking their cargo. Here's how that goes: <a href="https://t.co/LemXpmbHVO">pic.twitter.com/LemXpmbHVO</a></p>— TOM (@tomwalkerisgood) <a href="https://twitter.com/tomwalkerisgood/status/1815993399138476314?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 24, 2024</a></blockquote></div></figure></div><p>As far as Walker is concerned, playing <em>GTA IV </em>this way catapults the experience into a different genre altogether.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>"It's more survival-horror than any game I've ever played,” Walker told Aftermath. “Your resources are scarce, your foes are many, you are the only thing in the world made of soft yielding flesh. … Less cars just means the silence between cars is longer, suspense builds, then a sedan slams from the horizon into you in 0.5 seconds. When a car gets into an enclosed space, they slam around as skittish and furious and violent as a necromorph."</p><p>Descending into Car Hell has forced Walker to get clever about how he manipulates <em>GTA IV</em>’s systems. For example, he’s learned from speedrunners that he can subtly shift the flow of traffic using just his in-game eyes.</p><p>"If you look down a short street, cars won't spawn there,” Walker said. “A long street will still have cars spawning far enough away that you can't affect them, but sometimes when crossing a road you can shut off one source of cars by looking left as you start to cross, then WHIP your camera around to the right as you pass the halfway point."</p><p>Walker has also realized that the streets – nearly as much as cars – are his enemy.</p><p>“The cars own the ground,” he said. “Take to the air. Take to the earth. Raised railways, bridges with walkways, tunnels, any area with clearly defined paths for the traffic to take where there's a lower chance of it ricocheting into [<em>GTA IV</em> main character] Niko.”</p><p>Some missions cause traffic to behave a little differently, a welcome reprieve that’s also taught Walker more about how <em>GTA IV</em>’s engine works.</p><p>"Scripted chase missions have what I call a 'sanity aura' around the lead car," Walker said. "The traffic around them behaves normally until they get about three car lengths away [from your position], and then they rocket away as if they've been excused from the dinner table. … Cars don't seem to become physics objects until they're closer; at a far distance, a fast car will slam into the back of a regular car, and the regular car will just tank it. If they get closer, both get completely destroyed."</p><div><figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This series of <a href="https://twitter.com/tomwalkerisgood?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@tomwalkerisgood</a> trying to get literally anything done in GTA4 with the traffic speed overcranked is one of the funniest things I’ve seen in weeks. Had to pause multiple times just to breathe. <a href="https://t.co/Sro9U5F3iA">pic.twitter.com/Sro9U5F3iA</a></p>— Sam Winkler (@ThatSamWinkler) <a href="https://twitter.com/ThatSamWinkler/status/1794046322145972671?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 24, 2024</a></blockquote></div></figure></div><p>Though always ready to deploy a well-timed one-liner, Walker rarely laughs during his streams. He takes the act of playing the game pretty seriously, in part because he has to if he wants any chance of ever beating it and getting on with his life. But also, good bits often happen <em>to </em>somebody. Whether they’re getting hit in the face with a pie or a two-ton slab of metal – amplified by Newtonian physics to weigh 1,000,000 tons – it’s funnier when that person doesn't seem to be entirely in on the joke.</p><p>"I feel like I'm often too invested to react with anything other than a scream. If I'm close to a mission finish I'm opening my eyes real wide, channeling all my energy into seeing cars and trying to work out what angles could possibly work,” Walker said. “And I think it's funnier if I'm just taking it seriously the whole time.”&nbsp;</p><p>Why subject himself to this at all, though? Why grind his teeth through an endurance test where he, more than any torrential downpour of exploding cars, is the punchline? That’s where things get existential.&nbsp;</p><p>"I get the idea in my head that I will defeat stupid challenges that don't matter pretty often,” Walker said. “To me one of the most human things you can do is commit yourself to a challenge that doesn't matter, that only you care about and that you could stop doing at any time. If life is suffering, why not choose more suffering – and more life?"</p><p>Walker has his eyes on the prize. Come hell, high water, or even more cars, he’s gonna beat <em>GTA IV</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>“God help me, but I am so stubborn I will finish this no matter what,” he said. “People liking it certainly makes that easier.”</p><p>After that, he’ll probably move onto <em>GTA IV</em>’s <em>The Lost and the Damned</em> DLC. Not <em>Grand Theft Auto V</em>, though, even though <a href="https://x.com/MonkipiQuinn/status/1795286878016684340" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a similar mod</a> exists for that game. <em>GTA IV</em> holds a special place in his heart, with car handling that’s “ponderous and boatlike” and areas that are “too big and expansive.”&nbsp;</p><p>"<em>GTA V </em>is not of much interest to me," Walker said, "basically because it's... I dunno, too ‘good’?"&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Springloaded Software, the developer behind 2021's animal-splicing tycoon game Let's Build a Zoo, has unveiled Let's Build a Dungeon - a new "multi-layered" management sim in which players attempt to run a game development studio while creating their own MMORPG.
</p>
<p>
Let's Build a Dungeon's first layer comes in the form of studio management, with players needing to recruit staff (including artists, programmers, planners, and testers); manage project deadlines, advertising campaigns, and press relationships; negotiate with shareholders, and pitch to publishers, all in the hope of rising from indie start-up to mega-blockbuster studio.
</p>
<p>
But alongside the business stuff, players also need to get creative and build their own fantasy MMO - which could be anything from a creature-catching RPG to a cosy farming sim - filling it with towns, monsters, dungeons, and quests, all tailored to satisfy their virtual playerbase's demands and expand its audience. And it's even possible to jump into your creation at any time to experience it through the eyes of your players.

<p>
"Place every tree, build every quest and decide on job classes for visiting virtual players as you watch them explore in real time," Springloaded explains. "Increase drop rates if they are struggling, or boost enemy stats to keep them grinding for XP. The more time spent in your world, the happier your investors will be!"
</p>
<p>
"Will you risk financial ruin by delaying your game until it's perfect or push your staff to breaking point with crunch time and salary cuts?," the studio adds. "Will you bow to community requests, or stay true to your creative vision?"
</p>
<p>
Let's Build a Dungeon features a campaign in which players can develop new items, environments, and mechanics for their MMO, but there's also a sandbox-style Creative Mode too, where they can write their own stories and dialogue, draw characters, create cutscenes, and tinker with gameplay mechanics. And then the finished thing can be shared online or uploaded to an in-game browser.
</p>
<p>
It all sounds a lot more ambitious than Springloaded's enjoyable if rather lightweight Let's Build a Zoo, and it'll be fascinating to see how the studio plans to pull these different elements together into something with a manageable focus. All will be revealed when Let's Build a Dungeon launches for Xbox and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2365790/Lets_Build_a_Dungeon/">Steam</a> at some currently undisclosed future point - and there'll be a chance to take a peek even sooner via an open beta, with <a href="http://letsbuildadungeon.com/">sign-ups open now</a>.

But before long, <em>Dress to Impress</em> (or <em>DTI</em> as those in the know call it) was everywhere—in my day-long charity event, in my friend group, on the streams of high-profile influencers like CaseOh and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKz6EVXTmGE&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKz6EVXTmGE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Madison Beer.</a></span> Earlier this month, it peaked at well over 370,000 concurrent players, according <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rolimons.com/game/15101393044&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rolimons.com/game/15101393044" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">to fan-run <em>Roblox</em> site Rolimon’s</a></span>. So what’s the special sauce that’s making <em>Dress to Impress</em> so popular? And who is behind this viral fashion game?</p><h2 id="h4589"><a id=""></a><strong>How to dress to impress</strong></h2><p>The <em>Dress to Impress</em> concept is simple: you join a server, are given a theme (like “Dark Coquette” or “Holiday” or “Heroes Vs Villains”), and have a few minutes to put together an outfit from a curated selection, style your hair, do your makeup, and paint your nails. When the time is up, you walk down the runway, choosing a few poses to pull at the end of your strut. Players in your lobby will award each look between one and five stars, and the top three will get podium placement. Then, you rinse and repeat this process with a new theme.</p><p><em>Dress to Impress</em> leans into one of the funnier elements of gaming: panic. There’s not a ton of time to put together your look, and there are separate timers for hair styling and skin tone selection that make it especially stressful for a new player trying to figure out how to navigate the menus. The clubby Y2K music speeds up as you near the end of the round, but you can’t make your character walk any faster than a stroll, so hilarity ensues in the final moments, especially if you’ve accidentally forgotten to give her a face (I did twice). Plus, a jump button hilariously ragdolls these wannabe models, which makes for pure chaos in the dressing room. The first round I play, I can’t figure out how to take any of the clothes <em>off</em>, so I walk out with three pairs of shoes on, each heel visually clipping through the other, tears in my eyes from laughing so hard.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="ecfc4b1af176641fdca8810637c8728e" data-recommend-id="image://ecfc4b1af176641fdca8810637c8728e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A model wears a blue and yellow outfit in the Dress to Impress dressing room.

You can use Robux to buy better outfits and flashier accessories, which means the people (again, ostensibly kids) willing to fork over real money for in-game advantages will often win every round. $6,000 in <em>Dress To Impress</em> costs 1,500 Robux, and $20 will get you 1,700 Robux, though, confusingly, some of the outfits available for purchase can only be bought with Robux, not <em>DTI </em>dollars. As for how far your cash will go—not very: A cute flouncy skirt and shirt set will run you $1,800 in <em>Dress to Impress</em> money, while a shimmery faux-nude number costs $5,000, though any clothes you buy will at least remain unlocked on your <em>DTI</em> account for future use.<br></p><p>So far I’ve only played <em>Dress to Impress</em> the free way, pulling items from the mannequins that don’t cost any Robux or <em>DTI</em> dollars. I’ve played about a dozen rounds and only made the podium once during an Elements-themed showcase in which I put my model in head-to-toe flame print. This shit is rigged (and yes, there do appear to be cheaters who can “bot” the votes).<br></p><h2 id="h4590"><a id=""></a><strong>Everyone’s dressing to impress</strong></h2><p>The <em>Dress to Impress </em>Discord server has over 237,000 members at the time of publication, many of whom are teenagers (including those in the developer channel). But <em>Dress to Impress </em>is taking the gaming world by storm, breaking out of <em>Roblox </em>containment in a manner heretofore unseen, ushering in new, older players to join the relatively young player base. </p><p>Interestingly, despite how youthful many of the players I encounter are, putting together a look in <em>Dress to Impress</em> feels like dressing background characters for a <em>Euphoria</em> episode—the models walk on Barbie tip-toes even without heels on, their bodies are uniformly thin and big-boobed, the makeup options offer <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.allure.com/story/siren-eyes-tiktok-trend&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.allure.com/story/siren-eyes-tiktok-trend" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">siren eyes</a></span> and Kylie Jenner lips pre-dissolution of her filler.

The dev channel on the official Discord has intros for those working behind the scenes on <em>Dress to Impress</em>. Many of them are teenagers who live all over the globe (Lebanon, Hungary, Thailand) and worship pop stars like Charli XCX, Ariana Grande, Lady Gaga, and Rihanna. The “owner” of <em>Dress to Impress</em>, known only as Gigi, is herself 17 years old. A 14 year old claims to be one of the game’s 3D modelers, showcasing just how impressively talented the youth of today is—and reminding us of the questionable morality that is <em>Roblox </em>content created via child labor. <em>Roblox</em> was <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/roblox-banned-blocked-turkey-child-exploitation-why-1851616972&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/roblox-banned-blocked-turkey-child-exploitation-why-1851616972">recently banned in Turkey</a></span> amid concerns over child exploitation, and in April, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/roblox-boss-kids-child-labor-exploit-indonesia-slum-1851387795&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/roblox-boss-kids-child-labor-exploit-indonesia-slum-1851387795">Roblox Studio head Stefano Corazza suggested</a></span> that the game was “a gift” for “15 year olds, in Indonesia, living in the slums.”<br></p><p>I reached out to a few <em>Dress to Impress </em>devs, as well as <em>Roblox</em> PR, but didn’t get a response in time for publication.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-censorship-explained/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It’s rather common these days for developers to alter a remaster or remake, sometimes significantly, to enhance the experience for modern audiences. Or, so they claim. Some developers take things a step too far and start cutting out content that they feel the community wouldn’t enjoy, but they never ask the community at large. There’s some concern with Capcom’s approach. So, what’s going on with the Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster censorship claims?</p>



<h2 id="h-is-dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-censored">Is Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster Censored?</h2>



<p>If you spend any amount of time online, looking at or discussing video games, then you’ll stumble upon loud individuals who call out every upcoming video game for censorship of some sort. Some complaints are rooted in reality, and some aren’t. It’s tough to discern which is which when the argument solely revolves around yelling.  But if you pay attention, you can follow the claims for yourself. For instance, there’s the censorship in Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster, or so many claim.</p>



<p>This censorship involves changes to the dialogue, specifically a boss fight involving Cliff Hudson. In the upcoming remaster, Cliff no longer refers to the player as a “filthy communist.” That dialogue line was scrubbed entirely. It’s rubbing people the wrong way for a number of reasons, primarily because this is a mature-rated game and should retain the dialogue from the original game.</p>



<p>Secondly, Capcom <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-erotic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">removed the ability to earn Prestige Points by taking erotic photographs</a> in Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster. In the original game, if you snapped a photo of a survivor’s cleavage, you would receive points that count toward your next level-up. But in the remaster, that system is removed entirely. Capcom said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>When developing Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster, we tried our best to create a game that would please returning core fans and appeal to new players alike. As development progressed, we inevitably discovered that we couldn’t include everything from the original game. In the case of the Erotica points system, this was something we discussed at length and decided to remove; not so much as a response to a changing cultural climate, but because we felt there is no need to have a reward points system on this basis. Additionally, when considering Frank’s situation, it is not an appropriate reward for survival and not a skill required of a journalist trying to stay alive for the next 72 hours during a zombie apocalypse. However, players will still have the right to choose their picture subjects freely, and even though they won’t receive points, it is up to them to decide what photos they will take to represent their journey.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="h-how-much-does-dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-cost">How Much Does Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster Cost?</h2>



<p>Many refuse to purchase or pre-order the game due to the many claims of censorship in Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster. But you’re an individual and can make that decision for yourself. You may want to know about its pricing:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster – $49.99</strong></li>



<li><strong>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster Digital Deluxe – $59.99</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>If you pay $10 more for the Digital Deluxe, then you’ll receive a handful of in-game goodies, such as the Frank West 2006 Costume, Chucke Green Costume, and Willamette Parkview Mall Bee Costume, all of which you can activate and wear at the Security Room.</p>

The words you choose can do more than hurt or help your relationships with other characters, but you won't always be able to count on getting the same reaction twice.</p><p>TCR Senior Narrative Designer and writer Sarah Longthorne has posted <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/news/dev-diary-dialogue-choice-systems" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a developer's diary</a> for Bloodlines 2 that explores the way that dialogue will work in the game. "Conversations are not an exception to gameplay, but an expression of it," explains Longthorne. "And if gameplay is a test of skill, conversations are a test of emotional intelligence."</p><p>Essentially, characters will respond to your dialogue choices based on their personal preferences as well as their interactions with your playable character, Phyre. Longthrone noted that players will have to figure out the dispositions of the NPCs to learn what they respond to. As an example, she included a sample interaction between Phyre and a character named Lou Graham. The same response from Phyre was interpreted differently by Lou based on how the player had interacted with her in the past.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4350220-bloodlines2dialogue.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4350220" data-ratio="0.57153846153846" data-width="1300" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4350220-bloodlines2dialogue.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4350220"></a><figcaption>A sample dialogue interaction from Vampire: The Masquerade: Bloodlines 2</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4350220-bloodlines2dialogue.jpg"></figure><p>"What worked once won’t necessarily work every time," added Longthrone. "We don't want you getting complacent, picking options transactionally to fill up some bar or progress some metric; we want you thinking, and engaging from moment to moment.

<p>In previous years, Activision gave PlayStation users first access to Call of Duty betas because Sony paid Activision for this. However, now that Microsoft owns Call of Duty, everyone across Xbox and PlayStation will get in at the same time. Xbox's Phil Spencer promised <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-aiming-for-100-call-of-duty-parity-on-playstation-and-nintendo-exclusive-skins-and-betas-might-be-done/1100-6518470/" data-ref-id="1100-6518470">"parity"</a> for the Call of Duty series between Xbox and PlayStation, and this seems to be part of that. The executive also recently discussed how Microsoft wants to avoid <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phil-spencer-says-cod-under-microsoft-wont-try-to-do-slimy-platform-things/1100-6524115/" data-ref-id="1100-6524115">"slimy"</a> platform policies surrounding exclusive content for Call of Duty.</p><p>Activision has yet to reveal what's in the Black Ops 6 multiplayer beta, but it's expected to include a sampling of the maps and modes from the full game. The publisher will share more details on Black Ops 6's multiplayer during the Call of Duty Next event on August 28.</p>

It gives the cities in those PS2-era games so much character and makes them feel like lived-in places filled with real people and all their junk. But all that flying trash disappeared in 2004's massive <em>GTA</em>: <em>San Andreas.</em> So what happened? Turns out, not everyone <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gta-6-vice-city-rockstar-developer-blog-secrets-1851044987&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-vice-city-rockstar-developer-blog-secrets-1851044987">developing the 3D-era <em>GTA </em>games</a></span> liked all that trash flying around. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/ObbeVermeij/status/1823703886407901506&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/ObbeVermeij/status/1823703886407901506" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In an August 14 tweet from Obbe Vermeij</a></span>, a former Rockstar North dev, the creator explained that the digital streets in <em>GTA 3</em> looked “too clean” so he “added litter.” </p><p>“[Trash in <em>GTA 3 </em>is just a] single rectangle that occasionally moves with the wind. It can also be dragged along by passing cars. The artists created four textures for it. Two newspapers and two leaves,” explained Vermeij.<br></p><p>This same system was used in <em>Vice City</em>, but with a small change. After players completed <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/wU0YaRA4F9k&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/wU0YaRA4F9k" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a specific mission</a></span>, which saw them drop flyers from a plane, one of the four textures was replaced with those flyers. This was a detail I always noticed as a young lad and something I loved about <em>Vice City.</em><br></p><p>And if you wondered why trash would sometimes phase through the ground in <em>GTA 3 </em>and <em>Vice City</em>, it’s because of how the debris detects the height of the ground while it moves around. It only checks where the ground is when it lands, so it can sometimes slip through the map during animations. </p><h2 id="h4553"><a id=""></a>Why <em>GTA 3</em>'s trash is in <em>Manhunt </em>but not <em>San Andreas</em></h2><p>When <em>San Andreas</em> was released in 2004, I remember being a little disappointed that all the trash from <em>GTA 3</em> and <em>Vice City </em>was missing. Sure, all the other cool new stuff in Rockstar’s open-world sequel was great, but I did wonder where the trash went. At the time, I thought perhaps moving paper was too much for the game to handle with everything else going on. Turns out it was just because some devs didn’t like all the debris flying around. </p><p>“Not everyone on the team liked the litter. I removed it for <em>San Andreas</em> because I eventually lost the argument,” posted Vermeij. </p><p>However, the trash appeared in <em>Manhunt</em>, a stealth game focused on murder which was also developed by Rockstar North and released the year prior to S<em>an Andreas</em>. So how did that happen? According to Vermeij, it’s because some <em>GTA </em>devs helped out during the “last months of <em>Manhunt’s </em>development.” And he took the time to add back in the “litter code” from <em>GTA 3. </em><br></p><p>Who knew a few pieces of trash blowing in the wind could be so interesting?

<p>Dr Disrespect is still playing cryptic games on social media and has been posting more images that nobody can decipher. It’s widely assumed he’s shaping up to make a grand return to streaming, but the question is, how well will he be received?</p>



<p>In the latest chapter in this sordid saga, Dr Disrespect has deleted the post on social media that he published admitting to his wrongdoing that got him banned from Twitch in 2020. This was the post that clearly stated he did inappropriately message a minor in 2017. </p>



<p>Nobody knows why he has deleted this post, but everyone has a theory.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-dr-deletion">Dr Deletion</h2>



<p>Dr Disrespect has been absent from the internet almost entirely since the news surfaced that he’d messaged a minor on Twitch seven years ago. He announced he would be taking a break from streaming as he headed off on an extended vacation, and since then, all he has posted are some mysterious and puzzling images on X.</p>



<p>Since the revelations about Dr Disrespect were made public, the charismatic and controversial streamer lost almost all of his sponsorships and was cut from Midnight Society, the studio that he helped found. He also haemorrhaged followers, losing tens of thousands in the space of a few days.</p>
