			<p>The latest list of games to be added to GeForce NOW has been updated, and many top games have been added. To play games via GeForce NOW, you need to own them on the specified client listed by NVIDIA. GeForce NOW is compatible with multiple clients, such as Steam, Battle.net, and Epic Games Store. This month, GeForce NOW users can expect to see games such as Final Fantasy XVI, Age of Mythology, and Epic Mickey: Rebrushed as some of the titles coming to GeForce NOW.</p>
<p>This month, 19 new titles are added to GeForce NOW, with a dozen of them being day-and-date titles, meaning you can stream them via GeForce NOW as soon as the game is officially released. As well as those games that will be available this month, those who are eager to play the Open Beta for Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will be able to play it via GeForce NOW as long as you are a member.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/astro-bot-dlc-post-launch</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/astro-bot-dlc-post-launch-will-include-challenge-levels-and-speedrun-stages.972876/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/astro-bot-dlc-post-launch<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you've been hoping for some&nbsp;<em>Astro Bot&nbsp;</em>DLC that you can check out after you've finished the main game, then it sounds like you're in luck, as extra stages are planned for the game after launch.</p>
<p>That's according to a <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/astro-bot-dlc-will-include-challenge-and-speedrun-levels/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">new report from VGC</a>; the site's journalists apparently visited developer Team Asobi's offices last month, and while there, they were told that&nbsp;<em>Astro Bot&nbsp;</em>would be getting some extra content in the weeks and months following its release.</p>
<p>According to the VGC report, Team Asobi is currently planning to add around ten challenge levels and five speedrun-focused levels to the game after its launch. VGC does, however, say that it's not sure "if those numbers are still accurate".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/astro-bot-dlc-post-launch-enemy.jpg?itok=ZpTUpQAZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/astro-bot-dlc-post-launch-enemy.jpg?itok=sMYjrrHZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You'll have more&nbsp;<em>Astro Bot&nbsp;</em>to enjoy post-launch.</figcaption></figure><p>If Team Asobi does decide to bring more content to&nbsp;<em>Astro Bot&nbsp;</em>post-launch, then it seems to me that'll be a very wise decision.</p>
<p><em>Astro Bot&nbsp;</em>is set to launch tomorrow as a PlayStation 5 exclusive (although Team Asobi does say it's <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/astro-bot-director-leaves-door-open-for-pc-version-shuts-down-playstation-vr2" rel="noopener" target="_blank">interested in hearing from players</a> regarding a PC version), and the reviews are already in.</p>
<p>Of course, the only review you really need to read is the one <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/astro-bot-review-90s-platformer-done-right">written by our very own Andrew Stretch</a>, who describes it as "a 90s platformer done perfectly" and praises its gameplay mechanics, difficulty, and celebration of PlayStation's history.</p>
<p>Lest you think he's an outlier, though, think again; the game's currently <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/17118/astro-bot" rel="noopener" target="_blank">sitting at a coveted 95% rating on OpenCritic</a>, with 100% of critics giving it a positive score overall. Looks like this one's going to be a hit.</p>

<p>If you're wondering what exactly&nbsp;<em>Astro Bot&nbsp;</em>is, it's a 3D platformer that acts as a sort of pseudo-followup to the PS5 pack-in game&nbsp;<em>Astro's Playroom&nbsp;</em>(which remains one of the highlights of the console's software lineup even now).</p>
<p>Like its predecessor,&nbsp;<em>Astro Bot&nbsp;</em>celebrates PlayStation by including a wealth of cameos from Sony IPs both old and new. Obviously, it's too early to extrapolate a narrative, but the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/concord-shutting-down-refunds">failure of&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/concord-shutting-down-refunds">Concord</a>&nbsp;</em>and the success of this game feel like they should be sending a message to Sony.</p>
<p>You can pre-order&nbsp;<em>Astro Bot&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/astro-bot/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">right here via the PlayStation Store</a>.</p>

The platformer pays tribute to PlayStation’s past with cute little robot cameos representing nearly every video game hero from every era remotely associated with the brand. It was more or less a guided tour through the legacy of one of the big three, and after the PS4 solidified Sony as top dog in the console landscape, I was certainly in the mood to look back at how we got here when the PS5 launched in 2020. Now we have <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-kotaku-review-playstation-5-1851640280&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-kotaku-review-playstation-5-1851640280"><em>Astro Bot</em></a></span>, the excellent follow-up that builds upon all the tight platforming, adorable robo aesthetics, and PlayStation nostalgia of that pack-in game. But it’s been four years since the PS5 launched with <em>Astro’s Playroom</em> installed and the new game also inadvertently spotlights the fact that, despite four trips around the sun, the system has remarkably little to show for it.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196181" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Best Reveals From The Game Awards 2023" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="180" data-playlist="196181,196230,193348" data-current="196181"><div><p>The Best Reveals From The Game Awards 2023</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21718.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>As of this writing, I’ve seen <em>Astro Bot</em>’s credits roll and collected 250 of its 300 hidden robots, which are tucked into every corner of its levels. Most of these are generic white and blue bots not meant to resemble any hero PlayStation fans have embodied or foe that they’ve faced. Some, however, are based on classic PlayStation characters, from OGs like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/crash-bandicoot-5-spyro-crossover-cancelled-activision-1851632213&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/crash-bandicoot-5-spyro-crossover-cancelled-activision-1851632213">Crash Bandicoot</a></span> to more recent additions like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/horizon-forbidden-west-the-kotaku-review-1848524470&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/horizon-forbidden-west-the-kotaku-review-1848524470">Aloy from <em>Horizon</em></a></span>. There’s a pretty exciting range of characters to be found on Astro Bot’s adventures. I was grinning ear to ear when I found the Sly Cooper bot locked up in a cell for his kleptomaniac crimes. I was stoked to see some characters like Aigis and Joker from the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/persona-3-reload-remake-review-ps5-steam-pc-xbox-1851201927&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/persona-3-reload-remake-review-ps5-steam-pc-xbox-1851201927"><em>Persona</em> series</a></span> after they’d been omitted from <em>Astro’s Playroom</em>. But after finding a couple hundred, I realized something was off. By my count, I’ve only encountered one that originates from a PlayStation 5 exclusive in those 250: Rivet from <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ratchet-clank-rift-apart-the-kotaku-review-1847047303&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ratchet-clank-rift-apart-the-kotaku-review-1847047303"><em>Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart</em></a></span>. But I look at a list of Sony’s output this generation, and ask myself what else would they pick from? What has Sony released for the PS5 that has had any cultural impact that stands alongside characters like Kratos or Nathan Drake? Is it really that surprising that <em>Astro Bot </em>has a dearth of works to draw from?</p><figure id="" data-id="5ccf25eda6332d5b833b82a10356eae7" data-recommend-id="image://5ccf25eda6332d5b833b82a10356eae7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Astro presses a button while Kratos, Aloy, Nate, and others stand next to him." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Astro presses a button while Kratos, Aloy, Nate, and others stand next to him." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->PlayStation / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5ccf25eda6332d5b833b82a10356eae7" data-recommend-id="image://5ccf25eda6332d5b833b82a10356eae7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Astro presses a button while Kratos, Aloy, Nate, and others stand next to him." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There may be more I have yet to uncover, but the fact that the PlayStation 5 has almost nothing to showcase in <em>Astro Bot</em> becomes more stark as the game goes on. <em>Astro Bot</em> has a series of levels in which its titular hero dons the garb and weapons of different characters from throughout PlayStation’s life. Each of these levels spotlights a character from a different console era (though the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-valhalla-dlc-review-1851097244&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-valhalla-dlc-review-1851097244"><em>God of War</em></a></span> one is a little iffy considering it spotlights the modern, Norse-inspired era that began on PS4 instead of the original Greece-based PS2 games), and there’s is no such level for a PS5 character. There are points when each console era and its respective heroes get their time in the spotlight with a dedicated sequence for each generation. The PS5 is conspicuously skipped over, however, as if there wasn’t enough material to merit it.<br></p><p>Throughout <em>Astro Bot</em>, you’re rescuing marooned PlayStation characters as you all attempt to repair your PS5-shaped ship that’s crash-landed on a remote planet. As I look back at Sony’s latest console generation, there’s something morbidly poetic about watching Astro Bot run around trying to repair and salvage a console that has taken a serious beating. It’s not a PlayStation-exclusive problem, as Microsoft is taking its own beatings across the aisle, but this console generation has been a black hole for PlayStation.</p><p>Four years in, the PlayStation 5 has been characterized by remasters and remakes banking on old ideas from better days, the upheaval of decades of legacy through <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sony-playstation-layoffs-london-studio-closure-1851289547&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sony-playstation-layoffs-london-studio-closure-1851289547">studio shutdowns and job losses</a></span>, the disappearance of beloved series that don’t fit a specific prestige framework Sony’s leaning into these days, and a live-service focus that has panned out exactly once. Just days before <em>Astro Bot</em>’s launch, Sony and Firewalk Studios announced plans to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/concord-shutdown-playstation-offline-delisted-store-1851638956&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/concord-shutdown-playstation-offline-delisted-store-1851638956">shut down <em>Concord</em></a></span>, one of the biggest pillars of Sony’s focus on forever games, two weeks after it came to stores. <em>Astro Bot</em> is a celebration, but what are we celebrating? Our collective endurance? The memory of a console family that was once characterized by a spirit of innovation which cannot be recaptured in this “number go up at all cost” climate?<br></p><figure id="" data-id="082a40f8930131584dc3f7c57d30be09" data-recommend-id="image://082a40f8930131584dc3f7c57d30be09" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Nate bot crawls out of a treasure chest." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Nate bot crawls out of a treasure chest." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->PlayStation / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="082a40f8930131584dc3f7c57d30be09" data-recommend-id="image://082a40f8930131584dc3f7c57d30be09" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Nate bot crawls out of a treasure chest." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>In defense of PlayStation Studios, a lot of the defining works come in the second half of a console’s lifetime. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-2-tlou-remastered-review-1851167660&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-2-tlou-remastered-review-1851167660"><em>The Last of Us</em></a></span> wasn’t even in our field of view four years after the PS3 launched and it went on to become one of the most widely celebrated franchises in PlayStation’s arsenal. So there may certainly be the big, generation-defining games on the way. But <em>Astro Bot</em> reflects so poorly on everything Sony’s done since we last played as its robot hero. It is perhaps the most joyful thing to come out of Sony since the last <em>Astro Bot</em>, but so much of that joy comes from looking back rather than existing in the now because all we have now is a wasteland. I’m scared about what that says for the future.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Hooded Horse, the publisher behind </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Manor Lords</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, has been loudly advocating for better contracts. Earlier this year, co-founder and CEO Tim Bender said publishers should </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/hooded-horse-co-founder-says-publishers-should-ditch-horrible-recoup-clauses-to-help-devs">ditch "horrible" recoup clauses</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to help devs and suggested companies like Hooded Horse should be </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/hooded-horse-ceo-forget-success-judge-publishers-on-how-they-respond-to-adversity">judged on their failures–not the big hits</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If you can navigate the pitching slalom to eventually secure a publishing deal that's right for you, what comes next? Hooded Horse chief product officer Ashkan Namousi says developers should treat publishers like an open book. As advice goes, it might sound like a no-brainer, but Namousi says developers often fail to make the most of deals because they're perhaps too sheepish.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The one thing I always would like developers to do is to just ask," he says, speaking to Game Developer at Gamescom 2024. "I think, especially in a new relationship, there's a bit of coyness maybe. A bit of uncertainty and insecurity. That exists in any new relationship, but as a publisher we really think of ourselves as at your service.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We have developers coming to us and asking completely random questions like 'hey, I've run into this antivirus program issue and I don't know how to handle it.' We can spend five hours researching how to tackle those issues. We have a network we can talk to. A lot of indie developers don't have that network of specialists and partners, so we can open new doors for them."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Namousi says nothing hurts more than watching developers suffer in silence-whether because of practical hurdles or contractual difficulties–purely because they were afraid to reach out and ask for help.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We have all these capabilities we can offer. I would love to see more braveness. Asking [questions]. Being vulnerable," he continues. So, what should developers be asking? He feels some of the biggest quandaries facing indies include deciding when to staff up, how to expand (should they hire freelancers or full-timers?), and how to manage projects that are ballooning.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Namousi feels publishers can offer "qualitative, situational advice in relation to their growth and how they should attack those issues." He agrees that deciding how, when, and indeed whether or not to scale is perhaps one of the biggest existential questions facing developers in the current climate, so there's no harm in sourcing another opinion.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"There's always this balance of 'should I [scale] before launch? Before I have secured my income. Before I have secured my income or know the sales trajectory of the game.' On the one hand, that's putting the cart before the horse," Namousi continues. He says that plan could work provided success follows, but if it doesn't? Well, you're going to be in a bind.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"That's why I think we can have these conversations–and also to tackle the financial aspects. 'Can [my publisher] help me get money? Can they provide the money for that or not? These are all very situational, complex conversations we should be having."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">You can hear more from Namousi and other industry experts in the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/patch-notes-2-how-does-the-game-industry-survive-beyond-2025-">latest edition of Patch Notes</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, where we asked how developers can survive beyond 2025 in a fraught market.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">News Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a> has released a new trailer for the second season of Arcane. Season two of the acclaimed animated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a> spin-off is set to release later this year, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-now-describes-arcane-season-two-as-the-final-chapter">will conclude the series</a> (something that is deeply disappointing).</p>
<p>That said, if this trailer is anything to go by, it sure seems like the show is going out with a bang. With explosions, dialogue such as "I want to tear that laugh from her throat forever" and a backing track that is sure to leave you feeling pumped up for the afternoon ahead, this trailer has nicely whetted appetites for the upcoming season. It focuses on Jinx, Vi and Caitlyn's rivalry, although there is a distinct lack of Jayce and Viktor. We also get a proper glimpse of Singed and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arcane-season-two-teaser-reveals-a-big-new-character-and-sets-fan-tongues-wagging">a bit more of Warwick</a>.</p>
<p>"Watch it all burn," Netflix says in the description. Oh, I am sure we will. You can check out the trailer below.</p>

<p>Arcane's second season has been in the works for several years now, with the show first making its Netflix debut back in 2021. The first season told the story of sisters Jinx and Vi, each caught on different sides of a conflict between the rich city of Piltover and the oppressed underground city of Zaun.</p>
<p>Our Chris called the series "a thrill, full of welcome colour and life" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arcane-act-1-review-riots-glossy-animated-netflix-series-opens-with-a-striking-if-familiar-bang">Eurogamer's Arcane season one review</a> (which was based on the first four episodes), although he still had a few reservations. Following its debut, Arcane subsequently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/acclaimed-league-of-legends-animated-show-arcane-wins-an-emmy-for-outstanding-animated-program">won the Emmy for Outstanding Animated Program</a>.</p>
<p>Arcane's second season is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-confirms-arcane-season-two-will-launch-in-november-2024">set to air this November</a>. Other animated video game-related shows also coming to the streaming service in the future include <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-netflix-show-will-help-lara-deal-with-her-grief-so-she-can-finally-start-working-on-other-sht">Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflixs-next-animated-witcher-movie-will-star-doug-cockle-as-geralt">The Witcher: Sirens of the Deep</a> and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecraft-animated-series-announced-for-netflix">Minecraft series</a>.</p></div>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/god-save-birmingham-preview-a-fun-twist-on-the-zombie-genre.972825/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/god-save-birmingham-preview-fun-twist-on-zombie-genre<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I've been over zombies for quite a while, after consuming far too many season of <em>The Walking Dead</em> for my own good. Still, I'm always open for new ideas featuring zombies, and <em>God Save Birmingham</em> looks like it might just be the thing to reinvigorate my interest in the genre.</p>
<p>We got some hands-on time with Ocean Drive Studios' <em>God Saves Birmingham </em>at PAX West 2024. I was told it's been in development for just five months, but there's a solid foundation for something big with the ideas at play here.</p>

<h2>Medieval Zombies in <em>God Save Birmingham</em>!?</h2>
<p>It's medieval Birmingham, and the year is roughly 1340. You wake up and find your town is full of zombies. You don't have modern firearms or any technology to speak of, just whatever existed in 1340. How is one to survive? Well, you can start by grabbing that pitchfork on the wall, snag some food, and hope for the best.</p>
<p>I'm sure there's media out there that have explored the idea, but medieval zombies feels fresh, especially with such a focus on historical accuracy. Ironic, I know, since zombies aren't historically accurate, but one developer at Ocean Drive Studios explained to me the vision of this title, and I can't help but get excited.</p>
<p>The town of Birmingham is being faithfully recreated to how it would look hundreds of years ago. The developers are looking at actual buildings from that time period and putting them into <em>God Save Birmingham</em>. Here's another super intriguing idea: There's only as many zombies as there were people in 1340 Birmingham.</p>

<p>Records of the town's population vary, but Ocean Drive plans to add around 1900 to 2000 zombies and that's all there is. Though, not all zombies are the same, as some will be clad in armor, for example.</p>
<p>My demo was considered pre-Alpha, showing the progress and concepts at play. The town of Birmingham is coming along and certainly looks like how one would imagine a medieval village. <em>God Save Birmingham</em>'s demo included tons of items to pick up, as this is a survival title. Eggs, bread, cheese, meat, various weapons and the like will come in handy.</p>
<p>You'll contend with meters for hunger, exhaustion, and thirst -- it's not my favorite thing to have in a game, but for hardcore survival enthusiasts, I'm sure this will hit the spot. I'm most interested in how Ocean Drive will expand the combat, since what I saw led to some hilarious (and horrifying) moments.</p>

<p><em>God Save Birmingham</em> has this "de-limbing" system, as I'll call it. Aim your pitchfork at a zombies arms, and it'll fall off. Do that to any other limb and you're met with a similar result. I ended up creating this horrifying legless, armless zombie and it still tried to crawl and bite me!</p>
<p>There's a physics system that's also pretty goofy, so when you get swarmed by zombies, your body is contorting in weird ways to get out of their grip. <em>God Save Birmingham </em>is still early on in development, but if these details are improved upon, it's going to be a blast to play.</p>
<p>I'm looking forward to <em>God Save Birmingham</em>'s development, but it's a long way off. Nonetheless, I was told armor can prevent zombies from biting you, you'll be able to use swords, shields, and other medieval weapons. There's even a story with multiple endings. Sounds like some good ol' fashioned zombie-slaying fun, if you ask me.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/state-of-decay-2-updates-to-end-later-this-year.972822/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/state-of-decay-2-updates-ending<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Undead Labs has announced that the next major&nbsp;<em>State of Decay 2&nbsp;</em>update will be the game's last as the studio pivots towards working on&nbsp;<em>State of Decay 3</em>, but don't worry -&nbsp;<em>State of Decay 2&nbsp;</em>isn't going anywhere.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.stateofdecay.com/an-end-to-content-updates-for-state-of-decay-2/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">news post on the game's official website</a>, Undead Labs says that&nbsp;<em>State of Decay 2</em>'s Update 38 will be its "final update", and that it'll "fix some longstanding issues", bring extra quality-of-life improvements, and "permanently unlock seasonal or otherwise previously-gated content".</p>
<p>Additionally, although updates and content drops for&nbsp;<em>State of Decay 2&nbsp;</em>are coming to an end, that doesn't mean the game itself is shutting down. Undead Labs says that whether you own the game or you're playing on Game Pass,&nbsp;<em>State of Decay 2&nbsp;</em>will "continue to be available".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/state-of-decay-2-updates-ending-car.jpg?itok=h7vmoyV6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/state-of-decay-2-updates-ending-car.jpg?itok=3BnS9YUc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>State of Decay 2&nbsp;</em>is driving off into the sunset, so to speak.</figcaption></figure><p>With that said, Undead Labs does say it "won't be creating new content or supporting"&nbsp;<em>State of Decay 2&nbsp;</em>after Update 38, so if something does go wrong, it might not get fixed.</p>
<p>Bounties from the Bounty Broker will continue to cycle, and all of your saved games and communities won't be affected. However, if you do find a bug that's messing up your game after the shutdown, Undead Labs says it won't accept bug reports, so you're on your own.</p>
<p>We don't have a release date for Update 38 yet, but Undead Labs says it's coming "later this year". There may also be "at least one hotfix" following the update, but only if Undead Labs deems it necessary.</p>

<p>Undead Labs closes out its FAQ by commenting on&nbsp;<em>State of Decay 3</em>, which was first announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/state-of-decay-3-shambles-on-to-xbox-series-x">all the way back in 2020</a>&nbsp;(and which we also got to see more of during this year's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/every-xbox-showcase-2024-announcement">Xbox showcase in June</a>).</p>
<p>Per Undead Labs, more info about the game and its release will be shared "at a later time", which isn't much to go on, admittedly. In the meantime, you can check out&nbsp;<em>State of Decay 2&nbsp;</em>on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/495420/State_of_Decay_2_Juggernaut_Edition/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/state-of-decay-2" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox One</a> (and on Xbox Series X|S via backwards compatibility).</p>

And though <em>Rings of Power</em> has been mostly successful in focusing its runtime on the strongest stories (Galadriel and the elves’ fight against Sauron and The Stranger’s quest for self-discovery), it can still feel a bit spread thin as it tries to cram in tales of the dwarves and humans of Middle-earth. But this latest episode feels like it’s truly starting to pull them all together in a sensible way, and often does so with a playful glint in its eye that feels so decidedly Tolkien, capturing the same giddy, childlike wonder that Peter Jackson so effectively imbued his films with. </p><figure id="" data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Though there is a lot of proper drama and spookiness going on in this episode (including a scary trek through some haunted woods and the capture of Galadriel by Orc leader Adar), two storylines stood out to me: The Stranger’s quest to reunite with Nori and Poppy, and the Harfoots encountering the other race of hobbits, Stoors. </p><p>The Stranger, having conjured up a dust tornado to ward off attackers, is wandering the lands in search of the two missing girls when he stumbles upon a goat. He follows that goat to a hut, and sitting in front of it is a man humming gently to himself. When he tries to get his attention, the man turns and swiftly throws a branch at his face. The plucky music only adds to the scene’s playfulness, and it soon becomes clear exactly who The Stranger has just met: Tom Bombadil, the iconic and mysterious <em>Lord of the Rings</em> character who has seemingly lived longer than anyone else in this world. Bombadil is played brilliantly by Rory Kinnear, who imbues him with a kind of absentminded sageness that is a joy to watch. Seeing him play off of Daniel Weyman’s stranger has the lightheartedness and fun that you’d expect from any Gandalf scene in the original films. There’s whimsy, there’s wonder, there’s wisdom—I couldn’t stop smiling anytime the two of them were on screen.<br></p><p>It’s clear that Bombadil has incredible power and that The Stranger is meant to learn quite a bit from him, though getting information out of the notoriously spacey, singsongy character might be difficult. He keeps trying to get answers about the star map they’ve been following this entire time, but Bombadil turns the map into a loaf of bread, and hands it to The Stranger to eat. And rather than give him concrete facts or advice, he can’t stop waxing poetic about the sands of time, saying: “Tom was there before the river and the trees, Tom remembers the first raindrop and the first acorn. He knew the dark under the stars when it was fearless. This whole place used to be green, now it’s all sand. I had to come see for myself to believe it.”<br></p><p>Eventually, The Stranger asks Bombadil if he’ll help him learn how to wield the kind of power he’s been casually throwing about (while Bombadil is adorably holding a baby goat). The Stranger wonders aloud if he was meant to meet Bombadil all along, rather than find a staff, then asks if it’s his task to face Sauron and the riders working for the dark wizard we’ve been seeing. He wants Bombadil’s help fighting against the darkness threatening to take over Middle-earth, but the hermit replies that he’s “a wanderer, not a warrior.” When The Stranger asks if it’s his task to stop the fire spreading through Middle-earth, or to stop Sauron, Bombadil replies solemnly, “Your task is to face them both.” It’s a powerful and poignant scene, which feels thoroughly Tolkien.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="0e8eaa11c9520bfe58cb4d466de7cf18" data-recommend-id="image://0e8eaa11c9520bfe58cb4d466de7cf18" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Merrimack holds a torch.

Though they quickly run into who they believe is another Harfoot who’s just been stealing water from a well. We get a hilarious back-and-forth between the three of them, with the newcomer (who first introduces himself as “nobody”) agreeing to take them to his village after Poppy threatens to turn him in for being a thief. He can bring them there, but he says they have to follow the four rules: “One, never look her in the eye. B, always stand three steps back, 4, don’t ever ever, no matter what call her the Gund,” he says solemnly. “Was that three rules or four?” Nori asks. “I wasn’t really paying attention,” Poppy quips.<br></p><p>It’s a hilarious and light scene that leads directly to the girls learning that there are other races of hobbits out there, known as Stoors. Though it seems that both of them come from the same ancestors. The Gund tells Nori that a man with the same last name as the Harfoot’s former leader set out from this place ages ago, searching for a land where cold water always ran through rivers, where a family “could dig a hole and live in it for a month.” She’s talking about the people who eventually become known as the Hobbits, the same ones who live in Bag End. It’s a lovely little connection to the <em>Lord of the Rings</em> we know and love, and it’s done so with a pitch-perfect tone that feels like sipping a warm cup of tea on a cold day.<br></p><p><em>The Rings of Power</em> season two episode four felt tonally perfect for a tale inspired by Tolkien, and it gave me a ton of hope for the rest of the season. The next episode airs on Amazon Prime on September 12. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>In the 18 months since its release, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/hogwarts-legacy-review-sleight-of-hand/1900-6418032/" data-ref-id="1900-6418032">Hogwarts Legacy</a> has emerged as one of the biggest hits of Warner Bros. Discovery's video game division. To date, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hogwarts-legacy-sells-22-million-copies-series-of-other-harry-potter-games-in-the-works/1100-6520172/" data-ref-id="1100-6520172">24 million copies of the game</a> have been sold across all consoles and PC. Although a follow-up game hasn't been formally announced, WBD isn't being ambiguous about its plans. According to one executive with the company, getting a sequel to the Harry Potter-inspired title is at the top of WBD's wish list.</p><p>"[The video game industry] is, just like the film business, a hit-driven business," explained WBD CFO Gunnar Weidenfels via <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/warner-bros-discovery-cfo-hogwarts-legacy-sequel-1235991714/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Hollywood Reporter</a>. "Obviously a successor to Hogwarts Legacy is one of the biggest priorities in a couple years down the road."</p><p>Weidenfels didn't offer any other details about a potential Hogwarts Legacy sequel, but his remarks seem to indicate that the next game is still years away at the earliest. The original game was developed by Avalanche Software and the story was set roughly a century before the life of Harry Potter. Players were given the freedom to create their own characters, who are students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and that proved to be very enticing to action RPG gamers.</p><p>Unfortunately, like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/harry-potter-tv-series-aiming-to-release-in-2026/1100-6521317/" data-ref-id="1100-6521317">the upcoming Harry Potter TV series</a> on HBO, Hogwarts Legacy has been haunted by franchise creator J.K. Rowling's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/jk-rowlings-anti-transgender-stance-and-hogwarts-legacy/1100-6501632/" data-ref-id="1100-6501632">anti-trans views</a>, which she reiterated as recently as the Paris Olympics. Rowling's stance has put her at odds with several of the actors from the Harry Potter films, as well as a large number of her fans. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/balancing-creativity-and-deadlines-in-game-development<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In game development, striking a balance between creativity and deadlines is a challenge that every team faces sooner or later. We’re all passionate about building worlds, crafting stories, and pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in games, but we also have to think about the business side — staying on budget, hitting milestones, and ultimately delivering a game that not only excites gamers but also meets financial goals so that we can make more games after. It’s a constant juggling act — keeping the creative spark alive while ensuring we don’t miss our delivery dates. This isn’t just a project management issue; it’s about finding a workflow where creativity doesn’t end up being a luxury we can’t afford. The reality is, if we don’t get this balance right, it can lead to a host of issues including projects that never see the light of day. And that’s something every developer wants to avoid.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="1. Establish Clear Milestones and Goals">1. Establish Clear Milestones and Goals</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">to avoid scope creep and create engaging experience</span></p><div data-testid="content-paragraph"><p><span data-testid="content-text">To keep a game development project on track, especially when balancing creativity with deadlines, it's crucial to set clear, actionable milestones with specific deliverables. Breaking the project into distinct stages not only helps maintain momentum but also ensures that each aspect of the game is developed in harmony.</span></p><p><span data-testid="content-text">Here’s how a typical game development project might be structured:</span></p></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Setting clear, actionable milestones from the start is key, but it’s just as important to approach these milestones with an iterative mindset. By developing features incrementally and refining them through successive iterations, you ensure that each part of the game is tested, polished, and well-integrated.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This Agile approach allows for flexibility, enabling the team to adapt to feedback and changing requirements without derailing the project. Regular reviews of progress help keep everyone aligned and address any roadblocks early.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="2. Prioritize Features and Content">2. Prioritize Features and Content</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">to make gamer’s experience excellent.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><br><span data-testid="content-text">In game development, you can't include everything. Prioritizing features and content from the start ensures that the core experience is solid, even if time runs short.</span></p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ">●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span>Core Features First.</span> Start with the critical features that define your game. Ask yourself: What does this game need to have for gamers to fall in love with it? Focus your team’s efforts on these essential elements first — anything else can be added later if time allows.</h4><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ">●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span>Rank Features. </span>Once core features are locked in, rank the rest by how much they contribute to the core experience. This helps ensure that the most impactful non-essential features are prioritized next, while less critical ones can be pushed down the list.</h4><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="3. Foster a Collaborative Environment">3. Foster a Collaborative Environment</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">to stimulate creative contributions and enhance empathy</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The collaborative environment goes beyond just teamwork — it’s about ensuring that creative ideas are nurtured without losing sight of business objectives.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Through</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> Open Communication</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> teams can discuss both creative ideas and their practical implications early on. For instance, if a proposed visual effect could delay the timeline, this should be openly addressed, allowing the team to weigh its value against the project’s constraints.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Cross-Disciplinary Collaboration</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is critical for different departments to understand each other’s limitations and strengths. Suppose the design team proposes a highly detailed environment that could strain the game engine. The programming team might suggest alternative optimization techniques, such as level of detail (LOD), to achieve the visual quality without compromising performance or exceeding memory budgets. Involving marketing early also aligns the game’s unique features with market demands, blending creativity with commercial strategy.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Regular Check-Ins</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> serve as recalibration points, where teams reassess the balance between creative goals and business needs. If a visual standard threatens to push the project over budget, these meetings offer a chance to simplify or cut non-essential features, keeping the project on track without sacrificing core quality.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="4. Allocate Time for Creative Exploration">4. Allocate Time for Creative Exploration</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">to enhance performance and reduce stress</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Integrating creative exploration into the development process can be achieved through structured Agile practices that align with both technical goals and business needs.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Scheduled Creative Time</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> can be formalized within the Agile framework, often through the use of designated </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Innovation Sprints</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>, </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">which emphasizes rapid prototyping, testing, and iteration within a defined time</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>,</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> or </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Sprint Zero</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> periods, that refers to a preparatory phase before the actual development sprints begin. These sprints allow team members to focus on creative and technical experimentation without the immediate pressure of deliverables. They also serve as a risk management tool, allowing to assess the feasibility of new ideas before committing significant resources.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Encouraging Breaks and side projects</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> can be managed through </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>20% Time</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> policy also known as </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Innovation Time Off </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">—</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">the</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">approach used by Google. It allows employees to dedicate 20% of their work hours — equivalent to one day a week — to pursue projects of their choice that are not directly related to their primary job responsibilities.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">From a business perspective, these side projects can often lead to unexpected innovations that may be later incorporated into the main project. For instance, a developer’s side project exploring new rendering techniques could lead to performance optimizations or visual enhancements that benefit the entire game.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="5.

Balance Workload and Avoid Burnout</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">to make sure each member is satisfied</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">By avoiding overly optimistic timelines, teams reduce the risk of having to spend extra time and ensure that quality is not compromised in the rush to meet deadlines.

Agile methodologies, such as Scrum, provide tools to create more realistic timelines by breaking down the project into manageable sprints with clearly defined goals. By using techniques like Velocity Tracking, teams can measure their actual progress over time, which helps in predicting future output more accurately. This data-driven approach refers to the process of measuring the speed at which a game development team is delivering features, bug fixes, and other work items.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Monitoring Work Hours maintains a productive team. But it’s important to track not just the hours worked but the intensity of those hours. Platforms like Retrospectives offer space to discuss work hours and identify if the team is at risk of burnout. Such tools are designed to facilitate retrospective meetings where team members reflect on their performance. If certain members are consistently overworked, it can be a sign that tasks need to be reallocated or that the team’s velocity is overestimated.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Supporting Wellbeing ensures that team members feel healthy and remain engaged. It includes offering resources such as Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs), access to mental health professionals, or encouraging regular physical activity.</span></p></div></li></ul></div><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="6.

This feedback is then analyzed and directly informs the next sprint, ensuring quick, targeted adjustments.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As development progresses, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>External Playtests</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and beta phases involve a wider audience, with telemetry data and community feedback highlighting areas for improvement, such as level difficulty or gamer retention issues. These insights drive focused iterations that keep the game on track and aligned with gamer expectations.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">After each playtest, whether internal or external, feedback is used to guide the next sprint. For example, testers may find a specific gameplay mechanic too difficult; this feedback is quickly incorporated into the development process, with tasks created to address specific issues in the next iteration. By consistently looping feedback back into the sprint cycles, teams can refine mechanics and polish features based on actual gamer interactions.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Balancing creativity and deadlines in game development demands strategic prioritization, collaboration, and iterative feedback. By fostering open communication, realistic scheduling, and continuous playtesting, teams can navigate development challenges while staying in timelines. Flexibility allows for adapting to unforeseen issues without compromising quality. Ultimately, achieving this balance delivers a polished experience that meets gamer’s expectations. This approach ensures that the final product resonates with audience, leading to lasting engagement and success in the market.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro is going to be revealed early next week, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>Lunatic Ignus, who proved to be a somewhat reliable leaker in the past few months, correctly revealing, among other things, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-4ZM3jxhdE">May's State of Play</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-dlc-expansions/">Black Myth: Wukong expansions</a> before the official announcements, revealed today on their Discord server that the mid-generation refresh system from Sony is getting revealed next week, possibly on Tuesday or Wednesday. The console's reveal will be followed by a State of Play presentation later in the month, which will feature first-party games and potentially a "world premiere", although there's the chance this premiere may be set for this year's The Game Awards in December.</p>

<p>Though the reveal timings are still unknown, there's little doubt that Sony is gearing up for the release of the PlayStation 5 Pro. Last week, well-known leaker billbil-kun revealed they managed to take a look at the system's packaging, releasing <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-design-reveal/">a sketch</a> showcasing the new system's design. During Gamescom last month, developers <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-was-an-open-secret-at-gamescom-2024/">openly talked about the system</a> as well, so, at this point, it's only a matter of when the console will be revealed and released.</p>
<p>Despite the original system launching in two different editions, there's a good chance that only a PlayStation 5 Pro digital edition will be released. This would help Sony <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-digital-model-price/">keep the price down</a>, as the Japanese company seems to be having trouble containing the production costs, as highlighted by the recent base model's price increase in Japan.</p>

						<h5>Astro Bot</h5><p><span>September 6, 2024</span>
					</p></div><div>
							<h5>Publisher</h5><p><span>Sony Interactive Entertainment</span>
						</p></div></div></div>
					<p><span>Team Asobi has been out there making names for themselves as creators of perhaps Sony’s most iconic mascot in recent years. While Astro Bot himself has only been around across two PlayStation platforms, he’s rapidly become the face of Sony Interactive Entertainment for anything with than a Mature rating to which Kratos or Ellie might hold those honors for the age rating. Now the third title featuring Astro Bot is finally here in a 3D platformer of the same name and he’s brought a few hundred friends along with him.</span></p>
<p><span>While Astro Bot’s last adventure through Astro’s Playroom served as a tech demo and advertising piece for the unique features of the Sony PlayStation 5, the hero’s <a href="https://wccftech.com/astro-bot-ditched-open-world-design-to-provide-optimal-variety/">latest adventure</a> is more of a celebration of the past thirty years of Sony heritage. Despite Sony’s recent doubling-down on live service or mature cinematic centerpieces, there are still decades of mascot characters that helped propel the PlayStation into the household name it is today. The hundred-plus cameo bots aren’t limited to just Sony’s single-party output. There are collectible characters of everything from Vib-Ribbon to Shin Megami Tensei Persona 4 to even Bandai Namco’s Klonoa series. Having Mature-rated protagonists the likes of Raziel and Kain right alongside Katamari Damacy’s Prince or the black-furred mascot cats can be quite the culture shock in a children’s game, but Astro Bot really is about bringing together the five-console lineage, even if so many of these mascots don’t call PlayStation the only place to play.</span></p>
<p><span>Astro Bot can punch, run, and jump to solve most of his problems, but each playable stage brings a new gimmick to utilize, typically in the form of a unique collectible. In one stage, Astro Bot might call in his DualSense-shaped airship to navigate through some narrow corridors (which happens in quite a few levels) or knock out a rogue bot to unlock a chest bearing some new ability for that stage. In the last level I replayed as I was penning this review, Astro collected a pair of frog-faced gauntlets that would launch out on spring-loaded arms and punch enemies away from a safe range away from any spiky bits while also being resilient enough to withstand being punched into a bar of pink sticky goo and used to swing Astro across pits.&nbsp;</span></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/ASTRO-BOT_20240902104127-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p><span>Everything that Astro Bot touches is filled with whimsy and amusement. The titular hero’s every animation is tinged with a sickeningly sweet charisma, from the way he carries himself throughout the stage on his own two feet or floating through the air via his high-tech jet back, going a few rounds to knock out rogue bots, and the idle animations that are unique to each level. All of the backdrop and tertiary characters of Astro Bot similarly share that wonder and charm and even the simple interactions between one mascot bot to another would never fail to put a smile on my face. Despite the serious unspoken story of having an alien hijack your PlayStation 5 rocket ship and disassemble it across the entire galaxy, each denizen of the galaxy, both synthetic and organic, lives their best carefree lives even when Astro Bot is about to bounce on their heads to reach some out-of-sight cache of coins or puzzle pieces.</span></p>
<p><span>Each stage brings a new gimmick or ability to pick up and use along with their own set of collectibles. On their own, each stage of Astro Bot can easily be cleared in less than ten minutes with a majority of collectibles obtained, if not all. For those that might have missed a bot to recover for the homeward bound crews, at the start of each level replay is an optional perk that can be purchased. Costing 200 coins (which may sound like a lot, but that’s equal to two pulls on the in-game gacha machine and could easily be recouped in a single mission playthough), players can acquire a bird companion that follows Astro Bot around and chirps when there is a hidden collectible about. I won’t deny that I used this feature on a few times, especially in instances where there may be a one-way path that essentially blocks off backtracking to find that one missing collectible.</span></p>
<p><span>There are moments in Astro Bot where the challenge doesn’t quite match the childlike wonder that Team Asobi is going for. With no difficulty options or ways to mitigate incoming damage, taking a single hit brings both Astro Bot and the player back to their previous checkpoint, leaving all of those hard-earned coins behind to be collected once more (thankfully, any proper collectibles such as puzzle pieces and fellow bots are retained between checkpoints). Astro Bot is generous in its checkpointing that players won’t necessarily have to lose more than two or three minutes at a time, but for stages with tricky back-to-back platforming segments or extended encounters against a large wave of hostile foes, Astro Bot can be an exercise in frustration for younger players not accustomed to the more challenging 3D platformers out there.</span></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/ASTRO-BOT_20240902182449-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p><span>Much like Astro’s Playroom showcased what the DualSense could accomplish in players' hands for the first time, Team Asobi has designed Astro Bot to take full use of the controller with an additional four years of time to learn about the tactile capabilities. Every step the hardy little robot takes is translated to the player through both vibration and audio response from the integrated speaker. There’s a distinctive enough sensation to each material that you can easily close your eyes and feel the difference between running across grass and a cobblestone trail. All of these added sensations come at a cost, however, as the DualSense’s already minimal battery life and be cut down to the point where players might have to swap controllers to charge in the middle of an afternoon session.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/astro-bot/">Astro Bot’</a>s soundtrack, while charming with its various arrangements of the main vocal theme and leitmotifs sprinkled throughout, is one of the few low points to the whole package. There are only so many ways to sing-speak the words Astro Bot and make them sound unique and upbeat without becoming grating to the ears. That being said, Kenny Young has still recreated the magic of Astro’s Playroom with a few earworms that will stick with you long after hitting Rest Mode on your PlayStation 5.</span></p>

<p>As one of the few platformers to keep me grinning from beginning to end, Astro Bot is some of the most fun I've had working on a review all year. There's a profound sense of whimsy and wonder to everything that plucky little robot can do while the worlds he visits inhabit such a diverse set of environments and abilities. Astro Bot's adventure still may be far from over, but this time he's brought a few hundred friends along for the journey.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/black-myth-wukong-expansion-sales-18m<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>sales have apparently reached a staggering 18 million, and there's also a DLC expansion in the works for the game, according to a new report.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-05/investor-who-risked-it-all-on-wukong-scores-another-sales-win" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Bloomberg</a>, the game managed to reach 18 million sales "in two weeks", although it's not clear whether that's a firm milestone or whether the two or three extra days since&nbsp;<em>Wukong</em>'s release count towards that tally.</p>
<p>Bloomberg's piece takes the form of an interview with investor Daniel Wu, who's one of&nbsp;<em>Wukong&nbsp;</em>developer GameScience's biggest investors (along with his company Hero Games). It's Wu that confirms the existence of an expansion, although he doesn't say what it'll be or when it'll launch.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/black-myth-wukong-expansion-sales-fight.jpg?itok=G88vKqi- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/black-myth-wukong-expansion-sales-fight.jpg?itok=ylN9mGWz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>'s tale is not over yet.</figcaption></figure><p>Given that&nbsp;<em>Wukong&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/black-myth-wukong-sales-10-million">hit ten million sales</a> just three days after its launch, that means it's picked up another eight million in the intervening weeks, which constitutes a pretty steady performance. No wonder it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/steam-37m-user-milestone-wukong">helped Steam to cross a user milestone</a> a week or so after its release.</p>
<p>The Bloomberg article also states that&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>'s budget was around $70 million, a large chunk of which Wu himself apparently contributed. By way of comparison,&nbsp;<em>Marvel's Spider-Man 2</em>, a game that had sold <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ps5-sales-pass-548-milion-units-marvels-spider-man-2-has-sold-10-million-copies">around 10 million copies</a> at last count, reportedly cost a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2023/12/21/a-300-million-spider-man-2-budget-sonys-future-and-aaa-unsustainability/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">staggering $300 million</a> to make.</p>
<p>Bloomberg also brings up the infamous streaming guidelines outlined by Hero Games that requested streamers refrain from discussing "feminist propaganda", as well as other topics like COVID-19, when streaming&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>. Wu "declined to comment on the matter", according to Bloomberg.</p>

<p><em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>is available to play right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2358720/Black_Myth_Wukong/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/black-myth-wukong/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>.&nbsp;An Xbox Series X|S version of the game was reportedly also in the works, but the status of that version has been called into question recently; an <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-xbox-delay-due-to-sony-exclusivity-deal-not-tech-issues-according-to-source" rel="noopener" target="_blank">IGN report</a> says that the delay is due to an "exclusivity deal with Sony".</p>
<p>Microsoft's <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/09/03/microsoft-confirms-black-myth-wukong-delay-not-due-to-platform-limitations-comments-on-exclusivity/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">only comment</a> on&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>'s Xbox delay is that it isn't due to "Xbox platform limitations that have been raised to us". The plot thickens. Stay tuned for more, and in the meantime, you can <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/black-myth-wukong-review-serious-monkey-business">read my review of&nbsp;<em>Wukong&nbsp;</em>here</a> to find out why it's so darn good.</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/astro-bot-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/astro-bot-review.972774/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/astro-bot-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>I can now die knowing that I've blasted bubbles of honey into the air using an elephant’s trunk, jumped up on them to reach the top of a triple-stack of chickens hiding in eggs, and then sucked the yolk out of said eggs using that same trunk. In other words, I can now die happy. For 30 years, Sony has given us a vast library of top-quality PlayStation games, but there has never been a mascot platformer among them to rival the heights that Nintendo’s Mario regularly reaches. Crash Bandicoot tried. Jak and Daxter had a decent run. Even Knack had a go, bless him. Now, though, a true contender has arrived. Packed with dozens of colourful levels and experimental abilities, Astro’s latest outing thrusts him onto centre stage, joined by a supporting cast of PlayStation’s past heroes to provide hours of pure joy. Bursting to the seams with charm, Astro Bot is an inventive, nostalgia-fuelled platformer of the highest order.</p><p>If 2020’s Astro's Playroom was like a museum – albeit one with fun playable exhibits – Astro Bot is like a theme park, throwing a new thrill at you around every corner and after every double-jumped gap. It doesn’t always deliver the bonkers creativity that drives the likes of Super Mario Galaxy and Odyssey, but that's hardly damning criticism when swings of that size are rarely taken outside of Nintendo's walls. What developer Team Asobi has designed here, though, does successfully evoke the spirit of those great platformers by birthing novel stages full of visual flourish that never cross the line into becoming mere novelties.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Astro Bot Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>A handful of the many standouts are a time-bending casino, a Japanese bathhouse-inspired level with a humorous sponge system that's soaked in fun, and a smart level in which the floors and walls dynamically shift depending on whether a day or night button has been pressed – that last one in particular features a fantastic use of 3D space while also feeling like a page torn straight out of the Fez playbook. Astro Bot really is the video game equivalent of venturing through Willy Wonka's chocolate factory; a delightful concoction of experimentation and joy, just without the child endangerment. Chocolate death pipes and fizzy lifting drinks are instead swapped out for sinkholes leading to treasure and an inflatable friend who helps you reach floating platforms. </p><p>It even feels like some popping candy has smuggled its way into your controller as it fizzes and pings away, sweetly reacting to whatever is happening on screen. Astro Bot is a showcase for the DualSense's bells and whistles unlike anything since, well... Astro's Playroom at the PS5’s launch. Triggers tighten in your fingers and rumbles are sent through your thumbs. Raindrops tickle your palms. I found my whole body involuntarily drifting from side to side as I guided Astro's ship with the motion controls. I'd also recommend turning your controller speaker volume up if, like me, you have it muted by default – you'll be missing out on some fantastic audio flourishes otherwise. And while there's nothing to quite rival the GPU earworm of four years ago (despite the best efforts of a giant singing tree), the music is a consistent delight throughout.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Most levels are fairly linear, but some go the extra mile and are enjoyably knotty.</p></div><p>That soundtrack scores levels that seem simple at first, but soon unfurl themselves to reveal tantalising depths and secrets. Most are fairly linear, but some go the extra mile and are enjoyably knotty, providing sandbox-like areas to hunt for collectibles in. There’s never the openness found in the large-by-comparison Mario Odyssey levels, but enough nooks and crannies to get stuck into nonetheless. There are even whole extra levels to find within levels, with warp points hidden like buried treasure that jet you off to new locations in the "Lost Galaxy". I'm a big fan of this Russian doll structure and the way it introduces new lands. It ensures a constant supply of surprises throughout Astro Bot’s roughly nine-hour duration.</p><p>Some of those biggest unexpected treats are the new powers that Astro gets along his journey. The basic movement of our little robot pal is great, with his jump, double jump, and hover hitting that sweet spot between floaty and finely tuned. But it’s the temporary abilities that come with each level that make things truly exciting. The Twin Frog gloves are a particular favourite, with their sticky tongues flinging out to provide a grapple swing option. They're also spring-loaded, meaning any incoming projectiles can be sent back from whence they came, exploding in an enemy’s face. I also very much enjoyed the mouse mechanic, which reduces you down to a super small size, effectively turning on a "Toy Story" mode that lets you clamber up oversized shelves and leaves in search of secrets.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Even powers from previous Astro adventures are reinvented to great effect. For example, the Monkey Climber is an evolution of Playroom's climbing ability, but the assistance of a small robotic ape with huge hands this time means rocks can be hurled and ground pounded to great delight. Laurels are never rested on either, with new ideas and gadgets introduced right up to the final encore. Although some mechanics are reused a little more than I’d like, when such powers are recycled in later levels they're thankfully recontextualised and given slightly new uses. The aforementioned Twin Frog gloves, for instance, are reintroduced in a cave-like level, where their grapple-swinging ability comes into its own even further, encouraging you to pull worm-like enemies out of the ground from afar. </p><p>Outside of bosses and minibosses, there initially doesn't appear to be a great range in enemy types. Sure, some are coated in different colours of paint or dressed to fit in with their surroundings, but they are all vanquished via the same few fundamental jump and hit combos. Later on, though, the design book opens up and introduces some of my favourite foes. These include an anthropomorphic playing card that flings a hand of clubs and spades your way, which you can then jump on to make your way towards the enemy to deal a killing blow of your own.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It’s light touches of irony and slapstick humour that keep Astro’s playful tone going throughout.</p></div><p>Much friendlier faces can be found frequently, though. Over 150 of them in fact, as characters from PlayStation's vast library of games have made their way into Astro's world in the form of other bots. There are the ones you'd expect like Lombaxes, tomb raiders, and a certain rapping dog but, delightfully, some are plucked from the more obscure end of the scale. Mister Mosquito, here’s looking at you kid. You’ll never know where you’ll find them either. For example, you’ll rescue everyone's favourite tactical espionage action hero from the unfamiliar surroundings of Creamy Canyon – a dessert-based land dressed in sprinkles that’s a far cry from the steel and snow of Shadow Moses. It’s light touches of irony and slapstick humour like this that keep Astro’s playful tone going throughout. It really is just a delight from start to finish in this regard.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><p><h3>Simon Cardy's Top 20 PlayStation Exclusives</h3></p></div><p>Many of the PlayStation characters appear as short, charming cameos, but a handful play fully-fledged supporting roles. I won't spoil who gets the star treatment here, aside from one – the previously revealed Kratos. His introduction sees you wield his ice-infused Leviathan axe and take on the role of the exiled Spartan himself in a thrilling change of pace, the frosty blade boomeranging around the level. It's here where Astro Bot becomes truly magical, elegantly blending nostalgia with new ideas. Such moments essentially let you play these iconic games in miniature, lending Astro their powers and letting him loose in a level entirely built around familiar stories and settings, soundtracked by remixes of heroic themes. They're charming and often the real highlight of the experience. I just wish there were one or two more of them, but perhaps I’m being greedy.</p><p>It’s clear from the very first frame of Astro Bot just how much love and reverence Team Asobi has for the history of Sony’s consoles and their library of games. You choose a new save file by selecting one of three original PlayStation memory cards and are then thrust into a scene taking place on your PS5-shaped mothership. In terms of story, well… it's light. That mothership crash lands on a desert planet after an evil alien attack, and Astro must now travel the galaxy searching for its missing parts and crewmates.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It’s clear from the very first frame of Astro Bot just how much love and reverence Team Asobi has for the history of Sony’s consoles.</p></div><p>But a deep story isn’t what you're here for, is it? Free from the now-standard PlayStation Studios themes of threatening apocalypses, familial woe, and coming-of-age pains, Astro Bot is all about following a cheery little metal bloke around on his adventures. That's not to say it won't spark an emotional response, though – not through any great feat of nuanced writing, but when bumping into ghosts of PlayStation past and greeting them like an old school friend you haven't seen in a decade.</p><p>The crash site hub world has its own areas to explore and is packed full of quirks, such as eventually letting you customise your ship and outfit. The gacha machine mechanic makes a particularly enjoyable return, providing a satisfying way to spend the thousands of coins you'll collect. The way it builds out the hub with memorabilia and miniature dioramas for the PlayStation-themed bots to adorably call home again proves a fun, tangible way of visualising your progress through the adventure, rather than simply watching numbers tick up on a screen. It's not brand-new for the series at this point, but still hits all the right spots.</p><p>I arrived at the end credits after nine hours but had only collected 206 out of a possible 301 bots on my journey. There’s plenty to do after the main levels are done, including finding the remainder of the crew, building out the rest of the hub base, and unearthing new secrets among the stars. There’s so much, in fact, that it took me another nine hours (so, 18 in total) to 100% Astro Bot and acquire the platinum trophy that comes with it. While I'd never say any of its main worlds ever approach being truly "difficult" in the pursuit of that 100% completion goal, some enemies or obstacles did take a few tries. Thankfully, checkpoints are often generously and frequently located, meaning you're only ever moments away from the spot of your previous demise. </p><p>An extra level of difficulty can be found in the semi-hidden trial-like stages found by exploring among the overworld's stars, though. These short sprints are littered with fast-moving objects, numerous enemies, and precise gaps to hop across that are designed to trip you up. Throw a complete lack of checkpoints into the mix as well, and these are easily some of the toughest tasks in Astro Bot, with a final level that’s a real tough nut to crack. It’s a non-stop gauntlet of quickfire threats that made me piece together everything I had learned up until that point in a frantic, but still fun test.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/astro-bot-review.972753/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/05/astro-bot-review/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>When <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/11/08/astros-playroom-review-the-first-game-you-should-play-on-playstation-5/">Astro Bot’s Playroom</a> was released, there was one resounding criticism: where is the full game? Effectively a tech demo that came preinstalled on all <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5s</a>, this sequel to the PSVR-exclusive Astro Bot Rescue Mission was all about showing off the new DualSense controller. Sure, the game was amazing, but it was a very strange use of the new mascot and face of PlayStation. We were all left wondering: when will it be Astro’s day in the sun? Well, that day is finally upon us, and it has been well worth the wait!</p>
<p><iframe title="Astro Bot - Launch Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/unYFdcEjV9k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Travelling through space on a flying PS5, having a great time, Astro’s ship is suddenly attacked by an alien who wants the console’s ultra high-tech innards for itself. Astro’s crew of 300 bots is scattered throughout the galaxy and the PS5 crashes on a desert planet.</p>


<p>But all hope is not lost. Astro is repaired by the Dual Speeder (your DualSense) and sets about exploring more than fifty planets across half a dozen galaxies, each time sending bots back to the desert planet which quickly becomes your home base with all the usual trimmings — the gatcha machine, costume changing and an all new animal safari park.</p>


<p>Each planet is a self-contained level and follows a different theme, some with cute nods to iconic franchises. Some of the bots you rescue are iconic in their own right, too — the level where you find Crash Bandicoot also has crates of Wumpa fruit and a platforming section that hits you right in the childhood.</p>
<p>Playing through the game with my wife next to me, I was excitedly explaining the core mechanics of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/11/03/god-of-war-ragnarok-review/">God of War Ragnarok</a>, when I was asked to freeze some water to make a platform. My excitement only grew with each additional nod and easter egg thrown in by Team Asobi.</p>

<p>From the jungles to sandy beaches, Halloween-inspired to winter-themed, the level design is breathtaking throughout. You can spend hours exploring each level, either on your own or with a partner or child who helps point out the interactive elements or collectables on screen. It really is impossible not to get sucked in and love every second of this game.</p>
<p>Outside of the core levels, there are additional bits of gameplay squirreled away, from an entire galaxy of secret, hidden planets to smaller (but incredibly tough) challenges found by crashing through an asteroid belt while flying between levels. Not only does this game reward exploration and play, it positively revels in it. I was not expecting to sit there for 15 minutes, with sweaty palms, trying to nail a perfectly timed platforming level with zero checkpoints, but that’s exactly what I did at one point. It reminded me of my time with the PS1 and I loved every second of it.</p>
<p>And none of this is to say anything about the sound and graphics. It is abundantly clear that not only is Astro the new and unrivalled PlayStation mascot, but he <em>is</em> PlayStation. The world he lives in is obsessed with PlayStation’s icons and lore, and his games show off every element of how powerful the latest console or periphery is.</p>

<p>There is no way, with all this in mind, that Astro Bot wasn’t going to be polished to within an inch of it’s life. It’s so clean that you can pretty much see your reflection in Astro’s face. The graphics are flawless, the audio is the same incredible set of earworms that you know and love from the previous titles, and the gameplay is simply exquisite.</p>
<p>As increasingly common, and very welcome,&nbsp;Team Asobi has put a lot of effort into accessibility with this release. The flying and gyro sections can be set to analogue sticks and there are various haptic and visual aids that can be set to make your time with Astro even easier.</p>
<p>And for those playing with younger kids, or those who don’t want the stress of combing every inch of a level for a hidden secret, you’ll be pleased to know that your second run of each level comes with an optional buddy — a mechanical bird that senses the collectables you’re missing and points them out when you’re near.</p>

			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 has seemingly entered full production, judging from some recent findings related to the Japanese company assembler.</p>
<p>As reported on X by David Gibson, Hosiden, the Nintendo assembler, is spending 2 billion yen on production equipment and one billion yen on automation in the third quarter of the current fiscal year for its major customer in amusement, suggesting the system has indeed entered full production.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">No-one seems to have noticed the Nintendo assembler- Hosiden is spending ¥2bn on production equipment and ¥1bn on automation in FY3/25 for its major customer in amusement (Nintendo). I still expect Sept news and March 2025 release for next device. <a href="https://t.co/APGEGGSyS8">pic.twitter.com/APGEGGSyS8</a></p>
<p>— David Gibson (@gibbogame) <a href="https://twitter.com/gibbogame/status/1831321550185959553?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 4, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Commenting on the news on the Gaming Leaks subreddit, well-known insider NateTheHate provided some additional information on the Nintendo Switch 2, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1f8upu3/comment/llhjx2t/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirming</a> that it will be backward compatible with the previous system.</p>
<p>Thankfully, it seems like it won't be long until we finally hear something concrete about the Nintendo Switch 2. <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-month/">Earlier this week</a>, Gamesindustry.biz's Christopher Dring revealed that industry whispers on the console indicate that something related to it is happening this month. While a full-blown reveal is unlikely, there's a good chance we will get the first look at the new system and learn its name.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 console has yet to be officially revealed. We will keep you updated on the system as soon as more come in on it, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/astro-bot-review-90s-platformer-done-right</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/astro-bot-review-a-90s-platformer-done-perfectly.972747/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/astro-bot-review-90s-platformer-done-right<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Astro Bot</em> has had a long history of showing off the best of what's new for the PlayStation. Whether it was being stuck inside a Dualshock 4 in<em> The Playroom</em> or letting you see the best the Dual Sense has to offer, Astro Bot was there. Now, in their own full-length adventure, does the fun and frantic platforming and nostalgia-driven antics of Astro Bot continue to hold up?</p>
<p>Join Astro and 300 other Astro Bots as they chart across the stars in their PlayStation 5-themed spaceship. It's not long before this merry voyage is interrupted by an alien who robs the PS5 of its major components forcing the spaceship to crashland flinging all but one Astro Bot out across a number of galaxies.</p>
<h2>Super <em>Astro Bot</em> Galaxy</h2>
<p><em>Astro Bot </em>is a 3D Platformer that takes heavy inspiration from the kind of 90s titles that made PlayStation the powerhouse it became.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/astro-bot-2024-exploration.jpg?itok=u_uHEgig 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/astro-bot-2024-exploration.jpg?itok=XzapqTzG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Dressed as a Yharnam hunter with a chicken on his back, no better way to be</figcaption></figure><p>Starting on a sandy hub planet with your wreck of a spaceship you'll need to set off to the stars. Visit galaxies filled with full and bite-sized levels to rescue your missing comrades. Many of these are just generic Astro Bots while many highlight popular franchises, first and third party.</p>
<p>Each level also has a secondary objective, puzzle pieces that open up new features in the hub world, and some levels have secret exits that lead you to bonus levels in a Lost Galaxy.</p>
<p>Like a scavenger hunt, you'll drop into these different worlds fighting off the strange robotic enemies and rescuing the Astro Bots. You'll be rewarded no matter what as you search every nook and cranny of the world.</p>
<p>Even if you don't find an Astro Bot or Puzzle Piece you'll obtain coins that can be spent to give your PlayStation-themed Astro Bots iconic props, or they can be spent making the collectibles you're missing easier to locate.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/astro-bot-2024-12.jpg?itok=IpIykkrK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/astro-bot-2024-12.jpg?itok=ZAtx019B 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Find references to the earliest PlayStation games, and some of the most recent</figcaption></figure><p>I've got a deep love for the classic PlayStation platformers, <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="8caa1e91-0b32-409c-ab3c-e548f9c0e4c0" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/spyro-reignited-trilogy-review-thank-you-for-remaking-me">Spyro </a>and <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="bcfb7c7e-b0e3-4c04-86a8-2454c4b35b43" href="https://techraptor.net/games/crash-bandicoot-4-its-about-time">Crash </a>among the top, so I loved how each level in <em>Astro Bot</em> is filled with colorful settings and creatures. As a fan of collectibles, I also appreciated how the game allows you to 100% complete each level on your first try.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Astro Bot </em>does a fantastic job leading players to missing collectibles, without taking the fun out of exploration. If a level has seven Astro Bots and you pick up the first two and then suddenly have the fourth one then you know that somewhere after the second one and where you currently are in the level is another Astro Bot needing your help.</p>
<p>This is a fantastic way to continue to prompt players to hunt around for secrets without them needing to leave the game or be given explicit instructions about where to go.</p>
<p>Each level is relatively short to get through, taking 10 or so minutes. This makes the game easy to pick up and put down, but will also keep you saying to yourself 'just one more level.'</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/astro-bot-2024-01.jpg?itok=4Dg6vGCT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/astro-bot-2024-01.jpg?itok=8LRErUF- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>From the hub you can clearly see what you need to collect, and what you're missing</figcaption></figure><p>Some of the smaller levels, especially those tied to the four face buttons of the PlayStation controller, offer some real challenge to fans of fast-paced platforming. You'll need to time together falling ice paths, swinging through hazards, and enemies out to get you to make it through.</p>
<p>Platforming as Astro Bot is an absolute joy. In his base form, you're able to run around as Astro Bot, jump, hover/glide with foot lasers, and throw a punch. Multiple levels add new abilities to Astro Bot's move set in fun and interesting ways.</p>
<p>The Monkey gives you two arms to reach for switches and climbing frames, the bulldog rockets you horizontally allowing you to reach new places, and the Chicken blasts you vertically.</p>
<h2><em>Astro Bot</em> Was And Is Once Again The Best Dual Sense Game</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/astro-bot-2024-playstation-5-ship.jpg?itok=PjTARc-E 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/astro-bot-2024-playstation-5-ship.jpg?itok=yqTKnJls 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Astro Bot and his 300 closest friends in a PlayStation 5 themed spaceship</figcaption></figure><p>Each of the additional move sets in Astro Bot uses the haptic triggers of the Dual Sense controller, and some like the Monkey arms while climbing even have you turning the Dual Sense left and right to shift Astro Bot's weight.</p>
<p>Outside of the power-ups, you'll also be using your Dual Sense's motion controls to play with the controller when collecting new Astro Bots and when flying through the air on your way to levels.</p>
<p>I'm normally not a fan of the Dual Sense's additional features, mostly feeling like they're thrown into a game for the sake of having them and not for any actual benefit to the game. Many implementations of 'Dual Sense for the sake of Dual Sense' give me the same feeling as when I watch a movie and see a character's hand reach towards the screen as a 'for 3D audiences' bit.</p>
<p>In <em>Astro Bot</em> including so many Dual Sense features makes sense through both Astro Bot's history of being used as a 'tech demo' and how little of a fourth wall the game has.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/astro-bot-2024-10.jpg?itok=ivv4GWjh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/astro-bot-2024-10.jpg?itok=u4c5EaHe 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Different powerups change the way you view levels​​​​​</figcaption></figure><h2>A Love Letter To PlayStation's History</h2>
<p>While <em>Astro Bot's PlayRoom</em> was a love letter to first-party franchises and PlayStation hardware throughout the years <em>Astro Bot </em>is a love letter to all PlayStation games. You'll be seeing cameo appearances and references to current franchises like <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="aaf36c90-022d-49fd-be7c-6257963b7a70" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/god-of-war-ragnarok-review-colossal-triumph-for-playstation"><em>God of War Ragnarok</em></a>, retro titles like <em>Parappa The Rapper</em>, as well as multi-platform titles with characters from <em><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a69def04-c856-4b18-b4a3-52e942001025" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/resident-evil-4-review">Resident Evil</a>, <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="b8ce497b-1186-45a3-8bd7-de90087162b1" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/street-fighter-6-review">Street Fighter</a>,</em> and way way more making their appearance.</p>
<p>After each Galaxy's boss fight, there are even special themed stages to a single franchise where you don't just get to experience the environment of a game, but new mechanics are introduced that allow Astro to really run a mile in another character's shoes.</p>
<p>The game knows how much it's dipping into the well of nostalgia, but it does it so well that it's hard not to smile at every reference you come across.</p>

Each game-themed Astro Bot has its own place in the hub world, normally grouped up with characters from the same game. Using the Gatcha mechanic you can also obtain different props for them.</p>
<p>Seeing Jax standing around is one thing, but you've got to make sure you unlock a mechanical Daxter for him too.</p>
<p>It's in the hub-world that you can also work together with your unlocked Astro Bots to reach new areas and open special eggs, filled with non-Astro Bot shaped references like Spyro the Dragon or a retro robot dog toy. While it was fun to see so many Astro Bots working together it did sometimes take an unnecessarily long amount of time for them to assemble. I know that 120 Astro Bots working together is a lot, but if I was able to call all of them at once I wouldn't be waiting for Astro Bot Atreus to catch up to complete the work.</p>

<p><em>Astro Bot</em> has managed to perfectly recreate what made 90s platformers so special. Fun and whimsical worlds are enjoyable to explore while they never overstay their welcome and a player's desire to hunt down secrets is rewarded in spades.</p>
<p>While it seems like a simple idea, to recreate classic platformers in this way, it really goes to show why <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="dcbdcd2f-299e-45a2-8ee4-ba546ca2774c" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/super-mario-odyssey-review-pure-joy">3D <em>Mario </em>games</a> have never faded from popularity, while other 3D platforming series have gone awry while trying to add too many features.</p>
<p>The <em>Astro Bot</em> players who will truly get everything out of this game will be those who have been with PlayStation since its beginning. Those who will see an Astro Bot based on <em>I.Q: Intelligent Qube</em> and have flashbacks to a strange game experience on a demo disc they haven't thought about in 25 years. It's a heartwarming trip down memory lane.</p>

<p>Danil ‘donk’ Kryshkovets has been tearing up the Counter-Strike 2 esports scene for a few months, despite being just seventeen years old. The Russian superstar has been turning heads for a while now, but recently, he took things to the next level, breaking the CS2 single-map kill record while playing in the ESL Pro League against Wildcard.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-huge-numbers">Huge Numbers</h2>



<p>In a series that could have gone either way, Donk found himself clutching up big time while flying the Team Spirit banner against Wildcard. It was a close enough finish with a scoreline of 13 – 11, but that game length only aided Donk in netting a whopping 38 kills on Ancient.</p>



<p>He pulled off 11 multi-kills and dominated almost every round – even the ones that Spirit was unfortunate enough to lose. This means that Donk is now in the number-one spot on the leaderboard, sitting one kill ahead of Lucas ‘Lucaozy’ Neves, who landed 37 kills in an online series against paiN.</p>



<p>It gets better, though.</p>



<p>Donk is now one of just two players to sit in the top-ten after landing this achievement in a LAN environment, and he’s the only player in the world to appear in the top-ten list <strong>twice</strong>. Against The Chosen Few (online), Donk was able to net 35 kills in one map.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>It was one hell of a series, and Donk was able to rack up an overall KD of 75 – 29 while also securing an ADR of 131.3. This is why there are expectations that he’ll be crowned the top Counter-Strike player of the year.</p>



<p>What do you think? Was this a lucky series or does Donk have it where it counts?</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Does Sony Need New IP, Or Can It Just Revive a Forgotten Franchise?]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/sony-new-ip-forgotten-franchise/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/does-sony-need-new-ip-or-can-it-just-revive-a-forgotten-franchise.972732/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/sony-new-ip-forgotten-franchise/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>At the same time that Concord collapsed in on itself in an epic fashion, Sony’s CFO said that the company was lacking IP. He said that across the board, in games, films, and anime, Sony doesn’t ‘have that much IP that we fostered from the beginning’. This statement comes as the outlook for PlayStation in particular dwindles somewhat.</p>



<p>We could be mere months away from the release of the PlayStation Pro, but the chief concern amongst players worldwide is that there aren’t really any games to make buying an upgraded console ‘worthwhile’.</p>



<p>With that being said, should Sony invest in creating new IP and risk another Concord scenario, or should it dip into the wealthy pool of somewhat forgotten franchises sitting on the back burner and bring back something with an existing fanbase?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-we-re-all-waiting">We’re All Waiting</h2>



<p>Plenty of PlayStation-centric franchises are quietly waiting in the wings, some of which have been abandoned for more than a decade. Could it be that a revitalisation of one or more of these sunsetted series might be enough to Make PlayStation Great Again?</p>



<p>From my wishlist, I’d do malicious things to see another Killzone game from Guerrilla, which abandoned the series in 2013 to focus on Horizon. As we see a rise in tactical shooters, perhaps another SOCOM game would be a good choice, or as everyone loves an apocalypse, why not reinvest in Resistance?</p>



<p>Soulslike games are doing phenomenally well, so perhaps Sony could flush some cash back into FromSoft’s pocket and produce a Bloodborne follow-up (or even a remaster).</p>



<p>Superheroes and ‘enhanced individuals’ are universally appreciated, but since pivoting to develop Ghost of Tsushima, Sucker Punch left Infamous in the dirt in 2014.</p>



<p>What about Uncharted? It’s no big secret that Naughty Dog is busy with other projects, but that’s always a huge winner for PlayStation fans. Then we’ve got Sly Cooper, Jak and Daxter, Syphon Filter, The Order… It’s a lengthy list.</p>



<p>Concord, which was a $100 million mistake, is a perfect example of what happens when you release something completely new with almost no marketing and a premium price point in a world where free-to-play games are doing so well. Not every new IP can be as successful as Black Myth: Wukong, after all.</p>



<p>Ultimately, it’s a complex topic to broach, as it takes several years to develop games these days. Even if Guerrilla announced a tools-down move on Horizon and started piecing together the first Killzone title in 11 years tomorrow, we likely wouldn’t see that game emerge until 2030.</p>



<p>We can dream, though.</p>

However, Sony chief executive Kenichiro Yoshida believes that the company is lagging behind in IP, and wants to devote resources to creating more originals.</p><p>While speaking with the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/307f7a2e-a755-4f6e-badc-9bc119f185df" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Financial Times</a>, Yoshida indicated that Sony won't stop providing content for the various streaming services including Netflix and Max. But he believes that the company has to focus on making new IP in order to better compete in the entertainment industry.</p><p>"Whether it's for games, films, or anime, we don't have that much IP that we fostered from the beginning," added Sony's chief financial officer Hiroki Totoki. "We're lacking the early phase (of IP) and that's an issue for us."</p><p>Sony has already successfully adapted <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-last-of-us-hbo-show-review-faithful-additive-and-excellent/1900-6418015/" data-ref-id="1900-6418015">The Last of Us</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/twisted-metal-tv-show-renewed-for-season-2/1100-6519808/" data-ref-id="1100-6519808">Twisted Metal</a>, and Gran Turismo into live-action projects based on the company's hit video games. But according to the report, Sony is looking to lean more on the anime series it distributes through Crunchyroll and produce or co-produce new shows. Sony also wants to drive more more PlayStation Plus subscribers to Crunchyroll's anime streaming service.</p><p>So far, Yoshida has spent six years and $10 billion to realize Sony's ambitions to better capitalize on its creations. The company's goal to completely reshape its entertainment brand is still a work in progress, but Sony's success hasn't gone unnoticed by its video-game rivals.
