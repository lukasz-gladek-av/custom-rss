			<p>For a very long time, it was rumored that <strong>Bluepoint Games</strong> was working on a <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-playstation-5-remaster-sequel/"><strong><em>Bloodborne</em> remaster for modern hardware</strong></a>, but dreams of seeing Yharnam in all of its haunting glory on <strong>PlayStation 5</strong> were crushed by the studio's <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-shutting-down-bluepoint-games/"><strong>unfortunate closure</strong></a> last week. </p>



<p>Still, PC players can enjoy the classic <strong>FromSoftware</strong> action role-playing game with a slew of improvements on <strong>PC</strong>, thanks to the <strong>ShadPS4</strong> emulator and the <strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-remaster-improved-visuals/">Bloodborne Remaster Project</a></em></strong> by <strong>fromsoftserve</strong>, which was updated this week to a new version featuring some major overhauls.</p>



<p>The modding project's <strong>0.99.2 version</strong> biggest changes involve modified classic <strong>gparams</strong>, bringing the art direction much closer to that of the base game and making the project feel even more like an official remaster. In addition, this new version includes <strong>more upscaled textures</strong>, new <strong>shininess maps</strong>, and the removal of some <strong>baked lighting</strong> to enhance one of the best features of the project: <strong>fully dynamic lighting</strong> for the world.</p>



<p>The latest version of the <strong><em>Bloodborne Remaster Project</em></strong> can be downloaded for free from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/bloodborne/mods/45?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Nexus Mods</strong>.</a></p>

<p>Although these improvements make playing <strong><em>Bloodborne</em></strong> on <strong>PC</strong> via the <strong>ShadPS4</strong> emulator a better experience than on <strong>PlayStation 4</strong> and <strong>PlayStation 5</strong>, the emulated game sadly lacks support for the game's online features. However, soon enough, the game may support <strong>co-op</strong>, searching <strong>Chalice Dungeons</strong>, and <strong>asynchronous multiplayer</strong> features, thanks to <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-pc-online-play-is-no-longer-a-dream-shadps4-developer-showcases-working-multiplayer-milestone/"><strong>future updates to the ShadPS4 emulator </strong></a>currently undergoing testing.</p>

              <p><span>Overall, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-spotlight-new-heroes-perks-stadium-returning-2000665736"><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>is in a good place right now</span></a><span>. The five new heroes Blizzard released for the shooter are dynamic, the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-cinematic-doomfist-vendetta-death-reign-talon-2000665013"><span>focus on story</span></a><span> has given us new lore on a weekly basis, and the roadmap for future seasons sounds promising. But like any service game, there’s always going to be something that’s getting on the community’s nerves, and players who use characters whose primary function is to heal are fighting for their lives thanks to one subtle but significant change.</span></p> <p><span>If you play a character like Mercy or Lifeweaver whose primary utility is in straightforward healing, you might’ve noticed that it’s a bit harder to keep your teammates alive than it used to be. That’s because there’s a </span><a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/patch-notes/"><span>new universal passive across all heroes</span></a><span> that reduces incoming healing on players who have been damaged in the past three seconds. Previously exclusive to damage characters, this reduction lowers healing by 30 percent for most heroes, and 15 percent for tanks since they’re sturdier and have bigger health bars to fill.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Where once you’d have to be chased down by a damage hero and pestered with bullets to feel the effects of this healing reduction, now every opposing hero can limit your support’s healing output for long enough that some characters like Mercy can’t outheal incoming damage like they once did. Heroes like Winston and Moira, who are able to apply constant damage through their beam-like primary fires, can now overpower Mercy’s healing with little effort, even when she’s using her ultimate ability. Because she’s a single-target healer, her entire utility has been cut off at the knees.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">People intentionally misunderstanding bc it's a static example. The point is about how ineffective her healing is now as a single target healer. Mercy takes an eternity to even TRY to sustain her target with little room to DMG boost </p> <p>Here's a 6s example in game in Valkyrie <a href="https://t.co/wAYRX6A3XM">https://t.co/wAYRX6A3XM</a> <a href="https://t.co/7Q9uY2nVzD">pic.twitter.com/7Q9uY2nVzD</a></p> <p>— Skiesti 🌻 (@skiesti_) <a href="https://twitter.com/skiesti_/status/2024134672096084454?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 18, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>Though Mercy is the most impacted by this change, you can see some pretty damning examples of it for characters like Moira as well, who is having trouble healing teammates who have been focused.&nbsp;</span></p>

   <p><span>Though supports are struggling right now, some </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Competitiveoverwatch/comments/1r90voc/how_do_we_feel_about_the_healing_reduction/"><span>fans argue that this incentivizes players to actually get behind cover</span></a><span> and not run into the line of fire with reckless abandon. Which is fair enough, and I would love to not have to Life Grip every tank who thinks they can 1v5 an enemy team through sheer willpower, but if Blizzard is going to keep this universal passive across its heroes, characters like Mercy and Lifeweaver will probably need some kind of rework or buff to keep up. Blizzard has already said </span><a href="https://x.com/OWCavalry/status/2024984783084793974"><span>both heroes will be getting some of their old Perks integrated into their kits</span></a><span>; we’ll see if it’s enough to make them viable in </span><i><span>Overwatch</span></i><span>’s healing suppression era.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The original Final Fantasy 7 has re-released on Steam, and it doesn’t seem to be faring well with players due to some issues, as reviews have dropped to ‘Mostly Negative.’</p>



<p>For those unaware, Square Enix announced last month that Final Fantasy 7 will be re-released on Steam, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/original-final-fantasy-7-is-re-releasing-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">replacing the 2013 version</a>. Today, the new version has arrived with some brand-new features; however, these seem to be causing many gameplay issues, which are hampering the experience at launch. </p>







<h2 id="h-original-final-fantasy-7-re-release-on-steam-seemingly-riddled-with-issues">Original Final Fantasy 7 Re-Release on Steam Seemingly Riddled with Issues</h2>



<p>To understand the problem, players will first have to know the new features that have arrived with the original Final Fantasy 7’s re-release on Steam. Players have received a <strong>3x Speed</strong> mode, which allows them to battle, travel, and participate in select events at three times the speed. There’s also an option to turn off random battle encounters, a <strong>Battle Enhancement</strong> mode that allows players to recover HP/MP during battles, max out the Limit gauge, and an <strong>Autosave</strong> feature. </p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/final-fantasy/completely-broken-square-enix-rushes-out-final-fantasy-7-patch-for-the-og-jrpgs-new-steam-version-following-fan-reports-of-dizzying-battle-speed-and-other-technical-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GamesRadar+</a>, the majority of complaints seem to be with the game’s new speed-up feature, with players <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3837340/FINAL_FANTASY_VII/#app_reviews_hash" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">highlighting</a> issues like “combat speed is completely broken”, “the FPS limit has been increased from 15 to 30, doubling the speed of fights and actions but without adapting the animations so the actions desyncs with the audio,” and more. Some others have mentioned issues with overlays, textures, and screen tearing.  </p>



<p>However, some reviewers have pointed out that Square Enix was prompt in releasing a patch the same day to fix the combat speed issue. But will this be enough to get the review rating back up?</p>







<p>In other news, Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade on the Switch 2 is not a PS4 port. Additionally, the multiplatform release <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-multiplatform-release-wont-compromise-graphics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will not compromise the graphics</a> in FF7 Remake Part 3.

		<p>There are few franchises as iconic, memorable, and far-reaching as Resident Evil. A horror staple since the days of the original PlayStation, it’s become an instantly recognisable brand, its zombie action extending through multiple genres and platforms into cinema, TV and beyond. Alongside being an excellent new entry in the series – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/25/resident-evil-requiem-review/">see our review here</a> – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/resident-evil-9-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> continues the series foray into new territory, arriving day and date on the Nintendo <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a>, alongside a Resident Evil cavalcade that includes the two most recent mainline entries – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/01/23/resident-evil-7-biohazard-review/">Resident Evil 7: Biohazard</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/05/05/resident-evil-village-review-ps5-xbox-series-x/">Resident Evil Village</a>.</p>
<p>We’ve all been wondering how Capcom would manage in bringing their latest premier game to the distinctly less-powerful Switch 2, but, once again, this is a showcase for the adaptability of the in-house RE Engine, and for the development team’s smart choices when approaching Nintendo’s hybrid console.</p>



<p>You start out as Grace. An FBI analyst, she’s tasked with investigating the latest in a series of strange deaths. These bodies have been found looking decidedly unhealthy, covered in dark bruising, and are all tied together as previous survivors of the Raccoon City ‘incident’. You know the one. What’s perhaps a little hard to swallow is that the latest of these deaths has been found at the Wrenwood Hotel, the place where her own mother was murdered. I’m no expert in HR, but I feel like Grace could put in a grievance for being sent back there. On her own. With only a flashlight and a gun for company. Requiem would have been a much shorter game, and involved more HR meetings, though, so we’ll look past it.</p>
<p>Resident Evil Requiem gives you a batch of options for how to view and play both Grace and Leon’s sections. The recommended setup has you playing Grace’s more investigative, atmospheric and horror-filled levels in first person, before switching to a third-person over-the-shoulder viewpoint for Leon’s bombastic action sections. You can choose to completely ignore Capcom’s recommendation, but it feels very natural to shift between the two, especially when Grace’s storyline is so much more personal and immediate – it really benefits from the first-person viewpoint.</p>

<p>It is clear that there is some visual trickery and upscaling in effect from the moment you start Resident Evil Requiem on Switch 2. All of the cutscenes are in-engine, so you’ll immediately see the telltale shimmer of anti-aliasing around Grace’s hair, and curved surfaces. Character models are less detailed than what you’ll see on other platforms, reflections are screen-space instead of ray-traced, and some building and area textures appear to have been dialled back too. For all of that, Requiem is still a great-looking game on Switch 2, and, most importantly, I found myself thoroughly immersed in the story and its action. While I was meant to be looking for visual quirks and downgrades, I soon stopped. What Capcom have produced here is remarkable.</p>
<p>The goal here is 60fps, and Grace’s sections do a good job of generally hitting that target. They clearly benefit from being in more confined areas, and Grace’s slower pace, but they’re also very lighting-intensive, with flashlights, broken lights and naked flames playing out believably, ramping up the sense of danger and the cloying atmosphere perfectly. It all feels very impressive, and only heightens the immersion. As with elsewhere, there are compromises if you look for them, so sometimes you’ll see jagged, pixellated edges to the flashlight beams during cutscenes, but in action, it’s either less noticeable or it’s not there at all.</p>

<p>Leon’s missions don’t stick the 60fps landing, and in our rough estimation, it can come closer to 40fps. A lot of that comes down to the larger areas, the number of enemies or bystanders on screen, and Leon performing the seasoned, action hero role in comparison to Grace’s inexperienced, investigative tech analyst. It’s something of a shame that there are no overarching graphical options or the ability to opt for the consistency of a locked 30fps, but ideologically, it seems that the Resident Evil team have always preferred an unlocked frame rate in previous titles on previous generations – it can be a touch more responsive, but you can end up with a juddery feeling. Even so, Leon’s sections still play very well don’t drop below 30fps from what we’ve seen and tested.</p>
<p>The real saving grace (pun intended) for the Switch 2’s cross-platform ports is the availability of DLSS, and while it’s being pushed pretty hard to upscale for a 4K output, it’s impressively accomplished with an acceptable level of softness to the display. If anything, it works with Requiem’s art direction to a surprising degree, and there’s still a clear cinematic quality to how everything looks. Undocked, there’s the added bonus of built-in VRR to smooth performance out further. Handheld feels just as steady as docked play, and there are points where you’ll wonder what kind of ritual sacrifices Capcom had to make to get there.</p>

<p>It’s a shame that there are no mouse controls in the Switch 2 version of Resident Evil Requiem, as I think it would work really well across both Grace and Leon’s sections. At least we live in a time where it might be added further down the line. Capcom still make use of a couple of the Switch 2’s tricks, and HD Rumble 2 makes a startling difference to the way that scenes and sections feel. Through the opening areas, you can feel the rumble of a passing subway train, initially strong and obvious and then diminishing as it heads off, while the steady pitter-patter of the rain, or the accompanying blast of lightning, adds a layer of immersion well beyond the visuals. It’s definitely another selling point.</p>
<p>While there aren’t currently mouse controls, there are gyro motion controls, and if you’re looking for a bit more precision when aiming, it’s a handy inclusion. There are further aim assist settings too, if you’re not that great at hitting zombies in the head, with these turned on automatically for the Casual difficulty, or being a toggle in the Modern and Classic options.</p>
<p>Resident Evil: Requiem on Switch 2 is a stunning port that once again showcases what Nintendo’s handheld hardware is capable of.</p>

<p>Speaking during a recent episode of the <strong><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/kKtBbg2toiY?t=1637s">Games Mess Decide</a>s</em></strong> podcast, <strong>Jeff Grubb</strong> revealed an interesting tidbit about the game. <em>"I've heard that at some point, PlayStation had Gran Turismo 7 running on Switch 2 hardware,"</em> <strong>Grubb</strong> said. <em>"Now, to be clear, I am not saying it's coming to Switch 2. I don't think it is. But it’s one of those things where Polyphony and Sony were playing around with the dev kits."</em></p>



<p><em>"It makes sense as a benchmark. If you want to see what your own future handheld needs to target, you run your most scalable engine on the competition's new specs,"</em> said the show's other host <strong>Mike Minotti</strong>, to which <strong>Grubb</strong> responded: <em>"Exactly. It's an internal technical test. They want to know how that scale of hardware handles their tech, especially since GT7 is already so scalable from PS4 to PS5."</em></p>

<p>Unfortunately, nothing else has been said about this <strong><em>Gran Turismo 7</em></strong> technical test, but it would have been fascinating to learn how the <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong> handled one of the best-looking <strong>PlayStation 5</strong> releases to date. As <strong>Sony</strong> is rumored to be working on a <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-handheld-ai-upscaling-16gb-lpddr5x-16mb-mall/">PlayStation handheld system</a></strong>, however, there is still the chance we will eventually see a handheld version of the game.</p>



<p><strong><em>Gran Turismo 7</em></strong> running on a system such as the <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong>, where it has little to no chance of ever getting a release, is not the first time an exclusive game has been made to run on a different system as a technical test. Years ago, <strong>Epic Games</strong> had a working <strong>PlayStation 3 build</strong> of <strong><em>Gears of War 3</em></strong>, which eventually made its way online for all to see. As such, it is not impossible that we will be able to see this technical test ourselves years down the line.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Critical Role has appointed a new General Manager for their streaming platform, Beacon. The beloved media entertainment studio's newly appointed member, Alyssa Zeisler, has plans for the future of the platform and its style of TTRPG entertainment.</p><h2>Alyssa Zeisler's Appointment as General Manager of Beacon</h2><p>&nbsp;In an official press release, Alyssa Zeisler will oversee various elements of the Beacon streaming platform. These include product roadmaps, content and platform strategy, building the platform as a community hub, creator-led ecosystem, and central destination for Critical Role and TTRPG content.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>Business wise, Zeisler's appointment is a savvy choice. She is a veteran digital media and product executive with a respectable track record handling scaling subscription, platforms, and bringing savvy strategy to legacy media brands. Her previous position was Vice President of Product of Hallmark media, where she helped launch the Hallmark+ membership platform.</p><blockquote><p>“My goal for Beacon is to make it the gold standard for direct-to-consumer platforms,” said Alyssa Zeisler, General Manager of Beacon. “It’s a place where we can experiment with new formats in the TTRPG space while creating a seamless experience for fans. We’re building the blueprint for how a community-led brand transitions into a sustainable, global media company, and I’m excited to be at the helm as we evolve this ecosystem into something truly industry-defining.”</p></blockquote><p>The appointment of Alyssa Zeisler to Beacon is a sensible decision on behalf of Critical Role. The Beacon platform has showcased many different actual play series such as the ongoing <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/critical-role-campaign-4-trailer-introduces-us-to-land-of-araman" rel="nofollow">Campaign 4</a> DM'd by Brennan Lee Mulligan, and the upcoming <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/critical-role-and-titmouse-announces-new-actual-play-draw-your-weapons" rel="nofollow">Draw Your Weapons</a> and has continued to grow alongside Critical Role as a media brand.</p><p>That media brand has included their tabletop branch, Darrington Press, the developer of the fantasy RPG <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/darrington-press-announces-daggerheart-hope-fear-its-first-official-expansion" rel="nofollow"><em>Daggerheart</em></a>, two Prime Video animated shows, and a partnership AdHoc Studio's superhero adventure game, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dispatch-sales-3m-stats-adhoc" rel="nofollow"><em>Dispatch</em></a>.</p><p>With that growth comes with the demands of long-term strategy. In this case, Zeisler's strategy for Beacon is to grow the platform as a fan-first membership experience, all while supporting Critical Role's long-term vision for sustainable, meaningful, expansion.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/883947/resident-evil-requiem-review-ps5-xbox-switch-2</link>
            <guid>1445971</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Resident Evil has always been a strange creature: Like many of its most notable monsters, it has shifted and evolved into various forms. From its blocky days of tank-controlled Z-list actors to first-person fright fests, the franchise’s identity is not so much tied to genre as theme: zombies, viruses, very ugly monsters. Now, with <em>Requiem</em>, we have its first proper chimera, mixing the first-person horror of the latest installments with the fan-favorite action of <em>Resident Evil 4</em>.</p><p>Along with this are two playable characters that embody these two very different styles, with beloved Leon S. Kennedy returning as a middle-aged action hero alongside newcomer Grace Ashcroft. The pair come together for a <em>Resident Evil</em> that seamlessly shifts between tone and view to create yet another terrifying evolution for the franchise.</p><p><em>Requiem</em> sees Grace, an FBI analyst, investigating a series of strange murders. All the victims are survivors of the 1998 <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Raccoon_City_Destruction_Incident">Raccoon City Incident</a>, the inciting event that’s central to much of <em>Resident Evil</em>’s history. Grace’s section begins in 2026 in a burnt-down hotel encased in a rainy urban environment, which reminded me of the cold, wet horror of David Fincher’s <em>Seven</em>. She navigates the dark hotel, armed only with a flashlight, before realizing she is not, in fact, alone. She soon finds herself in the hands of the main villain, Dr. Victor Gideon.</p><p>The game lets you swap between first- and third-person views, but also recommends a particular view for each character. Much like the two previous entries, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/23/14353714/resident-evil-7-biohazard-review-ps4-xbox-one-pc"><em>Biohazard</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22420738/resident-evil-village-review-playstation-xbox-pc"><em>Village</em></a>, Grace’s section is designed with a first-person viewpoint in mind. With her limited ammo and inventory space, low health, and tiny frame, Grace is this game’s unprepared horror protagonist, surrounded by enemies who can often kill her in one or two hits. Grace has to prioritize hiding, using one-off but powerful weapons and gadgets, and fleeing. Playing this in first-person helps articulate her vulnerability.</p><p>Soon I was controlling Leon (who looks much worse for wear since his last appearance in <em>Resident Evil 6</em>, a game everyone, including me, pretends does not exist). Leon arrives near the hotel after Grace, and he’s soon killing zombies in the middle of a public street, giving chase to Gideon. It is rather unnerving watching Dr. Gideon shoot needles into innocent passersby as he escapes, quickly creating zombies. Leon’s sections are much like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23642938/resident-evil-4-remake-review-xbox-ps5-steam"><em>Resident Evil 4</em></a>: third-person action, with melee prompts and a new ax weapon. Despite being in his 50s, Leon remains an efficient killing machine: As with his abilities in <em>Resident Evil 4</em>, Leon has melee and instant kills, with incredible animations and satisfying gore gushing from successful takedowns. There has never been this much gore caused by a <em>Resident Evil</em> protagonist; it’s glorious to watch him paint rooms red.</p><p>It’s remarkable how seamlessly the game shifts between perspectives. If you have ever watched videos showing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWR11Ck_oZM">what first-person games look like from a third-person</a> perspective, you will know things are… different. For example, when Grace opens a creepy cupboard, the game wants to show you a disgusting mass with ooze. The animation for her arms, the angle you view it from, and more will differ if you’re watching it from a first or third-person perspective. Incredibly, <em>Requiem</em> has achieved this fidelity for both angles at any time. It’s truly masterful work by Capcom.</p><p>There is no optional character switching, however. You will simply find yourself playing Grace or Leon based on where you are in the story. For example, after playing as Grace for an hour, navigating very creepy hallways and avoiding a large monstrosity known only as the girl, she ends up being saved by Leon. The game then cuts back to show how Leon got the point of saving her. Later, when Grace is separated from Leon, you take over as Leon and give her covering fire from a sniper’s nest.</p><p>You cannot predict when you will play as either character, but most of the first half of the game is in the shoes of Grace, with Leon’s sections notably shorter; by the time I crossed the halfway mark, the game put Grace on the back burner for a very long time.</p><p>The mashup works surprisingly well, as it feels like the style of play reflects the characters and their particular story. Leon just could never be afraid, underprepared, or ill-suited to the horror around him by this stage in his story. Even with his bare hands, he is a formidable fighter, and remains the lovable weirdo from <em>Resident Evil 4.</em> His sections are refined, tight combat sequences; at one point you can even block a rocket with an ax.</p><p>Grace is another story. Despite being an FBI analyst, she looks like a very small teenager. While I appreciate that her being unprepared adds to the horror, nothing portrayed her as a criminal analyst or FBI agent. Indeed, her being a lonely college student would have made more sense, as nothing in any part of the story demonstrated any abilities. Her backstory, which I won’t spoil here, is also underwhelming, and discovering why she is so important to the all-powerful villains left me rolling my eyes. While she felt good to play and embodied vulnerability, her constant sniveling and delivering lines with a whimper became very jarring. Thankfully she shows some growth toward the end of the game.</p><p>The environments and scenarios are also wonderfully varied, throwing you from a creepy hospital-like area to the bombed-out remains of Raccoon City Police Department — also known as Leon’s origin story. It was quite emotional returning, as the original <em>Resident Evil 2 </em>was the first big-budget game I got in the 2000s. Leon and I were somewhat aligned in taking a breath before opening those doors. I chuckled as 50-year-old Leon commented on puzzles and items he dealt with nearly 30 years ago, which returning players will appreciate.</p><p>The series’ enemies have also continued to evolve beyond just the shambling undead. My favorites were the new partially sentient zombies who retain some semblance of humanity — a cook keeps chopping decaying meat in the kitchen, a cleaner keeps rubbing a stained mirror and bashing her face, a hotel guest nursing a hangover keeps turning a light on and off. Grace can use these tics to her advantage when trying to escape them; for example, with the light-switcher zombie, you can turn on a light farther down a corridor to get him to move.</p><p>Leon and Grace’s journey centers around what they believe is tracking down the last strain of the zombie virus that upended the world. I can safely say that the ending I got was one of the most satisfying conclusions to any <em>Resident Evil</em> game — and <em>Requiem</em> is a fitting name. This newest installment brings together two of the franchise’s heavy hitters — <em>Resident Evil 4</em> and the first-person horror of <em>Biohazard</em> and <em>Village</em> — and at just under 11 hours, it doesn’t overstay its welcome, either.</p><p>Over the years, <em>Resident Evil</em> has shown that it can be many different types of horror — and <em>Requiem</em> proves that the series can pull it all off in one single experience.</p><p><sub>Resident Evil Requiem<em> launches on February 27th on the PS5, Xbox, Switch 2, and PC.</em></sub></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTAwNTg="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Tauriq Moosa</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/883947/resident-evil-requiem-review-ps5-xbox-switch-2]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[Resident Evil Requiem is still scary as hell on the Switch 2]]></title>
            <link>https://www.theverge.com/games/883965/resident-evil-requiem-nintendo-switch-2-performance</link>
            <guid>1445968</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>It took me a while to recover from the first big scare in <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/883947/resident-evil-requiem-review-ps5-xbox-switch-2">Resident Evil Requiem</a></em>. There I was, hunched over with a screen inches from my face and headphones in my ears, when a gigantic woman began chasing me through a dimly lit hallway intent on, well, eating me. It was a heart-racing sequence, and when I finally got to a save room I had to put the game down for a few minutes. It was an early indication that <em>Requiem </em>was a great game, and further evidence that the Switch 2 is becoming a welcome home for third-party titles.</p><p>Since <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/686603/nintendo-switch-2-review">Nintendo’s latest console launched last June</a>, there have been few chances to see how it directly stacks up to other platforms. The successful <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/704560/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-nintendo-switch-2-comparison">cross-platform launch of <em>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4</em></a> was a good early sign for the Switch 2, but <em>Requiem</em> might be the best test so far. It’s a blockbuster action-horror game launching simultaneously across the Switch 2, PS5, Xbox, and PC. And while there are certainly some compromises on Nintendo’s platform, <em>Requiem</em> is a surprisingly solid experience on the Switch 2.</p><p><em>Requiem</em> brings together two different types of <em>Resident Evil</em> games: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23642938/resident-evil-4-remake-review-xbox-ps5-steam">the fast-paced action of <em>Resident Evil 4</em></a> and the more visceral first-person terror of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/23/14353714/resident-evil-7-biohazard-review-ps4-xbox-one-pc"><em>Biohazard</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22420738/resident-evil-village-review-playstation-xbox-pc"><em>Village</em></a>. Those two sides are represented through two playable characters. <em>RE4</em> hunk Leon returns as a grizzled action hero, while newcomer Grace is a more hapless FBI agent who does a lot of running and hiding. Impressively, you can seamlessly swap between viewpoints at any point, letting you experience Grace’s scares in first person or help Leon wield a chainsaw in third person (or vice versa).</p><p>On a purely functional level, I haven’t had any issues with the game on the Switch 2. There haven’t been any noticeable slowdowns or hitches, aside from one time when the corpse of a zombie butcher disappeared briefly, which gave me a scare thinking he’d come back to life after a tense shootout. But there’s been nothing game-breaking, and that’s been true in both portable and TV modes.</p><p>The main compromise, of course, is visual. <em>Requiem</em> on the Switch 2 simply does not look as good as it does on PC or the other consoles. There are a lot of blurry textures, particularly when you get up close to objects or walls, and things overall just don’t look as sharp or clear as they do on, say, a PS5. It’s especially noticeable in first-person mode when you’re up closer to objects and characters. I also spotted some wonky hair physics, with hair occasionally deciding to defy the laws of gravity and float whichever way it wanted. Again, none of these are game-breaking issues, but they do cut into the tension <em>Requiem</em> works so hard to build.</p><p>This is a busy week for <em>Resident Evil</em> fans who also own a Switch 2. In addition to <em>Requiem</em>, Capcom has released belated ports of <em>Biohazard</em> and <em>Village</em>. And while these are older games, my experience was much the same. I played through the beginning area of <em>Biohazard</em> again for the first time in nearly a decade — which I regret, because it is so freaking scary — and it similarly performed well but was plagued by fuzzy textures and impossible floating hair.</p><p>Honestly, that’s about the best-case scenario for ports like these. We all know the Switch 2 is underpowered compared to its direct competitors, so a game like <em>Requiem</em> is always going to feel hamstrung in some way. A port of <em>Requiem</em> that’s good enough, even if it’s not the best version of the game, goes a long way to helping Nintendo continue to flesh out the Switch 2’s library, which has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/875986/nintendo-switch-2-release-schedule-mario-tennis-fever">grown steadily in both size and quality</a> despite a notable lack of major first-party titles from Nintendo. And let’s not forget the fact that what you lose in visual splendor you make up for in portability.</p><p><em>Requiem</em> is a good sign for the Switch 2’s viability as a platform for major third-party games, but an even better sign would be seeing releases like this more frequently. We won’t have to wait too long to see the next big test: Capcom’s sci-fi action game <em>Pragmata</em> launches across most major platforms, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/874282/nintendo-direct-february-2026-fallout-ff7">Switch 2 included</a>, in April. I can’t wait to see how hair floats in space.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTk3"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Webster</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/883965/resident-evil-requiem-nintendo-switch-2-performance]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[Some Sims 4 Players Are Quitting After A Mysterious Bug Turns All Their Family Photos Black]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/sims-4-bug-family-photos-black-ea-patch-fix-2000673602</link>
            <guid>1445959</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i><span>The Sims 4</span></i><span> is a notoriously problematic game. Between its incessant monetization of content packs that have gradually grown sparser (and ultimately led to the essential cancellation of </span><i><span>The Sims 5</span></i><span>) and now Saudi Arabia’s impending acquisition of Electronic Arts, it’s not exactly the same life sim it was when the series kicked off in 2000. The game is also notably buggy, a problem that seems to grow with every new expansion pack. Most of these bugs have been fairly harmless and occasionally charming: things like Sims randomly hitting T-poses and peeing fire. But now, a much more devastating bug is wiping out generations of gameplay, and it seems like developer Maxis might not know how to fix it.</span></p> <p><span>Over the past several months, quite a few </span><i><span>Sims 4</span></i><span> players have noticed an eerie bug that turns all of their family photos black. While the bug has apparently been around for a whopping five years, it seems like it’s become rampant over the past several months. Photos serve as arguably the game’s most sentimental feature, and they’ve become a handy way to keep track of memories from past generations, so players are understandably really, really upset.</span></p>

 <p><span>The bug has proven especially devastating for players who play in the same family for generations. Reddit user iiappie </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Sims4/comments/1rccgmd/75_generations_worth_of_photos_all_gone/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><span>noted that they had lost 7.5 generations of photos</span></a><span>, sharing a screenshot of a gallery with hundreds of photos all gone. And Reddit user LilNyoomf shared that every memorial photo in their entire cemetery was </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Sims4/comments/1qcw3a1/pov_the_bug_fix_for_blackblank_photos_just_wiped/"><span>completely wiped</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>“Shaking my head,” LilNyoomf wrote. “I have no words.”</span></p> <p><span>As if the family photo bug isn’t already horrible enough, the game is also apparently now deleting entire Sims from the family tree UI, meaning players who don’t archive their progress through some external method are just losing all records of their dead Sims (other than their literal graves).</span></p>

 <p><span>“I haven’t played in over 6 month because of shit like this and with the way things are going, I likely won’t return,” Reddit user VibrantViolet commented on iiappie’s post. “EA killed this franchise.”</span></p> <p><span>The game’s patch notes from </span><a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/update-2-3-2026"><span>February 3</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/update-1-13-2026"><span>January 13</span></a><span> declare that the team fixed these bugs, but photos are definitely still vanishing. Some players have </span><a href="https://forums.ea.com/idea/the-sims-4-bug-reports-en/after-the-new-update-to-fix-pictures-turning-black-all-of-mine-turned-black-/13101831"><span>even reported that these patches intended to fix photos were actually what broke their photos,</span></a><span> which seems especially awful. It’s also worth noting that one patch states that the alleged fix it introduced doesn’t allow photos to be fixed retroactively, meaning there might not ever be an official way to recover these hundreds of lost photos.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>While Maxis hopefully works on an actual patch, Reddit user efsamo has shared </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Sims4/comments/1qu8zxy/i_found_a_way_to_recover_the_black_photos_in_your/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><span>a DIY fix</span></a><span> that allows players to recover their missing photos. However, it’s not a guaranteed remedy. Other players are turning to new ways of archiving their gameplay, like </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Sims4/comments/1qn296e/after_getting_hit_with_the_dreaded_black_out/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><span>modded portraits</span></a><span>, but plenty more are still waiting on Maxis to provide a surefire fix before even opening the game at all.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>I’ve never been a hugely sentimental </span><i><span>Sims </span></i><span>player, and I’ve abandoned so many single-generation save files to start new ones, but I </span><i><span>still </span></i><span>use the hell out of the photo feature. I can only imagine what it would be like to spend hundreds of hours building a massive family tree only to lose all of those digital memories. Hopefully Maxis will figure out how to patch this out for real (and maybe even rescue those lost photos), but it seems like this is still the last straw for quite a few players.</span></p>

			<p>After a series of fantastic remakes and two games focusing on the misadventures of Ethan Winters, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/resident-evil-9-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> finally returns to continue Leon Kennedy’s attempts to take down the Umbrella Corporation and end its legacy. Once again, he is not alone in his task, although rather than a series staple we now have a new character in the form of Grace Ashcroft, an FBI agent who is also the daughter of a character from the PS2 Outbreak spin-offs. This connection between different strands of Resident Evil is emblematic of the game as a whole; a game which at times feels like a compilation of highlights from the series in terms of references and set pieces. This isn’t a criticism, though, as the pacing is so well judged here that any long-time fan will be grinning for the duration.</p>
<p><iframe title="Resident Evil Requiem - 4th Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fXVy4mALHLY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The dual protagonists – and more interestingly, dual perspectives – in the game have drawn a lot of attention. In practice, this feels like another way in which Requiem is paying homage to the whole series that precedes it, with Grace’s first-person parts having the overwhelming tension and fragility of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/01/23/resident-evil-7-biohazard-review/">Resident Evil 7</a> while Leon’s more gung-ho third person action is straight out of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/03/17/resident-evil-4-remake-review/">Resident Evil 4</a> playbook. You can override the camera view, but this isn’t just a gimmick and the dynamics in gameplay and atmosphere make every part of the game feel like a high point. Revisiting areas that you anxiously snuck around as Grace when fully armed as Leon has the same freeing effect as a New Game Plus often does.</p>


<p>The story here is pure Resident Evil, and as such is wonderfully daft. Following the plot closely requires more than a passing knowledge of the series as a whole, but there is plenty of internal narrative to keep it interesting for a newcomer too. Grace begins the game as a FBI investigator sent to check out the mysterious deaths of individuals who survived the initial outbreak in Raccoon City, before being caught up in a conspiracy that takes you to the very heart of Umbrella’s nefarious schemes. While chasing up leads for this conspiracy, Leon discovers Grace’s involvement and sets out to rescue her. From this point on, the game takes you on a tour of both new and familiar locations, culminating in an endgame face-off that has fascinating ramifications for the series going forward.</p>


<p>Grace’s sections are characterised by stealth, but she isn’t totally helpless. The titular Requiem handgun – a ridiculously overpowered handcannon – is given to her by Leon early on but ammo for this is incredibly scarce so it remains a last resort throughout. She does have a more basic pistol and knives for protection but it can often be a better choice to avoid conflict. That being said, on the standard difficulty I did find Grace’s sections to include enough ammo to take out most of the zombies, an approach which took away from the survival horror a little. Then again, I tend to prefer the action-orientated approach over the creeping in shadows, so this suited me.</p>
<p>Grace’s sections also contain the more defined puzzles, with Leon’s mostly involving finding key items. With Grace, you’ll need to carefully scan photos and documents to find the solution to environmental puzzles, but there is nothing here to act as a real roadblock as is often the case in Silent Hill games. Grace’s unique mechanic is a blood collector that enables her to use the infected blood of enemies to craft items, ranging from ammunition to health upgrades. This is a novel take on the usual upgrade aspect of modern RE games, and is echoed by Leon’s more traditional credits obtained from defeating enemies in combat.</p>

<p>As Leon makes his way through the game he has access to the full range of weaponry you’d expect, from various pistols with different strengths to high powered rifles and machine guns. I found all the weapons to be useful in the various combat encounters that litter his sections, with switching between them often being more efficient than reloading in the middle of a fight. I can certainly see huge potential in speed-running the game through expert use of each weapon to navigate fights in the most time effective way. Weapons can be upgraded as you progress but there isn’t a standard New Game Plus mode in which you retain all of these upgrades. You can use credits from defeated foes to buy the weapons earlier in subsequent playthroughs however, so this feels like a suitable substitution.</p>
<p>The in-game achievements and related challenge points are once again used to purchase special items, upgrades, costumes, concept art etc. Many of these challenges are familiar from the recent remakes and provide a great amount of replayability and extra ways to enjoy the central game. This is particularly important as there may well be some negative responses to Requiem’s ten hour duration, somewhat shorter than the most recent Resident Evil 4 Remake. The game’s length is far more in keeping with the rest of the series, though, and is well judged to be all killer and no filler.</p>

<p>The RE Engine continues to be one of the most impressively optimised gaming experiences, reviewing on PC. I played through the game on desktop with an RTX4060 ti and Ryzen 3600 (still going strong) with a stable 75fps on high settings aside from one mid-game boss fight which tanked the frame rate for a few seconds. Requiem even performed at a playable level on Steam Deck straight out of the box, and we’ve been able to check out the game on Nintendo Switch 2, with Capcom making all the right compromises to get a good feeling experience, albeit with a more variable frame rate – see our Resident Evil Requiem Switch 2 impressions here. On PC, I stuck to mouse and keyboard due to the first person parts but found that third person view controlled excellently this way as well.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Resident Evil Requiem is a superb entry in the series and feels like a ‘best of’ at times with the persistent Easter eggs, references, and gameplay callbacks to the full range of earlier games. There is a vast amount of wider lore for fans of that part of Capcom’s legendary titles, but even newcomers will be caught up in the narrative and balls to the wall gameplay. RE Requiem is up there with the very best of the series.	</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<p>There’s a moment during <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> — actually, no, <em>several</em> moments — in which I laid the controller on my lap and just stared at the screen in awe. Over the last decade, the series has reclaimed its throne as the king of the survival horror genre, but Requiem pushes the quality bar higher than ever, presenting an experience that is equal parts fresh and nostalgic. For long-time fans who cut their teeth on the original ‘Raccoon City’ trilogy, this is a love letter that celebrates RE’s origins; one that will have you grinning from ear to ear until the credits roll.</p>
<figure><a title="Resident Evil Requiem Review - Screenshot 1 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/162330/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Requiem stars two playable protagonists: FBI agent and ‘scaredy-cat’ (<a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/12/grace-is-the-biggest-scaredy-cat-in-resident-evil-history-capcom-details-how-leons-gameplay-will-differ-in-requiem">Capcom’s words</a>) Grace Ashcroft and series veteran Leon Kennedy, who’s still busy serving the Division of Security Operations. Together (well, mostly separately), they work to uncover a bunch of mysteries linked to the Umbrella Corporation, with newcomer and excellent antagonist Victor Gideon driving the narrative.</p>
<p>And make no mistake, Requiem’s narrative is utter nonsense in the best way. The way it rewrites a lot of the series’ backstory may drive a few die-hard fans 'round the bend, but I loved every second. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-7-biohazard-gold-edition">RE7</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-village-gold-edition">Village</a>, as good as they are (particularly the former), were so tangentially connected to the wider narrative that they could have been named something completely different. Requiem is easily the most lore-heavy entry since <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_5">RE5</a>, one that goes back to corrupt corporations and deranged scientists while laying foundations for future games.</p>
<p>However bonkers the story is, it’s exceptionally well-told, with some wonderful voiceover work from Nick Apostolides as Leon, Angela Sant-Albano as Grace, and Antony Byrne as Gideon. Similarly, the music is consistently excellent, from the subtle, calming Save Room theme to the frantic numbers in the action sequences.</p>
<figure><a title="Resident Evil Requiem Review - Screenshot 2 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/162326/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The story bounces between Grace and Leon from start to finish, with key narrative beats signalling a character switch. That said, the first half largely belongs to Grace, with Leon concentrated primarily in the latter half. Grace’s gameplay is the quintessential survival horror experience, focusing on limited inventory space, scarce ammo, and brutal, relentless enemies.</p>
<p>I played on ‘Standard (Classic)’ difficulty, which brings back ink ribbons for Grace’s sections, an additional, limited-number item that you’ll need to save your progress. Naturally, being able to put the Switch 2 in sleep mode without losing progress does nullify the need for ink ribbons somewhat, but they do still offer severe consequences if you die, so their inclusion absolutely forces you to be more cautious.</p>
<p>Crafting also returns, and here it’s tied entirely to the collection of blood samples found throughout the environment or from your fallen foes. By holding ‘A’ next to samples, Grace can use a dedicated item to extract the blood, with larger enemies providing a greater supply. By combining this with herbs and bits of scrap, you can create all sorts of useful items like med injectors, ammunition, steroids, and more.</p>
<figure><a title="Resident Evil Requiem Review - Screenshot 3 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/162327/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>And yes, empty ink ribbon tins can also be found in the environment, so you can craft full ink ribbons too; definitely handy if you find yourself in need of one.</p>
<p>By having enemies provide essential blood samples, Requiem encourages you to kill them if you want to craft certain items. Like all great survival horrors, however, there are downsides to this. If you leave your fallen enemies lying on the ground too long, they’ll morph into Blister Heads (a clear nod to REmake’s Crimson Head zombies), which are generally much faster and more aggressive than their standard counterparts.</p>
<p>You can mitigate this by using craftable Hemolytic Injectors to make their bodies explode, or if you’re feeling particularly brave, you can sneak up on a zombie and use the injector instantly while they’re up and about. Again, though, it’s yet another item you’ll want to keep handy whenever possible, taking up a precious slot in your already-limited inventory.</p>
<figure><a title="Resident Evil Requiem Review - Screenshot 4 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/162324/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The balance is simply fantastic and it makes for the purest survival horror experience since RE7. But of course, that’s just one half of the story.</p>
<p>Leon’s sections are a more direct evolution of the action-horror seen in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_4">RE4</a>. Ammunition is much more plentiful, while the inventory system is a spin on the ‘attaché case’ approach seen in RE4 and Village, meaning you’ve instantly got a lot more space to play with.</p>
<p>Enemies are also more plentiful, with the game often putting you in situations in which you're forced to fight off waves of zombies. Roundhouse kicks are back, of course, and Leon can make use of various melee weapons, picking up spears and hurling them at distant foes, or turning the tables with his very own chainsaw. It’s about time he got to wield one of those things, right?</p>
<figure><a title="Resident Evil Requiem Review - Screenshot 5 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/162332/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>In addition to one-time melee weapons, Leon has a dedicated hatchet that you keep sharp by pressing ‘L’ and ‘Y’ together. It functions just like the defensive knives in RE4, meaning you can either use the hatchet directly against enemies at close range, or keep attacks at bay, with context-sensitive button prompts popping up to save your skin at the last second. It’s a great addition, and being able to sharpen it on the fly means you’re not limited to restoring its functionality at in-game shops.</p>
<p>The shops are indeed back, though. There’s no swashbuckling merchant in Requiem, but instead you’ll come across dedicated crates with a multitude of new weapons, armour, and recovery items. Currency isn’t located in the environment, but rather accrued automatically by killing enemies. Leon’s sections really encourage you to be as aggressive as possible, and you’ll find you have credits in the tens of thousands in no time at all, letting you boost your arsenal very quickly.</p>
<p>Much like Grace, Leon can also craft essential items, but given the swift nature of the gameplay, this isn’t tied to the collection of blood. Instead, you head into the crafting menu and combine the ingredients you wish to use. Simple.</p>
<figure><a title="Resident Evil Requiem Review - Screenshot 6 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/162325/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>There were moments during Leon’s sections in which the action gets dangerously close to the frantic gameplay seen in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_6">RE6</a> – thankfully, however, it never quite reaches the same heights (or lows, if you like). Whenever things get a little too over-the-top, Capcom wisely pulls back to keep everything grounded.</p>
<p>All told, by combining Grace’s survival horror gameplay with Leon’s more action-focused affair, the pacing is pitch-perfect. I simply never felt bored, and with a sprinkling of nostalgic easter eggs throughout the latter half (which no, I won’t spoil here), it made for one of the most exhilarating entries in series history.</p>
<p>There’s plenty of replay value, too. I won't go through exactly what's unlocked upon completion (which, for the record, took me just under 12 hours), but needless to say you'll have plenty of extra goodies to play around with to incentivise multiple campaign runs.</p>
<figure><a title="Resident Evil Requiem Review - Screenshot 7 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/162328/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>You can also play around with the camera on subsequent playthroughs (or your first, if you wish). Requiem recommends playing Grace’s sections in first-person and Leon’s in third — which I did on my first runthrough — but you can switch these around however you like for some interesting results. Sadly, there’s no Mercenaries Mode here, which seems ridiculous given the fast, addictive nature of Leon’s sections, but I suspect this might be added as DLC.</p>
<p>On Switch 2, Requiem mostly runs very well. Visually, it often looks incredible, with the environments in particular being a true standout thanks to excellent lighting and shadow effects. Things falter slightly with characters and items: hair often looks a little dodgy, while items picked up or examined will display some off-putting aliasing around the edges. These are cutbacks that I didn’t really notice with RE7 and Village, and it’s perhaps an indication of the advancements made with the RE Engine for Requiem.</p>
<p>Similarly, though frame rate is often gunning for a slick 60fps, there are moments in which it will become quite inconsistent when there’s a lot going on – usually during specific scenarios in which fire is heavily present in the environment. In my experience, this tends to be more noticeable during handheld play, but even then, I wouldn’t say it occurs enough to dampen the experience.</p>
<figure><a title="Resident Evil Requiem Review - Screenshot 8 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/162323/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Ultimately, the Switch 2 can't provide the most technically advanced version of Requiem, but the fact that Capcom got it running as well as it does is commendable.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Resident Evil Requiem sets a new benchmark for a series that has been pretty consistently great for the last decade or so. By combining classic survival horror with the more action-focused gameplay of RE4, the result is an experience paced to perfection. Add in a lore-heavy narrative and copious easter eggs, and you've got what might be the ultimate expression of Resident Evil.</p>
<p>There are a few minor visual hiccups along with some inconsistency in frame rate during busier moments, but the fact that we've got a brand-new flagship RE game running well on Switch 2 should be celebrated. The lack of a Mercenaries Mode feels like a missed opportunity, but I've got my fingers crossed that it eventually shows up.</p></section>

			<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/resident-evil/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Resident Evil</strong></a> series has largely gone from strength to strength in recent years, with <strong>Capcom</strong> serving up a number of <span>distinct takes on the series, from the hardcore horror of&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/resident-evil-7/" target="_blank"><strong>Resident Evil 7</strong></a>&nbsp;</span>to the intense action and zingers of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/resident-evil-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Resident Evil 4 remake</strong></a>. And now, Capcom is preparing to roll out <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/resident-evil-requiem/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Resident Evil Requiem</strong></a>, a game that promises to combine a lot of what they’ve been doing with the series recently into <a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/resident-evil-requiem-everything-we-know-about-the-new-game-in-capcoms-beloved-horror-franchise/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one terrifying concoction</a>.</p>



<p>Is Resident Evil Requiem destined to be another horrific hit for Capcom? Or does this Requiem lay the Resident Evil series' recent hot streak to rest? As always, grab yourself some green herbs, because it’s time to delve in.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/WCCFresidentevilrequiem2.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Resident Evil Requiem's story <strong>initially focuses on fresh-faced FBI analyst Grace Ashcroft</strong>, daughter of deep-cut character Alyssa Ashcroft (last playable in the Resident Evil Outbreak co-op games from the mid-2000s). In a flashback, Alyssa is brutally murdered before Grace's eyes for unknown reasons, and, wouldn't you know it, in the present day, Grace is assigned to investigate the death of a Raccoon City survivor (the latest in a string of similar deaths) at the very hotel where her mother was killed. Personally, I would have gone home sick that day.</p>



<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, the body at the hotel turns out to be a trap, and in short order, <strong>Grace finds herself surrounded by folks beset by some form of new zombie infection and captured by Dr. Victor Gideon</strong>, a hulking Frankenstein-like mad scientist with ties to Umbrella (there's just no escaping those guys, is there?).</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/WCCFresidentevilrequiem3.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Ah, but all is not lost. <span>Our old friend <strong>Leon Kennedy</strong>, still&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/leon-hot-uncle-resident-evil-requiem-capcom-female-staff/" target="_blank">largely battling back the ravages of time despite likely being in his 50s by now</a>, is looking into the Raccoon City survivor deaths, too, and arrives just in time to witness Dr. Gideon making off with Grace.</span> Leon also happens to be suffering from a mysterious ailment, a gangrenous black growth, affecting Raccoon City survivors.</p>



<p>Leon manages to track Dr. Gideon and Grace to a shadowy medical facility, at which point we continue down two paths, <strong>following both Grace and Leon's exploits as they splatter zombies and uncover various typical Resident Evil-style secrets and revelations</strong>. Why was Grace’s mom killed, and what’s the true nature of Emily, the young blind girl Grace finds locked in a holding cell? What exactly is the mysterious "Elpis," and why is Dr. Gideon obsessed with finding it? You get the gist.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/WCCFresidentevilrequiem4.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Resident Evil Requiem's story flows in a similar way to other recent entries in the series, which is to say, it gets its hooks in you early, but after an intense and attention-grabbing first few hours, it kind of gets lost in the weeds of <em>lore</em> and reveals that don't quite land with the impact you might hope. <strong>Is this an above-average story compared to other Resident Evil games? Probably, but by more general gaming standards, it's still a somewhat disappointing yarn, particularly for those hoping for a ton of new Leon character development</strong>. Yes, there are some attempts to bring a bit of emotional weight to Leon's personal journey (amidst all the wisecracks), but Capcom takes a pretty light touch with it. <strong>This is more Grace's story than Leon's</strong>.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/WCCFresidentevilrequiem5.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>And really, it's when Grace is front-and-center that Requiem's storytelling shines. This is easily <strong>Capcom's best new protagonist since the early days of the "classic" lineup</strong> of Chris, Jill, Leon, and Claire. She's more of a grounded, vulnerable character, much like Ethan in RE7 and RE8, but, crucially, you can actually see her face. This is an asset, as <strong>Grace's character model may be the most impressive Capcom has ever delivered</strong>. Her face is subtly expressive, with cutting-edge tech bringing every bead of sweat and strand of hair to life.</p>



<p><strong>Resident Evil Requiem is an impressive-looking game in general</strong>, with ray tracing on PS5 Pro and <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-supported-175-games-resident-evil-requiem-path-tracing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full path tracing on PC</a> adding to the game's atmosphere. The game also scales nicely, <strong>running at a consistently smooth 60 frames per second on the PS5 base model</strong> (I wasn't able to test the game on Switch 2, but previews have looked promising). This is a game that plays with light and darkness in really effective ways, and you truly feel every brain-splattering shotgun blast and blood-drenched death scene (this is the most gruesome Resident Evil ever by several magnitudes).</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/WCCFresidentevilrequiem6.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>In terms of gameplay, after a brief intro, <strong>the game settles into a nice rhythm</strong>, as you explore the Rhodes Hill Chronic Care Centre as Grace for a couple of hours at a time, with brief 20-to-30-minute interludes with Leon to break things up. The Grace sequences are good, old-school, undiluted Resident Evil in the vein of the Resident Evil 2 remake. The hospital is a classic labyrinth reminiscent of the Spencer Mansion of Raccoon City PD, full of improbable puzzles, weirdly-shaped keys, and a whole cast of grotesque "stalker" characters. The tension in these sections is <em>thick,</em> and <strong>Capcom has a lot of twisted fun with their new take on zombies</strong>, which retain some of their traits from when they were alive, doing things like obsessively turning off lights or cleaning up spilled blood (of which there is a lot).</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/WCCFresidentevilrequiem7.jpg"></a></figure>



<p><strong>Grace's parts of the game take the "survival" part of survival horror further than any Resident Evil in recent memory</strong> -- you only ever get a pistol, a powerful magnum-like gun with very limited ammo, and some throwable items to defend yourself with. Resources are quite limited, and to keep stocked, you need to engage with a novel new crafting system based around collecting infected blood from fallen enemies. Oh, and something similar to the terrifying Crimson Heads from the Resident Evil Remake returns here, with zombies rising a second time as extra-dangerous "Blister Heads" if you don't take extra steps to dispatch them. <strong>This is Resident Evil at its most sweaty, demanding, and intense</strong>.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/WCCFresidentevilrequiem8.jpg"></a></figure>



<p><strong>The Leon interludes are much more along the lines of Resident Evil 4: big, bombastic, one-liner-filled action set pieces</strong>. I wasn't sure how these bits would vibe with Grace's sections at first, particularly following an early Leon sequence in the hospital involving an entire ward of zombies and chainsaws that almost felt like (very, very bloody) slapstick. That said, I eventually began to appreciate these Leon intermissions as a bit of a pressure valve after the often gut-churning tension of the Grace sequences.</p>



<p>Frankly, I would have been quite happy if Resident Evil Requiem had continued in this rhythm for its entire runtime, but <strong>Capcom opted to take a hard left turn around halfway through the game</strong>. Without spoiling any story specifics, Resident Evil Requiem eventually returns to the ruins of Raccoon City (Capcom has been open about this in PR and trailers), and <strong>this doesn't just represent a change in location but a total shift in tone and gameplay</strong>.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/WCCFresidentevilrequiem9.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>At this midpoint in the game, <strong>Leon becomes your primary playable character</strong>. While the game doesn't go fully open-world, as there's still a specific path you need to follow, <strong>it does go "wide-linear"</strong> (the Downtown Seattle section from <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/the-last-of-us-part-ii/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Last of Us Part II</a> is perhaps a good comparison). An almost arcade-like scoring system is introduced, with Leon trading in points earned from kills at storage boxes for new gear, ammo, and healing items. The unsettlingly unique zombies of the first half of the game disappear in favor of generic ghouls that literally spawn by rising out of the ground. The carefully calibrated tension of the first half of the game largely evaporates.</p>



<p>I'll admit, when I first got to Raccoon City, I had a visceral "Oh no, what have they done?" reaction. <strong>I was having a great time with Resident Evil Requiem up to that point, and it just felt like a marked step down</strong>. Also, frustratingly, while Leon got those regular interludes in the first half of the game, <strong>Grace essentially disappears as you explore Raccoon City</strong>. To be fair, I did eventually get into the rhythm of the Raccoon City section of the game and found it fairly enjoyable in its own right, but it simply didn't measure up to what had come before. It felt like I was feasting on Resident Evil at its finest, a fantastic, sweaty-palmed elevation of what we got in the Resident Evil 2 remake, and then, suddenly, I was playing a Resident Evil Revelations game. And I don't mind the Revelations games, but they're kind of the fast food of the RE franchise.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/WCCFresidentevilrequiem10.jpg"></a></figure>



<p><strong>Thankfully, Resident Evil Requiem does right itself somewhat in its final hours</strong>, with a return to a more narrowly defined path and a heavy focus on referencing and reimagining various iconic elements from Resident Evil 2, which dedicated fans ought to appreciate. <strong>Grace also returns for an extended playable sequence</strong>, with the level of tension ratcheting up accordingly.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/WCCFresidentevilrequiem11.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>In the end, while you can't fault Capcom's level of ambition, <strong>I feel like Resident Evil Requiem tries to do a bit too much</strong>. It's basically every flavor of Resident Evil piled onto one plate, with a few new ingredients thrown in for good measure. Old-school Resident Evil 2 survival horror? Check. The gut-punch intensity of Resident Evil 7? Check. The balls-to-the-wall action of Resident Evil 4? Check. The tongue-in-cheek extravagance of Resident Evil Village? Check. Combat-free, dread-filled haunted house segments? Check. Slightly janky combat-heavy RE Revelations-like sections? Check. A Mad-Max-style motorcycle battle? Uh, check!</p>

</p></figure>



<p><strong>All these things are good (to varying degrees) in isolation, but eventually, the overall experience starts to feel a bit muddied</strong>. In my opinion, the very best Resident Evil games -- Resident Evil 4, Resident Evil 7 -- are the ones that pick a lane and tone, and largely stick to it. <strong>That said, there's no denying Resident Evil Requiem is a <em>journey</em>, with a substantial 15-hour campaign that feels twice as long given everything Capcom has packed into it</strong>. Whether this Resident Evil Retrospective approach appeals will largely depend on the player.</p>

						<section>
				<p>Resident Evil Requiem is the Every-Evil, as Capcom has taken all the things they've done with the franchise over the past decade or so and stitched them together into a towering monster of a survival horror game. Parts of this game are the best, scariest, and most intense this series has ever been, other parts are merely alright, but no part of the game is bad and it's all very distinctly Resident Evil. While it won't be everyone's new favorite, Resident Evil Requiem should hit enough right notes for most fans.</p>

												<ul>
							<h6>Pros</h6>
							<li>First half is classic RE formula perfection
</li><li>Grace is the series' best new character in ages

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p dir="ltr"><em>Resident Evil</em> returns to its roots in <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/resident-evil-9-requiem-closed-door-presentation-shows-classic-re-puzzles-and" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="33eaca7a-990f-42da-a131-81cbcae617b8" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Resident Evil Requiem</em></a>, introducing a new protagonist to crawl around a spooky building in a more classic approach to <em>Resident Evil</em>, while also giving the fans what they want in the return of Leon. Just how well does the story work around multiple gameplay styles, while also telling the latest story of zombie terrors and bioweapons?</p><p dir="ltr">The game opens with FBI agent Grace Ashcroft investigating a strange series of murders where the corpses that have appeared are all showing strange signs of bruising and bleeding. With the latest of these bodies being found in the same hotel where her mother, Alyssa Ashcroft, was murdered. Grace follows the trail, not realizing it was a trap to bring her to Rhodes Hill Care Center.</p><p dir="ltr">While Grace's investigation is taking place, Leon isn't too far behind, following up after the deaths of a handful of survivors of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/resident-evil-20-years-later" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="cbe64463-3b9a-42c5-9a0c-c274b905de74" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">original Raccoon City</a> outbreak, which leads him to Dr. Victor Gideon, the man in charge of Rhodes Hill Care Center.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2 dir="ltr">The Focus Of <em>Resident Evil Requiem's</em> Story Shifts With The Playable Character</h2><p dir="ltr">Throughout the story, the game relies heavily on the idea that while Grace is competent in her own right, the reality of getting thrown into a horror story with hulking monstrous creatures and zombies roaming the hallways has her looking for a way to get out asap. Along the way, other secrets crop up, including a blind girl locked away and a mysterious keyword that continues to pop up.</p><p dir="ltr">Leon's story, while still tense, follows a more action-forward focus as his story is less about exploration and more about completing his mission and getting to the bottom of the work that Dr. Gideon is doing.</p><p dir="ltr">Some of the elements of the story that I enjoyed the most were how much there was a focus on exploration and learning about Rhode Hill from environmental clues and documents, the intrigue surrounding the events of the story, and how intelligently paced the story was swapping between Grace and Leon.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/resident-evil-requiem-puzzles.jpg?itok=5HzQ9P8- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/resident-evil-requiem-puzzles.jpg?itok=pLJg5u_V 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="675">
                  

  </picture><p dir="ltr">Grace's gameplay is similar to that of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/resident-evil-7-biohazard-review-groovy" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="1a560db9-346a-4407-98cb-00ff8b36ed59" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Resident Evil 7</em></a> and <em>8</em>: you're a fish out of water making your way through unfamiliar territory. Exploration is promoted as a way for you to obtain additional resources, while also not trying to kick the zombified hornet's nest and get yourself stuck in a worse situation.</p><p dir="ltr">While there were a few puzzles, those that were of note were all part of the primary story. Don't expect to be doing too much to go out of your way to get side-items, but the things that you do find, like Antique Coins in safes, are definitely worth tracking down.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Inventory Management Had Me Hording</h2><p dir="ltr">Coupled with this is an incredibly limited inventory, starting out at just 8 slots, two to three of which are pretty much always going to be occupied by a gun, some extra ammo, and a makeshift shiv.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/resident-evil-requiem-grace-inventory.jpg?itok=qZ5gB2Qo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/resident-evil-requiem-grace-inventory.jpg?itok=KKk6AwqM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="675">
                  

  </picture><p dir="ltr">From the central hub chamber of Rhodes Hill, you are met with a large locked door that requires three specific items to open the door, allowing you to get free. You can obtain these by working your way through the various rooms and tight hallways of the Care Center, obtaining access to different restricted areas of the building, and doing your fair share of running away from monstrosities.</p><p dir="ltr">First setting foot in the Care Center, the environment was tense, I found myself creeping EVERYWHERE and picking up everything I possibly could. The limited inventory definitely stressed me out and resulted in me yoyoing from where I was in the mansion back to the save room and the item chest.</p><p dir="ltr">While it was frustrating to spend so much time going back and forth, I couldn't help but also appreciate that if I had been able to carry every weapon, charm, bottle, piece of ammo, and molotov cocktail I picked up, the environment would just not be the same.</p><h2 dir="ltr">The Pacing Was Perfect</h2><p dir="ltr">An aspect of <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em> that I absolutely loved was the pacing. As I stated above, the settings were tense as Grace was skulking through new hallways, until I knew the layout and I knew the locations of just about every zombie and obstacle. At the point the feeling of safety kicked in and I was far more spirited about my actions… that's when the setting would change.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/resident-evil-requiem-stealth.jpg?itok=XBdHk51_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/resident-evil-requiem-stealth.jpg?itok=SzuB-1IT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="675">
                  

  </picture><p dir="ltr">Either a new location would be unlocked, or embarked upon, or perhaps that would be the moment that we'd switch to Leon in a bit more of a 'high action' scenario. After getting that action back out of my system, we'd return to Grace, scared in the dark once again, and it would completely reset my fear while playing.</p><p dir="ltr">This reset of the tone also tended to go hand in hand with major plot moments and reveals. Just as Leon discovered something important about Grace, you'd cut away, having to push forward to learn more.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Leon's Gameplay Finds A Sweet Spot Between Action and Horror</h2><p dir="ltr">Unlike Grace's gameplay, focusing on light stealth and puzzle solving, Leon's is more about making your way to an objective through a decent-sized horde or just one really massive Zombie. <em>Resident Evil</em> fans will immediately recognize the change in gameplay as your inventory blooms from 8 slots to a full briefcase of storage.</p><p dir="ltr">Accompanying the action-forward gameplay was also a number of larger boss fights, which normally consist of a running section where Leon needs to charge through doorways, leaping over and under obstacles, for fear of instant death, that then ends in an intricate arena. Here you'll find a way to put some distance between yourself and the opponent before turning around and trying to fill them with the most powerful bullets you have at your disposal.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/resident-evil-requiem-leon-boss.jpg?itok=aCL2Jy-m 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/resident-evil-requiem-leon-boss.jpg?itok=0kcci7RB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="675">
                  

  </picture><p dir="ltr">While formulaic, these fights did up the tension for Leon a fair bit, and served as good high points of progress for him. For the most part, Leon's gameplay leans far more into the fear of the zombies in numbers overpowering you than experiencing one tense zombie encounter at a time.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><em>Resident Evil Requiem's</em> Lighting Is A Paid Actor</h2><p dir="ltr">The game wouldn't be anywhere near as spooky without the incredible locations and just how good the RE Engine's lighting systems are.</p><p dir="ltr">You've got everything you expect out of <em>Resident Evil's</em> locations: a creepy old mansion, decrepit basements, apocalyptic cityscapes, and pristine laboratories. While it was the first time seeing many of these places, the DNA of <em>Resident Evil</em> from the original game ran deep.</p><p dir="ltr">When in those darker locations, the unpowered hallways and basements, the light shines just enough to reveal the features, but lets you lose context as the light trails off. Catching portions of chain fences, bannisters, or other obstructions, I'd catch the shifting light in the corner of my eye, jumping that a zombie might be nearby.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/resident-evil-requiem-laboratory.jpg?itok=POcXUYH2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/resident-evil-requiem-laboratory.jpg?itok=L7fynGNO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="675">
                  

  </picture><p dir="ltr">Moments I loved, and also hated, were when whatever large creature you were hiding from couldn't be seen in the dark aside from the silhouette cast from the light behind them. No features, just a dark, skulking form that you were hoping wouldn't notice you.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><em>Resident Evil Requiem</em> Promotes Replayability, Even If It's The Same Story</h2><p dir="ltr">As is to be expected with <em>Resident Evi</em>l, as you complete the game, you'll get access to a harder difficulty mode, and the chance to replay the story with some of the items you already unlocked in your arsenal.</p><p dir="ltr">Each Achievement or Trophy completed translates to points you can use to purchase unique weapons, and the harder ones can even give you items that will make completing the game on a harder difficulty just a bit easier if you don't want the full challenge.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/resident-evil-requiem-map-exploration.jpg?itok=I1-x3XW3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">

  </picture><p dir="ltr">I'm a big fan of Achievements and Trophies being used as a way to push a player to complete a game in a wholly unique way. Beating it in a certain amount of time, beating it without using healing items, etc. While it's still the same plot and story beats on each replay, there are equipment and goals that will make the way you take that journey just slightly different each time.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><em>Resident Evil Requiem</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2><p dir="ltr"><em>Resident Evil Requiem</em> successfully threads the needle between the gameplay of Grace with a focus on <em>Resident Evil 7</em> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/resident-evil-village" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="7d76fc24-612e-4e7e-9804-64ccee40af28" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Village</em></a>-style exploration and combat, and a more action-packed story suited for a modern-day Leon (without falling into the territory of <em>Resident Evil 6</em>). There's plenty for new and old fans of <em>Resident Evil</em> to get into with this focus on a new character that might also prompt them to explore some of the rest of Resident Evil's latest remake offerings.</p><p dir="ltr">Fans of the direction that <em>Resident Evil </em>has been on will have an excellent time hopping into the latest adventure, fighting for their lives while uncovering yet another secret plot.</p><hr><p><em><strong>Resident Evil Requiem </strong>was reviewed on PlayStation 5 with a copy provided by the publisher - All screenshots were taken by the reviewer over 15 hours of gameplay</em></p></div><div><p><span><div>

Do you like architecture that plays tricks on you? Secret rooms in DOOM? The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0QsHKH77MI">Ashtray Maze</a> in Control? Thinking with Portals? <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/action-half-life-the-5-a-m">The 5 a.m.</a>? That painting of some books outside the lockers in the British Library that bends queasily as you approach, revealing itself to be a horrible wedge of tomeflesh, projecting outward into our realm like some dead author's imprisoned soul? I guess you’ll be playing the new Ultrakill update then.</p>
<p>It introduces the eighth layer of Hell, Fraud, in which nothing you perceive with your eyes can be trusted. A problematic prospect, for a “video” game. Here’s the trailer. I promise you that the play button below isn’t an illusion. Are <em>you</em> an illusion? Blink twice for "Yes".

If you’re yet to sample Ultrakill, it’s a style-scoring FPS that plays like a chainsaw joust between <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/quake">Quake</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/devil-may-cry">Devil May Cry</a>. Arsi "Hakita" Patala is the primary developer and New Blood are the publishers. While we’ve never quite written up the early access release, it’s an auld Alice O touchstone, appearing in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ultrakill">no less than four</a> Screenshot Saturday Mondays and one What’s Better.
</p><p>
Dirty jankster Graham Smith was also a fan, before he stabbed us in the back with his ridiculous new independent <a href="https://www.jank.cool/">website</a>, built out of farts and hairballs. “I've started to find it difficult to tell the difference between the many mid-'90s shooter revivals,” faithless loser Graham <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ultrakills-demo-offers-a-colourful-quake-like-where-blood-is-fuel">wrote back in 2020</a>. “Yer Amid Evils, DUSKs and so on all wash over me and leave only a refreshed desire to play more <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/devil-daggers">Devil Daggers</a>. Ultrakill appeals more than the others however, as it's pairing its Quake-inspired weaponry with movement abilities, combos and the need to recharge your health via getting enemy blood on you. There looks to be a rhythm and flow to it.”
</p>
<p>
The Fraud update was supposed to be here months ago, but it turns out deceiving the player at every turn whilst still allowing for coherent firefights is pretty hard! As the developers <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1229490/view/526488194423718484?l=english">have explained on Steam</a>: “when we embarked on this upside down / inside out journey to create a layer full of lies and non-euclidean portal technology - we underestimated just how much work would go into not only getting all of these things to simply work, but also rewriting every enemy to be able to use the portals, making sound and light and reflections travel through the portals, and so on and so forth.” 
</p>
<p>
New Blood actually hired a new programmer specifically to help with the Fraud update. Oh, to be a fly on the wall for that particular job interview. “Are you great at lying?” “Yes.” “Hold on, are you lying about being great at lying?” “Yes.” “Was that last answer also a lie?” “Yes.” “Ummmmmmmmm. You’re hired.”

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p><span>The line between a reflective look back at a series’ legacy and something that feels like pandering fanservice is razor thin, and I don’t know which one </span><i><span>Resident Evil Requiem</span></i><span> is trying to be. The latest entry in Capcom’s horror series is coming out during its 30th anniversary, and while it is one of the most <a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-9-requiem-preview-leon-gameplay-grace-2000662270">robust marriages of horror and action</a> the series has ever put forth, I can’t help but feel like it stumbles on its way to saying something more profound <a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-series-lore-requiem-leon-kennedy-wesker-ethan-winters-umbrella-2000672884">about its own legacy</a>. Capcom has touted </span><i><span>Requiem</span></i><span> as a fulcrum point in which the old generation of survivors converges with a new one, but when all is said and done, it kind of just feels like another </span><i><span>Resident Evil</span></i><span> game.</span></p> <p><span>That might be all you’re looking for, and Grace and Leon’s story delivers a pretty great one of those. But as I reached the climax of </span><i><span>Requiem</span></i><span>, the contemplative review that had been forming in my head started to dwindle in favor of a more confused one. </span><i><span>Requiem </span></i><span>is a polished fusion of nearly every era of </span><i><span>Resident Evil </span></i><span>Capcom has ever devised, but it can’t quite decide if it’s reflecting on those eras in a meaningful way or merely playing the hits for those who want to point at the screen and nod at every reference. It’s the kind of “break in case of emergency” retreat to basics you pull out when your series is in trouble, which makes it confounding that </span><i><span>Resident Evil</span></i><span>, a series that <a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-7-and-village-are-damn-near-perfect-switch-2-ports-2000673230">is in damn fine standing as of late</a>, would do something so safe when it had all the runway it needed to do something brave.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000673332" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000673332"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000673332">© Capcom / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><i><span>Requiem </span></i><span>is a dueling story starring both frightened newcomer Grace Ashcroft and grizzled veteran Leon Kennedy, both of whom find themselves tied up in the remnants of the Umbrella Corporation’s bioterrorism. Grace is kidnapped by a former researcher from the organization for reasons she doesn’t quite understand, while Leon is searching for a possible cure for a disease lying dormant that he and other Raccoon City residents have apparently carried with them in the decades since </span><i><span>Resident Evil 2</span></i><span>.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Circumstance brings them both to the Rhodes Hill Chronic Care Center, where Grace is held prisoner and Leon is searching for answers. Here is the beginning of a tale in which </span><i><span>Resident Evil</span></i><span>’s many pasts converge, and there’s a lot of lore to sift through that will delight sickos and at least intrigue anyone who has even a passing knowledge of Leon and company’s history. For most of </span><i><span>Requiem</span></i><span>, I was enamored by how many old threads the game tugged at, as it seemed to be really reckoning with the decades of damage suffered by both its post-apocalyptic world and by those who have fought through it all with a handgun and a dream.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000673333" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000673333"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000673333">© Capcom / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><i><span>Resident Evil </span></i><span>is a horror series, but it’s also a soap opera of wise-cracking bioterrorist fighters now reaching their twilight years and feeling the weight of all the carnage they’ve seen. When it’s at its best, there’s a real weight to Leon’s contemplation and Grace’s self-actualization. When it’s at its worst, </span><i><span>Requiem </span></i><span>feels like it’s only playing pretend. It gestures at a moment of great change before it dusts off its shoulders and gets back to doing what </span><i><span>Resident Evil </span></i><span>always does. Exceptionally well, mind you. But it stops short of making meaningful use of all this reflection and all these nods to decades of history. With maybe one or two exceptions, I wouldn’t be surprised if nothing from </span><i><span>Requiem </span></i><span>really factors into the future.</span></p>

 <p><span>The Care Center is not the only stage in </span><i><span>Requiem</span></i><span>, but is the most concise at getting the game’s core conceit across. Grace is a green survivor solving puzzles in an effort to escape the facility, and Leon is a walking arsenal that tanks through zombie attacks that would one-shot most humans. Even as they both explore the same facility, they move through the space very differently. Grace’s inventory is much more limited, her safety reliant on crafting whatever tools she can piece together from things you find in your surroundings, and even a bullet in her handgun does demonstrably less damage than it does when Leon is wielding a similar weapon. Her segments are gripping, as her lack of raw power means that even a low-level zombie is a threat, and more often than not, she’s also running from something much, much more powerful and ugly to look at than a doctor who’s been infected.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000673334" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000673334"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000673334">© Capcom / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Playing as Grace is a constant tug-of-war between your limited bag space and the few precious resources you can find scattered around the environment. Where most </span><i><span>Resident Evil </span></i><span>games have a sense of power creep that builds over the course of the story, Grace stays pretty grounded throughout the game. Even in the late-game sections, she’s pretty much using the same tools she did in Rhodes Hill, only against far greater threats. </span><i><span>Requiem</span></i><span>’s commitment to making Grace’s sections so markedly different from Leon’s is how it maintained a terrifying vise grip on my nervous system that </span><i><span>Resident Evil </span></i><span>games often discard in the latter half as I pick up a shotgun and stockpile ammo in my pack. Yeah, I gained a greater understanding of Grace’s tools, but no amount of play time was going to help her go toe to toe with a zombie. If you find hide-and-seek-style horror exhausting, I’m sorry to tell you that such segments don’t really go away in </span><i><span>Requiem</span></i><span> as long as you’re playing as Grace. But </span><i><span>Requiem </span></i><span>attempts to balance them out with Leon’s segments, which are some of the best realizations ever of the action horror the series has leaned into since </span><i><span>Resident Evil 4</span></i><span>.</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Requiem</span></i><span>’s duality as it pays homage to every era of </span><i><span>Resident Evil</span></i><span> is most on display when you swap over to Leon. In segments like Rhodes Hill, Leon navigates the same space as Grace but with a different toolset, which in quiet moments allowed me to access areas or open supply caches Grace couldn’t thanks to the hatchet he has on his belt at all times. Meanwhile his plethora of firearms and combat armor meant I could pretty fearlessly walk around the area in a way that was cathartic after sneaking around as Grace for several hours. How thorough you are as Grace or Leon in one section may help the other when you switch perspectives; you might, for instance, walk through an area as Leon and have fewer enemies to face in a brawl because you took some of them out as Grace. Walking around a location and seeing the remains of carnage from when I had done so previously as the other playable character, it clicked for me that these two survivors aren’t on separate paths, but an interlinked one in which each side could influence the other.&nbsp;</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000673337" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000673337"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000673337">© Capcom / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>When Leon’s not simply walking through Grace’s mess, however, he is as much of a blast to play as he’s always been. He’s powerful, his guns are always well-stocked with ammunition, and every time he reloads a weapon it looks cool as shit. If you know a zombie’s weak points (the head and the kneecaps), you’re pretty much playing with your food as Leon. A zombie’s pained moans and growls are no longer a reason to cower in fear; those are the sounds of Leon’s next victim as he practically dances on their undead form with an axe and pistol in hand. </span><i><span>Requiem</span></i><span> hams up </span><i><span>Resident Evil</span></i><span>’s campiest excesses with Leon, and the guy’s introspection on his decades-long career killing zombies while the same infection he’s been fighting all this time grows within him manages to ground the action and keep it from reaching an insufferable level of cheesy unseriousness.&nbsp;</span></p> <div>           <ul>                           <li>                 <p>Back-of-the-box quote:</p>                 <p>"The stuff you like is still good, mostly!"</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Developer:</p>                 <p>Capcom</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Type of game:</p>                 <p>Horror game with an emphasis on both hide-and-seek scares and zombie action.</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Liked:</p>                 <p>Leon and Grace, the best of both worlds for scares and shooting.</p>               </li>                               </ul><ul>                                         <li>                 <p>Disliked:</p>                 <p>Lopsided split between its protagonists; the introspective navel gazing doesn't really pay off.</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Platforms:</p>                 <p>PC, PS5 (played on), Xbox Series X/S, Switch 2.</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Release date:</p>                 <p>February 27, 2026</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Played:</p>                 <p>~8 hours for first playthrough.</p>               </li>                                     </ul>         </div>  <p><span>Unfortunately, Leon’s earliest segments in </span><i><span>Requiem </span></i><span>gave me the wrong impression of how much the game divides time between its leads. Despite being initially presented as Grace’s story, Leon’s play time ultimately dwarfs hers by a pretty significant margin, to the point where I’d say she takes a backseat in the latter half of the game. The lopsided split felt odd in the moment, and only felt worse by the time </span><i><span>Requiem </span></i><span>ended and a lot of the ideas it had been gesturing at regarding his inner struggle and Grace’s potential didn’t really go anywhere.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000673335" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000673335"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000673335">© Capcom / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><i><span>Requiem </span></i><span>starts with a lot of promise, seemingly striving to pave the way for the future of the series that it then seems too afraid to follow through on, but the bigger swings it had the chance to take only happen if a game is interested in real introspection about its legacy. </span><i><span>Resident Evil </span></i><span>is 30 years old now, and we’ve reached a point in this medium’s existence where a lot of franchises are celebrating long lives and considering what the next 30 years looks like. </span><i><span>Requiem </span></i><span>seems mostly content to think about the past and not give much thought to the future. But hey, the guns shoot good, the scares still hit, and Leon still looks good in a tight shirt. So maybe there’s no real need to make sweeping changes when the formula of multiple eras still goes down real smooth, even if it leaves me feeling a little bit empty.</span></p>      </div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-requiem-review-leon-grace-capcom-ps5-pc-2000673329]]></content:encoded>

<p>Xbox CEO Asha Sharma discusses the brand’s efforts to retain user engagement and grow its player base in an increasingly competitive landscape.</p>



<p>In 2026, there are so many entities fighting for engagement. Social media apps like YouTube and TikTok are competing with streamers like Netflix and Prime Video, as well as video game platforms like PlayStation and Xbox.</p>



<p>As Xbox looks to reshape its future following the retirement of Phil Spencer and the appointment of Asha Sharma as new CEO, the organization is recommitting to players rather than chasing emerging trends.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/exclusive-talking-to-new-xbox-ceo-asha-sharma-and-cco-matt-booty" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">In an interview with Windows Central’s Jez Corden</a>, Sharma was asked about her plans to explore new avenues to help Xbox grow its audience. In response, she reaffirmed her commitment to loyal users, saying that if the time comes to invest in a different community, they will evaluate these things on an individual basis.</p>



<p>What I don’t want to do is have any creator at Xbox dilute their focus to chase an emerging community,” Sharma explained. “If we want to invest in a new community, we’ll look at how to do that. But it’s really important that people stay true to their core when they’re building.”</p>







<p>Elsewhere in the interview, she discussed her plans to drive Xbox’s rise through hardware and first-party offerings.

<p>Marathon is Bungie’s foray into the extraction shooter scene, with the Destiny veterans taking their slick first-person gunplay and applying it to the tried and tested formula. If you’re curious about the project and can’t wait until launch to try it, then Bungie has just the thing for you…</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/marathon/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/games/marathon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marathon</a> Server Slam Playtest. In the weekend leading up to the official launch, Bungie are hosting a free-to-play event for anyone to join and give Marathon a shot. It’s a great chance for Bungie to stress-test its servers, whilst the fanbase can decide whether they want to buy into the long-term future of the franchise. </p>







<p>If you’re eager to get involved, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/bungie/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/bungie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bungie</a> have officially announced whether you can preload the Marathon Server Slam Playtest, and all of the details can be found down below.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-preload-the-marathon-server-slam-playtest">Can You Preload The Marathon Server Slam Playtest</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Don’t miss it! Image by Bungie.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Sadly, you will not be able to preload the Marathon Server Slam Playtest, so you’ll have to hit download the second it launches on February 26.</strong></p>



<p>This news was confirmed in the official Marathon Discord, and it’s disappointed a lot of the player base who wanted to dive right in the second it goes live. However, there was a silver lining, as in the same message, it was confirmed that you will be able to preload Marathon for the full release.</p>

</ul>



<p>So, for those dying to return to Tau Ceti after the Server Slam Playtest, fear not, as once Marathon goes live on March 5, you’ll have the option to have it downloaded and ready for launch. </p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-take-part-in-the-marathon-server-slam-playtest">How To Take Part In The Marathon Server Slam Playtest</h2>



<p><strong>To get involved in the Marathon Server Slam Playtest, all you need to do is download it for free once it releases on whichever platform you intend to play it on.</strong></p>

<p>Bungie is releasing one final gameplay outing for its new shooter before release day: The Marathon Server Slam Test. Its start times are crucial if you want to get into the action straightaway, and this guide has everything you need to know.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/marathon/" id="98" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marathon</a>‘s reputation has gotten stronger as time has gone on. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/bungie/" id="99" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bungie</a> has clearly listened to any feedback and criticisms, taken them on board, and the final result should be very promising: Could it rival ARC Raiders?</p>



<p>It remains to be seen, but you can see for yourself the state of the FPS via the Marathon Server Slam Test.</p>
