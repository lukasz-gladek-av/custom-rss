            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fifa-konami-esports-partner<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>FIFA has announced that Konami is its new partner for the FIFAe World Cup esports event, replacing former partner EA, with whom FIFA parted ways back in 2022.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/konami-replaces-ea-as-fifas-esports-partner" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a GamesIndustry.biz report</a>, the free-to-play football (sorry, but I'm going to be saying "football" throughout rather than "soccer") game <i>eFootball&nbsp;</i>will now be the game in which the esports World Cup takes place.</p>
<p>Naturally, prior to this partnership, that honor went to EA's <i>FIFA&nbsp;</i>series, but that franchise was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-fifa-games-to-be-replaced-with-ea-sports-fc-next-year">renamed to&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-fifa-games-to-be-replaced-with-ea-sports-fc-next-year">EA Sports FC</a>&nbsp;</em>following the split between EA and FIFA. A reason for the split was technically never officially revealed, although <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/it-really-looks-like-fifa-23-wont-be-thing" rel="noopener" target="_blank">it was reported</a> that a licensing fee dispute was the cause.</p>

<p>A total of 18 countries have been invited to take part, including England, France, Brazil, and Portugal, among others. The champion will be named at the conclusion of each tournament.</p>
<p>Konami senior executive officer Koji Kobayashi says he's grateful to FIFA for giving Konami the opportunity to play host to the FIFAe World Cup, and that it looks forward to sharing the "enthusiasm, excitement, and joy" of players worldwide.</p>
<p>FIFA CBO Romy Gai, meanwhile, says the association is "incredibly excited" to team up with Konami, and that the partnership is part of FIFA's "mission to promote football globally".</p>

<p>Still, FIFA's decision to partner with the studio that created the game which was, at one point, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/efootball-2022-just-released-but-its-already-worst-rated-game-on-steam">Steam's worst-rated game of 2021</a>&nbsp;is perhaps a touch questionable. The game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1665460/eFootball/#app_reviews_hash" rel="noopener" target="_blank">still holds a Mixed rating on Steam</a>, although in fairness, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2669320/EA_SPORTS_FC_25/#app_reviews_hash" rel="noopener" target="_blank">so does&nbsp;<em>EA Sports FC 25</em></a>.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in Konami news, the company's gaming CEO Steve Sutherland was recently <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241010529209/en/Konami-Gaming-CEO-Steve-Sutherland-Awarded-AGEM-Memorial-Award-for-Excellence-in-Commercial-Gaming-Professionalism" rel="noopener" target="_blank">handed a trade association award</a> for "excellence in commercial gaming professionalism".

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/astro-a50-wireless-headset-review/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Logitech has released the Astro A50 Wireless 5th Gen headset, an audio-based marvel that will sit atop a gamer’s head as if it were a crown. This versatile, sumptuous device offers unparalleled audio quality, stellar comfort levels, and intense customisation options – but all that is reflected in the price. If you’ve been sitting on the fence about this device because of the price point, hopefully, this Astro A50 Wireless headset review can set your mind straight.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-pretty-penny-gorgeous-peripherals">Pretty Penny, Gorgeous Peripherals</h2>



<p>The Astro A50 Wireless headset is now in its fifth generation, and this latest evolution is a superb one. Logitech has packed so many features into one device with the new Astro A50, allowing users to take advantage of the company’s proprietary LIGHTSPEED technology and PLAYSYNC Audio mechanics.</p>



<p>That means that the wireless connectivity of the Astro A50 is lightning fast, and thanks to the enhanced base station, you can connect it to three devices at once and switch between them at the tap of a tactile button – it’s brilliant.</p>



<p>It’ll run up quite a bill, though. The Astro A50 Wireless Gen 5 headset floats around $300, which makes it one of the most expensive gaming headsets on the market, but believe me when I say it’s worth every penny. From the broadcast-grade omnidirectional microphone to the Pro-G Graphene drivers, every inch of the Astro A50 Gen 5 headset is <strong>premium</strong>.</p>



<p>It comes in at just 363 grams, which means that the hulking frame of the A50 is decisively misleading. It looks like it should be much heavier, but it’s a wonder to wear it for hours on end without suffering from any fatigue. No matter what game you’re playing, you’ll be soaking up pinpoint spatial sound while taking advantage of phenomenally comfortable padding around the ears and the top of your head.</p>



<p>It has now been more than 12 years since the first Astro A50 headset was released, and from content creators to competitive esports players, it has become a firm favourite of so many gamers worldwide. The Gen 5 release represents the cherry on top; the icing on the cake in the form of a true multi-dimensional headset that’s a must-have for the multi-platform gamer.</p>



<h2 id="h-into-the-performance">Into the Performance</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The Astro A50 Wireless Gen 5 headset looks good in black or white, but how does it perform?</figcaption></figure>







<p>I’m in love with the Astro A50’s magnetic charging dock. As a forgetful gamer, I’ll leave wireless accessories out until their batteries run flat, but since testing the Astro A50, I haven’t once managed to leave it hanging on a monitor or sitting on my desk. It’s <strong>satisfying </strong>to click the headset into the stand and have it sitting in pride of place on a nearby shelf.</p>



<p>The status indicators on the base unit are super helpful, too. Even when you’re wearing the headset, a slight glance to the base unit will give you an indication of the battery level. With up to 24 hours of playtime on a full charge, you’ll find it hard to run the headset into the ground, which is fantastic.</p>



<p>The <strong>one drawback </strong>I have is that my PlayStation and Xbox consoles are across the other side of the room to my PC, so it’s almost not possible to have them connected to the base unit unless I use a really long USB-C cable. It means I can’t use the PLAYSYNC technology effectively, but it’s not a deal-breaker for me, as I’d have bought this <strong>to use it</strong> <strong>exclusively </strong>on PC games.</p>



<p>On all platforms, you can take advantage of the ‘mixamp-like’ audio mixing features, and on PlayStation and Xbox, you can use Dolby Atmos or PlayStation 3D Audio for better depth of sound. </p>



<p>The Astro A50 Gen 5 really shines brightest on PC, though. This is where you can utilise the G Hub software to fully tweak the device (G App is useful elsewhere), and you’ll get 24-bit audio by default without needing to worry about the HDMI 2.1 AV passthrough requirement.</p>



<p>I found that when playing a shooter like Escape from Tarkov, where every sound matters, I was picking up footsteps and audio cues much clearer, and the directional clarity was second-to-none. I’ve been around the houses when it comes to headsets, and the Astro A50 Gen 5 is without a doubt the cream of the crop.</p>



<p>Ultimately, Logitech’s Astro A50 Wireless Gen 5 headset is an audio experience in a tangible form. It sounds phenomenal, feels great on your head, and offers enough features under the hood to make the price point worthwhile. When you throw in the high-tech and attractive base unit, you’ve got one hell of a peripheral package that any gamer should be proud to own.</p>

                <p>Giant spiders have been a fantasy trope for a long time. From Shelob in The Lord of the Rings to the arachnids in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dragon-age-origins-review/1900-6238632/" data-ref-id="1900-6238632">Dragon Age: Origins</a> and its subsequent follow-up games. But later this month, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-has-gone-gold/1100-6526915/" data-ref-id="1100-6526915">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> will buck this trend by excluding spiders from the entire game.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dragonage/comments/1fz1yyu/comment/lqzsrqc/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a Reddit thread</a>, a BioWare associate community manager confirmed that there are no spiders in The Veilguard. This marks a significant change for the franchise, since the arachnids were so common in Origins and also present in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dragon-age-ii-review/1900-6301579/" data-ref-id="1900-6301579">Dragon Age 2</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dragon-age-inquisition-review/1900-6415949/" data-ref-id="1900-6415949">Dragon Age: Inquisition</a>.</p><p>No one seems to have asked the obvious question about whether there's an in-game reason for the absence of spiders. In the real world, Saint Patrick's Day is partially based on the myth that Saint Patrick drove all of the snakes out of Ireland. If someone rid Thedas of all its spiders, shouldn't they get their own holiday? It seems only fair, even if it's just an excuse to get drunk in-game.</p><p>Just because the spiders are gone doesn't mean The Veilguard will be lacking in fearsome enemies to fight. One of the recently revealed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-gameplay-trailer-unleashes-an-epic-dragon-battle/1100-6526689/" data-ref-id="1100-6526689">gameplay trailers depicted an epic battle</a> between the player's character Rook and a blighted dragon. Perhaps whoever got rid of the spiders should have dealt with the dragons first.</p><p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard will hit PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S on October 31.</p>

Activision said this requirement is in place to "deliver the highest-quality visuals while also reducing the game's overall storage space on your hard drive."</p>

"With these capabilities, we can cycle content that is less frequently used by players to a streaming cache, avoiding the need to download it directly to your device's storage. Going forward, more content will be included in this cache," Activision said in August.</p><p>While being always online is a requirement for Black Ops 6's campaign, Activision confirmed that players do not need a paid subscription to PlayStation Plus or Game Pass Core to play the story mode.</p><p>Black Ops 6's campaign takes place in 1991 during the Gulf War and tells a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-6-trailer-suggests-another-mind-bending-campaign-plus-pizza-dlc/1100-6526962/" data-ref-id="1100-6526962">mind-bending story involving conspiracies. </a> Unlike with 2023's Modern Warfare 3, Black Ops 6 is not offering early access to the game's campaign for people who pay extra.</p><p>"This year, we made the decision to ensure the community gets to dig in to any modes that they want at the same time, so we are back to one massive global launch moment October 25th," Activision said.</p><p>Players who beat the Black Ops 6 campaign will earn a variety of rewards for multiplayer, Zombies, and other parts of the game. Check out GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-6-here-are-all-the-rewards-earned-by-playing-the-campaign/1100-6527059/" data-ref-id="1100-6527059">full rundown of all the Black Ops 6 campaign rewards.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/10/mario-luigi-brothership-preview/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>It’s a little odd to think it, but since the turn of the century, Mario’s been as much of a role-playing powerhouse as a platforming icon. Between <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/21/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-switch-review/">Paper Mario</a>, Mario &amp; Luigi and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/10/17/mario-rabbids-sparks-of-hope-review/">Mario + Rabbids</a>, there’s actually been more new RPGs than jump man adventures, and that lead is only going to be extended next month with the release of Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership.</p>
<p><iframe title="Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership – Making Memories in Concordia – Nintendo Switch" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tffEKtODS4g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>it’s actually been nine years since the last new Mario &amp; Luigi game, with a couple of remakes during the Nintendo 3DS’s twilight years. The original developer AlphaDream closed down after the last of these remakes failed to perform, leaving the series’ future in doubt. However, it’s lovely to see it get another chance. We don’t know the name of the studio yet – Nintendo being as mysterious as ever – but some of the original developers were noted as being involved.</p>


<p>This new game sees the most iconic Italian brothers since Romulus and Remus thrown into another adventure in strange lands. Concordia has been shattered into islands, and this dynamic duo are the only ones that can help the local partner characters Connie and Snoutlet –&nbsp;not a pig –&nbsp;drag the realm back together again.</p>
<p>With an island adventure before them, they’re going to need a boat. What they end up with is Shipshape Island, a ship that’s also an island, able to traverse the seas and search for new islands to launch Mario and Luigi at from a cannon. Each island then needs to be linked back to Shipshape by finding a magical lighthouse and connecting their beacons together.</p>


<p>We got to fire ourselves at two islands from the game, showing that early evolution of introductory gameplay, as well as some of the pair’s new tricks. Landing on Twister Island, and needing to reach one of the locals who’s now stranded up on a clifftop, the famous twisting vines having withdrawn because nobody’s dancing anymore… and nobody’s dancing because there’s a serious hair gel shortage. It’s a real struggle, but thankfully it’s not that tricky to find Spiralia, the one person who knows how to make hair gel, and get them back to their shop, even if they work in the middle of a forest that’s full of bugs they are absolutely petrified of.</p>
<p>It’s an absolutely barmy series of situations in isolation, and I hope there’s a bit more heft to the overarching narrative of the game. Still, this allows the familiar Mario &amp; Luigi tandem gameplay shines through. Just getting around the world is a quirky little challenge, as pressing ‘A’ makes Mario jump and ‘B’ makes Luigi jump, who is invariably right on his heels, and you can get the pleasing one-two jump as you lead the pair around (though it’s far more forgiving than I remember the GBA original being). There’s some environmental puzzling here, as helping Spiralia requires you to carry her past meandering bugs, hopping over ledges and passing her back and forth between the two brothers.</p>
<p>Later, on Merrygo Island, a new Luigi Logic system shows up, with the taller brother able to take more of an independent role in certain scenarios. It could be helping you chase after collectibles that float around, and Luigi splitting off to go man a gong trigger, while Mario heads up to get a view of the surroundings –&nbsp;Merrygo Island is home to a huge circular maze, which needs to be shifted and moved around to let the pair pass through.</p>

<p>Then there’s the brotherly baddie bashing in combat. Similar to Paper Mario, every encounter is triggered by running into enemies in the world, sending you into battle with the possibility that you can get a free attack (or that the enemy does). From there you’re in a fairly standard turn-based system, picking from a jump attack, hammer attack or a special shell attack. The twist is that every single attack has Mario and Luigi teaming up, with active button presses for the two characters boosting your damage. From an acrobatic launch into the air, to winding up and hitting hammers together for a whirling dervish of damage, or the back and forth passing of a shell to build up to a shell attack, it’s a quick little QTE that’s nice and straightforward. That said, it is visually and mechanically quite repetitive with the limited abilities available this early in the game, and I’m definitely looking forward to more shell attacks later on.</p>
<p>More difficult to grasp is the timing of button presses when defending and possible countering enemy attacks. They all have multiple attack types to learn, and you have to read not only what attack is coming, but which brother it’s going to target. This is where the real learning curve comes in the game’s combat, and I was often getting caught out, especially with return attacks as enemies swoop back onto screen.</p>

<p>A further factor is the Plugs, consumable modifiers that boost various abilities alongside levelling up and grabbing new gear. You can apply multiple plugs and they can provide boosts to make counters more easy, give your attacks a dizzy effect, boost damage against flying enemies, drop an extra spike ball on an enemy with an Excellent rating, and more. Each plug has a set number of charges before needing to be replaced, but you can swap them in and out pretty much whenever you like. It’s a neat little system, relying on finding collectable energy in the world to craft them.</p>
<p>There’s plenty more that we didn’t get to really explore. Shipshape island will naturally be a hub for the game, and there’s some little back and forth minigame challenges to find around the different islands that we only really dipped a toe into. There’s also some fun team up abilities for the world exploration, with Mario and Luigi able to effective start tangoing, and then turn into a flying saucer when they jump. It’s a hell of a trick that would have the Strictly judges lose their minds, but more practically it will let you hover across wider gaps in the world.</p>
<p>If there’s one aspect I’m less enthused by, it’s the art style, which honestly might have worked best on the 3DS as opposed to the Switch. It’s a bit too heavy on the thick outlines, the picture quality a bit too soft, and there’s also this odd colour gradient to Mario and Luigi’s red and green tops and hats. Maybe it will grow on me with more time spent in the game, but it’s not one I’ve instantly loved.</p>
<p>It’s lovely to see Mario &amp; Luigi return, a role playing counterpart to Paper Mario, just like the back and forth of 3D and 2D Mario platformers. I’m curious to see how safe or adventurous the wider game will be, but it’s already clear that there’s plenty of unusual character to meet amongst the Concordians. Also… did I mention that Snoutlet, the sassy pig that’s definitely not a pig, actually lives in Luigi’s hat? I’m here for that. More games should have hat pigs (that aren’t pigs).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/halo-infinite-2-was-in-development-with-the-slipspace-engine-before-the-switch-to-unreal-engine-5/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>According to a rumor <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xh07V_QF5Oc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> by YouTuber RebsGaming, Halo Infinite 2 was in development at 343 Industries before Microsoft decided to drastically change the franchise's plans. The YouTuber's anonymous source says that right after the release of Halo Infinite (December 2021), 343's campaign team began working on the sequel in the Slipspace Engine. The team reportedly had 'high hopes' for the gameplay improvements that could have been introduced in Halo Infinite 2.</p>
<p>However, plans changed completely when there was a leadership <a href="https://wccftech.com/head-of-halo-infinite-steps-down-as-microsoft-starts-a-343-industries-restructure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">change</a> inside 343 Industries in September 2022. with Bonnie Ross being replaced by Pierre Hintze. The new leadership decided to switch to Unreal Engine for future Halo games and canceled the Halo Infinite 2 project. The team was asked to start learning Unreal Engine 5, which lasted until early 2023 when Microsoft's big round of layoffs hit 343 Industries hard. RebsGaming's source was also affected, so they do not know if the team is still working on a direct sequel to Infinite or not. The game was fairly well received upon launch; it got an 8 out of 10 score on Wccftech from Chris Wray:</p>
<p><em>Halo Infinite is, in my opinion, the best game of the series. While still faltering in the narrative, character development, and exposition, it improves earlier titles. Combat is entertaining and engaging, with improvements made across the board, but mention must go to new abilities like the grappling hook. The move to an open world helps the game stand apart, with added freedom to take the fight to your enemies and a vast arsenal of weapons and vehicles to bring into battle. While it slips up on a few occasions, from somebody who has never been part of the Halo fan club, this has given me a glimpse of what could be great things to come.</em></p>
<p>Still, it's official now: Microsoft has <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-has-multiple-projects-on-the-way-made-with-unreal-engine-5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rebranded</a> 343 Industries to Halo Studios, and the team has multiple games in development with Unreal Engine 5. In the meantime, Infinite is <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-infinite-getting-third-person-mode-in-november/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">getting</a> some new stuff soon, including a third-person view.</p>

<p>Per a <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/cryptic-studios-is-laying-off-staff-at-the-end-of-october" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Game Developer report</a>, a number of Cryptic employees, including artists <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7248093634103803905/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Amelia March</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mauricio-tejerina-758619_i-will-be-leaving-cryptic-studios-at-the-activity-7248056180013510656-5q3n/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Mauricio Tejerina</a>, have confirmed that they're being laid off on business social networking platform LinkedIn.</p>
<p>Cryptic art director Thomas Marrone subsequently <a href="https://x.com/thomasthecat/status/1843662460315980227" rel="noopener" target="_blank">confirmed the layoffs</a> via social media a couple of days ago, adding that "some wonderful people are being let go" and that "their loss will be deeply felt" at the company.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/cryptic-studios-layoffs-star-trek-online.jpg?itok=i7H52S9k 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/cryptic-studios-layoffs-star-trek-online.jpg?itok=dnG6HGZl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Cryptic Studios is responsible for games like&nbsp;<em>Star Trek Online</em>, as well as&nbsp;<em>Neverwinter&nbsp;</em>and others.</figcaption></figure><p>This isn't the first time Cryptic Studios has been hit by layoffs, either. Back in November last year, the studio <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cryptic-studios-layoffs">let an unknown number of personnel go</a>, citing an "organizational change".</p>
<p>That decision was likely part of a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-has-laid-off-8-of-its-employees-and-it-isnt-done-yet-despite-record-quarter">restructuring effort</a> by Cryptic's parent Embracer, which saw the holding company cut a huge number of jobs and outright close or sell some studios (including&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-shuts-down-saints-row-developer-volition"><em>Saints Row&nbsp;</em>developer Volition</a>).</p>
<p>Supposedly, however, that restructuring program is over, having concluded with Embracer announcing its intent to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-group-splitting-three-companies">split into three separate companies</a> back in April.</p>
<p>With that in mind, the reason behind these latest Cryptic layoffs isn't entirely clear, and neither Embracer nor Cryptic have announced anything through official channels, so no clear reason has been given by either company.</p>

<p>A new DLC for Dragon Ball Sparking Zero, the ‘Martial Arts Pack’, has been discovered online.</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://comicbook.com/gaming/news/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-dlc-martial-arts-pack/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ComicBook</a>, if you head over to the <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1790600/dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SteamDB</a> page of Dragon Ball Sparking Zero and click the DLCs tab, you will observe some new changes in the section. Since yesterday, the developers have added 4 types of downloadable content for the game. Three have already been announced: the Anime Music Pack 1, Anime Music Pack 2, and Ultimate Upgrade Pack. However, another DLC called Martial Arts Pack was added, which people have yet to learn about.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A report by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-dlc-revealed-via-steam-backend" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a> highlights a Reddit post by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tenkaichi4/comments/1g0ehsh/sparking_zero_book_released_in_japan_includes_a/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Zeucleio</a> that reveals a Dragon Ball Sparking Zero companion book was released in Japan, and the Martial Arts Pack DLC is part of this book. Players who purchase this book are provided with a key code for their respective platforms. Upon using this code, players are provided with the Martial Arts Pack in the game.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, what does the Martial Arts Pack include? Many players speculated that it could be a Dragon Ball Sparking Zero cosmetics pack or for characters from the original Dragon Ball Saga. However, it’s none of those. Players who use this code are provided with early unlocks for Bardock, Future Gohan, and Super Saiyan Future Gohan. They also receive Bardock’s Z costume and the Super Sparking! ability item.

The developer said it can make tuning changes “faster and with more frequency while working on the balance of the game.”</p><p>Live Tuning Update #1 reduces ball trajectory height for lobbed passes and crosses in Rush matches (Ultimate Team’s eye-catching new mode for FC 25), and reduces the accuracy of first-time lobbed through passes and lobbed through passes taken at severe angles across all gameplay.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>FC 25 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>But it’s the end of the game-breaking speed boost exploit that will be of most interest to core FC 25 fans.

<section><p>The first Mario &amp; Luigi game on a Nintendo console looks like a promising mixture of goofball humor and surprisingly deep RPG hooks.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">The handheld Mario &amp; Luigi RPG series has always been defined by its limitations. The first game's unique control scheme, mapping A to Mario and B to Luigi, was a clever twist on the timing-based combat of Super Mario RPG, built to work on a system with just two face buttons. Later iterations maintained its heart and humor with additional elements, but it has always been the smaller, more modest handheld Mario RPG series in contrast to the Paper Mario series on consoles. Based on a hands-on preview with Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership, it looks as if the sweet little handheld series is finally being given the premium treatment on the hybrid Nintendo Switch, without losing its charmingly goofy sense of humor.</p><p dir="ltr">It's been almost a decade since a new Mario &amp; Luigi game released, so it's only natural that Brothership would be a significant visual upgrade over anything we've seen before. Even still, the new look is immediately striking, thanks to a beautiful, bright and cheery animated style that lets the brothers squash and stretch like Looney Tunes characters. Mario &amp; Luigi has always focused heavily on the dynamic between the two brothers, so this element lets the animations emphasize their personalities. Mario as always is the steadfast hero, while Luigi is more of a well-meaning but overconfident goofball.</p><p dir="ltr">This time, the super bros are magically plucked from their homey Mushroom Kingdom to a mysterious new land called Concordia. This land was once a single world held together by the glowing threads of a magical tree, but the tree became corrupted and the islands split apart. Mario and Luigi have come into possession of a new sapling to restore the world tree, which they house on their floating sea vessel. So they set off from island to island to link them back together with the tree. It's a sweet concept that emphasizes bringing people together.</p><p dir="ltr">The people of Concordia have a distinct look that can only be described as: plug faces. They look like the plugs of your electrical outlet, albeit with some distinctive features to stand out from each other. Likewise, joining an island back together with the main world tree involves connecting a shimmering plug-like device, so there's certainly a theme at play here.</p><p dir="ltr">Sailing is done automatically and surprisingly reminded me of a cross between two different Zelda games: Wind Waker and Spirit Tracks. You choose a set of currents to ride along, and you'll journey in a circle on that current repeatedly until you scope out a destination using your spyglass. Since the ship doubles as your home base and it travels independently once you chart a course, you can roam around and do some shopping while en route to your destination. While the major mission-critical islands are obvious, there is a sense of discovery as well, since you can find other islands or landmarks to explore using your spyglass. And the feeling of sailing across the open ocean in a brightly colored landscape was Wind Waker through and through.</p><p dir="ltr">Once you arrive at a mission island, you need to find its lighthouse, which will come down to completing a themed quest. In the first island I visited, the Concordians were struggling from severely bad vibes, thanks to their Groovemaster dance leader being too ashamed to show his face due to a bad hair day. So Mario and Luigi had to venture into a scary forest to find the vendor who made the finest-quality hair wax, restore the Groovemaster's confidence, and get the citizens dancing again.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4381881-switch_mlb_mediapreviewsbroll_scrn_02.png" data-ref-id="1300-4381881" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4381881-switch_mlb_mediapreviewsbroll_scrn_02.png" data-ref-id="1300-4381881"></a><figcaption>Mario &amp; Luigi join the islands of Concordia back together.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4381881-switch_mlb_mediapreviewsbroll_scrn_02.png"></figure><p>Traversing the world lets you jump independently as Mario and Luigi as always, but this time, Luigi operates more automatically. If you clear a gap as Mario, Luigi will follow automatically without needing to precisely time and stagger his own jumps. The platforming still doesn't feel great, exactly--this certainly won't be mistaken for a real Mario platformer--but automating Luigi definitely helps alleviate some frustration I've felt with past games. You can also tap L when prompted to activate "Luigi Logic," which sometimes activates special contextual actions to complete a puzzle, and other times just lets him take care of busywork like smashing boxes to find some coins. This definitely makes Luigi a second-banana to Mario, but he doesn't seem to mind.</p><p dir="ltr">When you encounter an enemy in the world, you can get a boost by initiating with a well-timed jump. That launches you into the battle screen, where Mario and Luigi operate with their own buttons for jumps and dodges. The Mario &amp; Luigi twist on timing-based combat has always involved controlling both brothers simultaneously and carefully reading enemy attacks to know which brother they're targeting. That's present here too, and on top of that, your attacks are their own canvas to show off the brothers' animated antics. Most of your timing prompts will involve some interaction between the two--for example, a hammer attack might bounce back, only to have Luigi smack your hammer with his own for an extra finisher. These had a nice level of variety to them, with different animations triggering based on which brother you're using, which attack you're using, and which enemy you're targeting.</p><p dir="ltr">I was, however, slightly disoriented by the way the menu confirmation works. Mario's button prompts are always mapped to A and Luigi's are always mapped to B, as usual for the series. But when selecting an attack from the menu, A is confirm and B is cancel regardless of which brother you're selecting. That means remembering that when choosing a Mario attack, you use A to confirm and then A to perform the timing prompts, but when choosing a Luigi attack, you use A to confirm and then immediately switch to B for the timing prompts. I'm sure it would come to me with practice, but during the short preview session, I got my wires crossed and flubbed the timing on more than one occasion.</p><p dir="ltr">After a short break, we visited another island, which was a little later in the game and had some more complexities at play. The centerpiece of this island was an enormous circular maze in the center, filled with enemies, and different areas that could be used to rotate the interior or exterior of the maze to find your way through. This time, Mario was able to climb to a tall perch, giving you a bird's-eye view, while Luigi stayed behind and manned the rotation. It wasn't extremely difficult to solve, but it provided a little satisfying friction.</p><p dir="ltr">More difficult than the puzzle were the new combat encounters, but this second island was also meant to show off another new feature. A set of special passive abilities called Plugs could be equipped, giving you specialized benefits like 100% critical chance against certain enemy types. These are purchased using a special currency found by exploring the world, and the abilities themselves can be prepared ahead of time or hot-swapped during battle. What made them stand out was how they could be combined for much more powerful, almost game-breaking effects. With just two plug slots, I could equip one that guaranteed a critical hit on a flying enemy, and another that rewarded critical hits with a powerful explosion that hit surrounding enemies. When combined, I could simply target a flying enemy in the center and make short work of the whole field. I was told that more slots open up as you go and the abilities continue to stack, and just from the small taste of this system I could imagine tinkering with combinations to craft my own powerful strategies. They do come with some limitations, like a set number of uses before they need to recharge. But as a nice quality-of-life feature, you don't use a charge of an ability if it couldn't have triggered. For example, if you keep your anti-spike ability equipped and hit a non-spike enemy, that won't count against your uses. This effectively reduces the need to babysit your abilities between each turn.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4381882-switch_mlb_mediapreviewsbroll_scrn_05.png" data-ref-id="1300-4381882" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4381882-switch_mlb_mediapreviewsbroll_scrn_05.png" data-ref-id="1300-4381882"></a><figcaption>Luigi has a brilliant flash of "Luigi Logic"</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4381882-switch_mlb_mediapreviewsbroll_scrn_05.png"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4381883-switch_mlb_mediapreviewsbroll_scrn_01.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4381884-switch_mlb_mediapreviewsbroll_scrn_02.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4381885-switch_mlb_mediapreviewsbroll_scrn_03.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4381886-switch_mlb_mediapreviewsbroll_scrn_04.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4381887-switch_mlb_mediapreviewsbroll_scrn_05.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4381888-switch_mlb_mediapreviewsbroll_scrn_06.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4381889-switch_mlb_mediapreviewsbroll_scrn_07.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4381890-switch_mlb_mediapreviewsbroll_scrn_08.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4381891-switch_mlb_mediapreviewsbroll_scrn_09.png" data-ref-id="1300-4381883,1300-4381884,1300-4381885,1300-4381886,1300-4381887,1300-4381888,1300-4381889,1300-4381890,1300-4381891" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4381883-switch_mlb_mediapreviewsbroll_scrn_01.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4381884-switch_mlb_mediapreviewsbroll_scrn_02.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4381885-switch_mlb_mediapreviewsbroll_scrn_03.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4381886-switch_mlb_mediapreviewsbroll_scrn_04.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4381887-switch_mlb_mediapreviewsbroll_scrn_05.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4381888-switch_mlb_mediapreviewsbroll_scrn_06.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4381889-switch_mlb_mediapreviewsbroll_scrn_07.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4381890-switch_mlb_mediapreviewsbroll_scrn_08.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4381891-switch_mlb_mediapreviewsbroll_scrn_09.png"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4381883-switch_mlb_mediapreviewsbroll_scrn_01.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4381884-switch_mlb_mediapreviewsbroll_scrn_02.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4381885-switch_mlb_mediapreviewsbroll_scrn_03.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4381886-switch_mlb_mediapreviewsbroll_scrn_04.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4381887-switch_mlb_mediapreviewsbroll_scrn_05.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4381888-switch_mlb_mediapreviewsbroll_scrn_06.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4381889-switch_mlb_mediapreviewsbroll_scrn_07.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4381890-switch_mlb_mediapreviewsbroll_scrn_08.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4381891-switch_mlb_mediapreviewsbroll_scrn_09.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">As you gain levels, you'll continue powering up your stats, including the fan-favorite "Stache" stat. And as a new wrinkle, every eight levels you also pick from a list of specialized, permanent upgrades. One might give you an extra HP for each level from then on, while another might permanently boost your EXP gain. These can't be re-rolled, so it gives you a deeper level of decision-making about how you want to shape your Mario and Luigi strategy.</p><p dir="ltr">Though we didn't see the feature in action, we were told that tethering new islands will allow NPCs to move freely between all the other islands you've joined, opening up new side quests and other opportunities for exploration. Each island seems fairly quick to complete initially, but the ability to go back and find new quests suggests a potentially deep layer of exploration.</p><p dir="ltr">Just how deep it goes remains to be seen in the full game, but what I've seen so far is certainly impressive. The Mario &amp; Luigi series has long been a de facto second-tier Mario RPG, the little sibling of the dual series. Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership is an opportunity to come into its own on a bigger stage, and thanks to a comical animated presentation and some surprisingly deep RPG hooks, it's finally moving beyond its own limitations.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/i-need-this-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-inspired-xbox-but-microsoft-has-locked-it-behind-a-sweepstake<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>Microsoft has unveiled a rather fabulous custom Xbox console and controller, inspired by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-everything-we-know-9408">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>.</p>
<p>It's honestly a really great looking piece of kit. The console itself features a "timeworn yet beautiful design" in a golden hue. The controller, meanwhile, has a leathery look to it and gemstone-like buttons. As a huge Indiana Jones fan, I wanted this kit in my house yesterday.</p>
<p>But, here's the catch. Microsoft has locked this console, quite literally, in a puzzle box, and only if you solve the puzzle will you then be entered into a sweepstake to actually win the console and controller. Oh, there will also be the chance to win one via some kind of social media engagement on Bethesda's channels. But, otherwise, this console and controller will not be for sale. Sad.</p>

<p>"Forgotten ruins, Adamic puzzles and hidden treasure await any adventurer up to the task in this clever and challenging puzzle. Fans and families can visit the Microsoft Experience Centers in <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/store/locations">London</a>, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/store/locations">Sydney</a>, and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/locations">New York</a> to experience a stunning display for the holidays from 12th November through 6th January," reads an Xbox blog post on the Indiana Jones-themed hardware.</p>
<p>"What better way to experience the game than with your newest discovery of this console and controller? Don't forget to ask yourself as you investigate, decrypt and untangle this puzzle: What would Indy do?"</p>

<p>This is not the first time Xbox has kept one of its custom consoles behind a sweepstake of some description.</p>
<p>In November last year, Xbox announced a competition in collaboration with Warner Bros. Pictures to promote the Timothée Chalamet-fronted Wonka film. Winners got a range of chocolate goodies including a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-is-giving-away-an-edible-chocolate-controller">Wonka-inspired Xbox Series X and an edible controller</a>.</p>
<p>Also last year, it hosted a giveaway which saw some Xbox fans presented with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-announces-pizza-scented-controller-in-collaboration-with-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles">pizza-scented Xbox wireless controller</a>, as part of a promotion for the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</a> movie.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Battle Royale karting game <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/stampede-racing-royale">Stampede Racing Royale</a> has burst into a full free-to-play launch on PC via Steam with a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/dave-the-diver">Dave the Diver</a> – should that be Dave the Driver? – collaboration to celebrate the release.</p>
<p><iframe title="Stampede: Racing Royale ???? PLAY FOR FREE ON STEAM!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C0EJki9N-5Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The pitch for Stampede Racing Royale is pretty simple: it’s Mario Kart, but a battle royale. 60 players will join the starting lobby and then race through three rounds, first to avoid the cut and then to race for the win in the final round.</p>
<p>The game on Steam is skipping past the Early Access branding, but it’s a counterpart to the Xbox Game Preview version available on consoles and the Microsoft Store on PC, which is keeping the Game Preview label. There will also be the biggest update yet for the Game Preview build, with new content, features and community-driven changes.</p>
<p>There’s six new tracks, six new karts (plus one Dave the Diver kart), and more than 250 new customisation items. They’ve added a new ‘Wrapid’ special event to unlock an exclusive kart wrap, and there’s a reward for logging in for 7 days straight.</p>

<p>For the moment-to-moment racing, a new boost system has been implemented to accumulate boost via drifting, airtime and just passively, with players able to deploy it themselves. A new Jelly Block power-up will drop gelatinous cubes on the track to slow and blur the vision of anyone that runs into it. Add some new round modifiers, like Hard Mode, where players can be instantly eliminated by running into hazards, and there’s plenty of scope for added variety.</p>
<p>In a curious move, the game is going far beyond just being free-to-play. Sumo Leamington want to built a bustling community first, and so have completely removed in-app purchases from the game. They’re also gifting all racers 3,000 Star Chips&nbsp;–&nbsp;the in-game currency – which is enough to unlock all of the cosmetic content.</p>
<p>It’s a bold move, but alongside the Dave the Diver collab, it should hopefully help gain the game a good bit of attention. Season 0 will extend through to early 2025, with Sumo looking to make more changes for the eventual arrival of Season 1.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-mod-unlocked-framerate/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero mod was released online today promises to make the experience much smoother, at least in offline play.</p>
<p>The mod developed by Zetto, which can be downloaded for free from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonballsparkingzero/mods/10" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nexus Mods</a>, removes the 60 FPS cap in the PC version of the game, allowing the game to run at an unlocked framerate without speeding up the game.&nbsp;For the mod to work properly, the <a href="https://ko-fi.com/post/Dragon-Ball-Sparking-Zero-UTOC-Signature-Bypass-P-D1D314G19U" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sparking Zero UTOC Signature Bypass patch</a> is required.</p>
<p>Considering how <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-pc-system-requirements/">undemanding the Dragon Ball: Sparking! ZERO PC system requirements</a> are, many players should be able to take advantage of this mod to improve the experience. Back in <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-interview-with-jun-furutani-discussing-the-series-return-game-modes-netcode/">August</a>, during Gamescom, I asked the game's producer Jun Furutani about high refresh rate modes and was told that the team wanted to offer the same type of experience on all platforms, so all versions of the game run at 60 frames per second. During the same interview, Furutani-san also commented on balancing, play modes, character roster, and more.</p>
<p>Dragon Ball: Sparking! ZERO launches tomorrow, October 11th, on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S worldwide. The game is already available for all those who purchase the game's Deluxe Edition. You can learn more about the game by going <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-hands-on-ps5-preview/">here</a>.</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://playtest-p.nintendo.com/en-gb" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement on its website</a>, Nintendo says that the aptly-named Nintendo Switch Online: Playtest Program pertains to "a new feature for the Nintendo Switch Online service" that'll be available on the Switch.</p>
<p>You'll only be able to take part in said test if you have an Expansion Pack addon for your Switch Online subscription, and you'll also need to be at least 18 years of age starting from yesterday (October 9th).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-switch-online-expansion-pack-new-feature-playtest-games.jpg?itok=jGSY-RiJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-switch-online-expansion-pack-new-feature-playtest-games.jpg?itok=1GRdwF5w 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Nintendo Switch Online is about to get some kind of new feature, although we're not sure what it might be yet.</figcaption></figure><p>You'll also only be able to access the test if you're based in the UK, the US, Japan, France, Germany, Italy, or Spain. Those applying from outside Japan will be picked "on a first-come-first-serve basis", Nintendo says, while those within Japan will be selected via raffle "if there are many Japanese applicants".</p>
<p>Recruitment starts today at 10am Eastern and runs until October 15th, and the playtest period itself begins on October 24th, ending on November 6th.</p>
<p>Of course, this being Nintendo, the Japanese gaming giant is cagey regarding exactly what the new feature it's testing might be. However, given that you need an Expansion Pack addon to access it, we can make a few educated guesses.</p>
<p>Since the Expansion Pack offers a number of retro games you can't access with a basic Nintendo Switch Online membership, like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/game-boy-and-game-boy-advance-titles-are-finally-coming-to-nintendo-switch-online">Game Boy Advance games</a> or <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/european-n64-titles-will-be-slower">N64 titles</a>, it's possible Nintendo is trialing a brand new system for the Expansion Pack service.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/metroid-prime-remastered-nintendo-switch-online-expansion-pack-playtest.jpg?itok=A3XkEYy7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/metroid-prime-remastered-nintendo-switch-online-expansion-pack-playtest.jpg?itok=NcUwLOuP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Could GameCube games be on their way to Nintendo Switch Online?</figcaption></figure><p>The obvious first choice if this is the case would be the GameCube, since there are many games for that system, like&nbsp;<em>Super Smash Bros. Melee&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</em>, that are unavailable on modern consoles.</p>
<p>Nintendo could also be trialing the release of DS games for Switch Online. We know that porting DS games to modern systems is possible thanks to the recent release of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.konami.com/games/castlevania/dominus_collection/eu/en-eu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Castlevania: Dominus Collection</em></a>, after all.</p>
<p>In any case, you'll be able to apply for whatever this Nintendo playtest happens to be starting from 10am Eastern today. Stay tuned for more on this.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/10/24266327/metaphor-refantazio-persona-handheld-heritage<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Atlus’ <em>Persona</em> franchise is largely a console series, but it has a strong handheld heritage. There were excellent portable versions of <em>Persona 3</em> and <em>Persona 4</em>, and <em>Persona 5</em> <em>Royal</em> on Nintendo Switch was great, too. <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> is a new fantasy JRPG from the team behind those beloved <em>Persona</em>s. And while the game takes place in a different universe, many of the core elements are present in <em>Metaphor</em> — which means that it’s just as great of a handheld experience.</p><p>I might be understating it to say <em>Metaphor</em> is <em>Persona</em>-like. The game’s UI is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/24026398">exceptionally flashy</a>. You’ll spend a lot of time talking with your allies and improving your bonds with them. Days tick by as you navigate sprawling dungeons and spend time with your companions before a looming deadline. The main characters even go through epic transformations where they brutally rip an organ out of their body as a mysterious voice talks in “thous” and “haths.” Once, while taking notes about the game, I called it <em>Persona</em> instead of <em>Metaphor</em>. It’s that similar.</p><p>But that means so much of what makes <em>Persona</em> games <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/17/23403042/persona-5-royal-nier-automata-nintendo-switch-review">great portable titles</a> works for <em>Metaphor</em>, too. Battles tend to be quick, meaning if you have a few minutes, you can blast through several to clear a dungeon floor. Doing activities in one in-game day is enough to feel like progress. Some parts of the game feature long bouts of text, but when I’m playing just before I go to sleep, seeing what happens next can feel like an exciting chapter in a great book.&nbsp;</p><p>I’m playing <em>Metaphor</em> on the Steam Deck. The game is listed on Steam as Playable instead of Verified, and while it is indeed playable, performance is inconsistent, especially in town areas I’ve visited. (The towns are pretty busy places, with lots of characters and things going on.) I actually capped the game at 30fps in settings, even though it can run higher, just because I didn’t want to deal with varying frame rates.</p><p>But fortunately, <em>Metaphor</em> isn’t a game that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-metaphor-refantazio-a-sublime-game-let-down-by-bizarre-technical-choices">demands perfect performance</a>. In dungeons, you can attack enemies in real time to try to get the jump on them, but I found that frame rate dips didn’t hinder my ability to pull off a successful barrage. All battles are turn-based, anyway, and some frame drops didn’t make much of a difference to me there.&nbsp;</p><p>I’m more than fine dealing with some issues; being able to take <em>Metaphor</em> anywhere I want is amazing. I play the game pretty much every night before I fall asleep, I play it on the couch on the weekends while my new baby naps, and I even took my Steam Deck on two recent business trips just so I could sneak in some sessions when I had spare time.</p><p>There’s one more way <em>Metaphor</em> is like the <em>Persona</em> series: <a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/heres-exactly-how-long-it-takes-to-beat-metaphor-refantazio#:~:text=How%20Long%20Does%20It%20Take,ll%20add%20even%20more%20playtime.&amp;text=Metaphor%3A%20Refantazio%20is%20a%20lengthy,looking%20to%20mainline%20the%20story.">it’s absolutely massive</a>. But a game that’s dozens of hours long is a lot more manageable when you can play whenever and wherever you want.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Paradox Interactive <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-delays-prison-architect-2-and-cancels-preorders-improving-the-performance-has-proven-to-be-a-task-that-will-take-time">delayed</a> jail management simulator Prison Architect 2 indefinitely this August, commenting at the time that the game had notable performance issues, and that its system-led design was proving tricky to tinker with. This came a couple of months after the Crusader Kings publisher washed their hands of the sequel's original developers, Double Eleven.</p>
<p>Speaking to me at Paradox's Media Day last week, deputy chief executive officer Mattias Lilja offered a shade more insight on the decision, suggesting that hard-up players have "higher expectations" at present and are less trusting that developers will fix problems. Chief creative officer Henrik Fåhraeus also offered thoughts on what Paradox have learned from the disastrous launch of Cities: Skylines 2 in late 2023. Specifically, he said they need to give actual players access to the game early on, not just testers.</p><!--more-->
<p>"We're pretty confident that the gameplay is good," Lilja said of Prison Architect 2. "But we had quality issues, which means to give the players the game they deserve, we decided to delay it. So it's not the same kind of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-ceo-admits-company-made-wrong-calls-in-several-projects-in-wake-of-life-by-yous-cancellation">bucket of challenges that we had with Life By You</a>, which led to cancellation. It's more that we haven't been able to keep the pace that we wanted. But when we do peer reviews of the game and user testing and whatnot, people give us feedback, we actually get pretty good feedback, except for certain issues that we need to fix. Some of them are harder to fix than we thought." </p>
<p>Which issues, specifically, are Prison Architect 2's new developers Kokku having trouble with, I asked? "It's mostly certain technical issues rather than design," Lilja went on. "It's more how can we make this technically high-quality enough for a stable release." But there's also a degree of wider calculation, he added, based on Paradox's sense of how tolerant players currently are of imperfections even in early access releases.</p><p>"It's also based on the fact that we, in all transparency, see that fans right now, with a squeezed budget for games, have higher expectations, and are less accepting that you will fix things over time," Lilja said. "That's our take. The gaming space has always been the winner-takes-all type of environment. A few games bring in most of the players, and most games are dropped quite quickly, and this is even more pronounced now, [during] maybe the last two years. That's at least what we read from our games, and also from from others in the market."</p>
<p>These are obviously quite hazy characterisations, but there are a couple of specific reference points. One is obviously Cities: Skylines 2, which launched with performance issues so severe the developers, Colossal Order, decided to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cities-skylines-2-wont-get-paid-dlc-until-its-problem-issues-are-sorted-devs-say">postpone release of the game's first paid DLC</a>. While the base performance problems <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/after-six-months-of-renovations-cities-skyline-2-performance-is-considerably-less-terrible">seem to have been largely addressed</a>, certain DLC packs have been criticised as rushed and insubstantial, prompting Paradox and Colossal Order to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cities-skylines-2-devs-apologise-for-rushed-dlc-offer-refunds-promise-conciliatory-fan-summit">issue a joint apology and propose a fan feedback summit</a>. </p>

<p>"Cities 2, the experience there - we knew we would have some issues, like in every release," Lilja acknowledged. "We had more of that than we hoped. Some of those were definitely things we should have caught. But also The Lamplighter's League, which reviewed quite well, but did not attract a following that made it sustainable." Paradox's sense that audiences are choosier and more sensitive also comes from "talking to others in the business, and seeing how their games perform," he went on.</p><p>I'm always interested in how perceptions of technical shoddiness differ between players - one person's frame-rate hiccup is another person's reason to refund. Are there any particular types of technical issue that people are currently more sensitive to, I asked? </p>
<p>"It's not new issues," Lilja said. "People should have high expectations. It's just that in order to be certain, we should make sure that we have checked and double-checked. Some of the issues, I would argue, that we had in Cities 2, were some issues that we had not really understood fully, and that's that's totally on us."</p>
<p>When I spoke to him separately, Fåhraeus admitted that Paradox knew that Cities: Skyline 2's performance needed improvement before launch - they just miscalculated how much players would care. "We were aware that performance was not great, but we underestimated how it will be perceived by players - how serious the player perception would be," he said. "So I think one learning with Cities 2 is if we could have brought players in to try it on a larger scale, that would have helped. Going forward, we need to have this communication with players and openness to a larger degree, and quite early if possible."</p>
<p>Paradox could go about this in a variety of ways, Fåhraeus went on. "[Our community blog series] Tinto Talks is one way of communicating with players even before release. But there's also of course, closed beta tests and having dedicated enthusiasts in even earlier, under NDA, to help us identify issues. Not just identify issues, but also, what is your feeling when you're playing the game?</p>
<p>"We do use these tools and we've used them in the past, but maybe we've gotten a little worse at it lately, and we need to get back to that sort of openness with players," he conceded.</p>
<p>This sounds to me a bit like Paradox are trying to outsource some of their testing to players. Couldn't Paradox improve the technical robustness of their games by expanding their in-house testing and QA team, I asked? </p>
<p>"Depends on what we're trying to fix," Fåhraeus said. "QA is great at finding specific bugs. It doesn't work so well with the player experience of a feature - what are the pains with accomplishing your goals. We also have user research tests, we're bringing players in to try games, and see how they feel, see how they react. That's another great tool at our disposal. But at some point, you need to have a quantity of players, to really capture all the issues."</p><p>I'm interested to know whether you - yes, you! - think people in general have less patience for bugs at this stage. I'm not sure there's anything in it, myself, but I will say that it's never been easier for people to record, share and make a big stink out of a game's technical troubles. I'm also interested to know whether you think Paradox <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-still-want-to-make-a-sims-competitor-after-life-by-you-but-we-need-to-start-smaller">should make another Sims-style life sim</a>, after nuking Life By You, and whether you have any hope at present for vaporous action-RPG Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2, which Paradox <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bloodlines-2-is-more-spiritual-successor-than-sequel-to-a-a-competently-good-game-by-2004-standards-say-paradox">are now gingerly describing as "a spiritual successor, not an actual same blueprint type of game".</a></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>In 2019, Capcom released the remake of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/resident-evil-2-review-re-vived-nightmares/1900-6417071/" data-ref-id="1900-6417071">Resident Evil 2</a>, which took the classic PS1-era survival-horror title to new heights. Now, five years later, iPhone, iPad, and Mac users will finally get their chance to play Resident Evil 2 on their chosen devices.</p><p>Resident Evil 2's remake was largely faithful to the story of the original title, while modernizing other aspects of the gameplay including the over-the-shoulder third-person perspective of the player's character. There are two intersecting narratives following Claire Redfield--the sister of RE 1 hero Chris Redfield--and a rookie cop named Leon S. Kennedy as they try to survive a zombie outbreak in Raccoon City. One of the primary innovations of the remake was Mr. X, a nearly invulnerable genetic monster who relentlessly pursues the player's character throughout the game.</p><p>This isn't the first RE title to make it on to Apple's devices. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/resident-evil-village-review-shapeshifter/1900-6417672/" data-ref-id="1900-6417672">Resident Evil: Village</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/resident-evil-7-biohazard-review/1900-6416603/" data-ref-id="1900-6416603">Resident Evil 7: Biohazard</a>, and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/resident-evil-4-remake-review-stranga-stranga-now-thats-a-remake/1900-6418047/" data-ref-id="1900-6418047">Resident Evil 4</a> remake have also been ported over. In fact, RE4's remake and Village are both more recent titles than RE2's remake.</p><p>The prologue for Resident Evil 2 can be downloaded for free on Apple's <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/resident-evil-2/id1640632432" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">App Store</a>. But gamers who want to experience the full game on Apple's platforms are going to have to wait until later this year to dive into one of the best Resident Evil games.</p>

<p>FIFAe World Cup 2024 is almost upon its, and it seems that FIFA will feature Konami’s eFootball in the competition.</p>



<p>There will be two eFootball competitions at the FIFAe World Cup 2024: a 2v2 competition for consoles and a 1v1 competition for the mobile category. The competition will feature participants from 18 countries across the globe. Interested players can join the qualifiers, which begin today. Additional details are accessible on Konami’s <a href="https://e-football.konami.net/fifae_world_cup/2024/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">website</a>.</p>



<p>The FIFAe World Cup is the official esports competition hosted by FIFA (Fédération Internationale de Football Association). Until 2023, EA’s FIFA game series was the main attraction of the competition. However, both organizations ended their partnership <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-officially-unveils-ea-sports-fc-to-replace-fifa-soccer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">last year</a>, leading to Konami’s eFootball taking EA’s place at the FIFAe World Cup in 2024.</p>

</p></figure>







<p>Konami could potentially be replaced too at the FIFAe World Cup once FIFA creates its own football simulation game. FIFA’s President, Gianni Infantino, has already announced they are collaborating with new partners to develop <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fifa-president-new-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new ‘e-game’ under the FIFA brand</a>. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-fc-25-developers-arent-afraid-of-potential-fifa-2k-competition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Take-Two Interactive’s 2K Sports</a> could likely be the chosen partner.</p>

			<p>The Demon's Souls remake developed by Bluepoint is still today one of the best-looking games on PlayStation 5, and it reportedly looks substantially better on PlayStation 5 Pro.</p>
<p>The tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DFClipsChannel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> recently had the chance to check out the game running on Sony's soon-to-be-released mid-generation system. They revealed that it features a new Pro display mode that runs at what seems like 4K resolution and 60 FPS. The image looks very detailed but a little soft, but it's not clear if this is due to PSSR upscaling or anything else, as Digital Foundry could not confirm any details regarding the resolution.</p>
<p>What was confirmed, however, is that Demon's Souls on PlayStation 5 Pro features a new visual feature, a new contact shadow system. This system is similar to the screen space shadows system employed on base PlayStation 5, which is mostly noticeable in areas with rocks, but shows more fine shadow details that look quite good. Despite the lack of anything else, which is unsurprising considering the game will be four years old at the time the PS5 Pro launches, Digital Foundry has no doubt that Demon's Souls looks substantially better on the upcoming console.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-main-story-walkthrough-9352">Starfield</a> design director Emil Pagliarulo has taken to social media to assure fans that Bethesda is addressing community concerns, in the wake of his comments in a recent interview that some took to suggest the company was satisfied with the game's Shattered Space expansion.</p>
<p>Shattered Space launched last week to a lukewarm reception from fans and critics alike. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-shattered-space-review">Eurogamer's Shattered Space review</a> described it as "one of Starfield's most enjoyable storylines to date" but that the experience "once again struggles to offer any real consequences".</p>
<p>Pagliarulo received ire from Starfield's community for his responses in a recent <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/it-might-not-be-everyones-cup-of-tea-but-what-is-as-starfield-shattered-space-launches-bethesda-reflects-on-the-importance-of-players-speaking-their-mind/">Games Radar</a>  interview in which he described Starfield as "in a lot of ways, the best game we've ever made", despite its poor critical reception. Fans felt his words were disingenuous and out of touch with the community.</p>

<p>"It reads as if you and the team are patting yourselves on the head," a fan wrote in a lengthy thread on X directed at Pagliarulo.  "It's a pat on the head that based on reviews may not be warranted."</p>
<p>Pagliarulo responded with his own lengthy thread, saying he did not enjoy "leaving fans hanging".</p>
<p>"As the design director, sometimes I'm asked or instructed to do interviews. I was happy to do that, to represent the designers and the studio. Seeing how hard and passionately they worked on Shattered Space, they deserved nothing less," he said.</p>
<p>However, he acknowledged that his own "optimism is in no way meant to be mud in the eye of any dissatisfied fan".</p>
<p>He continued: "I'm also very proud of Shattered Space. We all are. Most of the quests and levels were done by designers who have worked on previous Bethesda games and DLCs, going all the way back to Morrowind. They're good at what they do, and it shows.</p><p>"Maybe it's a game of expectations. Fans want a lot, and we do all we can to accommodate them. Here's what I can tell you - nobody, and I mean nobody, at Bethesda is patting themselves on the back while ignoring our players."</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">First, the interview. As the design director, sometimes I’m asked or instructed to do interviews.

</p></div>
<p>Pagliarulo also acknowledged, in addition to delivering Shattered Space, Bethesda has "spent a lot of time this year addressing community concerns and making fixes". He added: "We'll continue to do so, and will be listening to our fans every step of the way. We make these games for all of you."</p>
<p>He concluded: "I love games. I love Bethesda's games. I've been playing them since the Terminator days. All I or anyone here wants to do is make those games... and then make them better. No ego. No arrogance. Just a lot of hard work, and appreciation of our fans."</p>
<p>Regardless of thoughts on Shattered Space, it's a welcome exchange from Pagliarulo who noted "I think a bridge to the devs is important".</p>
<p>Previously he commented on timeline controversies from the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout">Fallout</a> TV show, posting a "helpful little Fallout timeline" including both the TV show and all the games after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesda-developer-responds-as-fallout-fans-say-tv-show-contradicts-canon">fans complained the show contradicted canon</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>An Italian-language only quirk with Bloober Team’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-2-remake">Silent Hill 2 Remake</a> almost spoiled the entire plot for fans playing in that language, but was fortunately caught in time for the day one patch to make changes. As spotted by<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/horror/silent-hill-2-got-an-emergency-patch-after-a-huge-translation-mistake-spoiled-the-whole-game-for-italians/"> PC Gamer</a>, some garbled lines the player hears upon first picking up the game’s radio weren’t quite garbled enough in the Italian subtitles, accidentally dropping a massive plot spoiler in the first half hour. <strong>Stop reading now if you’re still playing</strong>, obviously. Here’s a video of a cat that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/ARur1qpJZyc?feature=share">sounds like he’s saying “bongiorno”</a> you can watch instead.</p>

<p>Right, spoilers. When James “no time to check trunk, must find wife” Sunderland first finds the radio that pre-warns him of every jumpscare, rendering the whole game a dogshit attempt at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> (this is absolutely a joke, please do not send my nan death threats), he’ll receive a deliberately incomprehensible call from his wife Mary. The Italian subtitles spelled out Mary’s call in full, including one where she asks James why he killed her. As detailed in this<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/silenthill/comments/1fvw2op/update_version_1003000/"> Reddit thread</a>, the error was originally picked up by folk playing the game early, who reported it to Bloober.</p>
<p>“Ahah esatto siamo riusciti a far patchare un gioco perché spoilera tutto nei primi dieci minuti. Ci manca solo una bella montatura politica stile rule of rose,” wrote one Reddit user, which I believe is Italian for “please remake <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_Rose">Rule Of Rose</a> next.” I agree!</p><p>“A good-looking and unflinchingly loyal remake of the beloved 2001 horror game, yet one that plays everything safe,” wrote Brendy in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/silent-hill-2-review">his review</a>. “The longer I spent in James' personal hellscape, the more I could accept it as the video game equivalent of Alisdair Gray's Lanark, but I also don't have the patience to analyse every detail within its 16 to 20-hour story, as some will. And ultimately, I can't help but feel underwhelmed by how much its sacred history has chained this remake down.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/old-rivals-konami-and-fifa-sign-efootball-esports-deal-following-ea-sports-split<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>The world of soccer video games took another twist today after Konami and FIFA — for years rivals on the virtual pitch — signed their first deal following the end of EA Sports’ long-running FIFA games. But don't get too excited yet, it's just for esports.</p><p>Konami's Pro Evolution Soccer series had for years tussled with EA Sports’ all-conquering FIFA series before <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/efootball-2024"><u>finally pivoting to the free-to-play eFootball</u></a>. EA has largely cornered the market, locking up the rights to the Premier League, La Liga, and other popular leagues, with Konami left fighting for scraps.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-sports-fc-fifa-split-reasons"><u>EA dropped the FIFA license in 2022</u></a> amid reports that the organization, which serves as the governing body for the various national associations around the world, had asked for more than $1 billion per four-year World Cup cycle. EA rebranded the series as EA Sports FC in 2023 with relatively few changes. Since then there has been speculation that Take-Two, with its 2K Games label, might take on the FIFA license, but in August Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick said that <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-boss-2k-fifa-games-ea-sports-fc-25">any potential competitor to EA Sports FC would face numerous complications</a>.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/10/fifa-konami-1728551107301.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Koji Kobayashi, Senior Executive Officer, Konami Digital Entertainment Co., Ltd, and Romy Gai, Chief Business Officer at FIFA.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Now, we have the Konami and FIFA collaboration, which will see eFootball used for this year's FIFAe World Cup on both console and mobile (EA Sports' FIFA games were used in previous years). It should be noted that this is not an agreement for Konami to take on the FIFA video game series, or rebrand eFootball to FIFA, but it’s a notable shift in the ever-evolving dynamic between video game makers and those who hold the keys to real world football.</p><p>Clearly, EA will be watching developments with great interest. In July, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fc-25-developers-say-they-welcome-a-true-competitor-with-a-new-fifa-waiting-in-the-wings">EA Sports welcomed the potential for genuine competition in the football video game space</a> amid rumors of a new FIFA game entering the market.</p><p>In May, FIFA president Gianni Infantino confirmed a new FIFA game was in the works, saying: “We will develop a new e-game, because (the) football simulation game is called FIFA. For hundreds of millions of children around the world, when they play (a) football simulation game, they play FIFA. It cannot be named something else.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>“We are developing with new partners a new game which obviously, as everything we do, will be the best. So get ready for the new FIFA e-game.”</p><p>If 2K does take on FIFA, perhaps it will relaunch as FIFA 2K, similar to 2K’s already successful annualized sports games such as NBA 2K. If it goes with Konami, maybe eFIFA? Pro Evolution FIFA? Or, perhaps more likely, the simple return of FIFA with the year popped on the end.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/until-dawn-review.1005810/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/10/until-dawn-2024-review/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/until-dawn">Until Dawn</a> is a classic tale of a cast of young beautiful characters getting killed off in horrifically gory ways by something lurking in the woods. It’s a modern horror game classic, packed full of twists and red herrings, and if you have not played the game in it’s original incarnation then you are in for a treat. With the PS4 original still very playable on PS5, you might be wondering what this remake brings to the table after less than a decade.</p>
<p><iframe title="Until Dawn - Launch Trailer | PS5 &amp; PC Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8nApBGPy0ao?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The characters are tropes of the genre with the jock, the nerd, the bitch and – thanks to the Hayden Panettiere’s casting –&nbsp; the cheerleader, all present. You get to play as all of the characters at various points throughout the game and make decisions that radiate out in a Butterfly Effect: What seems a simple decision may have a drastic impact later on, so much so that you might not even get to play large sections of the game if you manage to kill off a character early in the story.</p>


<p>Like all the ‘best’ horror movies the cast can be incredibly stupid and act in completely irrational ways. After screamed conversation about how no-one should go outside due to the murderous things roaming around, a character will then decide they must go, unarmed, into the heart of danger. Two minutes later the rest of cast, who were hysterical just moments ago, trot off happily to follow them. After a good half an hour of terror, a character in the second group chirps “I’ll take it from here the rest of you can go back” and off they trot. It makes no sense whatsoever and while the ‘stupid but beautiful people’ trope is clearly being played on, in 2024 it does just feel like bad writing. I also noticed that Hayden Panttiere’s character takes the longest bath ever. Girl, I know you got to look beautiful, but over two hours soaking in the tub while your friends are being diced in to bits is just not on!</p>


<p>The core gameplay will be very familiar to anyone who has played Supermassive’s original or any of the more recent entries in The Dark Pictures Anthology or <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/06/21/the-quarry-review-ps5-xbox-ps4-pc/">The Quarry</a>. Fairly lengthy cutscenes are followed by a period of exploration in which you can find clues to the story, with moments of action or horror liberally sprinkled throughout the 6-8 hour play time. The action scenes take the form of quick time events whilst the horror and stealth sections require you to hold the DualSense controller completely still, mimicking your character’s on screen predicament – if you move, they die. Both of these elements work even better than they did on PS4 thanks to haptic feedback, the controller shaking to your heartbeat as you try and stay still.</p>
<p>It is fair to say that there is a lot of walking around, but we are now way past ‘walking simulators’ being a derogatory term. The genre has established itself fully and Until Dawn remains one of the best with plenty of dialogue which add to the story as you trudge through the snow, the game gradually ramping up the tension.</p>
<p>If you did not know that Supermassive created Until Dawn back in 2015 then you would be forgiven for thinking that Until Dawn is a brand new game. It’s not labelled as a remaster or a remake, it’s just ‘Until Dawn’ with Supermassive only acknowledged at the end of a very, very long credit sequence in which everyone and their dog is mentioned before the people who actually created the original title. With Sony treating this is a brand new title, and it being a full remake in Unreal Engine, there is also means there’s no upgrade path, dyou can’t pay a tenner like you can do with Horizon Zero Dawn and get the shiny new version.</p>

<p>That’s not to say Ballistic Moon haven’t done a lot of work to enhance PS4 version. Obviously the biggest improvement is with graphics with the game teetering on the edge of being photorealistic in some places thanks to it being ported to Unreal Engine 5. Facial animations have been improved and subtly tweaked, the lighting is now more realistic – outside of the game starting at dusk, when it’s 9PM in the middle of winter – and the fixed ‘Resident Evil’ style camera has been ditched for a new third person view which allows you to move more freely through the environments and hunt out the collectables more easily.</p>
<p>There’s also a brand new score, reworked sound effects and the original songs have been replaced with more modern pop tracks, a couple of which are complete bops. According to Sony “We’ve endeavoured to keep the fantastic narrative integratory of the original, but we have seized the opportunity to expand upon unexplored emotional parts of the story,” which may be the case, but given the branching narrative of the game it’s hard to spot what is new and what you just didn’t see first time around.</p>
<p>The prologue is the most obvious change. Its now longer and the prank that kicks off the whole story has been reworked so it has more heft and emotional impact. There are also two new scenes at the end of the game which, in true horror movie tradition, tease that the story may not be over.</p>
<p>The many improvements to the game do&nbsp; highlight areas that have not been brought up to date. My main gripe is that characters can still only walk in circles, you cannot sidestep, and this means you do feel like you are controlling a vehicle rather than person. The animation of the character faces have been improved, but nothing has been done to the hair, Ashley’s long locks are resolutely stuck to the sides of her jacket and stretch in comically distracting ways when she turns her head.</p>
<p>There are also a smattering of bugs and glitches, like FMV cinematics juddering in the game’s intro, which definitely needs a patch.</p>

			<p>After several positive Starfield updates that improved performance and introduced various features and bug fixes, Bethesda was hoping to further renew interest in the game with the release of the first expansion, Shattered Space. However, its reception was mixed. In our 6/10 <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-shattered-space-may-the-great-serpent-save-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">review</a>, Francesco De Meo wrote:</p>
<p><em>The Starfield: Shattered Space expansion offers an engaging new story but adds little beyond that. Fans of the game's universe will appreciate spending more time in it and discovering a faction more complex than it appeared in the base game, but those who didn't enjoy Starfield or were primarily interested in its space exploration mechanics won't change their opinion with the expansion, as it doesn't address the vast majority of the issues that still plague the experience.</em></p>
<p>Bethesda Design Director Emil Pagliarulo has now <a href="https://x.com/Dezinuh/status/1843658963344339300" target="_blank" rel="noopener">engaged</a> in an X conversation to proclaim the team's faith in Shattered Space while also pointing out that the studio is not at all ignoring the players' feedback.</p>
<p><em>I’m also very proud of Shattered Space. We all are. Most of the quests and levels were done by designers who have worked on previous Bethesda games and DLCs, going all the way back to Morrowind. They’re good at what they do, and it shows. If folks haven’t played Shattered Space and they like Starfield, I think they’re missing out. If folks have played Shattered Space and still don’t like it, that makes me sad, honestly. Just know that we’ve also been hearing from plenty of people who love it.</em></p>
<p><em>Maybe it’s a game of expectations. Fans want a lot, and we do all we can to accommodate them. Here’s what I can tell you – nobody, and I mean nobody, at Bethesda is patting themselves on the back while ignoring our players. In addition to Shattered Space, we’ve also spent a lot of time this year addressing community concerns and making fixes. We’ll continue to do so, and will be listening to our fans every step of the way. We make these games for all of you.</em></p>
<p><em>Starfield is a massive game, and it takes time for us to address things. We move as fast as we can, as safely as we can. Game development is always tricky, but with a game as big as Starfield, every fix could potentially break something else.</em></p>
<p>Bethesda has committed to long-term support for Starfield, so we'll see whether they will take into account the mixed reception of Shattered Space to do something different with the next expansion for the sci-fi roleplaying game.</p>

            <p>Coffee Stain Publishing have fully revealed Goat Simulator Remastered, a spruced-up take on 2014’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world</a>, ragdolling livestock sandbox with all of the original’s DLC included. I played a bit of this at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/events/gamescom-2024">Gamescom</a> in August, and while the trailer below is proof positive that the remaster does indeed look newer and shinier, in the moment I couldn’t shake the idea from my memory banks that this was just how <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/goat-simulator">Goat Sim</a> <em>always</em> looked.</p>

<p>I wonder if there’s a word for this, where years of beaming ever-more lavish visuals into your eyes tricks you into perceiving long-unplayed games as looking more modern than they did. Alice0 (RPS in peace) enjoyed how the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/half-lifes-raytracing-mod-is-great-because-it-makes-the-game-look-old-in-a-new-way">Half-Life: Ray Traced mod</a> made the game still look old but in a newer way; kind of like that, except the changes only exist in your head, and can't be downloaded from GitHub.</p>
<p>In any case, Goat Simulator Remastered is a modest do-over in terms of tech, and it’s uncharacteristically restrained in concept as well. From what I saw, it plays the whole remake thing straight, with no wink-wink-nudge-nudging about itself or the industry’s current love of reheated games in the same way that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/goat-simulator-3">Goat Simulator 3</a> poked fun at sequels. Which could be a good or a bad thing, depending on how you get on with Goat Sim’s sense of humour.</p><p>Of course, there are parodies aplenty in the bundled DLCs, which among others include the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dayz">DayZ</a>-inspired GoatZ, the Mass Effect sendup <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/goat-simulator-space-expansion">Waste of Space</a>, and that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/payday-2-goat-simulator-crossover-dlc">Goat Sim x Payday 2 crossover</a>, which actually does pull on the nostalgia strings quite well by harkening back to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/payday-3s-launch-is-another-great-advert-for-not-making-your-game-always-online">when Payday was good</a>. And the remaster does make one big change, providing access to the Mutators menu – the comedy variables list that lets you play as a Giraffe or strap into a jetpack – at any time, rather than just at the level select screen. This turns missions, if you can call them that, into even more of a free-for-all, with your goat able to swap forms and abilities at will.</p>
<p>Goat Simulator Remastered is out on November 7th, via Steam and the Epic Games Store. It’ll be on Game Pass, too.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-alarmo-clock-costs-90-now-available-to-switch-online-subscribers<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
Alarmo, Nintendo's new interactive alarm clock, is available now in the UK if you're a Nintendo Switch Online subscriber.
</p>
<p>
The gadget is priced £89.99 on these shores. Upon <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-just-unveiled-an-alarm-clock-that-plays-mario-coin-noises-when-you-roll-over">its surprise announcement yesterday</a>, Nintendo also announced a $99 price point for the US.
</p>
<p>
Nintendo Sound Clock: Alarmo, to give the device its full name, is an interactive alarm designed to sit by your bedside. It includes alarm sounds and animations based around several top Nintendo franchises - including Mario, Zelda, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pikmin">Pikmin</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/splatoon">Splatoon</a> - to wake you up in the morning. 
</p>
<p>
The interactivity comes from Alarmo's snazzy movement sensor, which can detect when you're beginning to get out of bed. When it detects this, you can expect to hear additional noises - such as Mario coin sounds - as if to cheer on your rise from slumber. 
</p>
<p>
Alarmo is set to become more widely available beginning in "mid-January 2025", Nintendo announced yesterday. For now, you'll need a Nintendo Switch Online membership to order one from Nintendo's online store.

Eurogamer was able to access the device's My Nintendo Store page with relative ease this morning, after a brief wait in a virtual queue. There's no word on how much stock of Alarmo is currently available.
