            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Considering that I never play games on my PC and consider mobile games to only be for five minutes of mindless fun while waiting for a bus, no one is more surprised than me that I have spent hours playing a mobile game on my PC. This may be in part due to the most recent <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/15/destiny-2-the-edge-of-fate-review-community/">Destiny 2 expansion being a bit of a dud</a>, but Destiny: Rising has wrapped me back up in this sci-fi looter shooter setting ever since its release last week.</p>

<p>Destiny: Rising is NetEase’s free-to-play mobile spin-off to Bungie’s long-running series, creating a new alternate timeline and having been developed with Android and iOS in mind. But you can just play it on PC instead with an Android emulator, and this is fully sanctioned by NetEase, who promote it right alongside mobile platforms. Setting up the <a href="https://www.mumuplayer.com/">Mumu emulator,</a> was pretty straightforward – other emulators like BlueStacks will also work – and after a quick tweak to my BIOS the game was up and running. I did have to get a new cable to get my DualSense working, but apart from that everything was quick and easy, with the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/destiny-rising/">Destiny: Rising</a> gamepad controls being almost exactly the same as those on console.</p>


<p>Initial impressions are very good. This is Destiny, with almost every single thing found in Destiny 2, but mobile. Strikes, emotes, weapons upgrades, Supers, massive open world areas, finishers, matchmaking, PvP, sparrows – you name it and it’s here. Having a completely new version of Destiny to explore is very exciting and I am amazed just how much they have put into the game. It’s even got the football mini-game and a Destiny favourite, cats which you can pet and feed.</p>


<p>It’s also fully voiced with not just the characters but their ghosts as well, with lengthy, fully animated cutscenes when it’s time for some exposition.&nbsp; It has been discovered that a few <a href="https://twitter.com/JoshRuble/status/1961149009835311152?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1961149009835311152%7Ctwgr%5E6d69cab63db2c8effe6320dcb8e30a0aa09d46dd%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ffrvr.com%2Fblog%2Fnews%2Fdestiny-rising-players-discover-npcs-that-use-terrible-tiktok-ai-voices-instead-of-real-voice-actors%2F">unnamed NPCs have AI generated voices</a> which do sound rather robotic, but the main cast is played by real humans and the acting is good. Young Ikora shines as a more feisty incarnation of her character and there’s even some gentle humour, something that has been missing from Destiny 2 for many years. The music is the same mix of evocative, soaring orchestral pieces and thumpy techno tracks Destiny fans will be familiar with, and chirping Ghosts.</p>
<p>I could go on like this for ages so let’s make it simple: You know Destiny 2? It’s that, but in your hands. The biggest difference is seen in the graphics. The character designs and FX are really quite detailed but some environments do look a little blocky. Imagine a PS3 game but running in 1080p at 60fps and you would be close. The only other noticeable difference in terms of content is that you have two weapons slots rather than three, and Energy weapons do not exist in Destiny: Rising.</p>

<p>The story is considered non-canon and set in a time before The First City, when Guardians were just finding their place in the world. Rather than play your own character you play as one of the named characters, starting off as Wolf, a recently resurrected Guardian who conveniently acts as a tutorial, as the world of Destiny and Guardians is explained to him and the player at the same time. Later on you will pick Kabr, a young man with a perchance for exaggeration, and then Destiny stalwart Ikora Rey. Each character has their own skills, Supers, and weapons, and picking the right character for the right mission might give you an added advantage. There are ten playable characters at present with another three coming soon as part of the live service.</p>

<p>Alongside the story there are a load of side missions and huge open world areas with collectables, secrets and Public Events, and again, these are all new. Familiar characters also start to surface, Xur and The Nine have a event that can be run for rewards and a popular, if renamed, character can be found in Haven – this game’s version of The Tower. Alongside Strikes there is a wave based activity run by Xur that requires you to move at speed through levels, and gives you modifiers with each level you pass.</p>
<p>My favourite activity by far is the Shifting Gates which is like D2’s Gambit on steroids. The premise is roughly the same, fight through areas, collect data cubes, and dump them at the collection point, but rather than tootling around in your own area with the occasional invader you are playing as part of six teams of three, all fighting across a large map. Destiny Mobile has an 18-player PvPvE mode, when the most Destiny 2 has ever managed is 8 player, and I think that says a lot about how Bungie has failed to maintain or expand on certain areas of their game.</p>

<p>On top of all the stuff recreated from Destiny, there’s a bunch of new stuff including Clan Housing, campfires, fishing, and the return of Sparrow Racing. Frankly there’s maybe a little too much and new players to Destiny may find it overwhelming, especially when there’s things pinging off every five seconds reminding you of a mission, a hidden chest, or the completion of a task. The gunplay is impactful and feels fairly solid, so while it’s not quite as heavy as the console game, it still packs a punch when needed. Matchmaking is also almost instant which took me by surprise, though considering 10 million had pre-registered for the game, maybe I shouldn’t be.</p>
<p>Being the F2P mobile game there are options to spend you cash including Gacha boxes and a Season Pass. The Gacha mechanic asks you to spend in-game currencies, or more likely pay cold hard cash for boxes that contain new characters, upgraded characters, weapons, or the various other currencies required for in-game upgrades. There is a smaller base pool of characters alongside time-limited specials, and the odds of getting anything good a ridiculously low, but so far I have yet to see any reason to spend anything than in-game currency. The Season pass will launch in the coming weeks and includes the usual mix of bonuses and weapons.</p>
<h4><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/30/destiny-rising-how-to-get-bon-voyage-charms-quickly/">Destiny: Rising – How to get Bon Voyage Charms quickly</a></h4>
<p>Destiny: Rising has the one thing that Destiny players have been clamouring for: a huge batch of refreshingly new content to explore. The bonus is that, while it’s a mobile game, you can just load it up on PC, grab a gamepad and get close to the Destiny 2 experience in the process. You don’t even need a jacked up gaming rig to run it. There are hours of content to play without spending any cash so it’s not hard to recommend at least giving it a try, but the ultimate test is still to come. As time goes on, how much content will NetEase lock being paywalls or paid character upgrades?</p>
<p>But in the long run, Destiny: Rising’s greatest achievement might be giving the kick up the bum that Bungie needs to focus on things players want.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/roblox-experiences-will-now-have-iarc-age-ratings-age-verification-for-in-game-chat-coming-by-end-of-2025.1288785/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Roblox has partnered with the International Age Rating Coalition (IARC) to swap out its current maturity rating system for the games on its platform, or what Roblox calls 'experiences,' with age ratings commonly used on individually sold games, like ESRB, PEGI, GRAC, and USK ratings. The company will also require <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/09/roblox-to-expand-age-estimation-to-all-users">players to verify their age</a> to use in-game chat by the end of 2025.</p>



<p>Players in North America will see ESRB ratings, while players in Europe and the United Kingdom will see PEGI, USK in Germany, and GRAC in the Republic of Korea.</p>



<p>It's another layer to Roblox finally trying to do more to address the issues of adult predators using the platform to target children, an issue that's been <a href="https://hindenburgresearch.com/roblox/">reported</a> on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTMF6xEiAaY&amp;t=1030s">multiple times</a> over <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gXlauRB1EQ">the years</a>. Last month, Louisiana's attorney general, Liz Murril, <a href="https://wccftech.com/roblox-sued-louisiana-lack-safety-protocols-against-sex-predators/">filed a lawsuit</a> against Roblox for failing to implement proper safety protocols to protect children from those who've been able to abuse the platform and its lax security for years. Roblox <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/08/roblox-responds-to-louisiana-ag-lawsuit">responded to the lawsuit</a>, calling the claims "<em>erroneous</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>With so many families engaging with Roblox, it is hugely beneficial to provide parents with trusted and familiar ratings no matter where they live</em>," said Patricia Vance, ESRB president and IARC chairperson, per a report from <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/roblox-partners-with-international-age-rating-coalition-to-replace-current-maturity-labels">GamesIndustry.Biz</a>. "<em>The globally streamlined process will provide Roblox creators with an efficient and proven process for obtaining age and content ratings, while informing parents of what their kids may experience before they play.</em>"</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Today we're announcing our plan to roll out platform-wide age estimation, designed to set a new standard for online safety. Learn more about the 100+ safety initiatives we shipped this year: <a href="https://t.co/KRIpYzwCVG">https://t.co/KRIpYzwCVG</a></p>— Roblox (@Roblox) <a href="https://twitter.com/Roblox/status/1963300638219223482?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 3, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Regarding the age verification, Roblox will use a combination of ID age verification, parental consent, and facial age estimation technology to get a more accurate read on a users age, instead of what it's been doing so far, "<em>simply relying on what someone types in when they create an account</em>," writes chief safety officer, Matt Kaufman.</p>



<p>Kaufman also writes that Roblox has issued "<em>over 100 safety</em> <em>initiatives</em>" since the start of this year, and that these new implementations are building on an already "<em>strong foundation</em>" of protocols Roblox already had in place.</p>



<p>Last year, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-roblox-pedophile-problem/">Bloomberg</a> reported that Roblox had over 13,000 incidents of child exploitation on the platform in 2023, and that employees who had worked with Kaufman claimed Roblox was "<em>on its back foot</em>" in its struggle to clear the platform of predators.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> has officially buzzed across the thin red line between <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/our-favourite-videogame-vapourware-no-silksong-allowed-edition">"entirely hypothetical object of mass hysteria"</a> and "existing videogame that you can play on your PC". Team Cherry's new metroidvania is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1030300/Hollow_Knight_Silksong/">live now on Steam</a> and <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/hollow_knight_silksong">GOG</a>. You can actually buy it with your actual money. <em>Should</em> you buy it? Sadly, I don't yet have a Hollow Knight: Silksong review for you, because Team Cherry have decided not to distribute any codes in advance. If you're reading a Silksong review right now, the reviewer is either a worryingly close confidant of the developers or a filthy bloody liar or some other, totally innocent third thing.</p>
<p>The absence of early review code reflects the fact that Silksong already has more Hype than most messiahs, partly thanks to Team Cherry's long silence about gameplay specifics and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-release-time">Silksong's release date</a>, after an initial flurry of publicity in 2019. Only <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-everything-we-know">GTA 6</a> has attracted this many conspiracy theorists. Team Cherry need attention from reviewers at this point like a drowning person needs a glass of water.</p>
<p>A lot of the Hype has arrived care of the Silksong subreddit, who are in both a celebratory and a mourning mood today. "God help me I don't know where to start," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Silksong/comments/1n7oyhv/thank_you_rsilksong_legacy_flairs_from_your/">writes</a> one of the founding moderators, zoravy. "Thank you everyone for the insanity and fun I never could've predicted when starting this place up in 2021, this has genuinely been one of the funnest places to be on all of the internet, and its been an honour to see every bit of it, from the start."</p>
<p>It's certainly been a journey. Wired have <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/how-fans-turned-waiting-for-hollow-knight-silksongs-release-into-a-game/">published a good piece</a> about the meta-gaming of Silksong anticipation, with subreddit subscribers not just fomenting speculation about release details but actively making things up and trolling each other. Major events include the "sacrificing" of certain users to Silksong - that is, they were banned from the subreddit, and only permitted to return after launch. There was also a running joke about fake copies being distributed by "Snosk", a fully manifested version of one of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a>'s hidden bosses. To this, add <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/unless-this-cake-is-lying-to-you-silksong-will-reappear-in-april">my own reporting about that cake</a>. </p>
<p>Hollow Knight, of course, is a game of copious, wriggling lore, so all of this roleplaying is entirely appropriate. If only I could persuade the dang <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-ix">Final Fantasy 9</a> remake rumour-mongers to think this way.</p>
<p>We may not have a review as yet, but we do have James's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-is-faster-prettier-and-harder-yet-still-feels-like-a-safe-sequel">hands-on verdict from Gamescom</a>. "It's a little quicker, a little more dynamic, and to these fingers, a little more difficult than the first Hollow Knight," he wrote. "But it entirely preserves that tight-as-a-drum feel of the original's sword swishing, and deploys it against insectoid baddies that challenge and frustrate in practically identical ways."</p>
<p>We also, rather terrifyingly, have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/silksong-will-get-dlc-for-years-some-of-the-plans-for-that-stuff-are-kind-of-ambitious-as-well">the prospect of Silksong DLC</a>. For context, Silksong itself began life as a humble Hollow Knight DLC pack, before it transcended those mortal confines and levelled up into a piece of internet phantasmagoria.</p>
<p>Are you buying today? Good luck to you. Let us know how you get on.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>After eight long years, <a href="https://kotaku.com/silksong-demo-hands-on-price-hollow-knight-pax-west-2000621695"><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> has finally arrived</a>. There’s just one small problem: the biggest game release of 2025 is causing all sorts of issues for the Nintendo Switch 2 eShop and Steam store pages. Fans racing to download the highly-anticipated Metroidvania sequel are stuck looking at error screens instead.</p> <p>The PlayStation and Xbox stores are getting hammered too. Here’s what players are seeing:</p>           <p>I’ve been trying to download the game on my Switch 2 and I keep getting kicked out of the eShop. On my most recent attempt I was finally able to load the actual Silksong store listing and hear the music from the auto-playing trailer, nothing else on the page actually populated. After about 20 seconds the store crashed on me again and kicked me back out to the main Switch 2 menu.</p>

 <p>There’s no word yet on whether this is just a momentary issue caused by the sudden surge in traffic or if something else is going on with <em>Silksong</em>‘s launch that could delay it further from i<a href="https://kotaku.com/silksong-when-release-live-price-hollow-knight-steam-2000621785">ts originally planned 10:00 a.m. ET debut</a>. Some players do appear to be having success getting the game downloaded, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/botherer.bsky.social/post/3lxzdiekdmk2m">at least on Steam</a>. It’s also available through Game Pass for free for paying members.</p> <p>The game’s arrival has been unique among modern releases, with no advanced code provided to reviewers and everyone getting the chance to jump into the game and play it at the same time. Or at least whenever the eShop, Steam, and other store pages start working again!</p> <p><em>Update 9/4/2025 10:23 a.m. ET: Added more information.</em></p>

<p>In the minutes leading up to the global release of Hollow Knight: Silksong, more than 240,000 viewers were waiting in the chats of thousands of Twitch channels about to stream the game. Unfortunately, the sheer number of people hitting ‘download’ all at the same time took down Steam, leading many to wait and watch others start playing this highly anticipated game.</p>



<p>I scrolled through Twitch, clicking on various channels to see users disappointed at Steam’s implosion, brought on by their own doing.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-hollow-knight-silksong-offline-for-everyone">Is Hollow Knight: Silksong Offline for Everyone?</h2>



<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong reached epic proportions on streaming platforms even before it had been released by Team Cherry. On Twitch, scores of viewers were sitting and eagerly awaiting the game’s launch, joining their favorite content creators in counting down to that inevitable moment when they could finally start downloading the game.</p>



<p>As I write this, more than 310,000 people are watching Hollow Knight: Silksong, and more than 47,000 people have managed to get into the game on Steam.</p>



<p>We’re also seeing reports that the Nintendo eShop and the Xbox Store are suffering, which we’re working to verify. Most recently, the store page for Hollow Knight: Silksong on Microsoft’s platforms disappeared, and we can’t fathom why.</p>



<p>Up until launch, Hollow Knight: Silksong remained the number one most-wanted game on Steam, acquiring a spot on millions of wishlists worldwide. During the Opening Night Live showcase at Gamescom, a new trailer for the game was revealed, the the release date was dropped shortly after.</p>



<p>It was a monumental thing that had fans frothing at the mouth, simply because that release date was set to arrive <strong>today</strong>, mere weeks after the latest trailer dropped.</p>



<p>Earlier today, it was revealed by Team Cherry developers that the Silksong protagonist, Hornet, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksongs-new-protagonist-completely-changed-dlc-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">caused drastic design changes</a> based on her character model.</p>

<p>If that statement is true, then Bond fans can likely look forward to environments that they can explore for hours, given IO's talent for creating intricate levels. The Hitman: World of Assassination trilogy had no shortage of stages to explore, with some of its largest being the superb Sapienza level, a massive section of an opulent Dubai skyscraper, and the Club 27 warehouse in Berlin. The State of Play showed just how players can adopt a 007 mindset during each mission, as Bond can use his gadgets, fists, and wits to access new areas.</p><p>007: First Light launches on March 27, 2026, for PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Switch 2.

                <p>At long last, Hollow Knight: Silksong is releasing today, September 4, but the rollout hasn't gone entirely smoothly right out of the gate. People are reporting issues on Steam, with players saying they cannot launch the game or even add it to their cart. Despite those issues, the game has blasted off to more than 75,000 concurrent players in the first 10 minutes of availability on Steam alone.</p><p>For context, that's more concurrent players than the original Hollow Knight's all-time record of around 72,000.</p>

<p>The game's store page on Steam even totally vanished from the Steam home page. Players also reported that they cannot access the Steam store at all--this can happen sometimes at the launch of a new Steam sale. However, there aren't too many instances we can recall of this happening for a game launch.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4562140-screenshot2025-09-04at10.09.45am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4562140" data-ratio="0.54637436762226" data-width="593" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4562140-screenshot2025-09-04at10.09.45am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4562140"></a><figcaption>The error message some have reported seeing upon visiting Steam.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4562140-screenshot2025-09-04at10.09.45am.png"></figure><p>These issues aren't affecting everyone, as other players are reporting they're able to buy and download Silksong from Steam. On Switch 2, the game is apparently <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ethangach.bsky.social/post/3lxzcsdgpic2p" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">encountering issues for some players as well on the eShop.</a> On Game Pass, Silksong is launching more smoothly, according to multiple reports on social media.</p><p>As usual, your mileage may vary--many people appear to be booting into Silksong just fine. Despite the struggles for some, the game has already reached 75,000 concurrents on Steam in the first 10 minutes of availability.</p><p>Silksong had a huge amount of pre-release hype due in part to the game's lengthy development and status as a game people thought they might never get to play. But the day has finally come, and people appear to be flocking to Silksong.</p><p>As announced previously, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksongs-price-is-cheaper-than-you-might-have-guessed/1100-6534401/" data-ref-id="1100-6534401">Silksong costs $20</a> at launch on all platforms. There will be a free Switch 2 upgrade for original Switch owners.</p><h2><strong>What is Hollow Knight: Silksong?</strong></h2><p>Hollow Knight: Silksong is the long-awaited sequel to Team Cherry's 2017 game Hollow Knight. The game sold more than 15 million copies and was highly regarded critically. The sequel, Silksong, was originally going to be DLC for Hollow Knight, but Team Cherry said its scope grew to the point that it had become a full, standalone game. Silksong has players becoming the character Hornet in a 2D platforming world. The game has new enemy types and bosses, and the <a href="https://www.altchar.com/game-news/team-cherry-post-hollow-knight-silksong-dev-update-e3-demo-axgGa3o4jK8P" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Greymoor area is among the biggest Team Cherry has ever created.</a></p><h2><strong>Why did Hollow Knight: Silksong take so long to come out?</strong></h2><p>Team Cherry founders Ari Gibson and William Pellen said Silksong was not stuck in development hell or anything like that. The enormous success of the 2017 game allowed the Australia-based developers to develop the follow-up at their own pace.</p><p>"It was never stuck or anything," Gibson told <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-08-21/why-silksong-team-cherry-s-sequel-to-hollow-knight-took-so-long-to-make" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>. "It was always progressing. It's just the case that we're a small team, and games take a lot of time. There wasn't any big controversial moment behind it."</p><p>One of the reasons why Silksong did not come out sooner was due to how, as previously stated, it was originally envisioned as an expansion to Hollow Knight. As for why Team Cherry went quiet and didn't discuss development updates with fans over the years, Gibson said the team opted not to because, "All we could really say is, 'We're still working on it.'"</p><p>Pellen added: "Instead of popping up and bugging people for the sake of it, it felt like our actual responsibility was just to work on the game."</p><p>At one point, Silksong was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/12/22175400/hollow-knight-silksong-sequel-xbox-game-pass-trailer" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">officially scheduled to launch before June 2023</a>, and Pellen said the team did "genuinely believe" the game would make it out then. But that didn't happen, of course.</p><p>The wait could have been even longer. Gibson said Team Cherry has a development structure that allows its members to "see results fasts," with ideas turning into real elements of the game "almost immediately." That was a fun way to work, Gibson said, but it also presented challenges.</p><p>"I remember at some point I just had to stop sketching," Gibson said. "Because I went, 'Everything I'm drawing here has to end up in the game. That's a cool idea, that's in. That's a cool idea, tha'ts in.' You realize, 'If I don't stop drawing, this is going to take 15 years to finish.'"</p><h2><strong>Is Hollow Knight: Silksong on Game Pass?</strong></h2><p>Hollow Knight: Silksong <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-will-be-on-xbox-game-pass/1100-6534209/" data-ref-id="1100-6534209">is available at launch for Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass subscribers</a>. Alternatively, as mentioned, it can be purchased outright for $20.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>

Keywords and competitors like Virtuos generally make money not by selling games, but by landing contracts with larger studios who need temporary support in game development without increasing studio headcount.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So is High Voltage getting back into full-time original game development? The answer is "no," according to CEO Anthony Glueck. Rather, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dragon Front: Adventures </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">is a passion project for the company partly meant to keep full-time employees working on games and helping new hires upskill on a lower-stakes project. He said the project proves external development studios can use their between-contract resources to make fun games on a low budget.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/wildgate-and-sunderfolk-publisher-dreamhaven-is-making-layoffs" target="_self" data-discover="true">Wildgate and Sunderfolk developer-publisher Dreamhaven is making layoffs</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In other words, instead of laying off developers or having them sit around idle while waiting for a new contract, High Voltage had an opportunity to let them do what they do best: making games.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Dragon Front: Adventures"><span>Dragon Front: Adventures</span> came to life after developers became "suddenly available"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to Glueck, it was the surprise ending of Keywords contracts in 2024 that gave life to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dragon Front: Adventures</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. The studio found itself with "a group of developers" suddenly available after being "removed" from assignments (he alluded to it being an "all-too-common" occurrence seemingly in reference to the wave of game cancelations and studio closures of the last few years). He explained that High Voltage had the ability to retain these devs, but it "needed a home" for them.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He explained that the studio was tasked with spinning up a project that could bring together developers from different disciplines (some from other Keywords North America studios). The team started by making </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fortnite</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> islands using Unreal Engine for Fortnite, but later set off on making a "longer-term" game based on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dragon Front</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. The studio was in an unusual position—thanks to years of development on the original VR game, it had 500 unique 3D assets that could be the foundation for a new game.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/jagex-ceo-wants-studio-s-games-to-operate-as-apolitically-as-possible-" target="_self" data-discover="true">Jagex CEO defends Runescape in-game Pride event cancelations as 'apolitical' decision</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Design director Micah Skarita and senior producer Keith Hladik—both huge fans of roguelike deckbuilders—took lead on what would later become what Glueck calls a "tug-of-war" roguelike. The change happened after the team realized the roguelike deckbuilder market has become "saturated."</span></p><p>Image via High Voltage Software.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Making games with "between-contract" developers poses a unique challenge for external development studios: even though Keywords supported </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dragon Front: Adventures</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">' development, High Voltage's bread-and-butter requires developers to jump on projects when available. Glueck said </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dragon Front</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s lead developers needed to be flexible in planning production because developers needed to be added and removed from the team—sometimes on a weekly basis.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Development even slowed down a few months after greenlighting, when the studio was brought on to an "important" project for one of its biggest clients. Developers weren't allowed to "double-dip" because legal obligations require development teams to be separated and not cross-pollinate between projects.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While the core development team stepped away to work on the bigger project, High Voltage brought on "benched" developers from other Keywords North America studios.

New design hires could be onboarded and trained before being transferred to contract projects, and quality assurance testers interested in game design roles could branch out and upskill on a lower-stakes project.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The shuffling staff roster created some discipline deficiencies at different points in the project—but that was taken as an opportunity, not a reason to shut it down. Artists and other developers were "encouraged" to build cross-disciplinary skills. "Some artists that primarily worked on rigging and animation tried their hand at lighting and environment staging," Glueck said. "Concept and character artists jumped in to create a new User Interface design and 2D images for the Steam achievements. Environment artists learned how to create VFX in Niagara and implement them with blueprints, and all team members contributed to QA by playtesting the game often."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Art producer Kate Wareham was one staffer who took the chance to upskill while working on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dragon Front: Adventures</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. After the game's design and engineering producers were called back up for client work, the pair taught Wareham how to produce "other disciplines." She also took on release management duties for Steam and the Epic Game store, and chipped into marketing efforts as well (including reaching out to Game Developer—something normally handled by PR teams).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"That's been one of the most beneficial parts of this project for the whole team," she said.

Glueck said the studio has toyed with a JRPG version of the game over the years—but for now, the studio's first order of business is serving its clients, not building Dragon Front into a huge global brand.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But the experience has taught Gleck that it's "healthy" to work on side projects that can be successfully brought to market. He said that making these games can "give people some further creative output, new skillsets, and save you money in the long run."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Losing a creative employee, by choice or not, is expensive. You will inevitably have to spend more to get the same level of competence, and no matter how much you pay, you will usually lose invaluable experience."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He urged any studios looking to make their own side project teams to plan for "fluidity" and not a traditional "</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model">waterfall</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">" production approach. "Since we didn’t know how long we'd have benched staff, we just kept the game modular by adding factions.

When done right, he said these projects can build company culture, shape a studio's identity, and let developers make a fun game they can call their own.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.

            <p>A little game by the name of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> just released, and it has thrown platforms into chaos.</p>
<p>As you can see from images captured by the Eurogamer team, the likes of Steam was brought to a grinding halt as many flocked to get their hands on the highly-anticipated sequel.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, several of us have been unable to add the game to our carts across Xbox, PlayStation and Switch. The PS store, for example, is stuck on Wishlisted at the time of writing.</p>
<p>
In the words of our Conner: "Steam it looks like every step has issues, trying to pay with Paypall is leading to error messages."</p>
<p>Are you having more luck than us?</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsung-pro-plus-1tb-microsd-memory-card-with-adapter-is-now-15-cheaper-than-black-friday-pricing-2000622760</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/samsung-pro-plus-1tb-microsd-memory-card-with-adapter-is-now-15-cheaper-than-black-friday-pricing.1288731/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If there is one thing that anybody with one or several tech devices will never say no to, it’s more storage. Think about it: Everything from your smartphone and tablet to your laptop, digital camera, handheld gaming console — even your drone if you’re an enthusiast (like us) — they’re all just as good as their amount of memory allows them to be. That’s why this limited-time deal at Amazon is so universally appealing: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3897/">Save 35% off the price of the Samsung PRO Plus microSD 1TB memory card and adapter and boost your storage for just $75.</a></p>
<p>Samsung’s title as the World’s #1 Flash Memory Brand has been going strong for 22 years now, going all the way back to when 8GB thumb drives were&nbsp;<em>the</em> giant-capacity devices to have. This Samsung PRO Plus microSD card is 125 times bigger than that in capacity, and comes in a much smaller package. Times have changed for sure, but Samsung’s reign as the top flash memory brand is still in effect, which makes this Amazon deal even sweeter.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3897/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Blazing Speed</h2>
<p>Throw it back to 2003 again for just a moment and recall what it was like to move huge files onto a portable storage device. You’d drag and drop, and then go make yourself something to eat while periodically checking in on that bar graph window to see how much longer you had to wait. The Samsung PRO Plus microSD card reads data at 180 MB/s and sequentially writes it at 130 MB/s, so make that sandwich to go, because you won’t be waiting long.</p>
<p>As for storage size, just how big is a terabyte? Enough for 47 hours of 4K video, or nearly 160 hours of full-HD video, or 437,298 4K photos, or 654,480 HD photos. Chances are, you may never actually fill this $75 storage beast, but if you do, those read-write speeds will come in incredibly handy. And you can fill, empty, and refill the PRO Plus microSD card over and over again, because despite it’s amazingly minuscule size, it’s built to last. Samsung made it to withstand water, extreme temperatures, magnets, x-rays, and drops, which is why so many photo and video pros swear by them for live outdoor shoots.</p>



<h2>Universal Appeal</h2>
<p>You can take the Samsung PRO Plus microSD out into the wild in a digital camera, GoPro or other action camera, or drone, but it’s certainly just as much at home in your home. Smartphones and tablets, laptops, home security systems, and handheld gaming consoles like the Nintendo Switch (not the Switch 2) all benefit from the extra storage of the 1TB microSD card. The format is nearly universal.</p>
<p>Now that we’ve established how far an extra terabyte of memory in a near-universal format goes and in how many devices, this Amazon limited-time deal taking 35% off the price of the 1TB model of the Samsung PRO Plus microSD card looks even better. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3897/">The Samsung 1TB PRO Plus microSD card is just $75 right now at Amazon, down from its regular price of $115.&nbsp;</a></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/mindseye-hitman-io-interactive-roadmap-update-metacritic-2000623129</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hitman-maker-distances-itself-from-disastrous-mindseye-launch.1288728/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>MindsEye</em> is one of the worst-reviewed games of the year, and IO Interactive published it. In fact, it was the <em>Hitman</em> maker’s first outside publishing deal ever. How did things go so wrong? The studio’s CEO was finally asked to weigh in on the topic and he makes it sound like he doesn’t know either.</p> <p>“The initial talks we had with those guys were to support them,” Hakan Abrak, who’s been in charge of IO for nearly a decade, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/that-was-definitely-tough-right-ceo-of-mindseye-publisher-ioi-responds-to-disastrous-launch">told <em>IGN</em></a> recently. “We thought they had some great ideas and a great world in the background that they were building, and hopefully they’ll get the opportunity to show more of that in the future. And we just wanted to help them distribute the game.”</p> <p><em>MindsEye</em> had a sound pitch. Developer Build A Rocket Boy, led by ex-<em>Grand Theft Auto</em> producer Leslie Benzies, was making a user-generated-content-based metaverse called Everything, but pivoted to getting a smaller, single-player shooter out the door first. Following an ex-black ops guy with a brain implant that’s turning his world upside down, <em>MindsEye</em> sounded like an old-school action-adventure campaign with some modern AAA gloss.</p>

 <p>What it ended up being instead <a href="https://kotaku.com/mindseye-review-bad-ps5-update-boring-open-world-pc-gta-1851785108">was a confusing and boring mess</a>. It’s one of the lowest-rated games of 2025 on Metacritic and has only 2,000 user reviews on Steam, around 70 percent of which are negative. As far as first-time publishing experiences go, it probably couldn’t have been any worse.</p> <p>“Well, that was definitely tough, right?” Abrak told I<em>GN</em>. “It was a tough reception. It wasn’t what they hoped for, and also what we didn’t hope for at IOI Partners. They’re working hard on turning that around to regain the trust of the gamers out there, and they have tons of potential and content they’re working on. So hopefully they’ll succeed with that in the future.”</p>

 <p>While Build A Rocket Boy has made promises, it’s also been <a href="https://kotaku.com/mindseye-layoffs-refunds-steam-reviews-gta-everywhere-1851784902">undergoing post-launch layoffs</a> and playing <a href="https://kotaku.com/leslie-benzies-ex-gta-producer-mindseye-fail-saboteurs-1851785617">weird blame games</a>. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mindseye-devs-uk-workforce-of-around-300-receive-at-risk-emails-as-former-gta-lead-leslie-benzies-finally-addresses-staff"><em>IGN</em> reported</a> that Benzies took the opportunity on a rare video call with staff in July to accuse internal and outside actors of trying to sabotage <em>MindsEye</em>. The studio announced an updated roadmap later that month that includes more fixes to the game and its <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MindsEyeGame/comments/1m8ykoy/july_update_from_the_studio/">upcoming <em>Hitman</em> crossover mission</a>.</p> <p>Worth noting is that at no point does Abrak talk about the partnership like it’s still ongoing. He talks about “we” at IO Interactive and “those guys” and “them” at Build A Rocket Boy. Even with the upcoming content you get the distinct feeling the <em>Hitman</em> team is ready to wash its hands of the entire thing and focus exclusively on its <a href="http://i/">upcoming 007 <em>James Bond</em> game</a> moving forward.</p> <p>Does IO plan to publish any other outside games after this? Abrak said, “That remains to be seen.”</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksongs-new-protagonist-completely-changed-dlc-plans/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hollow-knight-silksong%E2%80%99s-new-protagonist-completely-changed-dlc-plans.1288722/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong’s DLC plans were tossed out thanks to the new protagonist, Hornet. </p>



<p>Team Cherry’s new game, which was finally released today, has been in development for 7 long years. The game started out as a DLC, but it <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/why-hollow-knight-silksong-took-so-long-to-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">grew larger than planned</a>, with the devs adding multiple towns, a deep quest system, and a world much bigger than the original games. Now, the developers have revealed one of the major factors that contributed to the game’s lengthy development. </p>



<h2 id="h-hollow-knight-silksong-s-hornet-changed-everything-for-the-developers">Hollow Knight: Silksong’s Hornet Changed Everything for the Developers</h2>



<p>During an interview with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/platformer/team-cherry-had-to-go-back-to-the-drawing-board-for-hollow-knight-silksong-for-one-simple-reason-hornet-being-taller-changes-everything/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>, Team Cherry’s leads, Ari Gibson and William Pellen, explained how Hornet led to changes in Hollow Knight: Silksong’s DLC plans. Pellen explained that “Hornet being taller changes everything,” and the devs couldn’t do justice to the new playable character through just a DLC. </p>



<p>In Hollow Knight: Silksong, Hornet is able to travel much faster, jump higher, mantle or clamber onto ledges, and is generally more acrobatic than the previous protagonist. Hence, “the caves around her have to expand to accommodate her height.” Moreover, Hornet’s fighting is faster, and her competence led to a change in enemy design as well. “The core of the world is mainly a reflection” of this character and her nature “is echoed in the way the world is set up.”</p>



<p>If Hornet were straight placed in Hollow Knight’s world, she would be easily able to maneuver through the “would-be hazards,” and the extended attack range changes things as well. Silksong, on the other hand, brings “greater focus on aggression, decisive action, and proactive decision making.”</p>



<p>Gibson also elaborated that Hornet is half-bug, which not only makes the character more physical, but the world as well. Which means players will see “less glowy orb things, and magic bursts of light, and many more blades and traps.”</p>



<p>In other news, Hollow Knight: Silksong developers are offering <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-devs-offer-free-switch-2-upgrades-for-switch-1-users/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">free Switch 2 upgrades</a> to Switch 1 players. Also, the game releases today. Here are the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/team-cherry-confirms-hollow-knight-silksong-price-release-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">price details and release times</a>. What are your thoughts on Hornet changing Hollow Knight: Silksong’s DLC plans? Let us know through the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>&nbsp;discussion.</p>

Mooshies apparently has a very fun sense of humor, because a closer look at Cease &amp; Desist reveals lines that would never appear in an actual legal document from Nintendo: "Low key that mod do be sick though," and "Your mod too tough.

That mod was initially paywalled behind Mooshies' Patreon account, before it was subsequently released for free. It's unclear if Mooshies actually received any legal notification from Nintendo before releasing the new Cease &amp; Desist mod. Mooshies jokes that the Cease &amp; Desist skin is available for "10 morbillion dollars"--a direct yet humorous retaliation to the backlash the modder faced for locking the Jimbo the Clown from Balatro skin behind a paywall. He has <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/hello-paywall-137359387?utm_medium=clipboard_copy&amp;utm_source=copyLink&amp;utm_campaign=postshare_creator&amp;utm_content=join_link" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">since clarified</a> that "all mods will be free" but Patreon backers will receive early access to them.</p><p>Earlier this year, former Nintendo employees Krysta Yang and Kit Ellis suggested that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-these-ex-nintendo-employees-think-super-smash-bros-melee-hd-will-never-happen/1100-6512664/" data-ref-id="1100-6512664">the publisher will never make Super Smash Bros.

            <p>Daily <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Silksong</a> News, a YouTube channel and Discord server that has been posting constant updates on Team Cherry's action adventure game Hollow Knight: Silksong, has said farewell after 1694 days of uploads.</p>
<p>The final video, which premiered as Hollow Knight: Silksong became available for sale and titled The End, the video featured a stop-motion skit sending the channel off with a face reveal of the host Araraura. It's peak early internet energy.</p>
<p>Over almost 1700 days, Daily Silksong news accrued 234,000 YouTube subscribers and a Discord community of thousands of dedicated fans, lurkers, and posters. The live premiere of the final Silksong news video had over 15,000 live viewers, with longtime watchers saying their farewells at the cusp of the game's release.</p>

<p>Daily Silksong News was a running gag that transformed into something larger than its original intent. The vast majority of the channel's uploads are brief, with host Araraura announcing there was no news. However, on the occasion when there was news, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkjebOOXbX4&amp;ab_channel=DailySilksongNews">both Araraura and the channel's community would erupt with energy</a>.</p><p>Speaking to Eurogamer, Araraura expanded on his feelings now that the journey was over: "It feels unreal in a way, I got so used to Silksong just being 'a game that's not out' now that it's about to be it almost feels like I'm about to experience something that was out of my reach for so long".</p>
<p>As for how he'll be celebrating the release of Silksong, Daily Silksong News host Araraua will hang around with his friends and community members until the game goes live: "[I'm] probably gonna watch the DSN finale with my friends and stay on VC until the very last minute before it comes out after that I'm gonna go full blackout mode and enjoy Silksong on my own. No commentary or streaming, just at my own pace".</p>

<figure><a title="Octopath Traveler 0" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ac9d54fdc8d0f/octopath-traveler-0.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure><p>We still have a couple of months to go before <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/octopath-traveler-0">Octopath Traveler 0</a> lands on Switch 2, but Square Enix has lifted the specs lid early, so we all know what to expect from a performance and resolution standpoint.</p>
<p>The info was shared in a new update to the game's <a href="https://www.jp.square-enix.com/octopathtraveler0/">Japanese website</a> (thanks for the heads up, <a href="https://www.jp.square-enix.com/octopathtraveler0/">Nintendo Everything</a>), in which the dev posted an info table containing everything you need to know about the game on all platforms.</p>
<p>Fortunately, things are looking rather good for those with the latest Nintendo hardware. The Switch 2 version of the game will run at up to <strong>60fps</strong>, with a <strong>1920x1080</strong> resolution. The Switch 1, on the other hand, keeps things slightly lower and will play at up to <strong>30fps / 1280x720p</strong>. The site doesn't currently specify any handheld/docked discrepancies, so we might have to wait until release to see the differences in action.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067jgrtsw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>Another interesting addition to the performance table is the row that specifies how each version will fare in the game's town builder mode. The Switch 2 will allow up to 400 buildings to be placed in one area, while the Switch 1 edition will only allow up to 250.</p>
<p>For those wondering, this puts the Switch 2 version on the same level as the Octopath Traveler 0 PS4 release. The PS5 and Xbox Series X will muster up to 120fps at 3840x2160, with the opportunity to customise town with up to 500 buildings, while the Series S boasts 120fps at the slightly lower 1920x1080p with the same 500-buildings option.</p>
<p>It's always nice to get an idea of these numbers early, and the boosted frame rate and resolution should make the Switch 2 version play like a dream if the former runs smoothly — heck, look at how wonderful the first two games appeared on Switch 1.</p>
<p>Octopath Traveler 0 will launch on Switch 1 and 2 on <strong>4th December</strong>. Square Enix has announced that there are <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/octopath-0-is-a-game-key-card-on-switch-2-and-square-enix-has-no-plans-for-a-switch-1-upgrade-option">no plans for an upgrade path</a> between the two, and the S2's physical will arrive as a Game-Key Card (because of course it will).</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/geforce-now-gets-rtx-blackwell-update-next-week-unveils-busy-september-release-schedule.1288674/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>This GeForce NOW Thursday, NVIDIA brings the highly anticipated news regarding the launch date of the RTX Blackwell update: the cloud servers will be <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-geforce-now-blackwell-rtx-5080-pc-like-latency-image-quality-install-to-play-new-games-same-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">upgraded to GeForce RTX 5080-class hardware</a> (and improved CPU as well) on Wednesday, September 10. </p>



<p>The rollout will be gradual as usual, so do not be alarmed if your nearest server isn't up to snuff yet. As noted <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-shows-off-significant-level-up-of-the-geforce-now-experience-at-gamescom-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in our Gamescom 2025 preview</a>, there's a lot more than the GPU and CPU upgrade, though. Features like Cinematic Quality Streaming, Rivermax hardware packet pacing, L4S (Low Latency, Low Loss and Scalable Throughput), improved racing wheel devices support, and Steam's Install-to-Play are leveling up the experience in all regards: visuals, latency, hardware compatibility, and expanded games support.</p>



<p>On that note, GeForce NOW users can look forward to a very busy September featuring practically all the most anticipated PC game releases, starting this week with METAL EDEN, Hollow Knight: Silksong, Cataclismo, Hell is Us, and Cronos: The New Dawn.</p>



<p>Hell is Us and Cronos: The New Dawn support up to NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation, so from next week, Ultimate subscribers who live near an RTX Blackwell-upgraded server will get to enable that. You can find our Hell is Us review <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hell-is-us-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a> and our Cronos: The New Dawn review <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/cronos-the-new-dawn-such-is-our-calling/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>, if you're interested in our take on these titles.</p>



<p>NVIDIA also shared the full list of GeForce NOW games scheduled to be added to the cloud platform throughout the rest of September:</p>



<ul>
<li>Firefighting Simulator: Ignite (New release on Steam, Sept. 9)</li>



<li>Borderlands 4 (New release on Steam and Epic Games Store, Sept. 11)</li>



<li>Fata Deum - The God Sim (New release on Steam, Sept. 15)</li>



<li>Dying Light: The Beast (New release on Steam, Sept. 19)</li>



<li>Jump Space (New release on Steam, Sept. 19)</li>



<li>Warborne Above Ashes (New release on Steam, Sept. 19)</li>



<li>Endless Legend 2 (New release on Steam, Sept. 22)</li>



<li>Baby Steps (New release on Steam, Sept. 23)</li>



<li>Aztecs: The Last Sun (New release on Steam, Sept. 23)</li>



<li>Lost Rift (New release on Steam, Sept. 25)</li>



<li>Cloverpit (New release on Steam, Sept. 26)</li>



<li>Predecessor (Steam)</li>
</ul>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/dying-light-the-beast-xbox-game-pass/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/is-dying-light-the-beast-coming-to-xbox-game-pass.1288665/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Xbox Game Pass is one of the pillars of subscription-based gaming services. With Dying Light: The Beast looking to cause an explosive ruckus, it would be apocalyptic if The Beast jumped over the odd rooftop to get onto Game Pass.</p>



<p>Dying Light is looking to unleash the animal in all of us with The Beast. The game is a sequel to Dying Light 2, and brings back long-time hero <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/techland-explains-kyle-crane-thirst-dying-light/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kyle Crane</a>. Techland has worked on the third full game, to the extent of delaying the horror title. The Beast resumes the series’ on-brand cocktail of parkour and dishing out pain.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dying-light-the-beast-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dying Light: The Beast</a> arrives during a busy September 2025. But if you’ve only got eyes for The Beast, you should know its Xbox Game Pass status in case you can save a penny or two.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-dying-light-the-beast-on-xbox-game-pass">Can You Play Dying Light: The Beast On Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>There’ll be hell to pay for this. Credit to Techland</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Neither Techland nor Microsoft has said Dying Light: The Beast is coming to Xbox Game Pass as either a day-one launch or as a freebie at some point in the future.</strong></p>



<p>It’s very telling if you approach a game’s release date and there’s nothing about <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/xbox-game-pass" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Game Pass</a>. In 99% of cases, this means the game won’t be a day-one launch title. Xbox has had some third-party winners in 2025, including <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> and even the Soulslike <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wuchang-fallen-feathers-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</a>.</p>



<p>However, unless you’re an Xbox Game Studios title, there’s a good chance you’re paying full whack for the game—as is the case with Dying Light: The Beast. It’s not had a Game Pass logo slapped onto any of its trailers, and the Xbox store listing doesn’t bat even the slightest eyelid at the prospect.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-dying-light-the-beast-come-to-xbox-game-pass">Will Dying Light: The Beast Come To Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<p><strong>I’d say the chances of Dying Light: The Beast coming to Xbox Game Pass are pretty slim right now, given the franchise’s lack of history with the service.</strong></p>



<p>When you’ve enquired about enough games and their Xbox Game Pass chances, you learn a thing or two. I don’t think a Dying Light game has ever been on Xbox Game Pass. I can’t find the history of this, but Microsoft does have a habit of removing games after a while.</p>



<p>As of writing, you can’t find Dying Light or Dying Light 2 on Xbox Game Pass. That could be a big indicator of the game’s future on Game Pass. It’s not like these are niche indie titles after all. There have been rumors of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/game-pass-killed-by-first-party-development-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Game Pass being unsustainable due to first-party development costs</a>.</p>



<p>It’s one of those: If The Beast is announced for Game Pass, you’ll hear it from us first. On the other hand, I suggest keeping your expectations in check on this one.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> GTA 6 (Grand Theft Auto VI) - Official Release Date Reveal | Trailer 2</p>
      </div>
<p>Before this, Ubisoft referred to Skull &amp; Bones as a <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ubisoft-ceo-defends-skull-and-bones-70-price-despite-its-live-service-leanings-calls-it-quadruple-a/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"AAAA" game</a>, a comment that led to many memes and jokes.</p><p>Lowrie commented on GTA 6 against the backdrop of Devolver considering whether or not it would delay some of its games to get out of the way of GTA 6 when it was planned for a 2025 release. He said GTA 6 was "blinding" when it came to the calendar. It remains to be seen if Devolver will delay any games due to GTA 6.</p><p>In a cheeky social media post, the company said it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/devolver-re-commits-to-releasing-a-game-on-the-same-day-as-gta-6-after-delay/1100-6531291/" data-ref-id="1100-6531291">would, in fact, launch a game on the same day as GTA 6.</a> Devolver recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-latest-silksong-induced-game-delay-doesnt-hide-its-reasoning-in-new-trailer/1100-6534273/" data-ref-id="1100-6534273">delayed Baby Steps due to Silksong</a>, and while some have questioned that decision, Lowrie said he didn't want to gamble with people's livelihoods.</p><p>"You can't AB test reality," he said. "Maybe Baby Steps would've just been fine September 8, it could have been. But am I willing to risk this team's livelihood and the future of the game they've worked on for five years to see if they both work out? I'm not. And I also want to listen to what they want, and what they want is to have their own spotlight and I couldn't agree more."</p><p>Going back to GTA 6, Adam Lieb, the CEO of marketing platform Gamesight, told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/why-hollow-knight-silksong-is-this-years-gta-6-and-whether-a-juggernaut-stomping-on-your-release-date-really-matters" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> that GTA 6 has had an outsized effect on calendars and planning for video game companies.</p><p>"I would say that GTA for the last year and a half has been a part of almost every conversation around launch dates I have heard," Lieb said.</p><p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-05-09/-grand-theft-auto-vi-delay-is-impacting-every-game-company" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg reported</a> that when GTA 6 was delayed to 2026, some studios with games set for Fall 2025--the previous launch window for GTA 6--embraced the news, with others scrambling to make decisions for their own 2026 games.</p><p>GTA 6 is expected to perform exceptionally upon release, with one firm predicting it will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5-could-make-3-billion-in-first-year-alone/1100-6528605/" data-ref-id="1100-6528605">sell 40 million copies and drive $3 billion in revenue in the first year alone</a>. The game has gigantic shoes to fill, as GTA 5 has sold <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/top-10-best-selling-video-games-of-all-time/2900-4814/#1" data-ref-id="2900-4814">more than 215 million copies.</a></p>

            <p>Last year, Camouflaj and Oculus Studios released a Batman-flavoured VR release in the form of Arkham Shadows, and it looks like the teams are taking another bite of the apple.</p>
<p>During a recent interview with <a href="https://www.culturecombine.com/post/exclusive-interview-mark-rolston-talks-aliens-shawshank-and-spider-man-3-at-fan-expo-chicago-2025?ref=uploadvr.com">Culture Combine</a>, which was spotted by <a href="https://www.uploadvr.com/batman-arkham-shadow-sequel-voice-actor-confirms/">UploadVR</a>, Commissioner Gordon's actor confirmed a sequel is in the works.</p>
<p>Actor Mark Rolston was chatting about his career, and the difference between approaching games such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/blade-runner">Blade Runner</a> and Spider-Man 2.</p>
<p>"In the Blade Runner game, I was a voiceover, but for Spider-Man, I do complete motion capture, voice, and everything," the actor told the publication, before slipping this little nugget of information into the conversation:</p>
<p>"Same thing with the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/batman-arkham-shadow">Batman Arkham Shadow</a> VR game. We're about to start another one of those. I play Commissioner Gordon."</p>
<p>So, there you have it!</p>
<p>Our Ian rather enjoyed Batman Arkham Shadow in its release last year. "Batman Arkham Shadow can feel rough around the edges at times, but it's still a more than worthy entry to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/batman-arkham-games-order">Arkham series</a>, and an essential Quest 3 experience," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/batman-arkham-shadow-review">Eurogamer's four star Batman Arkham Shadow review</a>.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/i-played-more-crimson-desert-and-im-still-blown-away</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/i-played-more-crimson-desert-and-i%E2%80%99m-still-blown-away.1288626/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Back at Summer Game Fest in June,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/crimson-desert-preview-jaw-droppingly-detailed-gameplay-depth" rel="nofollow">I played some <em>Crimson Desert</em></a> and my mind was blown with just how dense its systems were. At PAX West, I had the chance to play a near identical demo on a new build but with a different focus and learned so much more.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Check out my previous preview linked above for information on the combat, as that is the same as what I experienced here. Suffice to say, it is complicated, dense, interconnected, and surprising.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>For The Sake of Immersion&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Interestingly, I was told they had four different people demoing the game at Summer Game Fest, each of them focusing on different aspects of the game to see how various previews would be written. Plus, they knew they would see some of us again at PAX West and other events, so they wanted to show us what wasn’t shown before.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So where I had been hyper focused on combat before, I now got to see a lot more of the little details in the world and focus on immersion in <em>Crimson Desert.</em> Like with the combat, how you interact with the world was given the same attention to detail.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The best way I can convey that is by just giving you a bunch of examples of what I saw and was shown.&nbsp;</p>

<p>First, one thing the team wanted to boast about was that they have the largest mocap studio in Asia, and they put it to use on every animation in the game. From the idle stuff in the background to the insane wrestling moves in combat, everything started in the mocap studio.</p>



<p>That has led to a lot of deliberate movements that really sell what you see on screen. Two soldiers reacting excitedly to seeing your character, Kliff, a famous mercenary, comes across as genuine and real. Kneeling down to repair a wheel on a cart, kicking it on just looks right.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is one of those things that sounds so boring to write out and talk about, but it’s one of those subtle things that you don’t notice but can have a big effect. There’s a big difference between clicking a button and suddenly the cart is repaired to seeing it put back together. In the latter, it feels like a real world and not a video game.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That is the world the<em> Crimson Desert</em> team has put a lot of work into making. We spent a decent amount of time talking about that immersion and the small, seemingly insignificant details that all add up to sell the world to players.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Things like voices muffling and echoing when wearing a helmet that covers a character's face. That the skybox rotates during the day to change as the time of day changes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In one funny example, I was told that in another demo someone wanted to see if they could pick up the chickens that are running around. You sure can, and they learned the white chickens were picked up and held by their feet while you the lucky brown chickens are cradled in Kliff's arms. Something not even the demoer knew you could do.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>You Can Change the World Around You</h2>

<p>The most interesting thing I saw was in how ways you interact with the world logically affect the properties of certain things. For example, I caught a large wooden gate on fire and while it was still catching fire, I tried to smash through it with a big hit. The gate was too strong and withstood the attack.</p>

<p>It was explained to me that inanimate objects have a sort of damage threshold that needs to be hit first before any damage can be done to them, sort of like in <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After some time, the gate burned up completely and looked very different, all black and charred. I then tried to smash through the gate again with a big attack, and this time I broke on through.</p>

<p>The fire had not just changed what the gate looked like visually, it had weakened the material just like what would happen in real life.</p>



<p>It’s that sort of logical detail that is littered throughout<em> Crimson Deser</em>t that I think it will delight people for a long time. A lot of moments of “I can’t believe the game can do that” will happen.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There’s so much granular detail that has been given a ton of attention and so many systems that all work together in a logical and intuitive way that the possibilities to do cool stuff are everywhere.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Being surprised by what is there is a big part of what they are going for with<em> Crimson Desert.</em>&nbsp;I saw that born out in this demo and my previous hands-on, as not only am I surprised at what the game could do so were the developers showing it off.</p>

<p>Part of keeping that surprise a big part of the game comes down to player choice. You have a ton of options in combat, how to move around the world, and just how to interact with all of the objects in it. I haven't seen much on the story or player choices that come into play there, but I can't wait to hear more.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[IO Interactive Might Be Done with Third-Party Publishing After MindsEye]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/io-interactive-mindseye-third-party-publishing</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/io-interactive-might-be-done-with-third-party-publishing-after-mindseye.1288623/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>MindsEye&nbsp;</em>publisher IO Interactive has suggested that the game's disastrous launch may have made the studio think twice about taking on third-party publishing contracts in the future.</p>

<p>Speaking <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/that-was-definitely-tough-right-ceo-of-mindseye-publisher-ioi-responds-to-disastrous-launch" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">to IGN</a>, IO Interactive CEO Hakan Abrak said that while his studio will continue to publish its own games, whether or not the IOI Partners label publishes any more third-party games "remains to be seen".</p>

<p>Just in case you need a reminder,&nbsp;<em>MindsEye</em>, which is the debut project from the "multinational" studio Build a Rocket Boy, was IO Interactive's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/io-interactive-publishing-ex-rockstar-thriller" rel="nofollow">first external publishing effort</a>, and it's safe to say the game's launch didn't exactly go as either studio had hoped it would.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mindseye-io-interactive-publishing-shooting.jpg?itok=JY2N_wf- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mindseye-io-interactive-publishing-shooting.jpg?itok=t0Om158X 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>IO Interactive may think twice about third-party publishing after&nbsp;<em>MindsEye</em>.</figcaption></figure><p><em>MindsEye&nbsp;</em>was released earlier this year to a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mindseye-launch-messy" rel="nofollow">roundly negative reception</a>, with its messy launch encountering widely-reported technical issues, leading to developer Build a Rocket Boy severing a planned sponsorship with streamer CohhCarnage, as well as PlayStation issuing rare refunds to players.</p>

<p>The launch of the game went so poorly that Build a Rocket Boy announced later that month that it would <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mindseye-build-a-rocket-boy-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">lay off over 100 employees</a>, which, according to an IGN report, constituted around a third of the studio's headcount at the time.</p>

<p>IO Interactive CEO Abrak described&nbsp;<em>MindsEye</em>'s launch as "definitely tough"; he said the release "wasn't what [Build a Rocket Boy] hoped for, and also what we didn't hope for at IOI Partners".</p>

<p>Despite that, Abrak says that Build a Rocket Boy is "working hard on turning that around to regain the trust" of disgruntled players, and that&nbsp;<em>MindsEye&nbsp;</em>has "tons of potential and content" in the pipeline. We'll have to wait and see if any of that comes to fruition.</p>




<p>IO Interactive's third-party publishing efforts may be on hold for the moment, but the studio is powering ahead with publishing its own releases, the next of which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/007-first-light-release-date" rel="nofollow">March's&nbsp;<em>007 First Light</em></a>. Here's hoping that launch goes better than&nbsp;<em>MindsEye</em>'s.</p>

              <p>Would you swap out your car’s motor for a nitro-burning drag engine if you could do it yourself and do it for pennies on the dollar? Of course you would, but unfortunately, unless you’re an automotive expert with a killer garage and a death wish, you can’t. But you can do the PC desktop equivalent of that kind of massive power upgrade — it’s easy, and while <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3896/">Amazon’s selling the Intel Core Ultra 7 processor for just $259 during a limited-time deal, it’s peanuts compared to the price of buying a whole new desktop rig.</a></p>
<p>This is a terrific deal for anyone looking to transform a blah PC desktop into a raging speed demon, but it’s especially great if you’re a gamer looking to upgrade a rig or are thinking about building your own from scratch. With 8 performance cores and 12 efficient cores, and that awesome max clock speed of 5.5GHz, the Intel Core Ultra 7 is begging to be the engine for high-end lag-free PC gaming.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3896/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>More Than Speed</h2>
<p>The Intel Core Ultra 7 processor is compatible with Intel 800 Series Chipset-based motherboards, and supports PCIe 5.0 and 4.0, along with DDR5. It’s clearly a speed demon, with more than enough horsepower to blast your way through the most rugged action games and shooters, but those performance and efficient cores also let your PC run cooler, which means less power consumption and less chance of sustaining overheating-related damage.</p>
<p>There’s a significant brain upgrade with the Intel Core Ultra 7 too, in addition to all that brawn. Intel’s Ultra processor-based AI is the key to better streaming and gaming than ever before, with an NPU that takes on tasks like background removal and auto-framing and applies AI to them to create the smoothest gaming and streaming experience yet.</p>



<h2>Optimization Across the Board</h2>
<p>The Core Ultra 7 processor features Intel’s Application Optimization tech, a customizable way to devote more of the processor’s incredible power to the games and applications you want to give a max boost to. The user interface lets you see which games are optimized, and to turn it on or off for individual games as you see fit. Combined with Ultra processor-based AI, this is future-proofed gaming guaranteed, with the absolute maximum speed and performance always at the ready.</p>
<p>Buying an all-new PC desktop with this much power is an expensive proposition indeed, and now thanks to this limited-time deal at Amazon, it’s one you can skip entirely. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3896/">With the price of the Intel Core Ultra 7 processor slashed by 36%, all the way down to $259</a>, the smart choice is to perform a little DIY brain surgery on your existing PC, or build one around this monster processor.</p>

<p>007 First Light developers have just confirmed that they used Daniel Craig’s head on Agent 47 to pitch the game.</p>



<p>007 First Light received its first gameplay yesterday at the exclusive State of Play event, along with a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/007-first-light-release-date-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release date</a>. Since then, players have begun forming impressions about the game, and the developers have also come forward to say it isn’t a “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/007-first-light-devs-insist-it-isnt-a-hitman-reskin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reskin</a>” of Hitman. Now, new details have been revealed about how Daniel Craig’s likeness was used when pitching 007 First Light. </p>



<h2 id="h-007-first-light-was-pitched-with-daniel-craig-s-head-on-agent-47">007 First Light Was Pitched with Daniel Craig’s Head on Agent 47</h2>



<p>IOI CEO, Hakan Abrak, confirmed during an interview with <a href="https://in.ign.com/project-007/240656/news/hitman-dev-io-interactive-put-daniel-craigs-head-on-agent-47-when-pitching-for-james-bond-game-007-f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a> that Daniel Craig’s head was placed on Agent 47 and put into World of Assassination when they demoed 007 First Light. Abrak reveals, “We actually did put Daniel Craig in there”, and they modeled his head and placed it instead of Agent 47. This was done for demo purposes only, to provide “an impression of what these living, breathing spaces mean in an IO game.”</p>



<p>Abrak adds that players who are familiar with a level called “Sapienza with the virus in the caves underneath the compound”, should know that some things were shown off there and “it was well received” The CEO explained that they were trying to convey that this is a “360 experience”, which is not just shooting and cutscenes, but also explores the “Bond Fantasy” in social spaces where the character needs to use his “charms and bluff” instead of his fists.</p>



<p>Abrak revealed that this was the first time they had worked on something other than original worlds and characters, and it was essential for them to put their “creative fingerprints” on it. They weren’t interested in “a gamification of a movie or maybe where it’s about technical prowess only, like pushing the pixels on Pierce Brosnan, for example, or just taking some bespoke scenes from a movie and realizing them in gaming.”</p>



<p>Instead, the developers want to create a “game for gamers” which brings players “a genuine Bond experience” where Bond is yet to become the world’s most famous spy and is still learning the ropes of the trade. </p>
