<figure><a title="Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition Review - Screenshot 1 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160784/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>As a person who grew up on the original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tomb_raider_i-iii_remastered">Tomb Raider</a> games back on the PS1, I eagerly anticipated the ‘new era’ of Lara Croft promised by publisher Square Enix and developer Crystal Dynamics for the 2013 reboot. Seemingly inspired by the success of the <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps3/uncharted_drakes_fortune">Uncharted</a> franchise (which itself was inspired by Tomb Raider), the first game in this reinvention strips back the years of character development and delivers a young woman yet to build the skills and charisma her older counterpart emits.</p>
<p>Instead, a young Lara is swept up in a dangerous adventure that lands her marooned on a remote island named Yamatai, and battling both hired goons and the wilderness itself for survival. It's a little dated now (prepare for lots of QTEs), but back in 2013, this gritty new take on Tomb Raider was a reinvigoration, and thanks to some smart combat changes shamelessly ripped from Nathan Drake’s outings, it still feels fresh today.</p>
<figure><a title="Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition Review - Screenshot 2 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160787/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/tomb-raider-definitive-edition">Tomb Raider</a> (2013) is a quasi-open-world entry that splits the gameplay between third-person action and platforming to explore. Lara and her team aboard the Endurance find themselves stranded, and quickly Croft is battling not just the elements, but also hoards of mercenaries (and plenty of other enemies) in a desperate struggle to survive and escape. Plus, you’ll also be doing some good-ol’ plundering, with small hidden Tombs littered across the map, not unlike the Shrines in modern Zelda.</p>
<p>The world of Yamatai is surprisingly open, and while the platforming here is nothing like the style of exploration we’d get just a few years later with titles like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild">Breath of the Wild</a>, the playground surrounding Lara is wide enough to feel intimidating.</p>
<p>Stripping the protagonist back to the essentials also makes her vulnerable, and the world surrounding Lara is absolutely out to take advantage of that. We find Croft beaten, bloodied, and generally put through absolute hell, and while it can occasionally feel gratuitous (seriously, those kill screens are wild), it does a fairly good job of showing the very first trials that forged our hero.</p>

<p>Mixing platforming with occasional stealth, sprinkling some light RPG elements with a skill tree, and some basic but satisfying combat, this Tomb Raider is a cocktail that tastes much better than the sum of its parts, largely thanks to execution. Revisiting it for the first time in many years, it's remarkable that while it certainly does ape the Uncharted formula (and perhaps even a little <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/resident_evil_4">Resident Evil 4</a>), there’s a cohesion and thrill to the gameplay that makes it impossible to put down.</p>
<p>The third-person action still feels tight, and while your weapon selection isn’t huge, the ways you can improve them are plentiful. Earning XP from combat or scavenging weapon parts slowly unlocks more options, and alongside finding relics and other collectibles, there’s plenty to uncover and many reasons to do so. Even when inspecting some of your pilfered relics, spinning them around to find hidden secrets is a joy and even earns you more XP. Though on Switch, the rumble goes a bit wild when you are looking at these relics and are close to a new clue.</p>

<p>Ultimately, original developer Crystal Dynamics did a good job of helping you care about Lara’s progression and making it feel earned. Whether you’ve played it before or are hoping to finally experience this story, there are dozens of hours to enjoy here if you want to explore everything on this godforsaken island.</p>
<p>Aspyr is responsible for this particular port, bringing this Definitive Edition to our greedy little mitts quite out of the blue. But, while some of the other ‘Definitive Edition’ ports on recent hardware boast gorgeous visuals and lighting effects, instead, this feels like the very original 2013 release given a quick polish.</p>
<p>Everything runs great, but stopping to look at textures or some of the character models reveals that this is a version of the game that has omitted visual fidelity in favour of performance, to quite a dramatic degree. I loaded up my PC copy of Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition just to play around and try to find a similar graphical benchmark, and cannot say I was impressed with the results. At a glance, Switch 2 feels comparable to the Normal PC graphics settings, and we’re definitely not getting the advanced TRESSFX for Lara’s hair.</p>
<figure><a title="Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition Review - Screenshot 5 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160786/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Thankfully, frame rate performs much better, with my tests showing a rock-solid 60fps on Switch 2 in docked mode while visuals were running at 2560x1440, with handheld mode looking to run at a comparable level frame-wise. Gameplay is key here, and this is not an ugly game by any means. A lush jungle is strengthened with dense foliage and inquisitive wildlife. Weather effects and running water add to the immersion and the great sound design. A lit torch and its flickering flames illuminate the dank caves and many tombs you must explore, smartly using shadows and beams of light to great effect.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a vantage point reveals the large scope of this gorgeous island, as well as the many dangers within. Ideally, the world would also have a greater variety of visual identity, because there’s a lot of PS3-era grey/brown design here, with even an occasional smearing of dirt on the screen. Lara spends the game covered in filth and surrounded by the elements, and the visuals convey that well.</p>
<p>For those picking it up on Switch 2, there are a couple of nice additions to sweeten the deal. One of those promised by Aspyr is gyro controls, and they appear as an option, but seem to only move specific menus instead of your sights with guns or bows. This, if intentional, is a wild choice and a complete waste - we've reached out for clarification and will update if/when we hear back. Hopefully, actual motion controls will be implemented with an update in the future.</p>

<p>Faring slightly better are the mouse controls, which at least work, but are very sensitive and a bit wonky. Even when holding the Joy-Con sideways, you have to use 'ZR' to pull your arrow, and then 'R' on the same Joy-Con to release it. This is just a very weird layout, and doesn't ever feel comfortable, especially when the controller version of this is the standard 'ZL' to pull, and 'ZR' to release.</p>
<p>Finally, this Definitive Edition of Tomb Raider also includes a treasure trove of additional content, including concept artwork, character models, and even the return of the surprisingly fun multiplayer. If you ever played the <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps3/uncharted_3_drakes_deception">Uncharted 3</a> online mode, this might be the closest thing we have today.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition is sadly not as Definitive as the title might imply. While Aspyr has done the work to make a title from 2013 run at a solid 60fps on a handheld, and with 1440p resolution, it seems the cost was graphical fidelity at almost every turn. Not to mention the bizarre implementation (or lack thereof) of motion controls, and unwieldy mouse options.</p>
<p>Thankfully, this entry in the Tomb Raider mythos remains one of the very best, and clever visual design means that your trip through Yamatai is far from ugly, as long as you don’t inspect too closely. Crystal Dynamics’ 2013 reinvention of Lara Croft just might be the best entry in this decades-old franchise, and for the asking price, you’re getting a thrilling action romp that’ll keep you hooked until the credits.</p></section>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Dead By Daylight has been given a brand new update by Behaviour Interactive, bringing the game up to update 9.3.0. The update re-enables the Mindbreaker perk, but has disabled the Breakdown and Wicked perks. Another new major change applies to the Hook with a Resolve Bar being made visible to other Survivors while being hooked. There are also more balance changes, plus changes for both Killers and Survivors. You can read the full patch notes below.</p>
<h2>Dead By Daylight 9.3.0 Mid-Chapter update patch notes</h2>

<ul>
<li>The Mindbreaker perk has been re-enabled.<wbr></li>
<li>The Breakdown and Wicked perks have been disabled.</li>
</ul>


<p><b>Quality of Life</b><wbr></p>


<ul>
<li>
<p>The Resolve Bar is now visible to other Survivors while hooked.<wbr></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Dev note: To help bridge the information gap between players using voice chat and those who aren’t, we’ve added the Resolve Bar to the HUD. This will help Survivors determine if the Killer is camping and plan their next move accordingly.</i></p>
<p><wbr><b>Balance</b><wbr><wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Anti-Facecamp meter now fills faster based on how long the Killer stays near the hook:<wbr></p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>0-10 seconds: 1x speed<wbr></li>
<li>10-20 seconds: 2x speed<wbr></li>
<li>&gt;20 seconds: 4x speed<wbr></li>
<li><i>Note: This multiplier only accumulates when the Killer is considered camping (the meter is gaining progress). The multiplier resets when the Survivor is unhooked.</i><wbr></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Decreased the base fill rate of the Anti-Facecamp meter by roughly 50% to compensate.<wbr></li>
<li>Hooking a Survivor now applies a 7 second grace period to all hooked Survivors&nbsp;<i>(was only the last hooked Survivor)</i>.<wbr></li>
</ul>
<p><i>Dev note: To make the Anti-Facecamp mechanic fairer to both sides, we’ve reduced the base fill rate and added the time the Killer remains near the hook as a modifier. This gives Killers who are not camping more freedom to pass by a hook (particularly in cramped spaces like hallways) without worrying about the meter filling and giving the Survivor a free escape. This also means that Survivors who are being camped for extended periods gain the ability to unhook themselves slightly earlier.</i><wbr><wbr></p>

<p><b>Unhook Changes</b><wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Survivors gain 10% Haste and Endurance for 15 seconds after being unhooked&nbsp;<i>(was 10)</i>.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Decreased the time for crows to appear to 80/100/120 seconds&nbsp;<i>(was 120/140/190)</i>.<wbr></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Dev note: Following the release of the updated AFK crow system, we increased the time it took to gain crows. This was much too generous, allowing for Survivors to avoid crows too easily. We’re dialing back the values a little bit to a middle ground between the original values and the live values.</i></p>


<p><b>The Shape</b><wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Slaughtering Strike’s camera controls are now identical to regular camera controls.<wbr></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>The Skull Merchant</b><wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Increased the Drone Rotation speed to 105 degrees/second&nbsp;<i>(was 95 degrees/second).</i><wbr></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increased the Hindered status effect from getting scanned to 10%&nbsp;<i>(was 8%).</i><wbr></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Decreased the Deploy Drone cooldown to 7 seconds&nbsp;<i>(was 10 seconds).</i><wbr></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Decreased the Undetectable duration after deploying a Drone to 6 seconds&nbsp;<i>(was 8 seconds).</i><wbr></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Removed the fast vault immunity to Scan Lines.<wbr></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For every 2.5 seconds spent standing underneath a Drone, the Survivor gains 1 Lock On&nbsp;<i>(was instant).</i><wbr></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Decreased Killer detection range for the Drone&nbsp;<i>(now only rises when colliding directly with The Skull Merchant)</i><wbr></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Dev note: The Skull Merchant has dropped fairly significantly in terms of kill rate and lethality. These buffs aim to make her Drones a bigger threat and bring her up a little bit. Additionally, we’ve decreased the cooldown to deploying drones, and consequently decreased the duration of Undetectable to keep some downtime between her Undetectable status effect. When standing underneath a Drone, Survivors would get instant Lock On, which felt like a bug whenever it happened. The gradual increase of Lock On will feel more natural and provide feedback to the Survivor that something bad is happening to them. Lastly, we reduced the Drone’s sensitivity to their mistress, to make sure they are always ready to scan Survivors during chases in tight spaces and don’t ascend unintentionally.</i><wbr><wbr></p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><b>Original Pain (The Cenobite):</b><wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When a Survivor breaks free from a Possessed Chain, reveal their aura for 8 seconds&nbsp;<i>(rework).</i><wbr></p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Soma Family Photo (The Singularity):</b><wbr></p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Slipstreaming a Survivor inflicts the Hindered&nbsp;status effect for 6 seconds&nbsp;<i>(was 3 seconds).</i><wbr></li>
<li>Inflicts the Deep Wound status effect if the Survivor is injured&nbsp;<i>(removed).</i><wbr></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Dev note: Both of these add-ons were notorious for their ability to disable the Endurance status effect Survivors get when they are unhooked. These changes aim to remove this ability to bypass the protection post-unhook.</i><wbr><wbr></p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><b>Conviction:</b><wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Updated perk to require specifically healing another Survivor&nbsp;<i>(to prevent infinite interaction with Plot Twist).</i><wbr></p>

<li>
<p>Increased Bloodpoint amount to 500&nbsp;<i>(was 200)</i>.<wbr></p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Dev note: With the above changes to hook improvements, we thought it was the right time to raise a few Score Events to encourage Killers to spread first hooks earlier in the match.</i><wbr><wbr></p>

<p><b>Pallet Density Changes</b><wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>Reviewed all pallet tiles to evaluate and reduce the safety of pallet loops on MacMillan Estate, Asylum, The Red Forest, Yamaoka Estate, Haddonfield and Mount Ormond Resort.<wbr></li>
<li>Adjusted the spawn logic of certain structures (i.e. the main building in Disturbed Ward; the piers in Backwater Swamp) to better randomize items and balance the distance between windows and pallets. This also impacts The Red Forest<wbr></li>
<li>Adjusted the Crotus Prenn Asylum Realm, reducing the safety of the main building which could spawn near maze tiles and chain into other tiles.<wbr></li>
</ul>
<p><i>Dev note: After collecting feedback from the community on the recent pallet density update, we made the above changes to address some of the most notable friction points. Thank you so much for taking the time to share your thoughts on its initial iteration and do let us know what you think of these changes.</i><wbr></p>
<p><b>The Underground Complex</b><wbr></p>

<li>We’ve introduced a fog effect across the map.<wbr></li>
<li>We’ve reworked the overall lighting and adjusted the hue of the Realm to improve visual clarity.</li>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>When Spellcasters Chronicles was announced, it felt like a whirlwind of an announcement. Early morning of Thursday, October 16, 2025, you could see rumors online about Quantic Dream making a multiplayer game. Shortly after, those rumors proved to be true as Quantic Dream co-founder David Cage <a href="https://wccftech.com/quantic-dream-announces-multiplayer-game-star-wars-eclipse-work-continues/">confirmed the studio was entering a new chapter with a multiplayer game in development</a>, while work on Star Wars Eclipse continued.</p>



<p>Fast-forward one hour from Cage's post, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/quantic-dream-competitive-multiplayer-game-spellcasters-chronicles/">Quantic Dream had announced its multiplayer title</a> as Spellcasters Chronicles, a new PvPvE, 3v3, F2P, third-person multiplayer action game that's also a hero-shooter and a deck builder. The game's first closed beta would arrive before the end of the year, and the next day, on October 17, attendees at TwitchCon would be able to play it and check it out for themselves. It was a lot, to say the least, for the announcement and reveal of the studio's debut multiplayer game.</p>



<p>Though, while it's arguably a tad overwhelming with its mix of genres, it also makes a lot of sense to me. As a studio known only for its single-player games, Quantic Dream might as well go big or go home with its foray into multiplayer. So that means we get a game that's trying to mash a few different things together: a bit of Overwatch here, with a bit of deck building there, and a splash of Destiny, but your characters can actually fly in the air constantly instead of having to come back down to the ground.</p>

<p>It also means a short eyes-to-hands time span, which is my term for the time between when we see a first trailer and when it's first publicly available to players to try. A shorter eyes-to-hands time span means less time for players to wonder how development on it is going, and less time for negative speculation.</p>



<p>There's some emphasis on narrative, though at this stage in the game, it's far less clear how that will play out. I've found that a lot of developers will try to claim there's some kind of meaningful narrative to be found in their multiplayer game, and very few, if any, will actually make good on that claim. We'll see where Spellcasters Chronicles ends up.</p>



<p>In the meantime, ahead of the game's first closed beta, I got the chance to play an hour of Spellcasters Chronicles with other members of the press and a few of the game's developers. Well, it wasn't necessarily an hour, because the first 15 minutes were spent solving a couple of technical issues, one of which was that the game ran like an absolute slideshow on my laptop.</p>

<p>My laptop is not the highest-end gaming laptop out there; I have a 3070Ti laptop GPU paired with a Ryzen 9 6900HS CPU and 32GB of RAM. It's not the best, but it's not the worst either, and while I get that it's a pre-release build, I was still surprised by how poorly it was running when I first loaded the game and got into a match. I was able to have a smooth experience for about 45 minutes once I connected to Quantic Dream's internal streaming setup, so my impressions are mostly based on that short window.</p>



<p>That short time frame could very well be why, coming away from that time with the game, to answer the question I asked in the title of this preview: No, it probably can't cast a spell on players.</p>



<p>Now, there are a lot of caveats here; I didn't spend a lot of time with the game, only getting through about one and a half matches. I also wasn't playing with a bunch of experienced Spellcasting Chroniclers (or whatever its community of players will call themselves). Each side had one Quantic Dream developer on their team, so the sides were evenly matched with one experienced player, but the rest of us were new to it, and anyone who plays multiplayer games knows that as your game knowledge increases, so does, generally speaking, how much fun you have.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/3.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Spellcasters Chronicles. Image credit: Quantic Dream</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>I also didn't get the full Spellcasters Chronicles experience - not just because of the short time I had with it - but because the abilities my character had were pre-set for this demo. I have to imagine that if we were able to actually build the characters we played and spend some time choosing and learning the pros and cons of each card, which would be the case in the final game, I'd feel more engaged with the match.</p>



<p>All that to say, I could be wrong, and this could become the next big multiplayer game in the industry for all I know. But what I do know is that, whether I'm wrong or not, I probably won't be playing very much of it, and that has little to do with the limitations of the time I spent with the game; I only mention them because they do, of course, colour my experience with it.</p>



<p>Let me start with the good. It feels good to play, and by that I mean it felt good to fly around, to use the different abilities of my hero, to summon creatures and move forward on your enemies' Lifestones. While I did have issues with the pacing in the one-and-a-half matches I played, I appreciate the layer of strategy involved in its gameplay and the back-and-forth that can occur. </p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/8.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Spellcasters Chronicles. Image credit: Quantic Dream</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>It's also not a boring game to look at. There's a great spectacle to the gameplay, with the spells you use as your main attacks, summoning creatures to march towards your enemies' Lifestones, and especially summoning Titans to march your line forward. A spectacle that was only matched by an experience I had, where I summoned a Titan-sized stone wall to defend our team's Lifestone long enough to destroy theirs, and win the match.</p>



<p>There's a lot to like about Spellcasters Chronicles, for sure, I'm just not sure it's all engaging enough to really make a dent in the communities of already established multiplayer games, particularly established MOBAs. Much of what I don't like about playing the game can be attributed to things I just don't like about MOBAs, but even when considering that my personal issues with MOBAs clearly aren't problems for the millions of people that play them, it's difficult to see Spellcasters Chronicles breaking through the ceiling.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/4.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Spellcasters Chronicles. Image credit: Quantic Dream</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Most of the moment-to-moment gameplay in Spellcasters Chronicles felt good, and very little of it felt great. Casting spells felt good because they looked cool, but they never felt great to cast, as the visuals, audio, and animations didn't align to make it a deeper sensory experience.</p>



<p>The character designs seemed fine? The more I study them in action while watching back B-roll footage provided by Quantic Dream, the less intrigued I am to know anything about them, but I don't think I would say they look bad. The environmental design of the map was lacking anything really eye-catching, and I'm not entirely sold on its mix of genres. It's not a 'bad game,' which means it must be a 'good game,' at least in some ways, but it's by no means a great game.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/62.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Spellcasters Chronicles. Image credit: Quantic Dream</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>'Good but not great' is not a good place for a multiplayer game to land in 2025.</p>



<p>Launching a new original single-player game, and by that I mean a game that's not based on a previously established series, is one thing. Launching a new original free-to-play multiplayer game? You're not just trying to get players in the door, you're trying to get them to move into a mostly empty space when they're already living in five other world-class apartments (games).</p>



<p>Yes, this is just a preview. Yes, once again, I only had a short time with the game in limited, pre-release conditions that the general public won't deal with. Yes, it will be tweaked and altered over time, and yes, considering <a href="https://wccftech.com/report-reveals-how-ubisoft-execs-turned-splinter-cell-game-into-xdefiant/">how many multiplayer games</a> we've <a href="https://wccftech.com/herman-hulst-playstation-trying-to-learn-from-live-service-failures-concord/">seen come and go</a> (<a href="https://wccftech.com/herman-hulst-playstation-trying-to-learn-from-live-service-failures-concord/">announced</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-live-service-canceled/">unannounced</a>) even within <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazons-crucible-just-got-discontinued-only-five-months-after-launch/">just the last five years</a>, across <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/mountaintop-studios-shutting-down-after-debut-shooter-spectre-divide-falls-short">all genres</a>, it's <a href="https://wccftech.com/multiversus-to-end-with-season-5-game-to-go-offline/">not exactly prophetic</a> to say <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-avengers-shutting-down-soon-2023-content-canceled/">the latest game to try</a> won't make it.</p>



<p>But I'll still say it, because I don't think Quantic Dream has something here that's ready to smash onto the MOBA scene and the free-to-play multiplayer scene and catch everybody's attention with the kind of intensity that it needs to survive.</p>



<p>Ultimately, hey, what do I know? I know that I didn't love what I played, but I liked it enough to give it another shot under regular conditions to win me over. I know that it's not generally my kind of multiplayer game, and that's where I hit a wall with it. I also know that in the history of single-player game studios branching out to multiplayer, <a href="https://wccftech.com/anthem-going-offline-2026-ea/">it doesn't always go so well</a>.</p>



<p>If you want to play what honestly feels like it'll be the <a href="https://wccftech.com/remedy-admits-disappointing-sales-fbc-firebreak-control-sold-5-million/">FBC: Firebreak</a> of MOBAs, then you should check out the closed beta for Spellcasters Chronicles from December 4-7.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-rog-xbox-ally-update-adds-%E2%80%9Chand-crafted%E2%80%9D-game-profiles-for-40-games.1364269/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Last month, <a href="https://wccftech.com/asus-says-market-response-to-xbox-rog-ally-has-been-extremely-positive/">ASUS and Xbox released their collaborative handheld device</a>, the ROG Xbox Ally and its more powerful variant, the ROG Xbox Ally X. It was the arrival of Xbox's Full Screen Experience (Xbox FSE) and our first taste, <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-gen-xbox-console-will-be-very-premium-very-high-end-curated-experience-says-ceo/">according to Xbox president Sarah Bond</a>, of what the company will do with its future consoles.</p>



<p>In the time since launch, ROG Xbox Ally users have seen <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-rog-xbox-ally-biggest-update-since-launch-boosts-battery-life-and-game-performance/">plenty of updates come from ASUS</a> as it supports and fixes software issues with the device as they appear, but we've yet to have a new feature added or see a major update from Xbox - until today, as Microsoft announced in an <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/11/25/rog-xbox-ally-updates-improvements-november-2025/">Xbox Wire post</a> that the latest update adds Default Game Profiles.</p>



<p>The new feature is meant to make your experience playing on the ROG Xbox Ally/Ally X as seamless as possible and limit the amount of time you'd have to spend in a game's settings, adjusting and tweaking the graphical options so you can get it running at a solid frame rate and visual fidelity.</p>



<p>Essentially, Xbox has, across 40 titles to start, created ROG Xbox Ally/Ally X-optimized settings. These Default Game Profiles will automatically balance frame rate and power consumption for supported titles creating "<em>smoother, more enjoyable gameplay and extended battery life, without requiring manual adjustments</em>."</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Inside ROG Xbox Ally - Default Game Profiles" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RCU97vtmsE8?start=23&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Hollow Knight Silksong, for example, is a game that you can now get a full extra hour of playtime out of, due to how well the power consumption is optimized with its Default Game Profile, according to Xbox, while still playing at a full 120 FPS.</p>



<p>Thankfully, you're not locked into using a supported game's default profile; you can still choose to adjust the settings manually to your preference. They'll also only turn on automatically when you're playing the ROG Xbox Ally on its battery, and not when it's plugged in. "<em>When you launch a supported game, the system automatically applies a tailored game profile, which sets recommended power (TDP) and a FPS limit specific to the game</em>," the Xbox Wire post reads.</p>



<p>Though the post is clear that 40 titles are supported off the jump, it doesn't include a full list of the supported titles, only highlighting 16, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</li>



<li>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</li>



<li>Call of Duty: Warzone</li>



<li>DOOM Eternal</li>



<li>DOOM: The Dark Ages</li>



<li>Fortnite</li>



<li>Forza Horizon 5</li>



<li>Gears 5</li>



<li>Gears of War: Reloaded</li>



<li>Gears Tactics</li>



<li>Halo: The Master Chief Collection</li>



<li>Hollow Knight Silksong</li>



<li>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</li>



<li>Minecraft</li>



<li>Sea of Thieves</li>



<li>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4</li>
</ul>



<p>Currently, games that are cleared to work well on the ROG Xbox Ally and Ally X will include a "<em>Handheld Optimized"</em> notice on that game's store page, though there doesn't appear to be a tag for games included in the list of games that support the new 'Default Game Profile' feature. The Outer Worlds 2, for example, is a game I booted up on my ROG Xbox Ally X that I could see does support the new Default Game Profile feature and is not listed here.</p>



<p>Perhaps a tag will be added later, but for now, if you want to check if a game you're playing supports this new feature, you'll only be able to find out once you've launched it, and can see the option for the Default Game Profile in the Armoury Crate Command Center.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-quietly-liquidates-ugreen-nexode-65w-4-port-fast-charger-almost-free-now-2000647211</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-quietly-liquidates-ugreen-nexode-65w-4-port-fast-charger-almost-free-now.1364251/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Modern life requires charging multiple devices at once and most homes and offices don’t have anywhere near enough outlets or good-quality chargers to keep phones, laptops, tablets, and accessories all charged up simultaneously. A compact multi-port charger consolidates the charging infrastructure into a single hub that eradicates adapter juggling and outlet competition and offers fast charging across all connected devices.</p>
<p>At <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4472/">$24, down from $39, Ugreen’s four-port Nexode 65W charger has reached a record-low price</a> on Amazon for Black Friday that suggests a zero-margin pricing that’s purely aimed at driving volume sales during the critical shopping period. This aggressive discount makes <strong>premium GaN charging technology accessible to everyone</strong> rather than remaining a luxury for tech enthusiasts.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4472/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>65W Power for Laptops</h2>
<p>The maximum <strong>65W output provides enough power to charge MacBook Air</strong>, MacBook Pro, Dell and other USB-C laptops at full speed rather than the trickle charging that lower-wattage adapters deliver. A MacBook Air reaches 51% battery in just 30 minutes when using the full 65W through a compatible cable: this makes quick charging practical during brief work breaks or morning routines.</p>



<p>The <strong>four-port configuration, including three USB-C outputs and one USB-A input</strong>, covers every device type you’re likely to carry daily without requiring multiple chargers or adapters. You can charge your laptop off one USB-C port while simultaneously powering your phone off another USB-C port, your tablet off the third USB-C port, and older accessories such as wireless earbuds or fitness trackers off the USB-A port<strong>. Intelligent power distribution</strong> automatically adjusts wattage allocation based on the requirements of the devices connected to ensure optimal charging speeds, rather than equally splitting power without regard for actual needs.</p>
<p>The <strong>compact dimensions of just 2.64 x 1.65 x 1.5 inches</strong> make for a charger small enough to slip into jacket pockets or laptop bag compartments without the bulk that makes larger chargers a pain to transport. This size reduction compared to traditional laptop chargers comes courtesy of GaN technology that allows higher power density in smaller packages thanks to running cooler and more efficiently than silicon-based designs. <strong>Foldable prongs</strong> collapse flush against the body to avoid snagging on bag contents or causing damage to other items during transport.</p>
<p>Besides size reduction,<strong> GaN technology provides safety due to better thermal management</strong> and prevents dangerous overheating that has plagued cheap chargers with outdated component designs. Improved efficiency means less energy is converted to waste heat during operation, keeping the charger cooler during extended use while reducing fire risk. Built-in protections against overcurrent that could damage sensitive device circuits, overvoltage spikes resulting from unstable power grids, and short circuits from cable damage or debris in the ports are included.</p>



<p>This covers universal compatibility with MacBook Pro and Air, iPhone 15/16/17 series, Samsung Galaxy S24/S25, Google Pixel 9/10, iPad Pro, Steam Deck, and virtually any USB-C device compatible with Power Delivery fast charging standards. That cross-compatibility breaks the iOS versus Android divide in which you’d have to use different chargers for different ecosystems.</p>
<p>For $24, the Ugreen 65W charger delivers a total of four ports, including three USB-C, GaN technology, and 65W laptop charging capability. Now 39% off retail this Black Friday, Amazon’s aggressive pricing suggests margin sacrifice for volume during peak shopping season.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/persona-director-says-%E2%80%98jrpg-3-0%E2%80%99-is-coming-to-re-shape-the-genre-%E2%80%98at-a-fundamental-level%E2%80%99.1364248/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>People talk about turn-based role-playing games and JRPGs the way academics fret about the novel. Much ink is spilt over what defines the form and whether it’s dead, only for a great piece of work to come along and briefly revitalize hope that it’s as alive and relevant as ever. <a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-ending-verso-maelle-choice-1851778284"><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></a> was this year’s jolt of lightning, proving turn-based RPGs still have some gas left in the tank, but <em>Persona</em> director Katsura Hashino seems to think the genre’s best days are still ahead.</p> <p>The lead developer behind <a href="https://kotaku.com/metaphor-refantazio-review-pc-ps5-xbox-persona-atlus-1851665876"><em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em></a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/persona-5-the-kotaku-review-1793752909"><em>Persona 5</em></a> recently gave a talk at the G-Star 2025 gaming conference in South Korea with the heady title ‘When experience becomes memory – designing lasting impressions through art and structure’ in which he argued there are three main eras of the JRPG, according to a report by <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/714/G071477/20251114074/"><em>4Gamer</em></a> that was translated by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/jrpg/persona-and-metaphor-refantazio-creator-says-he-wants-to-create-jrpg-3-0-fundamentally-changing-the-genres-structure-and-presentation/"><em>Gamesradar</em></a>.</p>

 <p>According to Hashino, JRPG 1.0 encompasses the “true classics,” which seems to include everything from the NES through at least PS2. Then there’s JRPG 2.0, which refers to the modern era of the genre. The director doesn’t seem to specify the boundaries, but lets peg it at <em>Persona 4</em> through <em>ReFantazio</em>, a period which Hashino describes as being “higher quality due to how much more responsive they are to the player.”</p>

 <p>Most importantly, there is “JRPG 3.0,” which refers to the next generation of games that haven’t yet been defined. How will the genre stay fresh in this new era? “There will be a greater dimension to these games and they’ll change the genre’s structure and presentation at a fundamental level,” he says, according to <em>Gamesradar</em>.</p>

 <h2>Is <em>Clair Obscur</em> the future or the past?</h2> <p>I have no idea what any of this means, but I’m excited that Hashino seems excited. He doesn’t sound dogmatically wedded to the past or necessarily burnt out on what has become a very successful but somewhat predictable formula for Atlus RPGs. Will that push the team to try and reinvent the wheel a bit with <em>Persona 6</em>, or whatever P-Studio has coming in the future? I certainly hope so.</p>

 <p>There’s been <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/expedition33/comments/1ogr1r2/history_of_turn_based_rpgs_according_to_e33/">a meme going around</a> aimed at lampooning self-identified JRPG fans who sometimes seem to pretend like nothing good came out of the genre between <em>Final Fantasy VII</em> and <em>Clair Obscur</em>. But there’s a kernel of truth in both stances. There have been plenty of great JRPGs during this period, and they weren’t just called <em>Persona</em>. The<em> Xenoblade Chronicles</em> are a particular bright spot, while <em>Trails</em>, <em>Tales</em>, and other series have grown bigger as well.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is unironically how some of y'all treat this genre <a href="https://t.co/pL8tIDXfcU">https://t.co/pL8tIDXfcU</a> <a href="https://t.co/wwswKZrRS0">pic.twitter.com/wwswKZrRS0</a></p> <p>— Red (@kitsuneredFES) <a href="https://twitter.com/kitsuneredFES/status/1981807121168838678?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 24, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>But it’s also true that <em>Clair Obscur</em> has pulled in lapsed fans in a way few other games have. A timeline with only<em> FFVII</em> and <em>Clair Obscur</em> on it is JRPG erasure, but it’s probably a not entirely inaccurate picture of your average casual gamer’s relationship to the genre.</p> <p>The French GOTY front-runner is in many ways a very traditional turn-based role-playing game, but it has just enough unique twists on old tropes and mechanics to feel bold and novel. It recontextualizes the past more than it points to some revolutionary future, but maybe, as with <em>Metaphor</em> and other turn-based games experimenting around the fringes, it can be a bridge to something new. Or maybe I, like a lot of fans, just want to be tricked into feeling like what we’re nostalgic for is actually doing something fresh.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/wd-5tb-portable-external-hard-drive-at-0-02-per-gb-shows-black-friday-is-all-about-clearing-stock-not-profit.1364242/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>You have enough on your mind during the holidays, why not free yourself from the fear of your laptop or desktop meeting with a catastrophic demise and taking all of your precious data and files with it? <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5920/">There’s a Black Friday deal for that right now at Amazon — save $30 off the price of the 5TB model of WB’s Elements portable external hard drive for Windows or Mac.</a> Take a quick break from shopping for family and friends and give yourself the best gift of all — peace of mind.</p>
<p>That might sound extreme, but saving yourself from losing your data and files due to a massive hardware failure, an accident, or even an act of nature is well worth the new $110 price tag on the 5TB WB Elements. Many of the items on your PC or Mac are probably irreplaceable, like digital family movies or digitized photos, official documents that you’ve scanned into digital form, work files, archived emails, and more. A fast backup to a reliable portable hard drive is an essential step toward keeping your files safe, and the WD Elements is among the very best.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5920/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>The Size and Speed You Need</h2>
<p>The 5TB capacity of this WB Elements portable external hard drive is likely more than enough to back up your entire desktop or laptop, and possibly consolidate any files you’ve had floating around on thumb drives or smaller external hard drives. The longest file transfer is always the first one, but the WB Elements drive moves at USB 3.0 speed up to 5Gbps while also being retro-compatible with USB 2.0 devices. You should note it’s a USB-A device, not USB-C.</p>
<p>All those files may be hogging hard drive space on your computer, but the WB Elements backup drive will most definitely not hog space on your actual desktop. It’s a tiny, sleek device measuring only 3.2 by 4.35 inches and a scant 8.32 ounces, so it’s literally pocket-sized and more than able to hitch a ride in your backpack or briefcase.</p>
<p>The drive comes formatted for Windows 10, 8.1, and 7.1 for plug-and-play usage. It’s also Mac-compatible after a quick and easy reformatting process that your Mac or MacBook will walk you through.</p>



<h2>Steal of a Deal</h2>
<p>The full range of WD Elements portable external hard drives, ranging from 1TB to 6TB, are beginning to hit Black Friday pricing. But this 5TB model is by far the best deal so far at 21% off its regular $140 price. If you’re really concerned about keeping your files safe, a great way to take advantage of this awesome deal is to buy two WD Elements drives, with one intended to be stored somewhere away from your home in case of fire or other natural disaster.</p>
<p>WD’s rep as one of the best storage drive manufacturers has been decades in the making, starting with the My Book line that debuted in 2006. The 2007 model My Book was one of the first terabyte-sized drives to hit the consumer market. The physical size of these drives has shrunk dramatically while the storage levels have soared, and the prices have never been friendlier than they are now. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5920/">Hit this Amazon Black Friday deal on the 5TB WD Elements drive for just $110 and sleep easier knowing your files are safe and secure.</a></p>

<p>Battlestate Games has revealed that, amid ongoing issues with the redemption and dropping of Twitch rewards in the Escape from Tarkov 1.0 launch, the campaign has been greatly extended.

<p>Battlestate Games confirmed that <strong>no changes have been made </strong>to the rewards unlockable via the campaign, but Nikita Buyanov, the head of the studio, stated that his unique voice line pack has received a boosted drop rate.</p>

<p>Most of the viewers chasing the Tarkov Twitch drops are doing so because they want to unlock Nikita’s voice in the game. As one of the most exclusive rewards, users have a chance of securing Nikita’s voiceover for their character, regardless of whether they’re playing as a BEAR or a USEC PMC.</p>

<li>Rewards will be available only in PVP MODE.</li>



<li>The reward is issued only once per Twitch and game account, respectively.</li>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Pokémon is in the midst of a huge popularity spike that will only get bigger next year with the 30th anniversary of the franchise, and finding the right holiday gifts for an avid Pokémon fan in 2025 can be tricky, given the sheer amount of options available.</p>



<p>Anyone outside of the Pokémon loop may find it difficult to tell a Charizard and a Pikachu apart, which is merely the tip of the iceberg, as the Pokémon franchise has gotten weird at times during almost three decades of history. Fear not, though, as Insider Gaming is here to help with a selection of the best holiday gifts 2025 for any Pokémon fan, young or old.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-pokemon-holiday-gifts-for-2025">Best Pokémon Holiday Gifts for 2025</h2>



<h3 id="h-pokemon-tcg-mega-evolutions-elite-trainer-box">Pokémon TCG Mega Evolutions Elite Trainer Box</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>The Pokémon TCG is now in the Mega Evolution era, and this Elite Trainer Box covers the first set in that run. Each ETB contains an exclusive promo, nine booster packs, card sleeves, and other TCG accessories. There are two designs available, featuring Gardevoir and Riolu, with separate promos in each.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-pokemon-tcg-mega-charizard-x-ex-ultra-premium-collection">Pokémon TCG: Mega Charizard X ex Ultra-Premium Collection</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>For those looking for an extra boost for any Pokémon TCG collector, the Mega Charizard X ex Ultra-Premium Collection is one of the most sought-after products released in recent years.

<hr>







<figure></figure>



<p>Pokémon Legends: Z-A is the most recent game to release in the franchise, mixing things up with new battle mechanics and an expansive open-world environment across Lumiose City. Available on both Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2, it’s the perfect time to buy with the Mega Dimension DLC releasing on December 10.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-eevee-evolutions-powera-enhanced-wireless-controller-for-nintendo-switch-switch-2">Eevee Evolutions PowerA Enhanced Wireless Controller for Nintendo Switch/Switch 2</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>The Joy Cons on both the Nintendo Switch and Switch 2 are not the most comfortable to use for extended gaming sessions, so the PowerA Enhanced Wireless Controller is a good option—especially as this design is stacked with Eevee and its various evolutions, though there are also other designs available.</p>



<p>With up to 30 hours of charge, two mappable Advanced Gaming Buttons, and superior ergonomics for comfortable gaming, the PowerA Enhanced Wireless Controller is a solid bet.</p>

<p>Pokémon’s partnership with MEGA is coming to an end, with LEGO products arriving next year, so time is running out to get some of the best MEGA products available, including the Kanto Region Pokédex.

<hr>



<h3 id="h-pokemon-paldea-first-partner-plush-3-pack">Pokémon Paldea First Partner Plush 3 Pack</h3>

<hr>



<h3 id="h-pokemon-battle-academy-board-game">Pokémon Battle Academy Board Game</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Any young fan wanting to learn the Pokémon TCG can quickly become overwhelmed in the hobby, but the Pokémon Battle Academy Board Game is the perfect stepping stone.

Take on fearsome enemies to earn additional in-game rewards including two new weapons, a new Sync Strike for Zelda and Calamo, and more! <a href="https://t.co/ADRlQJBu5E" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/ADRlQJBu5E</a></p>  — Nintendo of America (@NintendoAmerica) <a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1993318778134765749?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 25, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>According to <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-gets-first-content-update-this-week-full-details/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Everything</a>, you'll get access to multiple Battle Challenges and Hyrule Challenges after you've cleared the main campaign, alongside new enemy types for you to fight. There's a Greatsword of Light and a Spear of the Upper Guard you can equip to the mysterious golem and warriors of various races. And you have Zelda and Calamo's new Sync Strike, which apparently sees Calamo throw a boomerang that Zelda will call back with the power of time, as well as a Sync Strike with the Block Golem, which is this powerful spinning attack that knocks down weak enemies.</p><p>Nintendo hasn't revealed an official English translation for the update yet; however, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-adds-new-weapons-and-challenges-in-free-update-this-week" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to Nintendo Life</a>, it'll come with a patch that aims to address functionality and fix a few bug issues. This reportedly includes adding map tutorials, previews of areas you can reclaim, and a preview of the amount of health you can recover.</p><p>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment is the second Hyrule Warriors game following 2020's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hyrule-warriors-age-of-calamity/" data-ref-id="5000-518353">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity</a>, and it's a prequel to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/" data-ref-id="5000-497748">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a>. We scored it a 7/10 in our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-review-link-to-the-past/1900-6418434/" data-ref-id="1900-6418434">Age of Imprisonment review</a>, saying that although the story doesn't feel satisfying enough for hardcore Zelda fans, its combat and roster make it "a high point for the spin-off series thus far." It's out now on Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

                <p>A new Nintendo Switch 2 software patch is out, and besides the usual stability improvements, it addresses some small but noteworthy problems.</p><p>Nintendo says that the <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68473/~/system-update-information-for-nintendo-switch%26nbsp%3B2" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">version 21.0.1 update</a> fixes two error codes that occur on a Nintendo Switch 1 when attempting a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-transfer-your-nintendo-account-to-nintendo-switch-2/1100-6532141/" data-ref-id="1100-6532141">system transfer to a Nintendo Switch 2</a> through local communication. The more prevalent note is a fix for when "wireless controllers or Bluetooth audio devices were unable to connect" after waking a Switch 2 up from Sleep mode or turning off Airplane mode.</p><p>While the Bluetooth wireless connectivity problem was not widely reported, several users on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1p5z7d2/nintendo_switch_firmware_update_2101_is_out_now/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit</a> shared that they experienced issues with their Bluetooth headsets and expressed joy over the patch. Switch 2 owners also pointed out that after the 21.0.1 patch, the Switch 1 version of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nier-automata-feels-like-a-platinum-games-classic/1100-6440908/" data-ref-id="1100-6440908">fan-favorite Nier: Automata</a> now functions properly on Switch 2 after having compatibility issues.</p><p>Backward compatibility fixes for Switch 1 games have coincided with Switch 2 firmware upgrades in the past, with the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-and-switch-get-new-system-updates-and-they-add-more-than-just-stability/1100-6536122/" data-ref-id="1100-6536122">hefty 21.0.0 update</a> earlier this month including fixes for Batman: Arkham Knight, Hitman 3 Cloud Version, and Windjammers. There are still a handful of Switch 1 games that remain broken on Switch 2, with Borderlands 3 the most prolific title out of those.</p><p>The new patch doesn't address the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-says-its-not-prohibiting-third-party-switch-2-docks-after-players-report-bricking-issues/1100-6536233/" data-ref-id="1100-6536233">reported problems with third-party dock compatibility</a>, an issue that arose after the version 21.0.0 patch, though manufacturers of these unofficial docks have already begun deploying their own fixes.</p><p>Switch 2 owners should have plenty to play during this upcoming holiday season, with Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment and Kirby Air Riders releasing earlier this month. The highly anticipated Metroid Prime 4: Beyond caps off Nintendo's first-party offerings for this year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>FX is developing an anthology TV series adapting Ubisoft’s Far Cry franchise. The upcoming show will stream on Hulu in the U.S. and Disney+ internationally.</p><p>According to a press release, the series will “retain Far Cry’s signature standalone storytelling format” and each season will take place in a new setting and star a different cast. Far Cry is being helmed by executive producers Noah Hawley, creator of FX’s <em>Fargo</em> and <em>Alien: Earth</em>, and Rob Mac (formerly McElhenney after a legal name change this summer), creator of <em>It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia</em>. Mac, who also co-wrote and stars in the FX docuseries <em>Welcome to Wrexham</em> and Apple TV's <em>Mythic Quest,</em> will join the cast of <em>Far Cry</em> in the starring role.</p><p>“What I love about the Far Cry game franchise is it’s an anthology. Each game is a variation of a theme, the same way each season of <em>Fargo</em> is a variation on a theme,” said Hawley in a press release. “To create a big action show that can change from year to year, while always exploring the nature of humanity through this complex and chaotic lens is a dream come true. I’m excited to partner with Rob and bring our shared irreverent, ambitious sensibility to the screen.”</p><p>"Getting to work alongside Noah Hawley is a dream realized,” said Rob Mac in a press release. “Ubisoft has been remarkably generous, entrusting us with one of the most iconic video-game worlds ever created. And through it all, my FX family continues to lift me up with their constant belief and support."</p>

            <p>Nintendo is gearing up to release some new content for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a>.</p>
<p>Age of Imprisonment is set before the events of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-walkthrough-tips-9343">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a>, and is the latest crossover with Koei Tecmo's Warriors franchise. It is a frenzied affair, but one that I have had a lot of fun thrashing and crashing my way through over these past few weeks.</p>

<p>And, it looks like I will be heading back to the moblin-filled lands of Hyrule again, when Nintendo's free update goes live on 27th November. That's this Thursday.</p>
<p>This forthcoming update will add additional weapons, as well as new Vicious enemies and "more" to the game, <a href="https://x.com/NintendoEurope/status/1993318901262823923">Nintendo wrote on its social media channels</a>. According to the Japanese site, when this update goes live, Zelda and Calamo (a personal favourite of mine) will have their own Sync Strike. This will see the series' princess chase after Calamo's Boomerang. "If you can press [X] at the right time, you will succeed in catching the boomerang and your attack will be powerful," the <a href="https://www.gamecity.ne.jp/zelda-fuuin/jp/update/">machine translated page reads</a>.</p><p>This update will be the first of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/it-only-came-out-this-week-but-already-two-free-updates-are-planned-for-hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">two previously confirmed updates headed for Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a>. Earlier this month, the official Zelda Musou social media account revealed these updates were in the works, and would allow fans to "enjoy Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment for even longer".</p>

<p>Elsewhere in Nintendo news, we got our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/i-think-these-set-photos-are-telling-us-a-lot-more-about-the-legend-of-zelda-movie-than-nintendo-is-letting-on-analysis">first look at official photos from The Legend of Zelda live-action film earlier this month</a>.

            <p>Katsura Hashino, director of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metaphor-refantazio">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a> and the Persona games at Atlus, wants to create "JRPG 3.0" as the next evolutionary step of the genre.</p>
<p>Hashino spoke at Korean gaming conference G-Star 2025 earlier this month, which was reported by <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/714/G071477/20251114074/">4gamer</a> (and translated by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/jrpg/persona-and-metaphor-refantazio-creator-says-he-wants-to-create-jrpg-3-0-fundamentally-changing-the-genres-structure-and-presentation/">Games Radar</a>). He separated JRPGs into three eras: 1.0 being those of the past, 2.0 being those of the present generation, and 3.0 being those of the future.</p>
<p>JRPG 1.0, said Hashino, are the "true classics", and while he didn't name any specific examples, the likes of the original Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest games are likely implied. Then, the genre evolved into 2.0 with "its current style, which feels higher quality due to how much more responsive they are to the player."</p>

</figure>
<p>As for JRPG 3.0, Hashino didn't provide any explicit details, but said he believes "there will be a greater dimension to these games and they'll change the genre's structure and presentation at a fundamental level".</p>
<p>It begs the question: what does this mean for Persona 6?</p>
<p>Atlus has been recently looking more to the past for inspiration. Last year, the studio released <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/persona-3">Persona 3</a>: Reload, a remake of the series' popular third entry, while a remake of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/persona-4">Persona 4</a> is currently in development.</p>
<p>Then there's Metaphor: ReFantazio. Yes, it was the start of a brand new franchise for Atlus, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/atlus-persona-follow-up-metaphor-refantazio-gets-release-date">Hashino described it as a "culmination of our RPGs"</a> marking the 35th anniversary of the company. It fits firmly into Hashino's "JRPG 2.0" definition, with its narrative structure and turn-based combat perfecting what Atlus had achieved with its previous games.</p><p>That's not to say the company hasn't experimented. 2016's Persona 5 proved so popular it spawned multiple spin-offs, namely Persona 5: Strikers and Persona 5: Tactica, both of which had different battle systems. There's also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/persona-5-the-phantom-x">Persona 5: The Phantom X</a>, which brought the series to mobile.</p>
<p>Still, it's unclear how Persona 6 will evolve the series' formula. Very little is known about the game, though it's been officially mentioned by Atlus on a couple of occasions. In a job listing interview in 2021, Atlus director Naoto Hiroaka stated the studio will "have to create a 6 which exceeds 5. However, exceeding 5 will be difficult with the current staff" (thanks <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/persona-6-confirmed-by-atlus-director-in-job-listing/">Games Radar</a>).</p>
<p>More recently, Persona 6 was included in a fan survey on the future of the series back in October, the first time it's been officially mentioned by name (thanks <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/atlus-mentioned-persona-6-1-and-2-remakes/">The Gamer</a>). Let's hope that's a sign news is coming.</p>
<p>And while Persona 3: Reload introduced improved elements taken from Persona 5 (and presumably, the Persona 4 remake will do the same), I'm personally hopeful Persona 6 may go further and step away from formulaic conventions like The Velvet Room and stereotypical characters.</p><p>What's particularly interesting for the genre is the success this year of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, which follows typical genre conventions of Japanese RPGs but was made by a French studio. It's been widely praised for its turn-based combat, which includes action prompts - expanding on elements of Super Mario RPG, Lost Odyssey, and Legend of Dragoon.</p>
<p>Creator Guillaume Broche had intended to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33s-fresh-take-on-rpg-traditions-could-revitalise-the-genre">create a "big realistic" AAA turn-based game</a>, which arguably hadn't been seen since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-the-last-game-that-made-me-cry-clair-obscur-expedition-33-director-on-the-iconic-xbox-360-rpg-lost-odyssey-and-its-unexpected-legacy">Xbox 360 exclusive Lost Odyssey</a>.</p>
<p>"It was very overwhelming," Broche told Eurogamer on the attention the game has received. "I was expecting turn-based fans to stand up and say 'oh this looks cool', but I wasn't expecting this community to be that excited actually. It's like we awakened a sleeping dragon."</p>
<p>At the very least, Expedition 33 has heightened interest in turn-based Japanese RPG-style games. No matter how Atlus evolves the genre with Persona 6, the future of JRPGs is looking bright.</p>

<li><u>Emergency Countermeasure</u>: Cooldown is decreased from 90 to 45 seconds.</li>
</ul>
<p><b><u>Vanguard</u></b></p>
<p>????&nbsp;<i>For too long, Vanguard’s role was to be a vessel for the squad’s healing perks. With these changes, we want to reinforce ranged/melee hybrid playstyle for him. But we are not entirely done with Vanguard changes. We would like to take a closer look at his ability.</i></p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>Old:&nbsp;<i>“After killing 10 enemies within 5 seconds, Diving Kick’s Damage increases by 40% for 15 seconds.”</i></p>

<p>????&nbsp;<i><b>Change from PTS:</b>&nbsp;Fix interaction between Shock Wave perk and Tenacity caused by double damage scaling.</i></p>

<li><b>Extreme Challenge:&nbsp;</b>Increased Extremis enemies spawn cooldown.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Gameplay QoL</h3>
<ul>
<li>Increased netcode damage cap.</li>
</ul>
<p>????<i>&nbsp;This change is going to open a huge can of worms for gameplay balancing, but it has to be done. The game damage numbers should not be restricted by net code and should be accurate all of the time. We will be monitoring which builds and perks combinations will become problematic. It’s pretty clear that some damage buffs combinations from multiple sources are already insane (looking at you Blocking Power Fist). For now, have fun.</i></p>
<ul>
<li>Sniper damage buff from Cloak Ability lasts a little bit longer to fully affect entire burst and full auto weapons.</li>
<li>Improved sound indication for unparriable attacks.</li>

<li>Fixed: Sniper ability stops recharging and working completely until the end of the match after getting hit during its activation in rare cases.</li>
<li>Fixed: Player can’t use gun strike on Lictor after perfect dodge in some rare cases.</li>

<li>Fixed: Combat Knife – “Combined Onslaught” and “Heavy Onslaught” perks do not apply to dash attacks.</li>

These appear as both Battle Challenges and Hyrule Challenges. Beating these will be how you unlock two new weapons, the Greatsword of Light and the Spear of the Upper Guard. There’s also some new attacks for you to learn to clear that screen of enemies.</p>


<p>Beyond that, update 1.0.2 does also bring a bunch of bug fixes and improvements.</p>
<p>Here’s the full (web browser translated and touched up) patch notes for Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment Update 1.0.2:</p>
<h2>Add new challenges and rewards</h2>
<div>
<h3>Adding a new challenge</h3>
<p>Multiple <strong>“Battle Challenges” </strong>and <strong>“Hyrule Challenges” </strong>will be added as elements after clearing the main story.<br>
New “dangerous species” such as Bokoblin and Sludgelikes have appeared. ” “Scra Attack” such as “Boko Slash”, which is activated using materials obtained from “Bokoblin (Dangerous Species)”, has been significantly improved compared to previous materials.</p>

</div>
<div>
<h3>New weapons added</h3>
<p>The “Greatsword of Light”, a special great sword blessed by Raura with the protection of the power of light, and the “Spear of the Upper Guard”, a spear given to the elite directly under King of Hyrule, will be added. These new weapons can be equipped with mysterious golems and warriors of various races.</p>
<p><em>You can get it by clearing the battles added in this update.</em></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>New dedicated sync strike</h3>
<p>A dedicated sync strike will be added to Zelda and Karamo. Zelda chases the boomerang thrown by Karamo with the power of time. If you can press [X] at the right time, you will succeed in catching the boomerang and the attack will become powerful.</p>
<p><em>You can learn it by clearing the Hyrule Challenge added in this update.</em></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Fighting with Block Golems</h3>
<p>It will be possible to activate the sync strike with the block golem. Its powerful rotating attack kicks Zako and cuts the week point gauge of the strong enemy.</p>
<p><em>In addition to the battles added in this update, it can also be activated in existing battles where Block Golems appear.</em></p>
</div>
<ul>
<li>In addition to the above, the following will be added as new battles.
<ul>
<li>“Battle with the serious Raura”</li>
<li>“Battle to get a lot of Pou”</li>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Game Improvements</h2>

<ul>
<li>Changed the special actions of the mysterious golem so that they can be saved for each weapon type</li>
<li>Added a warning sound before the end of the effect of the unique skills “Limit Break” and “Inexhaustible Battery”</li>
</ul>
<h3>Battle</h3>
<ul>
<li>Changed to be able to select characters and weapons in “training room”</li>
<li>Changed to display a preview of the recovery amount when selecting “Special Carry-on Food” and “Spare Battery”</li>
</ul>
<h3>Departure preparation screen</h3>
<ul>
<li>From the “Friends” screen of preparation for departure, change to fly to “Tweet Challenge” with the [Y] button</li>
</ul>
<h3>Hyrule Map</h3>
<ul>
<li>Add the tutorials displayed on the Hyrule map to the list</li>
<li>Visualize the area division on the ground on the Hyrule Map</li>
<li>Changed to display a preview of the area that can be recovered when the cursor is adjusted to the liberation battle</li>
</ul>
<h3>Hyrule Challenge</h3>
<ul>
<li>On the list of Hyrule Challenges, the items that can be cleared have been changed to yellow.</li>
<li>Adjust the display of the clear status of the Hyrule Challenge</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bug fixes</h2>
<p>Several problems have been fixed, including the following.</p>
<ul>
<li>The unique skill “Golem Launch” is not affected by some special effects and enhancements.</li>
<li>The tweeting challenge “Defeat 〇〇 enemies with Zonaugear” is not counted even if the conditions are met by strong attacks and air battles in Zonaugear.</li>
<li>Even if the secret function “Autoguard with a certain probability and the enemy is electrocuted/freeze/flaming” is activated by Deggama’s attack, and even if the enemy is automatically guarded, it will not be in the state of attributes assumed by the enemy.</li>
<li>If you “Switch Characters” from the pose menu, the enhanced state may be released.</li>
<li>When you select “Retry” after a specific operation, the BGM may not sound after that.</li>
<li>Inability to proceed in Ososowaku communication occurs</li>
<li>When a communication disconnect occurs in Share communication, the attack will not hit a specific enemy.</li>
<li>When playing the screen split 2P, if you select “Retry” after a specific operation, you may return to “Hyrule Map”</li>
<li>In the screen split 2P play, when Matsuba and sync strike are activated, the camera rotation operation is reversed.</li>
<li>Some screen display problems</li>
</ul>
<p>We rather enjoyed Age of Imprisonment, as the latest in the Hyrule Warriors spin-off series, and as a canonical prequel to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/05/11/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review/">Tears of the Kingdom</a>. Dom said, “This is a playful and enjoyable piece of Legend of Zelda lore, and one that will be essential for fans of the series, but it doesn’t break the same ground as Breath of the Wild, Tears of the Kingdom, or even Age of Calamity.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p><span>Here’s a reminder to turn your television down and not yell so much when playing games online. Over this past weekend, police in Northern California received reports of possible gunshots and arrived on the scene to discover, thankfully, that it was just someone playing games too loudly with their window open.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span><a href="https://www.actionnewsnow.com/news/chico-police-respond-to-loud-video-game-mistaken-for-gunshots/article_456898e1-4925-41f0-a71e-fee8a012852a.html">As reported by <em>Action News Now</em></a>, police in Chico, California, received a call from a local resident who claimed to have heard “threatening words” as well as “pop sounds” that sounded an awful lot like gunshots. <em>ANN</em> says a heavy police presence arrived at the scene around 5:30 p.m. on Saturday to investigate.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Police discovered that the situation wasn’t dangerous at all, just annoying. Apparently, a gamer in Chico was playing a video game at a very loud volume with their window open. No other details were shared about the incident.&nbsp;</span></p>  <p><span>Neither the report nor the police confirmed which game it was, but I’d assume a recently released FPS like <a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review-campaign-is-it-good-zombies-multiplayer-2000645198"><em>Black Ops 7 </em></a>or <em>Battlefield 6.</em> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ActionNewsNow/posts/police-confirmed-that-reported-gunshot-sounds-in-chico-on-saturday-night-were-ac/1258647912960506/">Over on the news network’s Facebook page</a>, commenters are also curious if it was <em>BF6 or CoD.&nbsp;</em></span></p> <p><span>It’s a silly story with a not-horrible ending, which isn’t always the case <a href="https://kotaku.com/swatting-the-hip-new-griefing-trend-sends-the-cops-5838927">when gamers and police get involved.</a> We’ve seen far too many cases of <a href="https://kotaku.com/fatal-call-of-duty-swatter-pleads-guilty-to-51-charges-1830434368">SWAT teams being called on random gamers and Twitch streamers</a> by assholes. </span><span>Thankfully, it seems that if a SWAT-like team was called, it didn’t escalate into something more serious. </span></p> </div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/guy-played-video-games-so-loud-the-cops-showed-up-2000647237]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Call of Duty’s Skill-Based Matchmaking model (SBMM) has long been the source of <strong>much debate </strong>and contention in the wider industry. It’s believed that these days, Activision’s studios want to punish you for being good at your game while trying to shoehorn players into matches with those closest to their current performance metrics, which makes things ‘sweatier’ for almost everyone on a streak.</p>



<p>It’s why people feel that a single good game in Call of Duty leads to you being ‘punished’ by SBMM. In a recent video, Charlie Olson, one of the original creators of the Call of Duty SBMM algorithms as we know them, took a dive into these very topics and debunked some of the SBMM-related conspiracy theories circulating Black Ops 7.</p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-7-sbmm-is-all-over-the-place">Black Ops 7 SBMM is All Over The Place</h2>



<p>In a new video shared by Charlie Olson of Invokation, the ‘Dark Art of SBMM’ was explored. Olson is credited with creating the current (or close to) <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-sbmm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SBMM model for Call of Duty</a> during a ten-year stint at Raven Software. He left a few years back to focus on his own company, but has remained in the realms of SBMM, MMR, and multiplayer gaming.</p>



<p>In the 40-minute video, Olson runs through the technical know-how behind MMR and SBMM, explaining why the systems are viewed both positively and negatively by the wider gaming community, even <strong>beyond </strong>Call of Duty.</p>



<p>Here’s the full walkthrough:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="The Dark Art of SBMM" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NpCmr8a9uuE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>Towards the end of his run-through of all things matchmaking, Charlie Olson addressed some of the ‘conspiracy theories’ that have surfaced in Call of Duty since Black Ops 7 was released midway through November.</p>



<p>On October 9, Treyarch posted on social media that ‘open matchmaking’ was confirmed to be coming to Black Ops 7, prompting many to fear that the game would be a casual crapfest. This is what Olson addressed first:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Some players are leaving because they thought this tweet meant SBMM had been completely removed from the game, and then they felt betrayed by the inclusion of one standard matchmaking playlist, and then blamed it for stealing ‘fodder’ from the open playlist.</p>



<p>What’s really going on here is there aren’t enough casual players at launch to make open matchmaking the pubstomp that was expected or promise. If open lobbies are sweaty, it’s because it’s mostly sweats playing.</p>



<p>Open matchmaking really does have minimal skill consideration and you can be sure that standard matchmaking isn’t pulling too many players yet, because most casual players just want the one or two modes they’re most comfortable with.</p>



<p>If you’re looking for noobs to stomp, my advice would be to try the open TDM playlist, that’s probably the best place to look.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He then jumped into the outright conspiracy theories surrounding SBMM in Black Ops 7. This core conspiracy theory suggests that Activision’s studios <strong>LIED </strong>about removing SBMM in open matchmaking.</p>



<p>Olson suggested that the evidence people are using to back up this theory is to be expected:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>This usually comes with three pieces of ‘evidence’. One, open lobbies are sweaty. Two, wait times are longer than in the beta. Three, connections are worse than in the beta.</p>



<p>But those are <strong>just trade-offs from bringing back persistent lobbies</strong> for launch, assuming they don’t want low-pop playlists to starve.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Olson wrapped with predictions, suggesting that Black Ops 7 will ‘get sweatier’ and that the player count will mirror XDefiant’s performance before the game bombed out.</p>

<p>GTA 5 can be nominated for the GOTY category in the Steam Awards 2025, thanks to the Enhanced Edition releasing this year. </p>



<p>Rockstar’s Grand Theft Auto 5 has been one of the most relevant titles in gaming for over a decade. The first iteration of the title was released for the PS3 and Xbox 360, with newer versions released with each successive generation of consoles and PCs. Now, the latest version of the game is up for the Game of the Year award on Steam. </p>







<h2 id="h-you-can-nominate-gta-5-for-goty-for-steam-awards-2025">You Can Nominate GTA 5 for GOTY for Steam Awards 2025</h2>



<p>The nomination window for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamawards/nominations/2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Steam Awards</a> is now open and will be live until December 1, 2025, 10:00 AM Pacific. During this time, players will be able to nominate games across 11 categories, including Game of the Year, VR Game of the Year, Labor of Love, Best Game on Steam Deck, Better With Friends, Outstanding Visual Style, Most Innovative Gameplay Award, Best Game You Suck At,  Best Soundtrack Award, Outstanding Story-Rich Game, and Sit Back and Relax. Winners will be announced on January 3, 2026, at 10:00 AM Pacific. </p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://gameranx.com/updates/id/557864/article/apparently-grand-theft-auto-v-is-eligible-for-steams-goty-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gameranx</a>, players have the option to nominate GTA 5 for GOTY in the first category. For those who don’t know, Steam Awards work differently from other award shows. Instead of a panel of judges deciding the nominations, Steam Awards selects nominees solely through player votes. Which means, theoretically, if players vote to nominate GTA 5 for GOTY and it receives the most votes again once the nomination period is over, it can win GOTY. The only reason it is eligible for this award is that GTA 5 Enhanced Edition was released on Steam on March 4, 2025.  </p>

Being typically coy there, Nintendo!

<p>Well, head over to <a href="https://www.gamecity.ne.jp/zelda-fuuin/jp/update/">the Japanese website</a> and you'll see exactly what else we'll be getting — along with some extra challenges, new enemies, and more powerful materials, you'll also be able to team up with the Block Golem for <em>another</em> new Sync Strike.</p>
<p>A handful of new battles are also getting added on Thursday, including one which is apparently titled "A serious battle with Rauru". <em>Hmmm</em>.</p>

<p>There are also some <a href="https://www.gamecity.ne.jp/zelda-fuuin/jp/update/">additional patch notes</a>, which aim to fix functionality and a few bug fixes. We'll post the official translation when they're out there, but a couple of tweaks include adding tutorials that appear on the map are added to the list, previews of areas you can reclaim will show up, and a preview of the amount of health you can recover is now shown.</p>
<p>The previous Hyrule Warriors game also got a handful of updates <em>and</em> an Expansion Pass which brought with it an "expanded roster". So don't expect anything of that scale here.</p>
<p>Nintendo promised that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-already-has-free-updates-planned">it had free updates planned</a> for the game after launch. And free stuff, whatever it is, we'll take. Especially as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">we really enjoyed</a> this canon prequel to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Tears of the Kingdom</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Demonschool Credits Try "Something Different", List Full Staff Duties]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/demonschool-credits-something-different</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/demonschool-credits-try-something-different-list-full-staff-duties.1364143/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Demonschool&nbsp;</em>developer Necrosoft says that it tried "something different" for the credits sequence in the game, opting to list the full duties carried out by staff rather than a brief description of each person's role.</p>

<p>Over on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/brandon.insertcredit.com/post/3m6fuipkh4k2u" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a>, Necrosoft director Brandon Sheffield says the team used a format of "name, title, lengthy description of what they did" for each staff member's credit on&nbsp;<em>Demonschool</em>.</p>

<p>This means that, rather than simply reading "art lead", a credit might outline that a staff member "did most of the 3D modeling and rigging as well as creating most backgrounds", or that they "created most avatars and poses, all overlays and menu art, [and] the game logo".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/necrosoft-demonschool-credits.jpg?itok=cqBDsfge 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/necrosoft-demonschool-credits.jpg?itok=WQKF_MDr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Demonschool</em>'s credits are serious about giving staff members their due.</figcaption></figure><p>Sheffield says he wants to make sure that those who choose to watch&nbsp;<em>Demonschool</em>'s credits (which, he acknowledges, won't be everybody) will "come to understand how each person participated", and that doing things this way might help staff members to elucidate their roles during job interviews in future.</p>

<p>He also says that, in addition to&nbsp;<em>Demonschool</em>'s core team, Necrosoft credited "everyone who ever touched the game in any way". Sheffield acknowledges this means the credits for&nbsp;<em>Demonschool&nbsp;</em>are long for a small team, but to that, he says "why be stingy?".</p>

<p>It's refreshing to see an indie team being so upfront about its credits, especially in an era where specific studios and staff members often <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gaming-business-roundup-july-12th" rel="nofollow">aren't credited</a> in major <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/original-metroid-prime-developers-omitted-from-remastered-credits" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">releases</a> on which they worked. Whether or not this style gets adopted across the world of indie gaming remains to be seen, but I sure hope it does.</p>

<p>As for&nbsp;<em>Demonschool</em>, if you're unfamiliar with it, the game is a tactical RPG that combines the minutiae of school life with a strategic puzzle-style combat system in which you must battle demons between your own world and theirs.</p>




<p>The game was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/demonschool-persona-inspired-tactics-rpg-announced" rel="nofollow">revealed back in 2022</a>, but was subsequently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/demonschool-release-date-september-2025" rel="nofollow">delayed numerous times</a>, most recently due to Necrosoft wanting to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hollow-knight-silksong-indie-delays" rel="nofollow">avoid a clash</a> with then-hotly-anticipated Metroidvania&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>.</p>

<p>Happily, however,&nbsp;<em>Demonschool&nbsp;</em>is finally out, and you can take a look at it right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1900250/Demonschool/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10007754" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/demonschool/9p7d4xfj2xwf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/demonschool-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.</p>
