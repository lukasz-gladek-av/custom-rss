<p>It has been announced by 343 Industries that Halo Infinite is getting a third-person mode in November. Dubbed a ‘new way to play’, the third-person mode in Halo Infinite has been branded nothing more than ‘Fortnite-ification’ by some users, and at first glimpse, the gameplay shown from that perspective certainly is reminiscent of the popular battle royale.</p>



<p>It’s not a groundbreaking update, but it’s <strong>something </strong>that should bring people back to Halo Infinite, even if they’ll only hang around for a game or two to test out the new third-person perspective.</p>

<h2 id="h-halo-infinite-isn-t-forever">Halo Infinite Isn’t Forever</h2>



<p>Halo Infinite has struggled with maintaining an active player base more or less since it was released in December 2021. It has ebbed and flowed, but over time, the player count has dropped at a steady pace. Once upon a time, it was because updates weren’t coming fast enough, and now it tends to be that updates applied to the game just aren’t meaningful enough.</p>



<p>As the Halo World Championship unravels in Seattle, 343 Industries has revealed the next evolution of Halo Infinite with a fresh third-person mode.</p>



<p>It was unveiled on social media along with a work-in-progress gameplay clip:</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>It doesn’t look terrible, but I’m bad enough at Halo Infinite when I play from a first-person perspective, so third-person might just bamboozle me more than ever. Unfortunately, the community is mostly against this update, with many suggesting it’s a waste of time and resources at 343 Industries to be pushing content like this instead of anything a bit meatier.</p>



<p>What do you think? Are you going to give third-person mode a try in Halo Infinite? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

And they've gradually been discovering a pretty cool secret about its map: it "links" up almost perfectly with the map from <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-a-link-to-the-past">A Link to the Past</a>.</p><p>More and more players have been sharing posts on social media comparing the maps of Echoes of Wisdom and A Link to the Past, and have figured out that Echoes of Wisdom basically uses the same map from A Link to the Past... <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/echoesofwisdom/comments/1fqmyqu/the_eow_map_is_basically_a_very_expanded_alttp_map/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">just expanded</a>. A number of major landmarks can still be found in the same spots as in Link to the Past, though they've changed or aged seemingly with the passage of time. </p><p>What's more, most of Echoes of Wisdom's brand new locations exist outside the boundaries where Link to the Past's map stopped, implying that civilizations like the Goron and Gerudo could have always existed in Link to the Past, they just weren't accessible in that particular game.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">It’s truly amazing how Grezzo made the Echoes of Wisdom map with such care. It lines up with A Link to the Past’s Hyrule in a way that maybe the Gorons, Gerudo, Zora, and Dekus DID live there, just outside where we could explore. And it explains why they don’t know Zelda/Hyrule. <a href="https://t.co/MANVHl5S97" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/MANVHl5S97</a></p>— Rebecca Stone (Taylor’s Version) (@forestminish) <a href="https://twitter.com/forestminish/status/1842239724464849034?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 4, 2024</a></blockquote> <p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-review">We chatted with our own reviewer, Tom Marks</a>, about this phenomenon, who agreed with the parallels. He pointed out to us that landmarks especially around Hyrule Castle will be familiar to Zelda veterans. The graveyard and church are in the right spots, and the hill where Link's house was in Link to the Past is still there too, even though the Echoes of Wisdom Link lives in Suthorn Village.</p><p>There are other comparison points fans are finding. Eastern Palace, for instance, is still present in the same spot and even includes a sidequest. Where Kakariko Village used to be, Echoes of Wisdom has ruins, implying it was moved at some point. There are also Desert Palace ruins, Swamp Ruins is in the right place, and so much more. </p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">There’s A Link to the Past DNA scattered throughout the overworld in Echoes of Wisdom and it makes me feel warm inside. Let’s take a quick tour, starting with the destroyed ruins of the Desert Palace. <a href="https://t.co/CCP1eifuRF" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/CCP1eifuRF</a></p>— Metroid Mike 64 (@MetroidMike64) <a href="https://twitter.com/MetroidMike64/status/1842032665052021200?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 4, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Echoes of Wisdom is far from the first Zelda game that's involved clever, if subtle, map tricks. A Link to the Past itself famously included both a Light and Dark variation on the same world. And when Tears of the Kingdom came out, we wrote about how its <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tears-of-the-kingdoms-depths-hides-one-of-the-biggest-zelda-secrets-ever">Depths was essentially an underground mirror of the surface</a>.</p><p>What's most curious for Zelda lore buffs will be whether or not this answers meaningful questions about Echoes of Wisdom's place on the Zelda timeline. Could this in fact put Echoes of Wisdom in the timeline post-Link to the Past and Link Between Worlds? Or is this some alternate universe situation? We'll need Zelda scholars to sort this one out.</p><p>As you look for these parallels in your own playthrough, check out our <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom">wiki guides</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-interactive-map">our own interactive map</a> whether you're exploring the similarities yourself, or just looking for more heart containers.</p><p><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

<p>The old-school <em>Diablo</em> games endure for a lot of reasons. Some players like the deep lore and world-building. Some like partnering with friends and working through dungeons as a team. Some like hunting for incredibly rare loot and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/02/diablo-ii-streamer-finds-1-in-3-million-item-drop-instantly-sells-it-for-laughs/">maybe selling it on a livestream</a>.</p>
<p>Sometimes, though, you dive into high-level <em>Diablo</em> just for a chance to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsNx0DGrSW8">kill a screen full of monsters really quickly</a>.</p>
<p>If that kind of high-density enemy killing is what you're looking for, <em>Halls of Torment</em>'s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdQweTEsOUE">recent Version 1.0 release</a> is a near-perfect take on the concept. Despite the decidedly old-school presentation, the game takes very modern inspiration from <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/10/vampire-survivors-a-cheap-minimalistic-indie-game-is-my-game-of-the-year/"><em>Vampire Survivors</em></a> and its quick-hit bursts of leveling up through overwhelming enemy hordes. In doing so, it has become my absolute favorite way to wipe out enemies at rates approaching and exceeding 50,000/hour, at some points.</p>
<h2><em>Survivors</em> of the fittest</h2>
<p>If you've played <em>Vampire Survivors</em> you'll be intimately familiar with the basic gameplay loop in <em>Halls of Torment</em>. You start as <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=smol%20bean">just a smol bean</a> with a weak weapon and slowly pick at a trickle of grunts that march toward you from the edges of the screen. Each defeated enemy drops gems that contribute to a leveling system for better stats and more efficient killing, which is crucial because the enemy hordes quickly increase in both density and relentlessness.</p>
<p>Eventually, the grunts get joined by bosses that absorb more attacks and lob tougher-to-dodge projectiles. Taking these down lets you customize your builds with new attack options ranging from auras of protection to semi-autonomous ghostly fighters to giant mace balls that swing in huge circles.</p>


<p>By the end of each timed, 30-minute dungeon-crawling session, the screen is utterly filled with all sorts of fantasy trope beasts, rushing your position and (hopefully) falling to the epilepsy-inducing flurry of powerful abilities you've built up over time. They also make some god-awful&nbsp;racket as they pass—the din of overlapping skeleton bone-rattles has been haunting my dreams after <em>Halls of Torment</em> sessions.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>Your first <em>Halls of Torment</em> run starts with a basic warrior, but new classes quickly unlock, each with their own distinct weapons and gameplay rhythms. My favorite ended up being the exterminator class, which uses a flamethrower to simply turn everything around him into a wall of flame. If that's not your speed, you can choose from defensive shieldbearers with extremely slow attacks, melee axe-wielders that swing quickly with wild abandon, ranged archers that can deal damage from afar, magic-users that make heavy use of area-of-effect spells, a class with a semi-autonomous dog that goes after nearby enemies, and more.</p>
<h2><em>Diablo</em>, but also not <em>Diablo</em></h2>
<p>Just from glancing at <em>Halls of Torment</em> screenshots, it's easy to glean the heavy visual influence the game owes to the grainy, isometric sprites of old-school <em>Diablo</em>. That throwback, nostalgic appeal extends to little touches like the menu system and low-fi voiceovers for NPCs as well, which comes across as a deliberate if cheesy design choice.</p>
<p>The game's old-school sprites also make it easier for your graphics card to handle literally hundreds of moving objects and flashy attack effects on screen at once, too. Despite this, my relatively high-end system started struggling to maintain a consistent frame rate by the end of the more difficult dungeons.</p>


<p>The visual frenzy of all these old-school sprites can get a bit overwhelming, especially when some of your own summon attacks end up difficult to distinguish at a glance from enemy threats. Overall, though, the use of distinct colors makes it easy enough to quickly evaluate a screen full of information and extrapolate what it will look like over the coming seconds. I especially appreciated the big, purple lines and circles that telegraph where projectile attacks are going to appear just moments before they do.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>Looks aside, the sheer density of enemies means <em>Halls of Torment</em> sometimes feels less like <em>Diablo</em> and more like playing an old-school bullet-hell shooter. It becomes a game of exploiting small gaps in the enemy lines to stay safe, carefully managing your relative position to manage the movements of the (relatively dumb) enemy groups. There's a subtle push and pull inherent in staying close enough to do maximum damage (and collect the crucial gem drops) while keeping enough distance so the hordes collapse your exit route and quickly overwhelm you.</p>
<p>Unlike <em>Vampire Survivors</em>, which automatically focuses most attacks on the nearest enemy, <em>Halls of Torment</em> offers you the ability to actually aim your attacks with either the right analog stick or the mouse. That might sound like a small difference, but it makes a large impact when you're trying to carve your way through a seemingly impassable wall of enemies or trying to protect a flank that's threatening to close up as you run in the opposite direction. You can also toggle auto-aim and fire options, though, if you're looking for a one-handed play option.</p>
<p><em>Halls of Torment</em> also leans heavily on an inherent character regeneration stat, which lets most characters recover health over time, sometimes rather quickly. This makes the game rather forgiving of small mistakes—if you need to squeeze past a grunt, the damage they do can be fully erased with a minute or so of careful play.</p>

<h2>Number goes up</h2>


<p>My biggest complaint with <em>Halls of Torment</em> so far is the overwhelmingly similar feeling of all six of the game's main dungeon areas—they mostly stick to tired tropes like "the fire pit" and "the frozen tundra." Cosmetics aside, most of the areas feel like the same big, open space with occasional walls or other barriers to get in your way. The one exception is a long bridge with two dueling armies that encroach from either side, which mixed things up just enough to be interesting.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
        
        
        
        <div>
          
          
<p>My first few runs through these areas didn't feel all that challenging, maybe because of my dozens of hours of experience with <em>Vampire Survivors</em>. After unlocking the basics, though, the endgame opens up with an "Agony" mode that scales up the difficulty as you level up and lets you activate enemy-enhancing artifacts for even more challenge. The extra difficulty here tends to ride that thin line between "impossible" and "boring" well and provides a good excuse to keep purchasing new, permanent stat upgrades and equipment in between runs.</p>
<figure><p><iframe allow="fullscreen" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JdQweTEsOUE?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent"></iframe></p></figure>
<p>Completionists will also be enamored with <em>Halls of Torment</em>'s ridiculous stack of 500 (Five. Hundred.) different tracked achievements. Most of these simply require hitting certain inexorable numbers—killing X enemies, doing Y amount of damage with Z effect—but a few ask you to focus on a particular class and/or leveling structure, giving you some meta-goal to focus on in a particular run. Completing more achievements also increases your leveling rate for future runs, leading to a satisfying "number gets bigger" loop from run to run.</p>
<p>And getting those big numbers—both in terms of damage and kill count—is a large part of the point. Sometimes you only have a half hour of gaming to spare and need to let off some steam by killing tens of thousands of on-screen beasts with as little complex thought as possible. These moments are what <em>Halls of Torment</em> was made for.</p>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sea-of-thieves-review">Sea of Thieves</a>' 14th season is almost upon us; Rare has confirmed it'll be bringing a whole bunch of new stealthy treats to its multiplayer pirate adventure on 17th October.
</p>
<p>
When last we heard hints of Season 14, it was all the way back in March, when Rare <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sea-of-thieves-bumper-2024-bringing-windy-horns-grapple-guns-a-roaming-warship-and-loads-more">laid out its content plans for 2024</a>. And while today's release date announcement was a little light on specifics - a proper season breakdown video is scheduled to arrive soon - we do at least have some idea of what it'll bring thanks to that early showing.
</p>
<p>
As per March's roadmap, Season 14 is all about introducing a stealthier, more mischievous style of play to Sea of Thieves, with new additions - assuming plans haven't dramatically changed - set to include a crouch ability, plus the power to hang off the side of ships, even stuff yourself into a chest and scuttle around undetected. 
</p>

<p>
That's on top of a new multi-purpose blow dart that's able to lure skeletons to specific positions, trigger bamboozling sound effects, and more, as well as the ability to place spring traps in the world. Most excitingly of all, though, pirates will be able to whizz about the place (or reel stuff in) using the new grappling gun tool.
</p><p>
The grappling gun is the one of the few parts of Season 14 that <em>did</em> get a proper mention during <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhWZt2oQrvU">Rare's latest news showcase</a>, with production director Drew Stevens outlining some of the limitations Rare has put in place to make it fairer for smaller crews. 
</p>
<p>
Essentially, pirates won't be able to use the grappling gun to bypass sideladders and gain easy entry to the sloop or brigantine - that is, grapple directly onboard from the sea or grapple onboard from above - but it <em>can</em> still be used to reach sideladders and to reposition alongside ships during a chase. These limitations don't, however, apply to the galleon, with grappling guns now giving those larger crews new vulnerability points.
</p>
<p>
An additional combat-related tweak PvP crews will need to keep in mind is that, as of Season 14, a ship's armoury can only be used by its own crew. That means invading crews will need to plan tactically before heading into combat.
</p>
<p>
And finally for the Season 14 tidbits Rare is currently willing to share, Outposts are getting new items for pirates to spend their hard-earned gold on: wrap-style shirts, the casino-themed Lucky Hand ship set and weapons, plus the Rusted Skulls clothing, makeup, accessories, and tattoos.
</p><p>
Ahead of Season 14's PlayStation 5, Xbox, and PC arrival on 17th October, Sea of Thieves will host another Gilded Voyages event, running from 10th to 17th October, giving players the opportunity to score "boatloads" of valuable loot on behalf of the Gold Hoarders, Merchant Alliance, Order of Souls, and Athena's Fortune. Additionally, a weekend of Sea of Thieves <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a> Drops is scheduled from 17th-21st October, with the Season Sailor Pistols, plus Sage Sea Dog Shovel and Drum, all up for grabs.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dandadan-is-the-best-anime-about-getting-your-penis-stolen-by-a-ghost.1001316/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/dandadan-anime-science-saru-netflix<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Have you ever been watching <em>X-Files</em> and thought, wow, I love this, but it would be even better if it was an anime set in high school, and also if all the aliens were obsessed with stealing Mulder’s cock and balls? <em>DanDaDan</em> is here to answer your prayers.</p><p>The anime, which premiered on Netflix, Hulu and Crunchyroll this week, is a perfect blend of slapstick action comedy and sweet high school romance. The series revolves around characters Momo Ayase, a no-nonsense teenage girl who believes in spirits, and Ken Takakura, a nerdy loner who is obsessed with UFOs. After meeting in high school and wanting to prove the other wrong about the existence of their hyperfixation, they instead learn that they’re <em>both</em> right: aliens and spirits are real. And for some reason, they’re obsessed with Ken Takakura’s dick.</p><p>The manga, which is illustrated and written by Yokinobu Tatsu and currently running in Shonen Jump, shows just how twisty and turny this zany concept can get. As Momo and Ken inevitably start to fall for each other, they also meet alien sumo wrestlers, ancient snake spirits, and a hair metal band that performs exorcisms. I was lucky enough to catch the first three episodes of the anime adaptation when it premiered in theaters last month, and it translates the mile-a-minute genre changes perfectly. If you’ve seen other anime produced by Science Saru, like <em>Keep Your Hands Off Eizouken!</em>, this shouldn’t come as a huge surprise. They have a knack for mixing down to earth human moments with fluid and inventive animation. I especially love the opening theme, which I think captures both the lighthearted and action-oriented parts of the series.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="DAN DA DAN - Opening | Otonoke by Creepy Nuts" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a4na2opArGY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Right now the series is releasing weekly, so I have a bit of a head start. If the entire show is as good as those first three episodes, then <em>DanDaDan</em> is going to be a lot of people’s new favorite show. And don’t worry, Takakura will get his penis back—eventually.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mouthwashing-is-silent-hill-2-for-dead-end-jobs.1001313/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/mouthwashing-silent-hill-2-remake-indie-game<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Is it worth sticking with a bad job if you’re good at it? What if you aren’t? What does taking responsibility mean in a lawless place? <em>Mouthwashing </em>is an abrasive psychological horror game about jobs, leadership, responsibility, mental illness, and what happens when those things careen into each other with violence. It is often disgusting, occasionally touching, and one of the tightest narratives I have played all year.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Spoiler alert: </strong><strong><em>Mouthwashing </em></strong><strong>is about 3 hours long, most of which is narrative. This article discusses elements of the plot, some of which might be more impactful as a surprise.&nbsp; If you wanna go in blind, you have been warned.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2475490/Mouthwashing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Mouthwashing</em></a><em> </em>is a first person horror game by Swedish developer Wrong Organ. Four months have passed since the space freighter Tulpar was driven into a head-on collision with an asteroid. In the process the captain, Curly, was left with severe burns. The crew has four months of food left on the ship. Resentment and mental illness that were already present are starting to get worse. The situation is made worse by two revelations: that after this job the entire crew is going to be laid off by their employer Pony Express (implicitly in favor of automation), and that the entire reason for the voyage that stranded them was a cargo hold full of Dragonbreath X brand mouthwash.</p><figure><figcaption>Glitching, data-moshing transitions are shockingly original. Credit: Wrong Organ</figcaption></figure><p>The structure of <em>Mouthwashing </em>is nonlinear, jumping back and forth between the perspectives of Captain Curly and his co-pilot Jimmy before and after the crash. These jumps take the form of sudden data moshing transitions and complex interactive dream sequences that serve as metaphors for the plot and collapsing mental state of the crew. Before the crash, we see the web of relationships that led to the ship being driven off course – Curly knows he is a good captain who can do better than this job but sticks with it because it is safe. Jimmy, his long time friend, slightly envies him for that.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>The captain must be fed his painkillers. Credit: Wrong Organ</figcaption></figure><p>After the crash, Jimmy takes over for Curly’s duties as the de-facto leader. Curly was heavily burned in the cockpit when the ship crashed. He is now unable to speak and heavily bandaged; only force-feeding him a slowly dwindling supply of painkillers will silence his cries. Other members of the crew are not taking it well either: The discovery of a mountain of mouthwash and impending mass layoffs prompts Swansea, an older man with a family and not much work left in him to break a 15 year sober streak and bully Daisuke, the gullible intern, into a dangerous and toxic drinking binge. Anya, the ship’s nurse, buckles under feelings of inadequacy and other severe health and interpersonal issues. Jimmy, now in the role of captain, convinces himself he can fix a situation that may not be fixable.</p><figure><figcaption>Happy (single work-allotted) birthday. Credit: Wrong Organ</figcaption></figure><p>There are brief moments of hope in that despair, fleeting glances of interpersonal joy between the crew members. Swansea as a cantankerous grease monkey and Daisuke as the green intern have good chemistry early on. Jimmy and Curly clearly have built up a legitimate, albeit strained, friendship over the years. The Tulpar is filled with the bare minimum amenities for the mental health of the crew, which they still manage to enjoy. Pony Express has rationed a single birthday party for the crew which is joyous before it isn’t. In one flashback prior to the crash, Anya and Captain Curly stare at the wraparound OLED that imitates the night sky in the lounge, and she points to a dead pixel on the screen that she cannot unsee. “I have to believe that our worst moments don’t make us monsters,”&nbsp; Anya repeats often. The game allots you tiny rations of joy, so much to make starving to death feel worse.</p><figure><figcaption>The crew discusses matters in the foamed-up cockpit. Credit: Wrong Organ</figcaption></figure><p><em>Mouthwashing </em>is of a piece with a lot of art I enjoy. It shares a currently in-vogue chunky PS1 style like the recent <a href="https://aftermath.site/arctic-eggs-cooking-eggs-retro-egg-flipping-simulator-game" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Artic Eggs</em></a><em> </em>and<em> </em><a href="https://aftermath.site/crow-country-review-indie-survival-horror-game-lowfi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Crow Country</em></a>, both of which I enjoyed. It is in the same tonal neighborhood as many of Kojima’s freakier stylistic touches in games like <em>P.T.</em>, <em>Metal Gear Solid 4</em> and <em>Death Stranding</em>. I was also reminded of the 2018 Swedish science fiction movie <em>Aniaria </em>and Claire Denis’ <em>High Life </em>from the same year, both of which deal with the violent and psychological consequences of being marooned in space.</p><figure><figcaption>Images flash on the screen often. Credit: Wrong Organ</figcaption></figure><p>But above all <em>Silent Hill </em>looms heaviest in my mind, appropriately timed given the upcoming remake of <em>Silent Hill 2</em> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloober_Team" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloober Team</a>. <em>Mouthwashing </em>is a game about longtime coworkers and friends pushed to their breaking point, about the things we do to each other and what we think we owe each other. The people here are damned, like James Sunderland and everyone he meets in <em>Silent Hill 2</em>.</p><figure><figcaption>Nightmare sequences become extended visual metaphor. Credit: Wrong Organ</figcaption></figure><p><em>Mouthwashing </em>is meant to leave a queasy feeling in the pit of your stomach, and it succeeds at that. Sometimes it touches its subjects with the subtlety of a sledgehammer – extended torturous sequences of cruelty that may be too abject for some to handle (although even an obvious metaphor rendered maximally can be effective). Other times it deploys itself with shocking nuance and humanity, gorgeous, layered storytelling that stays with you. But even when the experience gets too much to bear, it does so in a way that is narratively taut and stylistically jaw-dropping. You do not linger, and there is little fat in this narrative.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Moments of calm. Credit: Wrong Organ</figcaption></figure><p>In many ways the experience is similar in size and shape to this year’s <a href="https://aftermath.site/silent-hill-the-short-message-pt-konami" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Silent Hill: The Short Message</em></a>. Both games can be finished in one sitting, and technically do have puzzles, but only in a way to provide a slight interactive resistance to the player. But <em>The Short Message</em>, for all its faults, is fundamentally a far more compassionate narrative. There is beauty and hope at the core of <em>The Short Message, </em>particularly near the end. <em>Mouthwashing</em> is pure hell. I am sure that it will leave a foul taste in some people’s mouths, although that is precisely what it sets out to do.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>I don't get paid enough for this! Credit: Wrong Organ</figcaption></figure><p>There are severe depictions, both literal and metaphorical, of interpersonal abuse and self-harm, and while it could be argued that those should be signposted a bit better, I don’t think the game makers have a responsibility to pull their punches when engineering The Void. To quote Claire Dennis at a Q&amp;A for <em>High Life, </em>“<a href="https://www.avclub.com/we-were-afraid-of-the-void-claire-denis-on-working-w-1834092997" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I am not a social worker</a>.” <em>Mouthwashing </em>is a game about ambition, capitalism, and the delusions that people in power create for themselves to justify gaining and exercising that power. What does being a manager do to your soul, particularly when a role in management is often an economic lifeboat? And how many horrors stem from working within a system built on a foundation of exploitation and cruelty?</p><figure><figcaption>Safety first. Credit: Wrong Organ</figcaption></figure><p>There is another recurring character in <em>Mouthwashing </em>outside of the crew, a garish generic pony mascot for the Pony Express company named Polle. His goofy face is plastered all over the ship’s safety posters, and a lifesize statue of him stands in the common area caterwauling to passersby, his eyes locked in a <em>Five Nights At Freddy’s</em> style rictus. During one of the many metaphorical dream sequences, you must slowly creep through a warehouse of crates of mouthwash to avoid being caught by a dragon-like horse monster. Though you can see him thrash, and indentations where his serpentine neck have crushed the catwalk, his body and face are invisible except briefly when viewed through a special blacklight given only to the captains of the ship. Your only hint in beating him is a single note at the beginning, but it also sums up the game quite nicely.</p><p>&nbsp;“A blind beast, aimless and restless. You can’t run from it.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Now developers Too Kyo Games and Spike Chunsoft have ported the game to PS5, PC, and Xbox as <em>Master Detective Archives: Rain Code+</em>, and my hope is that it will run smoothly on more powerful consoles.

However, rather than once again talking up the collection as a whole for this week’s entry, I’m going to focus on the one game I’ve been playing most within <em>UFO 50 </em>of late: <em>Grimstone, </em>the collection’s epic JRPG.</p><p>In many ways, <em>Grimstone </em>feels like a traditional early JRPG. It’s more <em>Final Fantasy I </em>than <em>Final Fantasy IV </em>or <em>VI</em>, with its blank-slate characters who never speak or have any personality beyond what you can glean from their expressive sprites and their natural tendencies toward sharpshootin’, shotgunnin’, or whatever their particular specialty might be. However, as those weapons may have indicated, <em>Grimstone </em>does differ from most early JRPGs in one crucial way: it eschews the traditional fantasy setting most of them employed for a really terrific “weird west” world, one in which gunslingers and ghost towns coexist alongside angels, demons, and all manner of strange and unsettling creatures and happenings. And even if the characters in your party don’t have much depth, the world itself does. What at first seems like a landscape against which a simplistic battle of good and evil is playing out reveals itself to be more complex and intriguing as you persevere through <em>Grimstone</em>’s surprisingly lengthy quest.</p><p>I think I’m finally nearing the end of that quest after playing <em>Grimstone </em>pretty obsessively in recent days, though I still have no idea quite what I’ll find at the end of the mysterious late-game dungeon that now awaits me. One thing I do know, however, is that no matter what I find, finishing <em>Grimstone </em>will hardly mark the end of my time with <em>UFO 50</em>, as it still has so many wonderful games whose surfaces I have yet to really scratch. — Carolyn Petit</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-76-pts-update/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Bethesda Game Studios just released a sizeable update for Fallout 76’s ‘PTS’, the Public Tester Server available exclusively to users playing the game through Steam. This update includes a whole host of content coming to the full game soon, including ‘The Gleaming Depths’ raid, which is a new endgame activity, and C.A.M.P. pets.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-plenty-coming">Plenty Coming</h2>



<p>Fallout 76 is almost six years old, and since it has been on the market, it has undergone a tumultuous journey. This year, the game skyrocketed in popularity thanks to the success of the Fallout live-action series, and that growth continues to climb several months later.</p>



<p>If you’re on the Public Test Server for Fallout 76, you’ll be able to download and start interacting with the new update <strong>today</strong>.</p>



<p>At the heart of the update is The Gleaming Depths raid, a first-of-its-kind event that serves as a fresh endgame activity. In The Gleaming Depths, players must use teamwork to survive against intense bosses and armies of enemies. In a multiplayer-focused twist that’s not typical for Fallout 76, The Gleaming Depths will almost <strong>require </strong>players to join forces and use a multitude of builds to succeed.</p>



<p>There are special rewards in store, though. Along with the various item drops, you’ll be able to ‘farm’ new four-star legendary weapons by taking part in raids. That also means that four-star enemies are coming to Fallout 76. </p>



<p>Also coming in the new update are ‘player titles’ that can be used to identity the type of Fallout gamer that you are, as well as C.A.M.P. pets and a whole slew of tweaks to mutated public events, perks, weapons, and other items and mechanics.</p>



<p>If you check out the full patch notes for this upcoming update, you’ll note that this is one of the largest patches to hit Fallout 76 in years.</p>



<p>Are you eager to see what’s coming next in Fallout 76? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

But this is the first official look at what the studio has been developing. Before this, the only way to get an FPS option in fan-made <em>Fortnite </em>maps was to use <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/gbUlhuPUzWQ&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/gbUlhuPUzWQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">crude workarounds or camera hacks</a></span> that never felt great and were prone to bugs and glitches. Epic even acknowledged these workarounds in the blog post, opening it with: “Workarounds, begone.”</p><p>While an official FPS-like mode isn’t in the game <em>yet</em>, Epic’s new experimental tool lets us see what might be possible in the future. The module is now a part of the <em>Fortnite</em>-powered Unreal Engine editor known as UEFN. And the results look pretty good! I think most people would be fooled into thinking this was anything but <em>Fortnite</em>. </p><p>Now, this new module is still being built and tested, so Epic isn’t letting people publish maps with the FPS module included just yet. And not all weapons work perfectly with it and there are some graphical issues, too. But even in this rough state, it looks solid. </p><p>I bet it won’t be too long from now that Epic is offering up an FPS battle royale mode in <em>Fortnite</em>. And I’m excited to see what UEFN devs can whip up with the module once Epic improves it and lets players publish FPS games and maps. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fortnite-lego-pieces-worlds-uefn-creative-update-1851353810?_gl=1*18w56ps*_ga*MjAxMTA0MDE1Ny4xNzI1Njc1NzAy*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyODA2OTA5MC42Mi4xLjE3MjgwNzM3NTIuNDcuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-lego-pieces-worlds-uefn-creative-update-1851353810?_gl=1*18w56ps*_ga*MjAxMTA0MDE1Ny4xNzI1Njc1NzAy*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyODA2OTA5MC42Mi4xLjE3MjgwNzM3NTIuNDcuMC4w"><em>Fortnite </em>is already like 200 different games</a></span>.

The trick requires messing around with menu screens and save files. When it works it kind of breaks the game, but it’s worth it for speedrunners pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in the latest Nintendo Switch <em>Zelda</em>. </p><p>As ZeldaMaster explains, the first part of pulling off the glitch is simple enough. Once in control of Link during the prologue, make a manual save. From then on, don’t save again until controlling Zelda after the map opens up and can be explored as needed. At that point, go get the Sign echo and head to the Eternal Forest. This is when things start to get tricky. The next step requires planting a sign as close to where the forest warps you back to the start as possible. The goal is to pause and bring up the save screen at the exact moment Zelda finishes reading a sign and begins to get transported. </p><p>If successful, she’ll still be able to move around while the menu is up on the screen. Next, the goal is to load the existing manual save while Zelda is in the process of dying. This requires finding some nearby enemies and having them deplete her health. Bringing up the menu screen again the second she dies and Game Over is about to pop up will get the game bugged out and from there it’s possible to select Retry and load the original save at the same time, swapping Zelda back to Link on the current overworld near the forest. The game state will regress and certain gameplay features will become locked again, but Link has his gear and can freely explore the map.<br></p><p>It’s a neat glitch because people love Link, but it raises the interesting possibility of whether the entire game can be beaten with him. He doesn’t have the magic rod that lets Zelda create echoes, effectively locking him out of solving any of the game’s puzzles and progressing through to the end as the developers intended. But what if he could get the Tri Rod and start making them while retaining all his other abilities? If players can swap an entire character model, I’m sure they can figure out a simple item.</p><p>After all, <em>Zelda </em>speedrunners are the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/zelda-totk-master-sword-unbreakable-glitch-prologue-1851613232&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/zelda-totk-master-sword-unbreakable-glitch-prologue-1851613232">same folks who figured out how to rescue the unbreakable Master Sword</a></span> from the beginning of <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em>.

            <title><![CDATA[EXCLUSIVE – Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Remake is Closer Than You Think]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/black-flag-remake-release-date/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/exclusive-%E2%80%93-assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-black-flag-remake-is-closer-than-you-think.1001244/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/black-flag-remake-release-date/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>We first got wind of an Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Remake earlier this year, and information sent to Insider Gaming suggests that the game could be coming sooner than you might think.</p>



<p>When <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-flag-remake-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumors of the Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Remake</a> began to circulate on the internet, many, including ourselves, assumed that the game would still be some years away from releasing. However, new details and documentation on the game sent to Insider Gaming under the condition that it does not go public suggest that the game is well into development and could be released much sooner than we all thought.</p>



<p>In fact, prior to the recent <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-february-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Shadows delay</a>, which is understood to have affected the Assassin’s Creed pipeline of content releases, the Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Remake (codenamed Obsidian) was to be released around November 2025, which would be around the same time that the series’ multiplayer offering, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-invictus-will-be-a-fall-guys-like-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">codenamed Invictus</a>, is to be released.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming understands that this is part of Ubisoft’s ramp-up strategy for the Assassin’s Creed series, which will see around 10 Assassin’s Creed titles of various lengths and experiences released in the next five years. This includes Assassin’s Creed codename Jade, a fully-fledged mobile offering with a tentative date in Q2 2025 (FYQ1 26). </p>



<p>Unfortunately, though, the recent Assassin’s Creed Shadows delay, which Marc-Alexis Côté said to said staff in an internal email “will also impact the rest of the Assassin’s Creed roadmap,” may have skewed these dates a little.

Having successfully made its way onto iOS and Android devices through a combination of ceaseless legal activity and new EU regulations, the Epic Games Store is ready to start tempting users away from Apple and Google's digital storefronts - and, in news that's unlikely to surprise anyone, it plans to do so by giving away free games.
</p>
<p>
Weekly freebies - alongside subsidised sales vouchers and a rewards programme - have long been Epic's preferred method of attracting customers to its glacially evolving store on PC, after its various exclusivity deals elicited more frustration that jubilation from players. So news that it plans to repeat the strategy on mobile isn't much of a revelation.
</p>
<p>
But it's now been officially confirmed by Epic Games Store general manager Steve Allison, who, speaking during a round table during this week's Unreal Fest (thanks <a href="https://mobilegamer.biz/epics-mobile-games-store-up-to-50-titles-by-q4-free-games-program-lower-fees-for-unreal-devs-more/">mobilegamer.biz</a>) explained, "The free games programme will launch in Q4 along with the [first] third-party apps showing up, and we're gonna have some awesome stuff for players that will also be awesome for developers because it'll help us scale really quickly."
</p>

<p>
In total, Epic expects to have "between 10 and 50" third-party applications available on its mobile store by this "holiday season", with Ark: Ultimate Mobile Edition already to confirmed as one of those games. The biggest potential hold-up, according to Allison is "implementing a payment solution, so that may push some of these out into the subsequent months."
</p><p>
And when it comes to enticing developers, it's also pushing a similar self-publishing strategy to that seen on PC, alongside a reduced cut of earnings on app sales and in-app purchases compared to Apple and Google's share. Epic's standard cut is 12.5 percent, but that can be further reduced to 3.5 percent for Unreal Engine games launching on its store before or at the same time as other stores and platforms. It'll also waive its cut entirely for six months if a developer agrees to release its game as Epic exclusives.
</p>
<p>
Epic, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-games-is-reportedly-laying-off-900-employees">announced it was laying off "around 830 employees" last September</a> because it had "been spending way more money than we earn", has struggled to see a return on its PC store despite its huge monetary investment. Last year, it admitted the Epic Games Store <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-games-store-still-hasnt-turned-a-profit">still wasn't profitable</a> five years after launch, and it's unclear if that situation changed. Speaking earlier this week, Epic CEO Tim Sweeney <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-maker-now-financially-sound-after-mass-layoffs">trumpeted the fact</a> <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> and the Epic Games Store have "hit new records in concurrency and success", but made no mention of its financial gains.
</p>
<p>
Epic initially <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-secures-ios-developer-account-europe-mobile-store-and-fortnite-launch-this-year">announced it would be launching a mobile version of its store</a> back in February, after Apple confirmed it would be complying with the EU's Digital Markets Act requiring it to allow sideloading and alternate marketplaces on its devices. Those plans <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tim-sweeney-no-regrets-on-fortnite-app-store-drama-as-epic-game-store-launches-on-mobile-in-europe">finally reached fruition this August</a> when the Epic Games Store launched for iOS in Europe and Android devices worldwide, although only first-party titles including Fortnite are currently available. It also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-says-its-bringing-fortnite-and-the-epic-games-store-to-ios-in-the-uk-next-year">hopes to launch a UK version</a> in 2025.
</p>
<p>
Since then, Epic has continued its onslaught of legal action against app store competitors, most recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-launches-major-new-lawsuit-in-app-store-fight-this-time-against-samsung-and-google">targeting Samsung and Google</a> for using an "Auto Blocker" setting users must turn off in order to install Epic Games and Fortnite.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/horizon-zero-dawn-complete-edition-scrapped-to-make-way-for-remaster-requiring-a-psn-account/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1151640/Horizon_Zero_Dawn_Complete_Edition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Horizon Zero Dawn Complete Edition</a> was already ported to PC before they announced the remaster. Now, Sony has created the <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-pc-upgrade-adds-mandatory-psn-account-requirement/">Horizon Zero Dawn Remaster that requires players to create a PSN account</a> to be able to play the game. This has been a hugely controversial move by Sony, as it lands them in hot water with players every single time a PlayStation game gets ported to PC and requires a PSN account.&nbsp; Last Friday, the original Horizon Zero Dawn Complete Edition was delisted on Steam and the Epic Games Store to make way for Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered. It seems those who don't own the game will now be forced to buy the remaster instead of the original PC port.</p>
<p>Horizon Zero Dawn Complete Edition was previously available in countries where Steam could be accessed. While the Steam page for the Complete Edition is still live, people are no longer able to purchase the game itself. Instead, Steam users are prompted to either pre-order Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered or Horizon Forbidden West.</p>
<p>Previously, Horizon Zero Dawn Complete Edition was available straight after the remaster was announced, but then PlayStation quietly upped the price of the original to replicate its starting price when the game was first released. <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-quietly-doubles-price-of-horizon-zero-dawn-complete-edition-on-ps-store/">It went from $29.99 to $49.99</a> on the PlayStation store. In the six years the game was available in the store, this was the first time the game experienced a price bump, with the game going on sale frequently and the price dropping to a fixed rate of $29.99 in the past.</p>
<p>Pulling the Horizon Zero Dawn Complete Edition is a risky choice made by Sony, as it will make it more difficult for customers to be able to play the game depending on what country they're in. The Remastered release will be out on October 31 but will require a PSN account. Sony's PlayStation Network is not officially available in more than a hundred countries, with most of them being in the Middle East, Europe, Africa and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>As stated before, there have been previous games ported to PC by Sony that also require a PSN account, such as Until Dawn and God of War Ragnarok, which has proved to be a point of contention for many players. When Helldivers 2 was released on PC, Sony tried to make it a requirement for players to link to a PlayStation Network account, which led to review bombing. This was a quickly reversed decision. Whether that will happen for Horizon Zero Dawn remains to be seen, but considering that Until Dawn and God of War Ragnarok both still require PSN accounts, it's unlikely.</p>

Tess, voiced by Kaitlyn Dever (HBO’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-us-season-2-trailer-abby-joel-ellie-guitar-1851658503&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-us-season-2-trailer-abby-joel-ellie-guitar-1851658503"><em>The Last of Us</em> season two’s Abby</a></span>), is a teenage girl with a contentious relationship with her mother Opal (<em>The Americans’</em> Keri Russel). It’s a pretty familiar mother-daughter dynamic, but the third figure, Opal’s mom and Tess’s grandmother, looms over the two at all times. She might be dead, but her secret is what sends Tess and Opal on an adventure that teases out their generational trauma. </p><p>This road trip is more about the handful of stops you make along the way rather than the drive, tasking you with exploring these smaller spaces (An empty house filled with moving boxes, an abandoned vacation home, a boat) on foot as Tess. All of these places are filled with objects and traces of past lives for both Tess and Opal to uncover. The developers behind<em> Open Roads</em> used to work at Fullbright—of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gone-home-the-kotaku-review-1118218265&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gone-home-the-kotaku-review-1118218265"><em>Gone Home</em></a></span> fame—so you’ll walk around and pick up objects just as you did in the seminal 2013 walking simulator. Just like <em>Open Roads</em>’ spiritual predecessor, the story is told mostly through piecing together context clues found in the environments and objects of the world. News clippings, pictures, letters, and more bring out the (maybe purposely) forgotten frustrations between three generations of women in the family: Tess, Opal, and the grandmother.</p><p>While <em>Gone Home</em> had you exploring an empty house on your own, <em>Open Roads </em>keeps Tess and Opal together at all times. Instead of lonely reminiscing, each discovery turns into an opportunity for dialogue between mother and daughter. This is one of <em>Open Roads </em>greatest strengths, as Dever and Russel are both wonderful performers. Hearing the two actors play off each other feels less like a game and more like an intimate play. The game’s runtime reflects that, as it only takes about two hours tops to complete. If you want to experience a short but emotionally packed story carried by its excellent performances then <em>Open Roads</em> is the game for you. Its inclusion on Game Pass means that you don’t have a good reason not to play it. Even if you don’t like it, you’ll only have lost two hours of your life.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Midia also says that younger gamers like to take “vacations” from games like <em>Fortnite </em>and <em>Apex Legends</em>, and suggests that publishers and devs should try to release new single-player games toward the end of live-service seasons, when players are more likely to be looking for a break. </p><p>Of course, while this data shows that single-player is still a very popular type of video game, I doubt publishers will stop pushing for live-service hits.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/sword-art-online-developer-wants-to-take-the-series-in-a-more-mature-direction<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">As for permadeath, that's still to be determined.</h2></div><section><p>New entries of both the Sword Art Online anime and the games have consistently been released for more than ten years now. On October 4th, both the newest anime season, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/04/17/sword-art-online-alternative-gun-gale-online-episode-2-ggo-review">Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online II</a>, and the newest game, <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/sword-art-online-fractured-daydream">Sword Art Online: Fractured Daydream</a> were released. </p><p>SAO: FD is already quite different from the previous in the video game series, but we had to ask: What’s next for the Sword Art Online video games? Here’s what SAO: FD producer Shoehei Mogami and SAO game series producer Yosuke Futami had to say about the possibility of a more mature SAO game and the MMORPG-style SAO game they know fans want. </p><p>“Sword Art Online itself, the anime and the game, will keep going into the future,” Futami said. “We do want to bring SAO to the next level, maybe even to a higher-performing console.” </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Futami also explained that while Sword Art Online: Fractured Daydream is more character-based, they maybe also want to try to do something around the concept of SAO that if you die in game, you die in real life. That’s something they want to explore in the future, but Futami clarified they likely wouldn’t implement a permadeath mechanic because  “the current SAO game fans might be angry and just might break their keyboard or something.” </p><p>“We want to try to have more for those SAO fans who are adults and experience an SAO which is more mature,” Futami explained. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>We want to try to have more for those SAO fans who are adults and experience an SAO which is more mature</p></div><p>The future of SAO probably also wouldn’t be something like a Souls-like, and because of the difficulty behind development, neither an MMORPG.</p><p>“MMORPGs are very difficult to make,” Futami said, joking that in Japan it’s said to take 70 years to make one. “While we know the IP [Sword Art Online] would be great for it, and many of our fans and player community are interested in it, it's something we would only pursue once we know we have a strong concept and could do it right. Maybe, if all the stars aligned, we would be able to start making it.” </p><p>Though it isn’t an MMORPG, Sword Art Online: Fractured Daydream seeks to emulate raids found in MMORPGs with 20-person dungeons and raid bosses, complete with boss-specific, rare loot that not everyone can pick up at the end of the fight. It’s also a standalone title, so anyone familiar with just some of the anime would be able to get into and understand SAO: FD, no previous SAO game knowledge required. </p><p>“There’s a barrier to entry after ten years of [SAO] games,” Mogami said. “We want people who haven’t played the games to be able to enjoy SAO games.” </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>The team also wanted to challenge themselves by implementing cross-play in SAO: FD, so friends aren’t barred from playing with each other, Mogami explained. </p><p>There is one more thing we know about the future of SAO games, too: Though the chance is not entirely zero, don’t expect an SAO game without Kirito or Asuna. Having an SAO game without Kirito and Asuna, Futami said, “is like having a Dragon Ball without Son Goku.” </p><p><em>Casey DeFreitas is IGN's Deputy Guides Editor.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-starfield-star-citizen-yakuza<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There is a belief, among a certain school of game designers, that bigger is better – or that the larger and more detailed a simulation gets, the more convincing it becomes. Cases in point: <em>Star Citizen</em> and <em>Starfield</em>, both of which attempt to model entire universes to exacting standards (albeit in pretty different ways) and both of which made headlines this week for all the wrong reasons. The best, most lived-in feeling video game worlds are elaborate illusions. On this week’s <a href="https://aftermath.site/tag/aftermath-hours" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aftermath Hours</a>, we talk about that.</p><p>We begin by doing our best impression of that one meme where <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9S1EzkRpelY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jonathan Frakes asks you things</a>: What’s going on with <a href="https://kotaku.com/starfield-shattered-space-metacritic-steam-reviews-long-1851664605" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Starfield</em>’s new, poorly-received DLC</a>? Why is <em>Star Citizen</em> – a <a href="https://aftermath.site/i-wonder-what-star-citizen-is-up-to" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">crowdfunded</a> testament to one man’s hubris that’s been in development for more than a decade – <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-citizen-developer-cloud-imperium-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">forcing developers to crunch</a> in the year 2024? In light of the upcoming <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4tmmzh2PfA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TV show</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3061810/Like_a_Dragon_Pirate_Yakuza_in_Hawaii/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">yet another spinoff game</a>, is the <em>Yakuza </em>series spreading itself too thin? And <a href="https://aftermath.site/shadows-of-doubt-early-access-full-release" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">when is an early access game done</a>, really?&nbsp;</p><p>Then we answer questions about the psychic damage we sustain while trying to play games with optimal outcomes and which power Kirby would gain if he swallowed us (anxiety). Luke definitely does not regret the way he phrased his response to the latter question at all.</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can make a hyper-realistic, simulated-down-to-the-skin-pore version of <em>Yakuza </em>and then throw it out after realizing that it’s bad.</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation:</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> It’s so funny that we were talking about the creaky systems underlying something like <em>Starfield </em>and how people got tired of those after only a handful of installments, really, of games in that engine [in the <em>Elder Scrolls</em> and modern <em>Fallouts</em>, specifically]. Compare that to <em>Yakuza</em>, which has had many more games that are more openly formulaic, and yet people are still hungering for more <em>Yakuza</em>. Meanwhile, with something like <em>Starfield</em>, they’re like “It’s too similar to this one game that came out eight years ago, or this other game that came out 13 years ago.” How do you account for that? What’s going on there?</p><p><strong>Luke: </strong>It happened on a magic formula. It’s always been open-world to an extent, but an extremely limited one. But the setting for that open world has always been so intimate that nobody minds that it’s actually quite small. By making it a neighborhood that the story’s set in, most people relate to that. We all live in a neighborhood. We all live somewhere. You guys especially, you live in New York. It’s a major city. You’ve got your bodega, you’ve got your department store, you’ve got your pizza place. You’ve got two bars and a cafe. That’s what <em>Yakuza </em>is. The more you run around its streets doing errands, the more you become familiar with the layout of those streets.&nbsp;</p><p>I know Harper did <a href="https://kotaku.com/how-yakuzas-city-changes-from-game-to-game-1821884988" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a really cool piece</a> a few years ago on Kotaku about this: The cities of <em>Yakuza</em> actually become the star of the series, because that’s what you grow to love and remember and think really fondly about. You just know every street corner by heart. When you play the next game, you can be like “Aw, the burger place closed.” You start to imagine a storyline involving “Oh, maybe they were down on their luck” or “Maybe their wife got sick and they had to sell. Now it’s a fake Irish bar.” And then for the next 11 [in-game] years, that’s a fake Irish bar.</p><p>It’s got that limitation, that you don’t mind that it’s a small open world. Then it’s got the main appeal of the dialogue itself. Dialogue’s dialogue; you go up to someone and press a button. But in <em>Yakuza </em>you’re doing it for the writing and the story itself, not for the way it’s delivered. You’re not relying on a clockwork NPC or a dynamic branching storyline. It’s a soap opera. So they can just keep releasing this game forever, and people won’t care because it’s an interactive soap opera.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>Jarathen in chat says “It also speaks to where the Bethesda formulas fail, and that’s in making a place feel real, lived-in, and engaging.” And like, yeah, it’s that human element. Maybe this also ties back into <em>Star Citizen</em>, so we’ve really come full circle in a lot of ways. You don’t need to simulate everything.&nbsp;</p><p>There’s this belief, I think, among at least some people who make games that the closer you get to a simulation, the better your game is, or the more advanced it is. When in reality, <em>Yakuza </em>takes all of these what would be considered shortcuts to create the illusion of life and the illusion of a real place. But that’s so much more effective as a means of conveying the <em>feeling </em>of a place than something like Bethesda’s Radiant AI where everybody’s a little clockwork person that does the same thing every day or <em>Star Citizen</em> trying to model the whole universe and just having this kind of janky tech demo.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Luke: </strong>There are few experiences in video games as immersive as putting a modern <em>Yakuza </em>game into first-person mode and walking really slowly through a busy street. I know that sounds ridiculous, but these are really good-looking games. They know that they need to worry about neon lights and rain puddles on a city street as the main things you’re looking at, and they’ve nailed it. Walking through the city streets, all it does is spawn NPCs. You can’t talk to them. They’re not on a clockwork routine where one of them has to be Trevor the blacksmith, who has to be back in his barn by 5 PM to feed his ox, because that’s what Bethesda’s system mandates.</p><p>It doesn’t matter, because someone walking past you on the street doesn’t have to be a person with a story. That’s just a model. What’s important is the volume of them to make you feel like you’re in a bustling place that’s alive and full of people. And it absolutely nails that. </p><p>One of my favorite things to do in <em>Yakuza </em>is to walk between missions. And you can fast travel in a cab. Most people will run and sprint, but I like to walk. I like to look at every shop, because every shop is unique. You really feel like you’re in a place. Every time I play these games, no matter how many times I’ve been to Kamurocho, I can walk past and notice something new – just because I’m walking in this place that feels alive. I can be like “Oh, there’s a pachinko place here that I never noticed” or “The movie posters here are different this time around. I wonder what this movie is – because it’s all in Japanese and I can’t read it.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Ironically, for a game that’s able to come out so frequently, that is built on such a repetitive platform, that it can feel so alive every time speaks to how well they’ve got that machine oiled. They know what is special about the game, what they’re good at, and what they can do, and they execute every part of it perfectly every time.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
