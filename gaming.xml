            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/trailers/627307/devil-may-cry-netflix-vergil<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/charles-pulliam-moore">Charles Pulliam-Moore</a> <span>is a reporter focusing on film, TV, and pop culture. Before The Verge, he wrote about comic books, labor, race, and more at io9 and Gizmodo for almost five years.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><div><p>Ahead of the debut of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/19/24249440/devil-may-cry-show-netflix-date-trailer">its new <em>Devil May Cry </em>adaptation</a> next month, Netflix has released <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlEqHXRrcpc&amp;ab_channel=Netflix">yet another trailer</a> to get you acquainted with some of the characters who will be gunning for Dante.</p></div><p>In the new trailer it appears there are two different armies dead set on destroying demon hunter Dante (Johnny Yong Bosch) because of his connections to the supernatural world. Dante already has his hands full with the demon White Rabbit (Hoon Lee) and his goons threatening to raze an entire city if their demands aren’t met.</p><p>But to make matters even more complicated, human soldiers like Lady (Scout Taylor-Compton) see Dante as a threat due to the demon blood running through his veins. </p><p>Despite Dante’s insistence that he isn’t a monster, all of the high-flying, Studio Mir-produced acrobatics he pulls off definitely make it seem like he’s got some demonic heritage in the mix. And the look on Dante’s face when his twin brother Vergil (Robbie Daymond) shows up makes it pretty clear that he’s hiding something rather explosive about himself. The trailer makes clear that Netflix’s <em>Devil May Cry </em>is going to be feature elements from the franchise’s games like <em>Dante’s Awakening </em>as well as its official manga (where White Rabbit made his first appearance.) And hopefully, that means the series will feel like more than a one-to-one adaptation when it debuts on April 3rd.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It's a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cooperative-board-games">cooperative game</a>, so you and your fellow players are working together to take on the horrors that await. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's also part of the extensive world in the <a href="https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/?_gl=1*ta8od4*_up*MQ..*_ga*NTQ1MzkyOTIxLjE3Mzc1MDIzOTg.*_ga_9350SBPQ07*MTczNzUwMjM5OC4xLjEuMTczNzUwMzMxNy4wLjAuMA..#/universe/arkham-horror-files" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Arkham Horror Files</u></a> family of board games, card games, and the newest, the nicely accessible Arkham Horror: The Role-Playing Game (<a href="https://zdcs.link/9YOxqd?object_uuid=ef08ecdd-50ae-4054-9e78-1f17874c4766&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" data-aps-asin="B0CWS8TPJP" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">see on Amazon</a>) and subsequent newly released matching expansive <a href="https://zdcs.link/QV7KkY?object_uuid=ef08ecdd-50ae-4054-9e78-1f17874c4766&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" data-aps-asin="B0DHFL53C9" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">rulebook</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The card deck-builder Arkham Horror card game has been around since 2016. It has seen multiple expansions and revisions since its original printing. Buying the game is also not entirely straightforward outside of the base deck and campaign, as there are multiple ways to build, curate, and personalize your experience. </p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Featured in this article</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here's a swipe-able, all-in-one carousel of everything discussed in the article, for those who feel confident enough about their Arkham Horror: The Card Game knowleged to skip the blurbs. For everyone else, keep on reading.</p><p id="the-core-set"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="The Core Set">The Base Game</h2></p><div catalogid="42d3cfc0-2a33-4526-a7e7-e277d242fefb" id="216560"><div id="216560" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Arkham Horror: The Card Game</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The core set contains all you need to get started. It contains five pre-built investigator decks that let you dive into the first scenario: the Night of the Zealot campaign. This will give you a great, replayable taste of the Arkham Horror Card Game world. And if you like it, you have a huge selection of expansions to consider. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Arkham Horror Card Game Expansions </strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Arkham Horror’s card game expansions are a bit different than the board game version. For the board games, expansion boxes include the full stories and scenarios as well as the new investigators to join in on the fun. The card game operates a bit differently. You can buy campaign expansions to add new stories to your game, and/or you can buy investigator expansions to add new characters. In other words, the new stories and new characters are sold separately. This might not be ideal for everyone, but it allows you to choose how much of an experience you want to invest in at a certain time, since you can play an expansion scenario without the newer investigators if you want to. </p></div><p id="the-dunwich-legacy"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="The Dunwich Legacy"><strong>The Dunwich Legacy</strong></h2></p><div id="216561" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger" catalogid="42d3cfc0-2a33-4526-a7e7-e277d242fefb"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Arkham Horror: The Card Game - The Dunwich Legacy Campaign Expansion</h3></p></div><div catalogid="42d3cfc0-2a33-4526-a7e7-e277d242fefb" id="216563"><div id="216563" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Arkham Horror: The Card Game - The Dunwich Legacy Investigator Expansion</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The Dunwich Legacy was the first expansion released. It’s meant to be a gentle step up from the base game, with a user-friendly set of scenarios. In it you search for lost investigators, which coincidentally seems to tie into how the entire card game franchise builds upon itself by adding new investigator sets in each expansion release.</p></div><p id="the-path-to-carcosa"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="The Path to Carcosa"><strong>The Path to Carcosa</strong></h2></p><div id="216566" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger" catalogid="42d3cfc0-2a33-4526-a7e7-e277d242fefb"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Arkham Horror: The Card Game - The Path to Carcosa Campaign Expansion</h3></p></div><div catalogid="42d3cfc0-2a33-4526-a7e7-e277d242fefb" id="216567"><div id="216567" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Arkham Horror: The Card Game - The Path to Carcosa Investigator Expansion</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">A theatre production comes to Arkham in this expansion. The added rules in this one are fairly user-friendly for new playersm but the expansion isn’t easy enough for vets to dismiss. If you have the older first edition of this expansion, you may still find the differences in this second edition engaging enough to warrant a purchase.</p></div><p id="the-forgotten-age"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="The Forgotten Age"><strong>The Forgotten Age</strong></h2></p><div id="216568" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger" catalogid="42d3cfc0-2a33-4526-a7e7-e277d242fefb"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Arkham Horror: The Card Game - The Forgotten Age Campaign Expansion</h3></p></div><div catalogid="42d3cfc0-2a33-4526-a7e7-e277d242fefb" id="216569"><div id="216569" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Arkham Horror: The Card Game - The Forgotten Age Investigator Expansion</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This expansion has you explore the ruins of an Aztec city, with a mystery that threatens to unravel the fabric of time iteslf. This is a very difficult campaign, so it's not recommended to newcomers until they've played through some of the others first. It’s also on its second edition version now.</p></div><p id="the-circle-undone"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="The Circle Undone"><strong>The Circle Undone</strong></h2></p><div id="216570" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger" catalogid="42d3cfc0-2a33-4526-a7e7-e277d242fefb"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Arkham Horror: The Card Game - The Circle Undone Campaign Expansion</h3></p></div><div catalogid="42d3cfc0-2a33-4526-a7e7-e277d242fefb" id="216571"><div id="216571" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Arkham Horror: The Card Game - The Circle Undone Investigator Expansion</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This expansion has affectionately been called “the witches pack.” The new investigators introduced in this expansion have some powerful bonuses that are a delight to use. That's a relief, because the campaign is one of the tougher ones of all the expansions as well. If you plan to get this campaign, you should absolutely consider getting the investigators.</p></div><p id="the-edge-of-the-earth"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="The Edge of the Earth"><strong>The Edge of the Earth</strong></h2></p><div id="216572" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger" catalogid="42d3cfc0-2a33-4526-a7e7-e277d242fefb"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Arkham Horror: The Card Game - Edge of The Earth Campaign Expansion</h3></p></div><div catalogid="42d3cfc0-2a33-4526-a7e7-e277d242fefb" id="216573"><div id="216573" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Arkham Horror: The Card Game - Edge of The Earth Investigator Expansion</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The antarctic tundra is a classic location for Lovecraftian horrors to reside. So that's exactly where this expansion brings you and your fellow players: to the deep freezing cold. Peril lurks around every corner, so choose your steps wisely, with or without the coordinating investigators.</p></div><p id="the-scarlet-keys"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="The Scarlet Keys"><strong>The Scarlet Keys</strong></h2></p><div id="216574" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger" catalogid="42d3cfc0-2a33-4526-a7e7-e277d242fefb"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Arkham Horror: The Card Game - The Scarlet Keys Campaign Expansion</h3></p></div><div catalogid="42d3cfc0-2a33-4526-a7e7-e277d242fefb" id="216575"><div id="216575" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Arkham Horror: The Card Game - The Scarlet Keys Investigator Expansion</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This campaign expansion has you traversing the world as you delve into an international conspiracy involving the collection of keys and a race against the Red Coterie.

They require the base campaign set to play them, and while they are a bonus, they are best suited for folks who are serious about Arkham Horror: The Card Game. They are considered to be luxury items, essentially. And some of them are not the easiest to get a hold of. In fact, when going to create this list, I found that some were discontinued or not easily found through sites like Amazon or even Asmodee itself. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Five return-to-boxes are currently available: <a href="https://zdcs.link/avXq1b?object_uuid=ef08ecdd-50ae-4054-9e78-1f17874c4766&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Night of the Zealot</u></a> (the campaign in the original starter box), Dunwich Legacy, Circle of Carcosa, Circle Undone, and Forgotten Age. Some enthusiasts say that Forgotten Age fixes some of the complexities in the original expansion. As you can see, when you click the name of Night of the Zealot, these are out of print, so collectors may find them difficult to come by.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Parallel Investigator Packs</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/news/2020/5/5/beyond-our-dimension/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Parallel investigators</u></a> are alternate versions of investigators that have abilities different from those of their original counterparts, including enhanced abilities and stats. Like Return to Boxes, these are not as easily found at big retailers. Collectors will have to look around for them to get them. </p><p id="the-bottom-line"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="The Bottom Line"><strong>The Bottom Line</strong></h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you are a fan of Lovecraft mythos-themed games, Arkham Horror is a universe you’ll absolutely want to explore. One awesome thing about Arkham Horror: The Card Game is that you can play it as a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-solo-board-games">solo game</a>, as well as with friends. The universes and iterations of games make for lots of capacities for adventure, with seemingly endless replayability for several of them. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, like the board games, the card games absolutely veer on the more difficult side. They have quite a bit of chance, which can drastically increase replayability as well as frustration. Setup and learning time can also take a few minutes. You’ll find that the card games are easier to set up than the board games, even without expansions, which makes the journey through less painful.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Jennifer Stavros is a contributing freelancer for IGN, covering everything from comics, games, technology, and nerd culture.

          <p>Nvidia has launched all of the GeForce RTX 50-series GPUs that it announced at CES, at least technically—whether you're buying from Nvidia, AMD, or Intel, it's nearly impossible to find any of these new cards at their advertised prices right now.</p>
<p>But hope springs eternal, and newly leaked specs for GeForce RTX 5060 and 5050-series cards suggest that Nvidia may be announcing these lower-end cards soon. These kinds of cards are rarely exciting, but Steam Hardware Survey data shows that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/06/geforce-rtx-4060-review-not-thrilling-but-a-super-efficient-299-workhorse/">these xx60</a> and xx50 cards are what the overwhelming majority of PC gamers are putting in their systems.</p>
<p>The specs, <a href="https://x.com/kopite7kimi/status/1898951554322883046">posted</a> by a reliable leaker named Kopite and reported <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/nvidia-rtx-5050-rtx-5060-and-rtx-5060-ti-specs-leak-expect-8gb-16gb-flavors-and-higher-tgps">by Tom's Hardware and others</a>, suggest a refresh that's in line with what Nvidia has done with most of the 50-series so far. Along with a move to the next-generation Blackwell architecture, the 5060 GPUs each come with a small increase to the number of CUDA cores, a jump from GDDR6 to GDDR7, and an increase in power consumption, but no changes to the amount of memory or the width of the memory bus. The 8GB versions, in particular, will probably continue to be marketed primarily as 1080p cards.</p>

<p>As with the 4060 Ti, the 5060 Ti is said to come in two versions, one with 8GB of RAM and one with 16GB. One of the 4060 Ti's problems was that its relatively narrow 128-bit memory bus limited its performance at 1440p and 4K resolutions even with 16GB of RAM—the bandwidth increase from GDDR7 could help with this, but we'll need to test to see for sure.</p>

            <p>
It's been a bit of a busy day in the world of virtual reality, thanks to a flurry of PSVR 2 and PCVR announcements <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wN0B5utUu4">courtesy of the aptly named VR Games Showcase</a>. And if you've been itching for an excuse to don goggles again, there's fresh gameplay of Hitman: World of Assassination, a new look at Fireproof Games' intriguing Ghost Town, and more.
</p>
<h3>Hitman: World of Assassination PSVR 2 gameplay</h3>
<p>
Starting with Hitman: World of Assassination, it sees players slipping into the immaculately pressed suit (and other more situationally appropriate attire) of Agent 47, and he stealths his way through the likes of Mumbai, Paris, and the Columbian jungle. Its PSVR 2-enabled sniping, gadgetting, and dual-wielding arrives on 27th March, and here's what it looks like:

<h3>The Room studio's Ghost Town gets new gameplay trailer</h3>
<p>
Next up is a fresh look at Ghost Town from Fireproof Games, which previously developed the wonderfully sinister The Room series. This one casts players as witch-turned ghost-hunter Edith Penrose, as she tracks and exorcises spirits across 1980s London. It's a game of "unearthly puzzles" requiring "wits, mystical knowledge, and ancient magic" that's coming to Meta Quest, PSVR 2, and PCVR "early" this summer - and new gameplay is below.

<h3>Surviving Mars: Pioneer revealed</h3>
<p>
Strategy fans are also getting a bit of VR loving in the form of Surviving Mars: Pioneer, an adaptation of Paradox Interactive's terraforming colony management game from 2018. This one's set to release on Meta Quest and PCVR later this year, initially in early access.

<h3>Shadowgate VR coming to PSVR 2</h3>
<p>
Readers of a certain age might remember classic dungeon crawling series Shadowgate, which is celebrating its 35th anniversary this year. And to mark the occassion, its previously released virtual reality adaptation, Shadowgate VR: The Mines of Mythrok, is coming to PSVR 2. There's no word of a release date yet, but players can expect multiple difficulties, a crow guide called Odin, and other stuff as they explore Kal Torlin when it eventually shows up.

<h3>Slender Man slinking onto VR</h3>
<p>
And that's not the only blast from the past coming to VR; one-time horror phenomenon Slender Man is also being revived for virtual reality goggles in the form of Slender: The Arrival VR. It's a port of 2013's Slender: The Arrival - itself a "reimagining and expansion" of 2012 horror game Slender: The Eight Pages - and it's arriving on Meta Quest, PSVR 2, and PCVR this "spring".

<h3>More gameplay from Gorn 2</h3>
<p>
From a night in the woods to a spike in the butt, we're onto Gorn 2 - a "bigger, wilder, and stronger" sequel to 2019's comedic gladiator sim. There's talk of new weapons, new traps, and new supernatural power-ups as players challenge the five sons of the God of the Afterlife across the heavenly realms - which they'll be able to do when Gorn 2 comes to Meta Quest, PSVR 2, and PCVR later this year. And here's that new gameplay:

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/i%E2%80%99m-still-not-completely-sold-on-solo-leveling.1131792/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/solo-leveling-impressions-anime<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last year, I dropped watching <em>Solo Leveling</em> after seven episodes. Although the show lived up to the lip service I’d received from colleagues, I couldn’t ignore the nagging feeling that it was just another power fantasy anime that was all style and no substance. Despite my past reservations, I’ve given the anime another shot with my partner, who adores the series. Having caught up on its second season, I’m still not completely sold.</p><p><em>Solo Leveling</em>, animated by A-1 Pictures, is an anime adaptation of the wildly popular manhwa of the same name. It's one of those anime that’s not quite an isekai while incorporating all of that genre’s worst parts into its otherwise interesting premise. The series takes place in a world where portals from another dimension are filled with invading monsters. To combat the threat of portals randomly opening worldwide, hunters, a chosen few bestowed with the power to wield magical items, form guilds, defeat grunts and bosses inside dungeons, and close gates. To further accentuate the RPG mechanics the world is operating on, hunters are given ranks, with S being the strongest and E being the weakest.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>© A-1 Pictures / Crunchyroll </span></figcaption></figure><p>Our hero, Sung Jun-Woo, was once regarded as humanity’s weakest E-rank hunter. After surviving a near-death experience in a dungeon, Sung accesses a mysterious RPG interface that acts as a personal trainer, allowing him to challenge dungeons and daily objectives to raise his rank. By completing his dailies, Sung gains points to increase his aptitudes (which he exclusively uses to boost his strength until the system forces him to level up other traits with supplemental stat-boosting weapons), switch classes, and gain new powers. Should he ignore his regime, he’s penalized with demanding boss rushes.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Solo Leveling</em> has the juice in the animation department, crafting some of the industry's best fight scenes in its first and second seasons. My qualm with it<em> </em>is that it has yet to develop beyond the base appeal of<em> </em>being a generic edgy power fantasy.</p><p>Rewatching the anime with my partner, I found myself intrigued by the potential for the show to explore how the existence of hunters could create conflict between the global elite and the lower-class citizens gaining wealth exclusively through their ability to thwart dimension-hopping threats. When I asked if the show would ever delve into this thematic hook, my partner said, "Not really." Still, the show does allude to this concept, with Sung's motivation being to earn enough money to send his younger sister to school and pay for his comatose mother's medical bills—all admirable goals for a hero to aspire to. Unfortunately, as he grows stronger, he loses any semblance of a compelling personality.</p><figure><figcaption><span>© A-1 Pictures / Crunchyroll </span></figcaption></figure><p>At the show's start, Sung is an over-apologetic wimpy kid. Despite being a great statistician from his years of fighting to survive dungeon raids as a low-level hunter, his voice lacks confidence, no one respects him, and he has the physical endurance of a Nature Valley bar. Then, like Anne Hathaway’s glow-up in <em>The Princess Diaries</em>, Sung becomes a walking caricature of the idea of the “sigma male” thanks to his solo leveling ability. Consequently, his voice drops four octaves, he gets taller, and he exclusively spews edgy one-liners like he took wisecrack MasterClass courses from <em>Death Note</em>’s Light Yagami. His aura is too tough, his dick is probably enormous, and every scene is dedicated to the women in <em>Solo Leveling</em>’s supporting cast wanting to be with him and men wishing to be him (or be with him).</p><p>I've seen this repeatedly with anime that give the game away with sentence-long titles and plot progression that speedrun past adversity toward the instant gratification of a hero becoming an overpowered demigod thanks to a generic RPG mechanic. <em>Solo Leveling</em> does avoid being a <em>completely</em> generic self-insert power fantasy: Sung exhibits a sliver of his former emotional depth as a do-gooder trying to help his family. Granted, it's buried deep beneath his edgy, eye-roll-inducing bravado, but the show endeavors to plant narrative seeds to elucidate Sung's flattening, with him explicitly expressing concern that he loses his humanity the more he kills monsters and wrongdoers in pursuit of strength. But instead of wrestling with Sung’s inner conflict, the show is more concerned with dedicating most of its time to how raw he looks whenever he squashes his foes.&nbsp;</p><p>At first, I assumed my gripes with <em>Solo Leveling</em> stemmed from how it reminded me too much of <em>Sword Art Online</em>. However, that assumption fell apart when I remembered <em>Sword Art Online</em>’s hero won his fights because he pulled exploits and skills out of his ass. In contrast, <em>Solo Leveling</em> shows Sung making conscious decisions and inquiries into his character build — for lack of a better word — so viewers can follow the logic of why he’d win his battles. Perhaps I just hate the concept of a hero leveling up being shorthand for how power fantasy anime creates conflict for heroes. This assumption fell apart, too, when I remembered how much I enjoyed how shows like <em>Shangri-La Frontier</em>’s whole intrigue stemmed from how its hero — a guy who loves finding exploits in broken games — is forced to complete a naked run without armor or items and becomes the series’ LetMeSoloHer.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>© A-1 Pictures / Crunchyroll </span></figcaption></figure><p>Except for two instances where Sung had to strategize his way out of defeating over-leveled bosses in bonus quests issued by his enigmatic RPG system, every battle in <em>Solo Leveling</em> thus far has been a foregone conclusion. Whether Sung and his crew are betrayed by guild members or ambushed by ice elves, I never feel that Sung is in danger of losing a fight. Regardless of the posturing of his villains, he is destined to win, which does not make for captivating television, no matter how well-animated its stylish fight scenes are or the passionate performances of its talented voice actors. Because of this trend, the intrigue of bigger mysteries, such as why <em>Solo Leveling</em>’s RPG system is dead set on grooming Sung into a god among men, are on the verge of losing appeal due to the repetitive nature of watching Sung accumulate victories like an anime John Cena.</p><p>Whenever I have raised this concern with friends, they say <em>Solo Leveling</em> is "turn-your-brain-off" power fantasy entertainment and that I expect too much from it. Meanwhile, my partner insists that my opinion on <em>Solo Leveling</em> might change once it reaches its “Chimera Ant arc.” I resent being told I can only enjoy something if I don’t think too critically about it, but I will continue with an open mind, waiting for the other shoe to drop and transform the anime into the generational masterpiece its fandom hypes it up to be.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/wanderstop-review"><h3>Wanderstop Is A Management Sim About Burnout</h3></a><p>The game asks a lot of questions about work, but leaves you to find your own answers</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/luffy-one-piece-lakers"><h3>Luffy Would Never Be On My Starting Five</h3></a><p>The king of the pirates would not run point on any basketball team.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/blizzcon-makes-a-return-in-2026/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, it was announced by Blizzard Entertainment that BlizzCon, a celebration of all of Blizzard's communities, is making a return to the Anaheim Convention Center in September of 2026. Those who want to attend will be able to do so on Saturday, September 12, and Sunday, September 13, 2026. To celebrate the news, a trailer has been released. It's just under 40 seconds long but helps build up a little bit of hype for the event.</p>
<p><iframe title="BlizzCon | Announce Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JrMT3bgU-fs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>BlizzCon has been a major event for Blizzard Entertainment since 2005, where it allows members of the team to connect with the ever-growing and constantly changing community, as well as allowing players of Blizzard games to connect with each other at the event. 2026 will, of course, be bringing back some of the staples that have always popped up at previous BlizzCons, such as the Opening Ceremony, in-depth panels, Darkmoon Faire, and hands-on gameplay.</p>
<p>Along the way, there have been many changes to how BlizzCon works, as well as new events to constantly bring something new to the dedicated community, and some in-game rewards for those lucky enough to attend it in person.</p>
<p>From 2020 to 2022, there has not been an in-person BlizzCon, with a lot of it being due to the COVID-19 pandemic and people having to self-isolate. There were also plans for<a href="https://wccftech.com/blizzcon-delayed-indefinitely-game-announcements-coming/"> BlizzConline</a> during this time, but those plans also fell through, with it only happening in February 2021, despite there being plans for it in 2022.</p>
<p>Now, it's finally making a return to an in-person event, where fans and friends can gather at the Anaheim Convention Center to get some sneak peeks at upcoming content across Blizzard's mainstay franchises, such as World of Warcraft, Diablo IV, and Hearthstone.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.blizzcon.com/en-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcement</a> is posted on the official BlizzCon website, where more details will be shared in the future about what will be available at the event. The statement also goes on to say:</p>
<p><em>We are building this event just like we build our games: with a deep commitment to our players, with respect for your connections to our universes, and as a celebration of the strength of the bonds formed through shared adventure</em>.</p>
<p>While it is far too early to even begin to speculate what could be presented at BlizzCon 2026, it's likely that there will be information about the Worldsoul Saga in World of Warcraft as it gets closer to the reveal of the second expansion, Midnight. It's not been stated as of yet when people can expect the release of the second expansion in the saga, but it's possible we'll see it at BlizzCon next year.</p>

Especially in gaming where technological progress and innovation moves at breakneck speed relative to other mediums, playing something even just five or 10 years after it released can dramatically alter its impact.

I was there before they became buried beneath massive open worlds, 4K textures, and cinematic storytelling. It is both my <em>Citizen Kane</em> and my Rosebud. </p><p>The shortest version of the tale <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://medium.com/insert-cartridge/timeless-the-history-of-chrono-trigger-375ce25b481e&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://medium.com/insert-cartridge/timeless-the-history-of-chrono-trigger-375ce25b481e" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">of the game’s legendary development</a></span> is this. Talent from the two biggest Japanese RPG franchises in the 90s—<em>Final Fantasy</em> and <em>Dragon Quest</em>—got together to make a cutting-edge mashup for the SNES that would break new ground on multiple fronts. <em>Dragon Ball </em>creator Akira Toriyama made the art and Yuji Horii contributed to the writing while star developers from Square like Takashi Tokita, Yoshinori Kitase, and Kazuhiko Aoki directed and produced. <em>Final Fantasy </em>creator Hironobu Sakaguchi oversaw the project, while Yasunori Mitsuda composed the game’s unforgettable soundtrack.</p><figure id="" data-id="e243a3b0e631c8bcb1c1ed3ffb09eb5b" data-recommend-id="image://e243a3b0e631c8bcb1c1ed3ffb09eb5b" data-format="png" data-width="817" data-height="460" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Crono fights a robot dragon.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>For those who have never played <em>Chrono Trigger</em> before<em>,</em> its an epic, time-hopping adventure that weaves in and out of medieval fantasy and futuristic sci-fi as its characters fight to save the world from an extraterrestrial evil. In addition to time travel, there’s plenty of magic, and an emphasis on the ineffable will to persist that can only be derived from deep bonds of love and friendship. Events begin at the Millennial Fair, an event celebrating the 1000th anniversary of the founding of a kingdom called Guardia. It’s here that a science experiment gone awry opens up a portal to the past, sending the titular Chrono on a collision course with the apocalypse and beginning a quest whose twists and turns deftly dodge cliché and defy expectation. One minute you’re fighting a giant dinosaur dog, the next you’re in a floating kingdom in the sky. And at the end of it all is showdown with the alien Lavos in one of the most epic turn-based, multi-phase boss fights in the genre’s history.</p><p>The moments that resonated most with me when I was younger were the dramatic story beats and climactic battles. Very early on you save a princess, only to end up on trial for your deeds. The famous court scene spares no expense. An ominously front-lit judge oversees the proceedings with a massive stained glass sculpture behind him. Fellow citizens in the wings howl and grumble at each new accusation. But most ingeniously, the verdict ultimately hinges on random, innocent actions at the beginning of the game like whether you accidentally stole someone’s lunch or helped rescue a kitten. That you still inevitably go to jail whether  proclaimed guilty or not only serves to underline the injustice of the whole thing. It’s still a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.destructoid.com/chrono-triggers-trial-is-still-absolutely-brilliant/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.destructoid.com/chrono-triggers-trial-is-still-absolutely-brilliant/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">master class in video game storytelling</a></span>. </p><figure id="" data-id="6953e7b2dedba78b0f783830294d1d1f" data-recommend-id="image://6953e7b2dedba78b0f783830294d1d1f" data-format="png" data-width="817" data-height="499" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Chrono fights a big dinosaur.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Part of <em>Chrono Trigger</em>’s enduring legacy is that it’s full of moments like this. Your party becomes much more powerful after it learns to use elemental magic attacks that open up new multi-character combos. Those exact same attacks then get wielded against you in a fight against the evil wizard Magus, who’s been leading monsters in their war against humans. He has his own special boss music that includes the 16-bit version of someone laughing/wailing in the background. Only later do you learn that Magus is a temporal interloper from hundreds of years ago that accidentally got thrown through a time portal as a child because his mom became obsessed with harvesting magic from Lavos. He’s an asshole but you feel bad for him. He can even join your party later if you beat him in a one-on-one duel. This happens after Chrono dies and before you bring him back to life, unless you choose not to and beat the game without him, unlocking one of <em>Chrono Trigger</em>’s many hidden endings.</p><p>The lesson here is that things go off the rails very quickly in this game, and then they keep going farther and farther into unexpected, uncharted territory, but without ever crashing. <em>Chrono Trigger</em> never feels like a series of fetch quests or to-do lists stitched together while your real objective keeps taunting you from just over the horizon. Each time it pulls some wild shit that makes you think you know where things are going, it then pulls some more wild shit that points you in a completely different but equally evocative and compelling direction, and each time it’s totally earned and makes complete sense. All of it is conveyed with beautiful art, razor-sharp writing, and an immaculate score. </p><figure id="" data-id="60ce34b9be21410ef5996fcac286753b" data-recommend-id="image://60ce34b9be21410ef5996fcac286753b" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Chrono fights Magus.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As I get older, though, I find myself appreciating other aspects of <em>Chrono Trigger </em>even more: all of its little nuances, innovations, and details that make it still feel nimble, fresh, and unique even five console generations later. For instance, combat is turn-based but there are no random encounters. Everything smoothly transitions in the environment when exploration shifts to fighting, including the enemies who each have animated attacks rather than simply being static sprites. While some scenes are scripted, other dialogue flashes by as you explore, letting you freely move around even as some of the heaviest-hitting lines in the game are delivered.</p><p>Then there’s the time travel mechanic itself. While the story proceeds linearly until the endgame, the act of shifting eras is full of small nods to the past and future that make <em>Chrono Trigger</em> feel like an intricate, living world. That sensibility carries through in details ranging from special treasure chests that only offer the most powerful items when opened up as far in the future as possible to entire side-quests that change the future or reveal the past (I’ve spoiled a lot in this tribute but I’m not going to spoil those). And of course there’s the fact that <em>Chrono Trigger</em> was willing to kill its titular hero while also letting players try to beat Lavos less than halfway through the game. It turns out that being unburdened by the traditional hero’s journey feels incredibly liberating, even if you end up following through on it anyway. </p><p><em>Chrono Trigger</em> is one of those games that has a special magic all its own, one that fans keep waiting for someone else to recreate. Why hasn’t it ever happened? Even games that look the part like <em>Sea of Stars</em> are just echoes (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sea-of-stars-game-impressions-review-switch-jrpg-indie-1850854165?_gl=1*ofqq7j*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MTcyMDU4MS40OC4xLjE3NDE3MjA1OTQuNDcuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sea-of-stars-game-impressions-review-switch-jrpg-indie-1850854165?_gl=1*ofqq7j*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MTcyMDU4MS40OC4xLjE3NDE3MjA1OTQuNDcuMC4w">albeit great in their own right</a></span>). There are all sorts of theories one could posit, including the possibility that my rose-tinted Coke bottle glasses are obscuring my vision of the past. But my own guess is that recreating the result of a group of masters collaborating together in a small team and developing for great hardware they were intimately familiar with is next to impossible. You can’t manufacture the past, and while we’ll keep getting plenty of games that are as good as or better than <em>Chrono Trigger</em>, we’ll never get its peak fusion of tech, art, and design again. And 30 years later, I still can’t believe how good it is. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>At time of writing, less than a week after the game’s March 6th release, there are 13 playable Lancers in FragPunk. The variety in Lancers means there’s a character for every playstyle, but some are simply stronger than others. Here are the best Lancers in the FragPunk roster right now.</p>

<h2 id="h-best-fragpunk-lancers">Best FragPunk Lancers</h2>



<h3 id="h-hollowpoint">Hollowpoint</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Hollowpoint excels at gathering info and holding angles. Her railgun, Meteora, is a single-shot sniper rifle that deals maximum damage after a short charge, and it also recharges ammunition over time. Paparazzi is a trap that automatically attaches to and reveals enemy players, making it super useful when defending sites or catching flankers.</p>



<p>Smoke Screen is a slow-moving source of cover that blocks off wide angles and highlights enemies hit by it. It can be stopped manually as well to close off a chokepoint, and it can go through walls to reveal unsuspecting enemies.</p>



<h3 id="h-pathojen">Pathojen</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Pathojen is the perfect support Lancer, providing healing to the whole team plus abilities that can hinder attacker plants and defender retakes. Her Emotional Rescue ability is a wide area-of-effect healing ability that heals everyone in range. If your team took damage getting into the site, they can all huddle together and heal before the opposing retake try occurs.</p>



<p>Pathojen can also throw down her Killer Queen trap, which deals damage over time to enemy players after it is triggered or activated manually. Finally, her Shroom Wall can block the enemies from rushing into site or pulling off a quick flank.</p>



<h3 id="h-broker">Broker</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Broker is the very first Lancer you get to play, via the tutorial, but he’s one you should consider sticking with. His most prolific ability is Goddard’s Vengeance, an easy to use but explosive rocket launcher that deals massive damage.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cherry Bomb is a very useful ability as well, as it creates a cluster of energy bombs that will pretty much vaporize anyone who touches them. They’re easy to spot and destroy, but even doing so will give Broker players information about where the enemy is coming from. Finally, his Smokestack Lightning ability creates a huge wall of smoke that can provide extensive cover for his whole team.</p>



<h3 id="h-corona">Corona</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>If you’re a fan of the duelist class of agents in VALORANT, then Corona is the perfect Lancer for you. Fast Lane, while ironically sharing the name of a Neon ability from Riot’s shooter, is more like Jett’s Dash. Corona can use Fast Lane to dash forwards or upwards, allowing him to get to cover and take space.</p>



<p>Ashes to Ashes is a powerful molotov-like throwable that damages enemies caught in it, but it also provides Corona with damage reduction and a speed boost. In a pinch, Corona can use it on himself to give him the edge in a firefight. Finally, Corona can use Hothead to blind all enemies looking at him after a short charge. This flash ability is so unique compared to traditional thrown blinding abilities that you’re certain to catch numerous enemy players off guard.</p>

      <div><p><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a> Head Designer Mark Rosewater has shared a new sneak peek at the latest set. The Tarkir: Dragonstorm teaser contains a glimpse at creatures, text, and mechanics found in the upcoming set, allowing fans to speculate on potential combos and synergies.</p>



<p>As usual, the <em>Tarkir: Dragonstorm</em> teaser was dropped on Mark Rosewater's official <a href="https://markrosewater.tumblr.com/post/777738754267955200/maros-tarkir-dragonstorm-teaser" rel="nofollow">Tumblr page</a>. Like all prior teasers like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/unfinity-teaser-shared-by-mark-rosewater" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Unfinity</em></a> or <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/mark-rosewater-shares-brothers-war-teaser" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>The Brothers' War</em></a>, Rosewater's teaser only provides small bits of information. No full explanations or names are given away here.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tarkir-dragonstorm-inevitable-defeat-card-artwork.jpg?itok=QyjxsQGw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tarkir-dragonstorm-inevitable-defeat-card-artwork.jpg?itok=wACl-Gxo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The first part of Rosewater's tease contains the following quotes:</p>

<ul><li>A cycle of Dragonstorm enchantments</li>
	<li>Two planeswalkers</li>
	<li>Some counters in the set: decayed, lifelink, and time</li>
	<li>A card that can tutor for one of two other cards</li>
	<li>A legendary enchantment</li>
	<li>A Hydra that uses a clan keyword</li>
	<li>A common archetype theme gets an ability word</li>
	<li>An instant the generates five effects</li>
	<li>Dragons get a new typal enchantment based on a popular Zombie one</li>
	<li>A new instant and sorcery subtype</li>
</ul><p>The first part of the Tarkir: Dragonstorm teaser has some intriguing tidbits. First, this set will be getting two new Planeswalkers. Usually, a new set only contains one. New instant and sorcery subtypes are rare additions, which is gripping.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In addition, the reintroduction of decayed tokens are fascinating since they're usually seen on zombies from the Innistrad set. Time was used in a similar context in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/doctor-who-commander-decks-will-have-50-new-cards-each" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Doctor Who</em> Commander</a> decks.</p>

<p>The second part of the <em>Tarkir: Dragonstorm</em> teaser are bits of rule text. They are as follows:</p>

<ul><li>“Whenever you cast a Turtle spell, untap this creature.”</li>
	<li>“As long as there are three or more different kinds of counters among creatures you control,”</li>
	<li>“You may cast it without paying its mana cost if that spell’s mana value is 8 or less.”</li>
	<li>“If you put +1/+1 counters on five Dragons this way, you win the game.”</li>
	<li>“Whenever a creature you control enters, if you cast it, destroy that creature”</li>
	<li>“At the beginning of combat on your turn, if you’ve case both a creature spell and a noncreature spell this turn,”</li>
	<li>“Then if creatures you control have total toughness 20 or greater,”</li>
	<li>“During your end step, Warrior tokens you control have ‘This token can’t be sacrificed.’”</li>
	<li>“Whenever this creature deals combat damage to a player, you may search your library for a card named &lt;CARDNAME&gt;, reveal it, put it into your hand, then shuffle.”</li>
	<li>“Spells you cast have delve.”</li>
</ul><p>&nbsp;The rules text holds a lot of gripping possibilities. First, there is the introduction of a new alternative win condition. Second is the return of the Delve mechanic, which allows you to reduce the cost of cards by exiling cards from your graveyard.</p>

They are as follows:</p>

<ul><li>Creature – Dog Monk</li>
	<li>Creature – Elephant Druid</li>
	<li>Creature – Yeti</li>
	<li>Creature – Djinn Cleric</li>
	<li>Creature – Zombie Advisor</li>
	<li>Creature – Kirin</li>
	<li>Creature – Snake Shapeshifter</li>
	<li>Artifact Creature – Chimera</li>
	<li>Artifact Creature – Ape Snake</li>
	<li>Legendary Creature – Zombie Snake Warlock</li>
	<li>All-Out Assault</li>
	<li>Cruel Truths</li>
	<li>Desperate Measures</li>
	<li>Dragonologist</li>
	<li>Hundred-Battle Veteran</li>
	<li>Lightfoot Technique</li>
	<li>Rescue Leopard</li>
	<li>Seize Opportunity</li>
	<li>Stillness in Motion</li>
	<li>War Effort</li>
</ul><p>&nbsp;This may be the lightest in terms of gameplay or lore implications, but the text is evocative and imaginative. Zombie Advisor and Zombie Snake Warlock stand out considerably. The name Dragonologist also makes sense given the new set's focus on dragons.</p>

That's thanks to <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-hardware-report-project-keenan-next-gen-xbox-2027">a Windows Central report</a> that Microsoft is planning to partner with a "PC gaming OEM" for "an Xbox-branded gaming handheld" to be released later this year. The device, code-named Keenan, will reportedly feature "Xbox design sensibilities," such as the branded Xbox guide button, but will almost certainly be a PC gaming device running Windows at its core.</p>
<p>Any Microsoft entry into the world of gaming handhelds will join a market that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/01/why-more-pc-gaming-handhelds-should-ditch-windows-for-steamos/">has</a> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/08/asus-rog-ally-x-review-better-performance-and-feel-in-a-pricey-package/">become</a> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/09/lenovo-legion-go-suggests-gaming-portables-arent-big-enough-need-a-mouse/">quite</a> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/09/are-android-based-game-streaming-handhelds-a-fad-or-are-they-the-future/">crowded</a> in the wake of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/07/html-holes-provide-a-glimpse-of-steam-decks-initial-preorder-numbers/">the Steam Deck's success</a>. To make its own portable gaming effort stand apart, Microsoft will have to bring something unique to the table. Here are some of the features we're hoping will let Microsoft do just that.</p>
<h2>A bespoke user interface</h2>

<p>For decades, Windows has been designed first and foremost for the world of large monitors driven by a mouse and keyboard world. When hardware makers try to simply stick that OS into a handheld screen size controlled by buttons and analog sticks, the results <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/08/asus-rog-ally-x-review-better-performance-and-feel-in-a-pricey-package/">can be awkward at best</a>.</p>
<p>To be worthy of the Xbox brand, Microsoft needs to design a front-end that is built from the ground up for handheld use case. That means large, easy-to-read design elements that can be easily navigated and selected without a mouse. It also means following SteamOS's example in surfacing the settings and tools most important to gamers.</p>
<p>Microsoft's years of experience building elegant controller-driven interfaces for the Xbox console line should give the company a leg up in building a similar interface on top of Windows. Thus far, though, Microsoft has shown no interest in re-creating that console-like interface through <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/08/xbox-on-windows-10-what-it-is-what-it-isnt-and-whats-missing/">the Windows Xbox app</a>. Here's hoping <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/7/23862655/microsoft-xbox-handheld-editorial-steam-deck">previous reports</a> that Microsoft is working on a "lightweight version" of the Xbox user interface for handheld gaming end up panning out.</p>

<p>While Windows has been the premier PC gaming operating system for a while now, the operating system as a whole is obviously <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/10/eleven-things-to-know-about-in-the-windows-11-2024-update/">designed for much more than gaming</a>. For a gaming-focused handheld, Microsoft needs to make a version of the operating system that's streamlined to focus on the tools and features game makers and players need without all the bloat associated with ones they don't.</p>
<p>The 2017 introduction of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/03/how-game-mode-will-make-games-run-better-on-windows/">Windows Game Mode</a> was a step in the right direction here, turning off unnecessary background processes and focusing CPU and memory resources on the game in question. And Microsoft's Xbox consoles have <a href="https://betawiki.net/wiki/Windows_Core_OS">long been built off a Windows core</a>, showing how the PC OS can be modified for gaming purposes.</p>
<p>For a dedicated gaming handheld, though, Microsoft should go even further and craft a miniature version of Windows that's laser-focused on running one game at a time on specific portable hardware. Besides streamlining performance, reducing OS overhead, and improving battery life, such a move would mean portable Xbox gamers won't have to worry about automatic printer driver updates or a bunch of mysterious background tasks clogging up their processor.</p>

<h2>More than just Xbox</h2>

<p>Any Xbox-branded portable gaming system will obviously integrate deeply with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/08/xbox-on-windows-10-what-it-is-what-it-isnt-and-whats-missing/">Microsoft's existing Windows Xbox App</a>. But it would be a mistake for Microsoft to restrict the hardware to that Microsoft-controlled platform. Players should be able to install games from competitors like Steam, the Epic Games Store, GoG, and others on their Xbox-branded handheld, even if that doesn't necessarily align with the branding.</p>
<p>This kind of functionality doesn't have to be front and center in the portable's streamlined UI; Microsoft could hide these features behind a special system option, a la <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/02/linux-on-steam-deck-what-you-need-to-know-what-currently-works/">the Steam Deck's Linux desktop mode</a>. But power users who don't want to limit themselves to Microsoft's online store will need to be able to treat their Xbox handheld like any other Windows device if they so choose.</p>

<p>Microsoft has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/06/microsoft-reveals-first-details-on-project-scarlett-game-console-for-2020/">made a lot of hay</a> over the way recent Xbox consoles can play games dating all the way back to the original Xbox. If Microsoft wants to set its first gaming handheld apart, it should make those old console games officially available on a Windows-based system for the first time.</p>
<p>The ability to download previous console games dating back to the Xbox 360 era (or beyond) would be an instant "system seller" feature for any portable Xbox. While this wouldn't be a trivial technical lift on Microsoft's part, the same <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2017-xbox-one-x-back-compat-how-does-it-actually-work">emulation layer that powers Xbox console backward compatibility</a> could surely be ported to Windows with a little bit of work. That process might be easier with a specific branded portable, too, since Microsoft would be working with full knowledge of what hardware was being used.</p>
<p>If Microsoft can give us a way to play <em>Geometry Wars 2</em> on the go without having to deal with finicky third-party emulators, we'll be eternally grateful.</p>

<p>On the console side, Microsoft's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/11/xbox-series-x-s-review-beautiful-powerful-but-whatcha-gonna-play/">split simultaneous release of the Xbox Series S and X</a> showed an understanding that not everyone wants to pay more money for the most powerful possible gaming hardware. Microsoft should extend this philosophy to gaming handhelds by releasing different tiers of portable Xbox hardware for price-conscious consumers.</p>
<p>Raw hardware power is the most obvious differentiator that could set a more expensive tier of Xbox portables apart from any cheaper options. But Microsoft could also offer portable options that reduce the overall bulk (a la the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/09/nintendo-switch-lite-is-the-best-portable-system-nintendo-has-ever-made/">Nintendo Switch Lite</a>) or offer relative improvements in screen size and quality (a la <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/11/review-steam-deck-oleds-brilliant-screen-fixes-the-portables-biggest-flaw/">the Steam Deck OLED</a> and Switch OLED).</p>

<p>One of the best things about console gaming is that you can be confident any game you buy for a console will "just work" with your hardware. In the world of PC gaming handhelds, Valve has tried to replicate this with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/10/valves-deck-verified-badge-will-show-which-games-run-well-on-steam-deck/">the "Deck Verified" program</a> to highlight Steam games that are guaranteed to work in a portable setting.</p>
<p>Microsoft is well-positioned to work with game publishers to launch a similar program for its own Xbox-branded portable. There's real value in offering gamers assurances that "Made for Xbox" PC games will "just work" on their Xbox-branded handheld.</p>
<p>This kind of verification system could also help simplify and clarify hardware requirements across different tiers of portable hardware power; any handheld marketed as "level 2" could play any games marketed as level 2 or below, for instance.</p>

                <p>Unlike some of the other characters in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/marvel-rivals-review-i-can-do-this-all-day/1900-6418329/" data-ref-id="1900-6418329">Marvel Rivals</a>, Adam Warlock doesn't have a wide variety of looks to choose from. But starting later this week, players will get a chance to pick up a free Adam Warlock costume as part of Marvel Rivals' latest Twitch drop.</p><p>Starting on March 13 at 7 PM PT / 10 PM ET, fans who watch some of their favorite Marvel Rivals-affiliated players on Twitch can earn up to three rewards. Watching for 30 minutes will give them an Adam Warlock Will of Galacta spray, while staying for one hour will unlock an Adam Warlock Will of Galacta nameplate. But to get the costume, players will have to watch for four hours.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4457849-marvelrivalsadamwarlockthewillofgalacta.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4457849" data-ratio="0.56230769230769" data-width="1300" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4457849-marvelrivalsadamwarlockthewillofgalacta.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4457849"></a><figcaption>Adam Warlock's Will of Galacta costume.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4457849-marvelrivalsadamwarlockthewillofgalacta.jpg"></figure><p>Magneto and Hela have previously received Will of Galactca costumes that incorporate elements of her look into theirs. It seems likely that Warlock won't be the last one, especially since Hela and Magneto's costumes were also released as Twitch drops. Judging from the pic above, purple may turn out to be a good look for Warlock. But players will only be able to get him in that outfit through April 3 at 7pm PM PT / 10 PM ET.</p><p>NetEase has released a new Marvel Rivals patch that introduced a new LTM called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-marvel-rivals-patch-notes-introduce-clone-rumble-ltm-new-event-and-tons-of-bug-fixes/1100-6529942/" data-ref-id="1100-6529942">Clone Rumble</a>, which lets players pick the same characters for often-chaotic results.

But given the game's meteoric popularity, keeping the Marvel heroes intact appears to have been the right call.</p>

                <p>It's a tradition for MLB The Show to add baseball legends to the game, and this year's title is no exception. Sony and San Diego Studio have unveiled some of the biggest names heading to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mlb-the-show-25-limited-edition-is-up-for-preorder-includes-topps-baseball-card/1100-6529227/" data-ref-id="1100-6529227">MLB The Show 25</a>, including one of the greatest hitters of all time, Ted Williams.</p><p>Williams has appeared in previous installments of MLB The Show, but this marks his return after many years away. Williams will be joined by over 200 legends, including returning players Babe Ruth, Jackie Robinson, Satchel Paige, Ken Griffey Jr., and Derek Jeter. Some of the new additions include Roger Clemens and Manny Ramirez, as well as Negro Leagues legends Wilber “Bullet Joe” Rogan and James “Cool Papa” Bell. The trailer below briefly shows some of these stars in action.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGo1-jn6VUY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/pGo1-jn6VUY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>As seen in the trailer, some of the other legends featured include Jose Bautista, Jason Kipnis, Lance Berkman, Bobby Abreu, Gil Hodges, Jason Varitek, Darren O’Day, Don Baylor, Bobby Grich, Jim Kaat, Ted Simmons, Preston Wilson, Reggie Sanders, and Hank Greenberg.</p><p>MLB The Show 25 will also continue its look at the past with The Negro Leagues - Season 3, which revisits an era when Black players weren't allowed to take part in Major League Baseball. Some truly great players emerged from that period, and the season mode will incorporate Negro Leagues legends through gameplay, historic footage, and "informative storytelling" from Negro Leagues Baseball Museum president Bob Kendrick. All of the Negro Leagues players from the first two seasons will be available at launch.</p><p>Unfortunately for PS4 and Xbox One players, MLB The Show 25 will be skipping those platforms and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mlb-the-show-25-launches-in-march-but-wont-be-on-game-pass-this-year/1100-6529072/" data-ref-id="1100-6529072">it won't be on Game Pass this year</a>. However, it will be heading to Nintendo Switch, Xbox Series X|S, and PlayStation 5 on March 18. Players who purchase the Digital Deluxe Edition will get early access to the game on March 14.</p>
