		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> is dropping onto <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PlayStation 5</a> this week, meaning that a whole tranche of new gamers are able to experience one of the best games of last year. And with the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps5-pro">PlayStation 5 Pro</a> being officially the very best and most powerful games console out there, we had to put this game through its paces on Sony’s platforms.</p>
<p>Even with Bethesda’s pre-2023 history as a major third party publisher, it’s still a strange feeling for what is now a Microsoft-owned company to be releasing its games on Xbox’s biggest rival platform. Even more strange feeling is that these ports to PS5 Pro are going to outshine Xbox Series X.</p>
<p>The question for Indiana Jones and any of these other game, though, is how much better is it going to be? How much more fully featured is this game on PS5 Pro?</p>
<p><iframe title="Indiana Jones and the Great Circle – PS5 Pro vs. PS5, XSX &amp; PC" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3JFAhr3T3MA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Well… actually it’s not all <em>that</em> different. if you’re looking for the very best graphics and the most expansive set of ray tracing features to switch on, then you’re still going to need a high-end PC and a very expensive GPU in particular.</p>

<p>MachineGames created an exceptional technical showcase with Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. Using a heavily customised branch of the idTech engine, this game targeted 60fps on Xbox Series X, while still pushing for a typical 1800p (albeit with dynamic resolution scaling) and incorporating ray traced global illumination throughout. This uses ray tracing to bounce light through environments and realistically transfer colour and shade throughout. It absolutely pulled it off, and looks simply superb a lot of the time, with more naturalistic interior lighting in particular.</p>
<p>However, in order to get that performance, MachineGames made a number of cuts, taking some effects down to below what even Low is on PC, and making compromises for the game in general. Without any graphics options for performance modes or resolution modes, even an equivalently specced PC could get more visual fidelity at a lower resolution than console, regardless of whether you enable more ray traced features or not.</p>
<p>With this PlayStation port, it seems that base PS5 has pretty much identical visual targets to the Xbox Series X, including resolution windows and that pretty locked 60fps. PS5 Pro, however, pushes that up to a full 4K, a native 2160p target, still with 60fps. That might not sound like the biggest jump in resolution, but achieving a native 4K does add roughly half the pixels again, or more, depending on dynamic scaling on the lower consoles.</p>

		</div>

<p>Compared to the original launch last December, Machine Games has been able to turn up the wick for the quality of the global illumination on consoles –&nbsp;the latest update for the game last week also brought RTGI improvements to aid ambient occlusion and contact shadows. If there’s any further push for PS5 Pro, then the different is marginal at best.</p>
<p>And… well that’s about it. The PS5 Pro is a little bit better than Xbox Series X and PS5, but for most people, you’re going to get an equivalent experience, just at lower resolution.</p>
<p>In other words PS5 Pro still has the most noticeable limitations of the game on console. In particular, the rasterised sun shadows are noticeably blocky even at their highest quality when close to the player camera, and there’s a very sharp cascade stepping as you walk through environments where long shadows have been cast, which is in contrast to the much smoother fade that you can get on PC without path traced sun shadowing.</p>
<p>And enabling sun shadows does have a huge impact to the look of the game on PC, giving much more softness as you get further away from window frames and other obstructions.</p>

				<dd id="gallery-2-458912">

		</div>

<p>That does, however, come at a very steep cost. Enabling just this one additional ray tracing feature on our PC tanked the dynamic resolution to try and keep up. I’ve got a Radeon 6800 currently, which is far short of the minimum recommended GPU for turning on path tracing, the GeForce RTX 4070. Even then, that is only expected to hit 1080p with 60fps.</p>
<p>So perhaps this is beyond what the PS5 Pro can comfortably manage without making further compromises, but it’s still a shame that MachineGames weren’t able to extract more from the PS5 Pro.</p>
<p>It is also worth noting that, even with a handful of significant updates to the game since launch, there are still a handful of relatively minor bugs. Things like tutorial pop ups that don’t quite keep up with what you’re doing, showing irrelevant information, and some visual artifacting at distance, such as with flickering window panes or some odd black boxes in the sky. They’re few and far between, and hopefully noted for further updates to this game.</p>

<p>All in all, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/06/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review/">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is still a damn fine game</a>, and this relative closeness just means that owners of the base PS5 are missing out on very little compared to the PS5 Pro.</p>

			<p>Nintendo Switch 2 pre-orders in Canada should start next week, according to a very reliable leaker.</p>
<p>Earlier today, known leaker <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/billbil-kun.bsky.social" target="_blank" rel="noopener">billbil-kun</a> revealed that from what they can see through some Canadian retailers, pre-orders for the next-generation Nintendo console and bundles launching this June will start next week, on April 23rd. Unfortunately, the leaker couldn't confirm if pre-orders in the United States will also begin next week.</p>

<p>⚠️ Date subject to change. Can't confirm if it's the same for US</p>
<p>I'll keep you updated if it changes</p>

<p>Nintendo Switch 2 pre-orders in the whole of North America were supposed to start last week, but they were ultimately delayed in the United States first to <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-order-not-april-9th-tariffs/">assess the potential impact of tariffs</a>. Pre-orders in Canada were later delayed in order to <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-have-been-delayed-in-canada-thanks-to-us-tariffs/">align with the timing of pre-orders in the US</a>, so there's a good chance that those living in the United States may be able to pre-order the console next week if pre-orders in Canada will indeed begin on April 23rd.</p>
<p>If the current situation doesn't change, there's little doubt that the tariffs will impact the Nintendo Switch 2 price, although it is not yet known in which capacity. An internal assessment memo from a major Apple and Nintendo supplier seen by Nikkei Asia suggests that the console is in<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-increase-us/"> line for a significant price increase</a> as long as game consoles made in China will be subject to a 145% tariff in the United States. The PlayStation 5 could also see a price increase in the United States due to the tariffs, a price increase that would follow the one announced for the United Kingdom, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-price-increased/">this week.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-major-baldurs-gate-3-update-patch-notes<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It's the end of an era. Larian Studios has released the final major&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3&nbsp;</em>update, and there's plenty in it to tide you over until the studio's next release, including crossplay, a photo mode, and more.</p>

<p>Patch 8 follows on from the last major numbered patch, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-patch-notes" rel="nofollow">September's Patch 7</a>. While it'll serve as the final major patch for the hugely popular CRPG, Larian does say it will continue to support&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3&nbsp;</em>with "minor bug fixing".</p>

<p>Larian says that it has "told [its] stories the way [it] needed to tell them" with&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3</em>, and that it's "time for the team to go back to our cave and hang the armor on the wall" in order to focus on the next Larian game.</p>

Cross-platform progression has also been added, so you can pick up where you left off on PC or console.</p>

<p>If you're looking to play with mods, then you and your fellow players must have the same version of the mods in question installed. Some mods aren't available across all platforms, so make sure you're using compatible mods.</p>

<p>A photo mode has also been added to&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3</em>, allowing you to "position and pose your party, play around with camera settings, and whack a few stickers on there" in order to create your very own bespoke&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3&nbsp;</em>screenshots.</p>

<p>In order to celebrate the release of Patch 8,&nbsp;Larian has created a new animated short in conjunction with Spud Gun Studios, and you can check that short out here. Just make sure to have a tissue handy to dry your tears.</p>




<p>You can check out the full patch notes for&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3&nbsp;</em>Patch 8 right here.

It turns out you won't actually be spicing up your life next month, as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/funcom">Funcom</a> have announced that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a> is getting a delay. The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">survival</a> MMO was originally supposed to be launching this coming May 20th, but a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1172710/view/503947989263320421">Steam post</a> was shared today sharing that its release date has been pushed to June 10th. Those that have the deluxe or ultimate edition on order will still be able to play it a few days earlier, now June 5th.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Funcom explained that they came to this decision through feedback they've received from beta testers. On the flipside of things, there is some good news: a "large-scale weekend" is now planned for next month where "even more of you will get the opportunity to play the game and share your feedback." Though, hopefully this round of feedback won't delay the game further - can only imagine how much the devs will have to crunch with only three extra weeks! There's no further details about this beta just yet, but apparently they'll be coming soon.
</p>
<p>
Dune: Awakening had originally been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dune-awakening-will-burst-out-of-the-early-access-sands-in-early-2025">scheduled for sometime in "early 2025"</a>, but as with many games these days, plans change. I'm not sure if June counts as early any more, at least it's still technically in the first half of the year.
</p>
<p>
Right around this piece is likely to have gone live Funcom are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0KqiqdiBZ0&amp;ab_channel=Funcom">holding a livestream</a> showing off the game's combat, which seems like a good way to get a better feel for the game ahead of its new June release date.

The game jumps between two alternating timelines–July 1995, when Swann forges bonds with Autumn, Nora, and Kat, forms the titular punk rock band with them and documents life in Velvet Cove, and November 2022, when she’s in her early 40s and meets up with two of the girls at a bar to reminisce their teenage years while catching up on each other’s lives since that fateful summer.</p><p>If you’re mostly going to be invested in the dramatic story for the first half of <em>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage</em>, <strong>expect to log in six hours of your time</strong>.

Images from the game were found in the website files of the developer Virtuous before being removed. The images, which <a href="https://imgur.com/a/oblivion-remake-OUg7kXu">can still be seen on the hosting site imgur</a>, included several side-by-side comparisons between the game’s 2006 release and the remaster. Several photos show off the remaster’s environment including one featuring an Oblivion Gate. There is also an updated version of the game’s iconic fire-wreathed logo and box art including one for a deluxe edition for the remaster.</p><p>Rumors of an <em>Oblivion </em>remaster <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/19/23880132/microsoft-ftc-documents-leak-oblivion-fallout-3-remaster-doom-xbox">cropped up in 2023</a>, revealed in documents pertaining to the Federal Trade Commission’s case against Microsoft. Those documents were a part of a Microsoft presentation on its then pending acquisition of Zeni-Max studios <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22319124/microsoft-bethesda-acquisition-complete-finalized">which the company bought in 2021 for $7.5 billion dollars</a>. Other games from that presentation included a <em>Fallout 3</em> remaster, another game in the <em>Dishonored</em> franchise, and something known as <em>Doom Year Zero</em> which very much sounds like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/24349379/doom-the-dark-ages-release-date-trailer-xbox-pc-ps5"><em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em> which launches in May</a>.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/24/24351055/xbox-game-pass-releases-2025-notepad">reporting from <em>The Verge</em>’s Tom Warren</a>, Microsoft planned to release the remaster some time late spring or early summer. Journalist and insider Jeff Grubb similarly reports that Microsoft intended to <a href="https://x.com/Mr_Rebs_/status/1911973248532635942">stealth release the game sometime next week</a>. The leak of these images may impact Microsoft’s timeline but it seems at least the <em>Oblivion</em> remaster is real and it’s coming soon. As for <em>Elder Scrolls VI</em>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/10/17447808/elder-scrolls-6-announcement-reveal-bethesda-e3-2018">announced almost seven years ago now</a> with no significant updates since, who knows.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Goethe’s <em>The Sorrows of Young Werther</em> was blamed for a string of suicides, with little to no evidence, the moral panic itself far more likely the cause.</p><p>In 370 BCE, Plato writing Socrates’ words in <em>Phaedrus</em> took the helm of another moral panic. He wrote, “This invention will produce forgetfulness in the minds of those who learn to use it, because they will not practice their memory.” Socrates was talking about the act of <em>writing</em>.</p><p>The concern that the new thing the kids are into is causing society’s ills is as old as society itself, and it has long served a very specific purpose: to distract from the far more obvious causes.</p><figure id="" data-id="a7d4555d543b09c30ca9cae7ee8ab51e" data-recommend-id="image://a7d4555d543b09c30ca9cae7ee8ab51e" data-format="jpg" data-width="870" data-height="370" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Two Victorian ladies suffering through the act of reading." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Two Victorian ladies suffering through the act of reading." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Canterbury School of Humanities</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a7d4555d543b09c30ca9cae7ee8ab51e" data-recommend-id="image://a7d4555d543b09c30ca9cae7ee8ab51e" data-format="jpg" data-width="870" data-height="370" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Two Victorian ladies suffering through the act of reading." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There are very many examples of how video games are used as scapegoats for far more serious, fundamental causes of issues. But generally, the same purpose applies: it’s misdirection. The politician’s one hand is frantically waving around over here, gesticulating about the harm these games are doing to our youth, while the other hand is quietly passing an unseen wad of cash to a rich chum.</p><p>When Mike Johnson drops in his line about young men requiring Medicaid support because they’re “playing video games all day,” this is a very deliberate act of misdirection. In his speech, he even suggests that this act by these dastardly fellows is taking money away from the deserving recipients of…access to healthcare, single mothers, the elderly, and the disabled. See, video games are not only hurting these foolish men, but also indirectly causing suffering toward other groups you care about! Do not be in any doubt for a single moment that Johnson wouldn’t instantly turn on single mothers, the elderly, the disabled, or anyone else, if it were politically expedient for him, but in this example, he’s carefully chosen his specific misdirection.</p><p>Hell, let’s not lose sight of the fact that just one month ago, Mike Johnson trotted out the exact same line about “able-bodied” men mooching off the state with their games. Except that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.newsweek.com/mike-johnson-issues-medicaid-warning-2037182&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.newsweek.com/mike-johnson-issues-medicaid-warning-2037182" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">time it was as a part of his promises to <em>not</em> cut Medicaid</a></span>. And this is the same Mike Johnson who, in January this year, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/18/politics/house-remote-voting-new-moms-congress/index.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/18/politics/house-remote-voting-new-moms-congress/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tried to stop a bill</a></span> that would allow new mothers to remotely vote in the six weeks after they’ve given birth.

The point is, he doesn’t give a shit about single mothers and the awful effects video games are indirectly causing them.</p><p>What he—and the Trump administration at large—actually care about is ensuring their rich friends get richer, and if that involves nickel-and-diming the poorest, then perfect.

The fact that most of these apparently languorous men who play games all day are in fact in part- or full-time jobs, but are paid so badly that they cannot afford even the most basic healthcare, would seem like a systemic societal issue that should demand addressing. Something is fundamentally wrong when those who work the hardest are paid the least, and then it’s <em>those people</em> (including single mothers, the disabled, and every other category of the working poor) who are not only demonized, but targeted to have even more money taken from them. That’s an atrocity, but don’t notice! Look at the wavy hand pointing at the video games!</p><p>Or take the incessant blaming of video games (and all the other media that came before it) for real-world violence. Since <em>Doom</em> was co-blamed for the Columbine High School massacre, the scapegoating of gaming for violence and gun crimes in the United States has become commonplace.

The epidemic of school shootings, happening with a frequency and gruesome normality that’s utterly unlike any other developed nation, demands politicians deal with the reality of the lives of America’s young people in a way that is close to impossible without being decried as—boo, hiss—socialism.</p><figure id="" data-id="582ce8676035a1a6fcb76c3d43f8c31e" data-recommend-id="image://582ce8676035a1a6fcb76c3d43f8c31e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Four GTA Online characters running from a large fiery explosion." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Four GTA Online characters running from a large fiery explosion." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Rockstar</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="582ce8676035a1a6fcb76c3d43f8c31e" data-recommend-id="image://582ce8676035a1a6fcb76c3d43f8c31e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Four GTA Online characters running from a large fiery explosion." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>So, blame it on video games!

Video games are as political as any other form of media, and they can absolutely be used to attempt to spread harmful ideas or normalize bigotry. Just like cinema, theater, books, songs… We should absolutely always be thinking critically about the games we consume, and providing counterpoints when we disagree with messages. But despite this, and despite the vital importance of it, whenever the words “video games” are coming out of a politician’s mouth as a culprit for society’s ills, immediately redirect your eyes to see what their other hand is doing. Because there’s always something there they don’t want you to see, think of, or ask questions about.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Larian has bid a final farewell to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a>, its beloved breakout hit that won a legion of fans and propelled the studio to a new level of stardom.
</p>
<p>
Today, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3s-last-ever-major-update-gets-a-long-awaited-release-date">previously announced, marks the release of Patch 8</a> - the game's final content update. This adds PC, Mac, PlayStation and Xbox crossplay, a photo mode, a dozen more subclasses, plus <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3s-patch-8-adds-long-awaited-split-screen-co-op-for-xbox-series-s">the long-awaited arrival of Xbox Series S split-screen multiplayer</a>.
</p>
<p>
Larian has marked the patch's launch today in a fresh <a href="https://baldursgate3.game/news/the-final-patch-new-subclasses-photo-mode-and-cross-play_138">blog post</a>, which also includes a final animated short featuring the Baldur's Gate 3 cast going on one last adventure. There's even a special fourth wall-breaking cameo from Larian's own head honcho Swen Vincke, dressed in his suit of armour.

<p>
"You've helped us make BG3 a bigger success than any of us could've ever hoped for," Larian's blog post reads, "and that passion could keep us tweaking things and making changes until the end of time. But then we'd never be able to create something new. 
</p>
<p>
"As Swen said during the Baldur's Gate 3 retrospective panel at PAX West in August of last year, it's time for the team to go back to our cave and hang the armour on the wall while we focus on bringing you our next project."
</p>
<p>
What is Larian's next project? All we know officially is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larians-next-game-wont-be-a-baldurs-gate-3-sequel-dlc-or-anything-with-dungeons-dragons">the game will be unrelated to Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a>, something "big and ambitious" and "new in the sense that it is different from the things we've done before".
</p>
<p>
What about a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/baldurs-gate">Baldur's Gate</a> 4, then? Well, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wizards-of-the-coast-now-talking-to-lots-of-partners-about-next-baldurs-gate">D&amp;D owner Wizards of the Coast has said we may still get one of those too from another developer</a>, though it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hasbro-wants-baldurs-gate-4-but-isnt-in-a-hurry">wasn't "in a hurry" to rush it out</a>.

            <title><![CDATA[The Pitt Isn’t Just Another Anxiety-Inducing Medical Drama]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/the-pitt-hbo</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-pitt-isn%E2%80%99t-just-another-anxiety-inducing-medical-drama.1164819/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/the-pitt-hbo<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you’re searching for a TV show that masterfully delivers an emotional roller coaster across the full spectrum of human experience, look no further than <em>The Pitt</em>. The HBO show, helmed by executive producers R. Scott Gemmill (<em>ER</em>) and John Wells (<em>The West Wing, Shameless</em>), is an original drama that dives headfirst into the chaotic lives of underpaid and overstressed doctors and nurses, posing the question: Why do they put up with our bullshit?&nbsp;</p><p>While the collective answer often lies in the characters’ unwavering dedication to serving their community and using their skills and fancy degrees for good, the show doesn’t shy away from testing the limits of their patience and perseverance. From putting on a people face to crashing out in the bathroom, the series captures the unrelenting intensity of what could be just another day on the job that’ll remind you of the last time work made you want to rip your hair out.&nbsp;</p><p>The show, which spans fifteen hour-long episodes and has already gotten a <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/02/the-pitt-renewed-second-season-max-1236289824/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">second season</a> that’ll take place in the medical nightmare holiday that is <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/pittsburgh/news/allegheny-county-demonstration-offers-4th-of-july-celebrators-ways-to-stay-safe-when-setting-off-fireworks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Fourth of July</a>, cleverly delves into the relentless challenges of an emergency room staffer’s shift. Each episode title is a timestamp marking an hour within the fictional Pittsburgh Trauma Medical Center, where four rookie medical students are baptised by fire. While it may seem like another medical drama amidst a sea of anxiety-inducing <a href="https://aftermath.site/apple-cider-vinegar-common-side-effects" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">conspiratorial shows</a> in vogue this year, <em>The Pitt</em> stands out with its raw, heartfelt sincerity. In layman’s terms, it's the <a href="https://aftermath.site/look-back-gkids-tatsuki-fujimoto" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">medical version of <em>Look Back</em></a>. It’s the kind of show that inspires viewers to live with greater passion and cultivate a more profound empathy for those around them.&nbsp;</p><p>First and foremost, <em>The Pitt</em> has DILFs with receding hairlines, massive arms, and even bigger hearts with Dr. Michael Robinavitch (Noah Wyle) and his work husband, Dr. Jack Abbott (Shawn Hatosy). Their undeniable dad energy–holding down the fort, disciplining their work kids, and encouraging them even when they’re doing procedural no-no’s–is a powderkeg for AO3 fanfiction. (As of the time of writing, the pair have amassed 116 works, <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works?work_search%5Bsort_column%5D=revised_at&amp;include_work_search%5Bcharacter_ids%5D%5B%5D=123435199&amp;include_work_search%5Bcharacter_ids%5D%5B%5D=127115035&amp;work_search%5Bother_tag_names%5D=&amp;work_search%5Bexcluded_tag_names%5D=&amp;work_search%5Bcrossover%5D=&amp;work_search%5Bcomplete%5D=&amp;work_search%5Bwords_from%5D=&amp;work_search%5Bwords_to%5D=&amp;work_search%5Bdate_from%5D=&amp;work_search%5Bdate_to%5D=&amp;work_search%5Bquery%5D=&amp;work_search%5Blanguage_id%5D=&amp;commit=Sort+and+Filter&amp;tag_id=The+Pitt+%28TV%29" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">you’re welcome</a>). If sexualizing old men isn’t your thing, the show also has smooth-faced twinks in Patrick Ball’s Dr. Frank Langdon, who I’d best describe as a <em>Pokémon</em> evolution of John Mullaney; a mean girl™ medical intern who is desperate to complete her chest tube dailies like a gacha game player; a neurodivergent medical student with Princess Diana-levels of compassion; and a doctor-in-training amid a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad day being a human splash guard for fluids of every imaginable origin.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="The Pitt | Official Trailer | Max" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ufR_08V38sQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><em>The Pitt</em> also, miraculously, finds time for romance. You know that moment where you consider flirting with a nurse, but your conscience mercifully steps in to save you from utterly humiliating yourself as the poor dude just tries to do his job? Well, <em>The Pitt</em> introduces us to a medical student completely untethered by such inhibitions, rake-stepping into every encounter with her senpai. Meanwhile, her tiger mom hovers menacingly in the background, like a QTE prompt come to life.&nbsp;</p><p>The show also boasts jaw-dropping practical effects that’ll have you squirming on your couch, while the meal you foolishly decided to prepare before pressing play will sit neglected as medically intense — and technically sound — scenes of chaos flash across your TV screen<em>.</em> Much of this isn’t for the faint of heart; I had to nope out of the show a handful of times when “degloving,” cockroaches in ears, and makeshift eye surgeries became the new medical emergency for the pit crew to solve.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>And while there’s no shortage of medical misadventures, <em>The Pitt</em> finds room for gallows and situational humor too—be it Home Depot BBLs gone disastrously wrong, toddlers slumped on gummies, or teenagers trying to dodge the embarrassment of testicular torsion. It even has “gamba” (gambling for the terminally online), with staff placing DraftKings-style bets on the outcome of a stolen ambulance. The show boasts a unique open-kitchen operating room layout, giving distraught families front-row seats to watch their loved ones pop open like a car in an auto shop.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite its hour-long format, <em>The Pitt</em> flies by thanks to its brisk pacing and seamless flow of compelling medical cases. Its decision to skip a grandiose opening theme further amplifies this momentum, plunging viewers directly into the chaos because that’s what we ask of doctors and nurses every day. The cast delivers gripping performances, viscerally portraying the toll of the thankless, high-pressure world of medical professionals through a mix of nuanced subtleties and raw intensity woven throughout the season.</p><p>Whenever the show wasn’t confronting my uninsured ass with the stark reality of my mortality in these unprecedented times, it was genuinely inspiring. It was uplifting to watch its ensemble navigate their day—overcoming challenges like panic attacks, survivor’s guilt, and chaos or bureaucratic mismanagement. On top of that, the show’s “good politics,” which unflinchingly clap back at Dr. Google users from both sides of the aisle for dismissing professional life-saving medical advice, added a cathartic layer. If Noah Wyle doesn’t get his flowers this award season, I’ll be front and center for the ensuing riots.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/carlo-acutis-gamer-saint"><h3>The Politics, Theology, And Hype Behind The First Gamer Saint</h3></a><p>Teenager Carlo Acutis, set to be canonized at the end of this month, will be the Catholic Church's first millennial saint</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/devolver-digital-revenue-2024-25<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Devolver Digital has released its financial information for the 2024-25 fiscal year, and the studio's revenue is up, largely driven by the success of back catalogue games like&nbsp;<em>Cult of the Lamb</em>.</p>

<p>According to Devolver's latest financial presentation, the studio's revenue is up 13% on last year, rising to $104.8m as compared to a total of $92m in <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/human-fall-flat-2-delayed" rel="nofollow">the 2023-24 fiscal year</a>. Devolver says this is down to "strong back catalogue" and "success of lead titles".</p>

<p>The presentation also includes the latest revenue figures for a number of Devolver's titles, including&nbsp;<em>Cult of the Lamb</em>, which has now passed the $90m revenue mark.&nbsp;<em>Astroneer&nbsp;</em>is Devolver's next best-selling game at over $80m revenue, and the&nbsp;<em>Stronghold&nbsp;</em>series, which Devolver acquired in 2021, is sitting at over $50m.</p>

No cause of death was revealed, but I hope it comes as some small comfort to his loved ones to know that so many people are enjoying the game on which he worked.</p>

<p>Later in Devolver's presentation, the studio says the Switch is its most successful console, with over nine million units sold across all of its games.</p>

<p>Devolver calls the recently-revealed Switch 2, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">which launches in June</a>, an "opportunity", pointing to several games highlighted during the recent Switch 2 Direct show:&nbsp;<em>Human Fall Flat 2</em>,&nbsp;<em>Starseeker: Astroneer Expeditions</em>, and <i>Enter the Gungeon 2</i>.</p>

<p>As for what's coming up on Devolver's software slate (as well as the aforementioned, of course), upcoming games include&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tron-catalyst-mike-bithell-2025" rel="nofollow"><em>Tron: Catalyst</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-train-2-announced-demo-now" rel="nofollow"><em>Monster Train 2</em></a>, and Bennett Foddy's&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/baby-steps-bennett-foddy" rel="nofollow"><em>Baby Steps</em></a>, among many others planned for the next twelve months or so.</p>

            <link>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3s-final-patch-is-full-of-bees</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/baldurs-gate-3s-final-patch-is-full-of-bees.1164804/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3s-final-patch-is-full-of-bees<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Welp, it's finally happened. After many months of mainly murder related updates, Larian's stonker of an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> has at last received its final major content update. Patch 8 - which you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1086940/view/538849539213231622">read in full here</a> - brings Photo Mode, full cross play, and 12 new subclasses to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-class-list">Baldur's Gate 3</a>. That's one for each playable class, and likely at least six more than I'll ever reasonably experience. Still, a swarmkeeper ranger sounds very tempting. Yes the bees, is what I always say.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The full set of subclasses are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Path of the Giant Barbarian</li>
<li>College of Glamour Bard</li>
<li>Death Domain Cleric</li>
<li>Circle of Stars Druid</li>
<li>Arcane Archer Fighter</li>
<li>Way of the Drunken Master Monk</li>
<li>Oath of the Crown Paladin</li>
<li>Swarmkeeper Ranger</li>
<li>Swashbuckler Rogue</li>
<li>Shadow Magic Sorcerer</li>
<li>Hexblade Warlock</li>
<li>Bladesinging Wizard</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm a sucker for a good drunken master, too. According <a href="https://bg3.wiki/wiki/Way_of_the_Drunken_Master">to the Wiki</a>, this'll grant your Monk immunity to negative booze effects, Ki regain once a day on drinking, a strike with a chance to make whatever you're punching drunk themselves, and another strike that sobers them up, causing psychic damage.</p>
<p>Oh, this sounds exciting too! There's now "partial level editing" available in the modding toolkit. "Partial level editing means that what you won’t be able to do with the official Baldur’s Gate 3 Toolkit is add dialogues or change the static parts of the world like buildings, scenery or terrain," say Larian. "You can, however, create your own interactive objects". Sounds like you'll be able to add NPCs too, although mute ones, presumably.</p>
<p>The update also brings the usual round of fixes, although I haven't played in so long I couldn't tell you which of these were pressing issues. I've been waiting till this patch was out!</p>
<p>As for what's next for Larian, they've got <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/larian-have-two-new-games-in-the-works-fueled-by-the-very-same-fire-as-baldurs-gate-3">two new games in the works currently</a>, although are yet to share any details. Wizards Of The Coast, meanwhile, seem to be under the impression that all they have to do is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dds-makers-are-spending-1-billion-on-their-own-video-games-promising-theyll-be-quality-and-authentic-like-baldurs-gate-3">throw money around for several more Baldur's Gates</a> to fall into their laps.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/larians-final-major-game-patch-for-baldurs-gate-3-patch-8-is-out-now-on-all-platforms/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Larian Studios' journey with <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/baldurs-gate-3-review/">Baldur's Gate 3</a> began in <a href="https://larian.com/support/faqs/general-information_46#:~:text=Baldur's%20Gate%203%20is%20using,game%20design%20in%20late%202016.">2016</a>, with a small team starting work on the game's design and story. Then, in 2020, the game launched in an early access state on PC before its full release three years later in 2023. Now, it's known as one of the best RPGs ever made.</p>
<p>Today, the journey has ended in a significant way, with Larian Studios releasing the "<em>final major game patch</em>" for Baldur's Gate 3, Patch 8, which is now live on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Mac, and PC. This is the final patch Larian will release that includes new content, and every update after this will focus on continued maintenance and bug fixing.</p>
<p>"<em>We've told our stories the way we needed to tell them, and tried our best to make them impactful and engaging, and we're continuing to get better at handling our own chaos so that we can continue to create more chaos in the future,</em>" the studio wrote in a <a href="https://baldursgate3.game/news/the-final-patch-new-subclasses-photo-mode-and-cross-play_138">blog post</a> on its website.</p>
<p><iframe title="Baldur’s Gate 3: The Final Patch - An Animated Short" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CwCyTt8fSAU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>"<em>From patching in a way to change your appearance with the Magic Mirror, introducing Honour Mode for those of you looking for a hard time, and giving you new ways to make out with your romanced companion, to new cinematics for your most evil runs, and handing you the tools to create your own supported mods, Patch 8 now rounds off with cross-play, Photo Mode, and 12 new subclasses for you to enjoy.</em>"</p>
<p>Beyond the new <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-to-get-cross-play-12-new-subclasses-and-photo-mode-next-year/">subclasses</a>, cross-play functionality is one of the more significant features added in Patch 8, and it'll even work with most mods you might want to use. There are a few hang-ups, though, like the fact that all players will have to have the same version of the mods installed, and PC players squadding up with console players will need to be aware that only mods compatible with consoles will work when trying to use cross-play across PC and console devices.</p>
<p>If you're having trouble, Larian put together a handy <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX4ffv7xLsI">video guide</a> to take you through the process. Larian even put together a video guide to help you learn the ropes with the newly included <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RrZaWrZG-8">Photo Mode</a> to apply your photography skills to the world of Baldur's Gate 3.</p>
<p>You can find the full patch notes here to dig into every adjustment and change in Patch 8.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Dune: Awakening Delayed to June for "Improvements"]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dune-awakening-delayed-june</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dune-awakening-delayed-to-june-for-improvements.1164771/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dune-awakening-delayed-june<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Funcom has announced that upcoming survival game&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening&nbsp;</em>has been delayed by a few weeks in order to ensure the devs can implement "improvements".</p>

<p>In a Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1172710/view/503947989263320421" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a>, Funcom says that it still needs "a bit more time to cook" in order to "act on a lot more of the feedback" provided by beta testers in the past few months. As such,&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening&nbsp;</em>will now be launching on June 10th instead of its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dune-awakening-release-date" rel="nofollow">previously-set date of May 20th</a>.</p>

<p>The developer says it doesn't take the decision to move the game's release date "lightly", but that the three extra weeks will give Funcom "the time needed to make improvements that will lead to a better gameplay experience from day one".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dune-awakening-delayed-laser.jpg?itok=dgfONd6m 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dune-awakening-delayed-laser.jpg?itok=GZhzaVBY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dune: Awakening&nbsp;</em>is going to take a little longer to come out.</figcaption></figure><p>Funcom also says that this delay will allow it to "do a large-scale beta weekend next month", during which more people will get the chance to play&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening&nbsp;</em>and provide feedback to the team.</p>

<p>The studio closes by calling&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening&nbsp;</em>"a beast of a game" that represents "multiplayer survival on a massive scale", and it goes on to say that the game is "making gameplay and technical strides not seen in the genre before".</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening</em>, it is, believe it or not, a survival game set in the universe of Frank Herbert's popular&nbsp;<em>Dune&nbsp;</em>novels. However, the game takes place in an alternate version of the books' timeline in which Paul Atreides was never born and Lady Jessica gave birth to a daughter.</p>




<p>Much like Funcom's other survival game&nbsp;<em>Conan Exiles</em>,&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening&nbsp;</em>tasks you with surviving in a harsh desert environment. You'll comb Arrakis for resources, crafting equipment and using iconic&nbsp;<em>Dune&nbsp;</em>vehicles to traverse the land.</p>

<p><em>Dune: Awakening&nbsp;</em>launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1172710/Dune_Awakening/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10001899" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/dune-awakening/9pj6fv3130qz" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on June 10th.</p>
