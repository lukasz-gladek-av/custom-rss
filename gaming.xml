This issue is being written by <em>Spider-Man</em> writer Zeb Wells while Greg Capullo handles the art and cover. Issue 2, <em>Batman/Deadpool</em>, is being written by critically acclaimed comics writer Grant Morrison with art by Dan Mora. The second issue of this special crossover will land in November and be published by DC.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://ew.com/marvel-dc-crossover-2025-deadpool-batman-first-look-exclusive-11741707&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://ew.com/marvel-dc-crossover-2025-deadpool-batman-first-look-exclusive-11741707" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">According to <em>EW</em></a></span>, both issues will feature some extra stories and more DC/Marvel crossovers, but those are being left a secret for now. The outlet also confirmed that DC and Marvel plan on doing another one-shot crossover in 2026. </p><p>“A lot of things have to align,” Dan Buckley, the president of Marvel Entertainment, told EW. “Mostly, we plan our editorial schedule pretty far out. DC does their schedule pretty far out. You want to have the right talent involved because with this type of thing, you want to elevate it as much as you can to get people excited.”</p><p>“It happens kind of once every generation of readers. I’ll leave you to draw your own conclusions as to why. The timing has to be right in that you don’t want to do these too often. You want them to feel special. It is sort of finding that right moment for both companies to come together because it is complex. There’s a lot more coordination, collaboration, approvals that have to be done. And, obviously, from the business side, you’re sharing revenue, but it’s going to be a big deal. So you want the story, creatively, to warrant the hype of it all.”</p><figure id="" data-id="613af2be8366d42aa71b4ea6df278552" data-recommend-id="image://613af2be8366d42aa71b4ea6df278552" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->DC / Marvel / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="613af2be8366d42aa71b4ea6df278552" data-recommend-id="image://613af2be8366d42aa71b4ea6df278552" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Wells told the outlet that after writing 60 issues of <em>Spider-Man </em>he wanted a break, but Marvel offered him this chance to work on a Batman crossover and he decided that he “no longer needed a break” and hopped on board the project. </p><p> “In Batman, we’ve found someone who has even less time for Deadpool’s antics than Wolverine, but a city-wide threat from the Joker makes strange bedfellows (literally, if Deadpool had his way),” said Wells. “It’s been a blast letting Deadpool loose in Gotham City and watching what happens.” </p><p>Buckey added that the main reason DC and Marvel chose Batman and Deadpool for a crossover was that it was “a fun combo.”</p><p>“It was nothing more complicated than that,” said Buckley. “Like, Deadpool hanging out with Batman. There’s a lot of levity to be had in there, a lot of fun. And it would also be a little bit uber violent at the same time.... Our big thing is we want to do something that is a lot of fun, showcase comics, generate excitement, and bring new readers or lapsed readers back into the industry.”</p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">With marquee franchises ranging from grand adventures like The Legend of Zelda to niche series like Metroid, few video game publishers have a stable of properties as extensive and varied as Nintendo. But though many of these franchises are regularly supported with new installments, many more have been left languishing in dormancy--and among them, few are as frequently clamored for as F-Zero. Despite the ongoing wait for a new title, however, the futuristic racing series has actually been experiencing something of a quiet resurgence over the past few years.</p><p dir="ltr">This revival began in earnest in 2023 with the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/f-zero-99-announced-available-today/1100-6517727/">surprise release</a> of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/f-zero-99/" data-ref-id="5000-603158">F-Zero 99</a>, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-battle-royale-games/2900-6531/">battle royale</a>-style twist on the original F-Zero offered as part of the Nintendo Switch Online service. Like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/tetris-99/" data-ref-id="5000-493304">Tetris 99</a> (and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pac-man-99-will-shut-down-this-october/1100-6514261/https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pac-man-99-will-shut-down-this-october/1100-6514261/">short-lived Pac-Man 99</a>) before it, F-Zero 99 invigorates the series' classic formula by exploding the player count, with 99 competitors all vying for first place. But whereas Tetris 99 is a battle of attrition, a grueling contest to whittle down and outlast the competition, F-Zero 99 is still very much a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-racing-games/2900-5482/">racing game</a> at heart; unlike other battle royale-type games, your objective is not to eliminate other players (although it is greatly encouraged, as doing so replenishes your health meter), but to outmaneuver them over the course of four laps. The increased player count makes these high-speed contests even more nerve-wracking, and the difference between success and failure is often measured in milliseconds.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15787979/4502165-5775360847-7a016a000e495ee5aa915e223945d8fe0d117a61dd19c76d1a2a8187d1edbda7.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4502165" data-ratio="0.56222222222222" data-width="1350" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15787979/4502165-5775360847-7a016a000e495ee5aa915e223945d8fe0d117a61dd19c76d1a2a8187d1edbda7.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4502165"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15787979/4502165-5775360847-7a016a000e495ee5aa915e223945d8fe0d117a61dd19c76d1a2a8187d1edbda7.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The result is exhilarating. Though it may not be an entirely new entry, F-Zero 99 is a refreshing spin on the series, one that offers a tantalizing glimpse at a potential path forward for future installments. The expanded player count amplifies the high-stakes thrills of F-Zero's best moments--of negotiating winding, hazard-laden tracks and hairpin turns at lightning speed as other vehicles ricochet and explode all around you. More importantly, the game stands as proof that, contrary to what disgruntled fans may claim, Nintendo has neither forgotten about nor abandoned F-Zero.</p><p dir="ltr">Since 99's release, Nintendo has put out a steady cadence of F-Zero content on the Switch, keeping the franchise consistently in the public eye. 99 itself continues to hold regular in-game events and receive periodic updates, including one that recently added courses and other content from the long-lost <a href="https://fzero.fandom.com/wiki/BS_F-Zero_Grand_Prix" rel="nofollow ">BS F-Zero game</a> for Super Famicom's Satellaview attachment. The company also dug three classic F-Zero titles out from its vaults and brought them to Switch Online's Game Boy Advance library over the course of 2024. GBA launch title <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/f-zero-maximum-velocity/" data-ref-id="5000-3277">Maximum Velocity</a> hit the service in March, while anime tie-in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/f-zero-gp-legend/" data-ref-id="5000-19983">GP Legend</a> and its sequel, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/f-zero-climax/" data-ref-id="5000-21316">F-Zero Climax</a>, both followed in October.</p><p dir="ltr">The last title in particular is one of the most noteworthy additions to the service. Not only was Climax the final F-Zero game released for Game Boy Advance, arriving near the end of the handheld's life in 2004, it effectively marked the end of the series. Released in quick succession after GP Legend (which itself launched only a few months after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/f-zero-gx/" data-ref-id="5000-4377">F-Zero GX</a> on GameCube), Climax was the third F-Zero game in the span of two years, which significantly diminished its impact. This was borne out in the poor reception it received, reportedly selling a scant 5,000 copies in its first three days. As a result, it would be the last brand-new F-Zero game that Nintendo released before putting the series into hibernation--and would remain as such for nearly 20 years, until the aforementioned F-Zero 99 arrived.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxqYOmjPWF0" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/VxqYOmjPWF0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">More notably, Climax was originally never released outside of Japan. Faced with the series' dwindling sales, Nintendo elected not to bring the game to other markets, making its arrival on the Switch Online service the first official chance many F-Zero fans around the world have had to experience this lost entry. But though it may not have garnered much attention on its original release, F-Zero Climax arguably stands as the pinnacle of the series' 2D design, with refined racing mechanics, impressive visuals, and even a course customization tool (which is even more enjoyable to tinker with now, thanks to the ease with which custom tracks can be shared online). In a way, this long-overdue release ended up working to the game's benefit, as Climax arrives at a time when players are much more receptive to--and eager for--F-Zero content.</p><p dir="ltr">It's tempting to think these re-releases merely served as an easy way for Nintendo to buoy the original Switch as it has shifted its resources and attention to the upcoming Switch 2, but the F-Zero series will also play a pivotal role in the new console's launch. From the moment the system hits the market, Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscribers will have access to a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-gamecube-game-coming-to-switch-2s-switch-online-library/2900-6400/">library of classic GameCube games</a> on it--and tellingly, one of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-will-get-gamecube-games-through-nintendo-switch-online-new-gamecube-controller/1100-6530559/">first three titles</a> playable on the service right at the outset will be F-Zero GX.</p><p dir="ltr">This is notable for a number of reasons, not least because it will mark the first time the game will be officially available in more than 20 years. F-Zero GX is widely regarded as the series' finest installment, and it makes a compelling showpiece for Nintendo's new system. Thanks to the increased resolution Switch 2 offers, the game's neon-tinged visuals remain sharp and vibrant even two decades on, and the addition of online play greatly enriches its appeal. Moreover, GX's arrival means the entire F-Zero franchise (with the exception of obscurities like the F-Zero X Expansion Kit) will be playable on Switch 2 right from day one, giving longtime fans and newcomers access to the whole series on a single platform.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15787979/4502259-8730467379-36bbcf1160028ffe860ef9cf9a76bd470f6e2f9d7ec09315aad4de3e6d1e1383.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4502259" data-ratio="0.56222222222222" data-width="1350" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15787979/4502259-8730467379-36bbcf1160028ffe860ef9cf9a76bd470f6e2f9d7ec09315aad4de3e6d1e1383.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4502259"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15787979/4502259-8730467379-36bbcf1160028ffe860ef9cf9a76bd470f6e2f9d7ec09315aad4de3e6d1e1383.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Interestingly, that isn't the only way F-Zero is helping usher the new platform to market. F-Zero 99 also makes an appearance in the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-ad-brings-back-paul-rudd-decades-after-his-snes-commercial/1100-6530992/">Switch 2 commercial starring Paul Rudd</a>. Although the ad primarily showcases <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mario-kart-world/" data-ref-id="5000-658545">Mario Kart World</a> and Switch 2's GameChat feature, F-Zero 99 is prominently visible on the system's home menu near the beginning of the spot, which is likely the most mainstream exposure the game has ever received. Of course, it's easy to infer why 99 was included. The new ad deliberately harkens back to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYhGL5y4DPQ">1991 SNES commercial</a> Rudd appeared in, which spotlighted the original F-Zero among several other SNES titles. 99's appearance brings the commercials full circle, but it's nonetheless a good sign to see it promoted (however briefly) as part of such a pivotal marketing campaign.</p><p>Between these re-releases and updates, F-Zero is in a more prominent position than it's been in many years, which bodes well for the series' future. Nintendo has been steadily laying the groundwork for a potential revival, using the free F-Zero 99 and a regular drip of legacy titles to gauge fan interest and introduce the franchise to a new generation of players. For all the criticism the company deserves over its conservative tendencies, Nintendo is often willing to give some of its lesser-known properties another chance, as evidenced by the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/emio-the-smiling-mans-final-chapters-are-a-masterclass-in-suspense/1100-6528480/">recent revival of Famicom Detective Club</a>. If a series that obscure can receive a new entry, there's hope yet for a new F-Zero.</p>

            <p>
A new report has lend further credence to last year's claims Apple is working on game-focused iOS app that'll integrate store, social features, achievements and more - with the company now said to be "seeking to sell gamers and developers on the idea that it’s a leader in the market."
</p>
<p>
Word that Apple was looking to expand its gaming strategy with a dedicated iOS app first surfaced last year, when news site 9to5 Mac reported efforts were underway at the company to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/apple-reportedly-working-on-new-game-focused-ios-app-integrating-store-social-features-achievements-and-more">combine the functionality of iOS' App Store and its long-defunct Game Center service</a> - which previously offered a centralised place to view likes of challenges, leaderboards, and achievements before the app was removed from iOS in 2016.
</p>
<p>
And now, eight months later, Bloomberg has <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-27/apple-to-debut-dedicated-gaming-app-within-days-of-switch-2-s-arrival">corroborated 9to5's story with a similar report</a>, saying Apple is looking to preinstall the new gaming app on iPhone, iPad, and Apple TV set-top boxes later this year. There's also talk of a Mac version, capable of displaying games downloaded outside of the App Store. As in 9to5's earlier report, Bloomberg - citing "people with knowledge of the matter" - says the app will serve as a launcher for games and centralise in-game achievements, leaderboards, communications, and other activities.

<p>
It'll reportedly also feature internally produced editorial content highlighting new games available within the app, which will include those from the App Store's game section and the company's Apple Arcade game subscription service. Bloomberg says the app is due to launch as part of Apple's next iOS version, iOS 19, and will be showcased during the company's Worldwide Developers Conference on 9th June ahead of a September arrival.
</p>
<p>
Apple's push to create a prominent games destination for iOS users does, of course, follow the EU's mandate last year that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-returning-to-ios-says-epic-as-apple-agrees-to-alternative-app-marketplaces-in-eu">Apple must allow sideloading and alternate marketplaces</a> on its devices to comply with the Digital Markets Act. Since then, a number of third-party marketplaces have taken advantage of the EU's new rules, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-game-store-and-fortnite-now-available-in-eu-on-ipad">most notably the Epic Games Store</a>.

A new game-focused iOS app from Apple would mark another small step in the company's slowly evolving gaming strategy, which has so far included the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/apple-arcade">launch of its Apple Arcade games subscription service in 2019</a>, new tools to help developer easily port their Mac games to iOS, and even a push to woo major publishers like Capcom and Ubisoft onto its platform in recent years - although efforts to sell full-price AAA games such as Resident Evil 7, Death Stranding, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-mirage">Assassin's Creed Mirage</a> to iOS users have reportedly <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-7-has-reportedly-flopped-on-ios-with-under-2000-sales">proved disappointing</a>.
</p>
<p>
Reports of Apple's new app come as the company announces its first video game studio acquisition. It now owns RAC7, the two-person studio responsible for Apple Arcade hit Sneaky Sasquatch - although an Apple spokesperson <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/apple-acquires-rac7-sneaky-sasquatch/">told Digital Trends</a> the move was a "unique circumstance", as it saw an opportunity to help the team grow its game further.

Not only is it free to download, but it lets you explore one of the Tokyo area’s lesser-known iconic locations from the comfort of your home.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Metropolitan Area Outer Underground Discharge Channel, known as G-Cans for short, is a real-life disaster prevention facility. It is best-known for its “pressure adjustment water tank” — a huge cavernous space with 59 massive pillars. A truly epic looking, boss battle-worthy location, it is G-Can’s most iconic sight, and even has the nickname “underground temple” (chika shinden) in Japan. With bags of atmosphere, it also gets used as a location for music videos, Japanese TV dramas (like Kamen Rider) and movies.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/27/gettyimages-156814649-1748370157380.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The real-life G-Cans. Photographer: Tomohiro Ohsumi/Bloomberg via Getty Images.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In dry seasons, it is possible to tour G-Cans in real life, but thanks to the Japanese Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT), you can now explore this atmospheric facility in Minecraft too. The ministry have released a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKReBv1IRB0&amp;t=5s" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video on their official YouTube</a> which briefly summarizes the purpose of G-Cans and shows what it looks like in the blocky world of Minecraft.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Minecraft’s free G-Cans map doesn’t just include the facility though — there is also an overground area featuring rivers, homes, and neighborhoods, giving the player a sense of how G-Cans protects people and places in real life. You can also go into the control room and try draining flood water into the shafts to see how it works for yourself.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/27/000912066-1748370060929.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Minecraft G-Cans. Image credit: the Edogawa River Office.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">MLIT’s recreation of G-Cans in Minecraft is designed to educate people about the facility and how it prevents disasters. Exploring it, even in Minecraft, also gives the player a sense of how absolutely huge G-Cans is. In real life, G-Cans' concrete tunnels run for over 6km under Saitama Prefecture, part of the Greater Tokyo Area. Its five shafts capture water from flood-prone rivers during Japan’s rainy season (June) and typhoon season (usually around September), before gradually releasing it into the much bigger Edogawa River and Tokyo Bay. Completed in 2006 after over a decade of construction, G-Cans has played a huge role in combating flooding in the area ever since.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">MLIT’s G-Can’s Minecraft map can be downloaded for free from the official website of the <a href="https://www.ktr.mlit.go.jp/edogawa/edogawa01318.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Edogawa River Office</u></a>, which manages the facility. At least Version 1.21.1 of Minecraft Bedrock Edition or Version 1.21.0 of Minecraft Education Edition are required.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Verity Townsend is a Japan-based freelance writer who previously served as editor, contributor and translator for the game news site Automaton West.

            <p>
I think there might be a chance, just ever so slightly, that the development of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cities-skylines-2">Cities Skylines 2</a> has been a bit difficult. The game launched back in October of 2023 and has suffered from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cities-skylines-2-wont-get-paid-dlc-until-its-problem-issues-are-sorted-devs-say">performance issues</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cities-skylines-2-devs-apologise-for-rushed-dlc-offer-refunds-promise-conciliatory-fan-summit">rushed DLC</a>, and a delay to its first expansion Bridges and Ports. This expansion was meant to come soon after the Beach Properties DLC, but that obviously didn't happen, catching a delay to sometime in the second quarter of 2025 specifically to continue improving upon the base game. Except the expansion has been delayed once again.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Over on a <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/free-patch-and-updated-plans.1760205/">forum post</a>, developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/colossalorder">Colossal Order</a> shared an update explaining why the DLC has caught another delay. "After reviewing the content ourselves and sharing it with our early access group, we’ve received consistent feedback: the bridges are super exciting, and the port works well, but there are aspects of the expansion that are not as polished as they could be."
</p>
<p>
This, they say, left them with "a difficult choice: delay the release once again to add more depth, or release it as-is, knowing players may feel it falls short." Colossal also said they think Bridges and Ports is enjoyable as is, but to "bring it to the level you deserve, we need more time." Now, it's expected to launch sometime in the fourth quarter of this year.
</p>
<p>
Ironically, a free update is coming on June 11th that was meant to coincide with the expansion that includes a couple of new bridges, three leisure piers, and three quays. It's something! To be fair to Colossal, delaying it probably is the better decision, I could quite easily see another botched DLC sinking that city builder shaped ship. 
</p>
<p>
I think there was some famous guy who had a plumber for a son that once said something like "a delayed Bridges and Ports expansion is eventually good, but a rushed Bridges and Ports expansion is forever bad." Might be paraphrasing.

At the time, it wasn’t clear what Nintendo meant when it listed some games as having start-up issues and other titles as having in-game compatibility problems.

The good news: Only one first-party Nintendo game, <em>Nintendo Labo Toy-Con 04: VR Kit, </em>is completely unplayable on Switch 2. The console maker says this comes down to the fact that Switch 2 is too big and can’t be “inserted into the Toy-Con VR Goggles.”</p><p>All other first-party Switch games, including the other Labo titles, will work on Switch 2. However, some titles, like <em>1-2 Switch</em> and <em>Ring Fit Adventure,</em> will only work on Switch 2 if you connect an OG Switch Joy-Con to the new console.  It should also be noted that<em> Fitness Boxing,</em> also published by Nintendo, will need an update to work on Switch 2.</p><p>As for third-party titles, Nintendo has tested more titles and worked with publishers to create new lists. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://media.nintendo.com/switch-2/pdf-compatibility_issues_EN_05272025.pdf?_gl=1*wsyydv*_gcl_au*MTgyMDM4MDcxMy4xNzQ3MzM5Mjcz*_ga*OTY3MzU2MjczLjE3MjI0NDc4Mzg.*_ga_F6ERC4HMNZ*czE3NDgzNzMwNDEkbzQ5JGcxJHQxNzQ4MzczMDc5JGowJGwwJGg4Njg0MTY5ODc.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://media.nintendo.com/switch-2/pdf-compatibility_issues_EN_05272025.pdf?_gl=1*wsyydv*_gcl_au*MTgyMDM4MDcxMy4xNzQ3MzM5Mjcz*_ga*OTY3MzU2MjczLjE3MjI0NDc4Mzg.*_ga_F6ERC4HMNZ*czE3NDgzNzMwNDEkbzQ5JGcxJHQxNzQ4MzczMDc5JGowJGwwJGg4Njg0MTY5ODc." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">118 games are still listed as having</a></span> “start-up issues” on Switch 2. Meanwhile, 50 games  “start up on Nintendo Switch 2 but include some in-game compatibility issues,” and 54 games have in-game problems, but a patch is planned to fix these issues at launch or soon after. In April, the list of games with “start-up issues” was 130. Looking at the lists, over 20 of these games are now set to be updated and should work better on Switch 2, including <em>Doom Eternal </em>and <em>Pizza Tower. </em></p><p>Interestingly, some software like Hulu and Crunchyroll won’t be compatible on Switch 2 at all. It remains to be seen if that’s because there are new versions of those apps coming to Switch 2 in the future or because the companies behind those streaming apps just don’t see a point in supporting the new hardware. </p><p>Regardless, it’s great to see nearly the entire Switch library will be playable on Switch 2, even if I’ll have to dig out an old Joy-Con to play games like <em>Nintendo Switch Sports. </em></p><p><em> .</em><br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

EA <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/codemasters-has-secured-the-official-wrc-licence">inherited the World Rally Championship license</a> as part of its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-to-release-new-racing-game-every-year-after-codemasters-acquisition">acquisition of UK racing game specialist Codemasters</a> in 2021, and its first WRC title - EA Sports WRC - released two years later in 2023. Last month, however, the publisher <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-says-its-pausing-development-on-future-rally-games-as-wrc-partnership-ends">revealed it had "reached the end of the road working on WRC"</a>, leaving the future of rally gaming somewhat uncertain given it also confirmed it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-confirms-it-is-reducing-roles-at-codemasters-and-redeploying-as-many-as-possible">laying off staff</a> and "pausing development plans on future rally titles".
</p>
<p>
But less than a month later, a fresh World Rally Championship deal has been struck with a new company, Nacon - the publisher behind the likes of RoboCop: Rogue City and last year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown-review-tech-issues-mar-the-return-of-the-original-name-in-open-world-racers">disappointing Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown</a>. It's perhaps not a huge surprise, given Nacon (formerly Bigben Interactive) previously held the WRC license between 2013 and 2022, and released nine titles in that time, culminating in WRC Generations.

<p>
As detailed in <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/05/26/3088220/0/en/PRESS-RELEASE-NACON-ANNOUNCES-AGREEMENT-WITH-WRC-PROMOTER-FOR-THE-PUBLISHING-OF-THE-OFFICIAL-GAMES-OF-THE-FIA-WORLD-RALLY-CHAMPIONSHIP-FROM-2027-TO-2032.html">today's announcement</a>, Nacon's new agreement "covers the development and publishing of the official WRC games and eSports competitions, granting [the company] exclusive rights for PC and consoles for six seasons, from 2027 through 2032."
</p>
<p>
Nacon adds it's now set to begin development of an "all-new WRC game series, aiming to deliver an immersive experience that faithfully reflects the reality of the championship and meets the expectations of both rally enthusiasts and new players". These titles will mark a "complete reboot of the franchise", and will include the likes of official rallies, vehicles, teams, drivers, and sponsors.
</p>
<p>
"After a comprehensive evaluation, we are delighted to have reached an agreement with Nacon," World Rally Championship chief marketing officer Arne Dirks said in a statement accompanying today's new. "[Its] vision for the franchise stands out, and their expertise in delivering great rally games is unquestioned. We look forward to breaking new ground together in this collaboration, to truly turn the WRC games into epic adventures and offer gaming experiences beyond rally as we know it today."
</p>
<p>
The most recent game to release under the WRC license was the Codemasters-developed EA Sports WRC, which launched in 2023. Eurogamer called it a "joyous and rugged display of rally racing, with exquisite handling, lightly flecked by technical issues", in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-sports-wrc-review-a-bracing-and-richly-textured-celebration-of-rally">our four star review</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-publisher-says-brevity-should-be-more-of-a-virtue-in-gaming/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 officially <a href="https://wccftech.com/33-days-after-launch-clair-obscur-expedition-33-reaches-3-3-million-copies-sold/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reached</a> another important sales milestone today, having surpassed 3.3 million units sold 33 days after launch. The turn-based JRPG created by Sandfall Interactive and published by Kepler Interactive is one of the biggest surprise hits of 2025 so far. It has received unanimous acclaim from critics (getting a <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">9.5 score</a> from us) and fans, too.</p>
<p>Today, GamesIndustry.biz <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-big-clair-obscur-expedition-33-interview-sandfall-and-kepler-on-team-size-the-return-of-aa-games-and-whats-next" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> an interview with Kepler Interactive portfolio director Matthew Handrahan and Sandfall Interactive COO and producer François Meurisse. Among various things, the two credited the game with not dragging on for too long and challenged the view that longer games are better.</p>
<p><em><strong>Matthew</strong> <strong>Handrahan:</strong> One of the things that's great about Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is it really respects the player's time. It gives them plenty to do, and it gives them plenty of satisfaction, but it isn't arbitrarily 500 hours of gameplay. It's impactful because it's scoped correctly. […] It doesn't have any sense of bloat or extraneous things that are put there just to make it larger and larger and larger.</em></p>
<p><em>Brevity should be more of a virtue in gaming. Something can be better by being shorter – something that's being discussed in film at the moment. Every film seems to be two and a half hours long, and I think most people are like, 'Can they all be a bit shorter, please? Because we have other things to do with our lives'.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>François</strong> <strong>Meurisse:</strong> From the beginning, we wanted to do an intense and short experience. The first length estimates of the game were closer to 20 hours for the main quest. I think we ended up closer to 30, even 40 hours if you take a bit of time. As a player, there are so many great games out there that I want to experience, and what's important to me is the level of excitement and fun I get from a game, rather than how long it is.</em></p>
<p><em>The value that players get from games does not align systematically with the length of the game. For example, one of my favourite games of all time is Inside, which lasts about two hours, but it's one of the most polished and intense experiences – and even life changing for some people.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dungeons-dragons-2024-psion-class-introduced-in-new-unearthed-arcana<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wizards of the Coast has released playtest material for <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> 2024. The new Unearthed Arcana is notable since it contains another attempt at creating a new character class: the Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2024 Psion.</p>



<p>In an <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/ua/the-psion" rel="nofollow">official post</a> on D&amp;D Beyond, Wizards of the Coast released the <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> 2024 Psion Unearthed Arcana. The post was accompanied with a video of Todd Kenrick interviewing the design team on the playtest material. Notably, this is the first video not featuring the (now departed) design leads of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/christopher-perkins-retires-from-wizards-of-coast-after-28-years-working-on-dungeons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Chris Perkins</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/jeremy-crawford-game-director-of-dungeons-dragons-is-leaving-wizards-of-ghost" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Jeremy Crawford</a>.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dungeons-dragons-2024-psionic-artwork.jpg?itok=87qbKklM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dungeons-dragons-2024-psionic-artwork.jpg?itok=rwxH2HPP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The Unearthed Arcana contains playtest material for the Psion class, four Psion subclasses, several unique spells, and new Wild Talent feats. The Psion is effectively a psychic take on the Wizard. They both have no armor training and only a d6 hit die. The unique resource the Psion has the Psionic Energy Die, which can be rolled and added to certain ability checks and attack rolls.</p>

<p>Keeping in line with utility, the four <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> 2024 Psion subclasses are geared towards different forms of play. The Metamorph allows you to psychically alter your body and the body of others. The Psi Warper lets you bend space between objects. The Psykinetic focuses on powerful bursts of energy and defensive shields. The Telepath enables you to delve into the minds of your enemies.</p>

<p>Lastly, the Unearthed Arcana's Wild Talent feats allow other character classes to dip into the new psionic power. They are similar to the Magic Initiate feat. Take this feat and your Fighter or Barbarian has limited access to some of the Psion's abilities like pyrokinesis or disguising your appearance with psychic power.</p>

<p>The Psion is the first attempt by Wizards of the Coast to create a new character class in eight years. Their last attempt was a similar psychic-themed class, the Mystic, in 2015. That class was ultimately abandoned, generally because it was considered too powerful due to versatility through psi points.</p>

<p>The new Psion class by comparison, is more closely inspired by other psychic-themed subclasses like the Psi Knight Fighter or the Soulknife Rogue. As for whether or not this class will be refined and released in a future book, that will depend on community feedback.</p>

The boosts give players who didn't play the previous expansion a chance (for a price) to jump straight into the new content.

Perhaps an additional reward will be enough for some players to push through, but for those who can't be bothered, Blizzard is also offering a $80 bundle that includes a paid level 85 character boost, game time, and additional cosmetics.

Now Mako and Gamebreaking Studios are bringing it back.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to Gamebreaking CEO Taylor Hellam, Mako contacted art and creative directors who worked on the original release, who led him to Rebel Entertainment CEO Mike Goslin.

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cities-skylines-2">Cities: Skylines 2</a> players are facing yet another delay for the beleaguered city builder's first major DLC expansion, with publisher Paradox Interactive having announced a new release window of "Q4" this year - closing in on two years after it was originally due to launch.

<p>
Cities: Skylines 2's troubles are well documented; the city builder sequel got off a disastrous start in 2023, forcing developer Colossal Order to reprioritise its development efforts amid <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cities-skylines-2-fans-complain-of-performance-woes-after-developer-admits-it-missed-target">significant criticism of the game's performance</a>. Initially, the studio had planned to release its first DLC - the Beach Properties Asset Pack - shortly after launch, but it was delayed into the following year, while all other announced DLC (the Urban Promenades and Modern Architecture Creator Packs, and the Bridges &amp; Ports expansion) shifted from Q1 2024 to Q2.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, the Beach Properties' eventual arrival did little to improve the community's goodwill; it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cities-skylines-2-publisher-refunds-dlc-and-admits-we-let-you-down">slammed by players for its high price and lacklustre content</a>, leading Colossal Order to announced an 'indefinite' delay for all future paid DLC. Bridges &amp; Ports was moved into 2025 as a result, but a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cities-skylines-2-dlc-gets-further-delays-as-developer-priorities-assets-editor-for-mods">further delay was announced last September</a>, while Colossal Order focused its efforts on completing what it called the "crucial" assets editor.
</p>
<p>
In the months since, Colossal Order has continued to make improvements to the base game and <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/cities-skylines-ii/modding/cities-skylines-ii-region-packs">launched some free "region" DLC</a>. But that "crucial" assets editor remains unreleased, and now the studio has opted to delay Bridges &amp; Ports yet again, moving it out of Q2 this year into Q4. "We've spent the last five months working hard on the Bridges &amp; Ports DLC, and towards our upcoming expected release," the studio <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/free-patch-and-updated-plans.1760205/">wrote in a message shared on the Paradox forum</a>. "After reviewing the content ourselves and sharing it with our early access group, we've received consistent feedback: the bridges are super exciting, and the port works well, but there are aspects of the expansion that are not as polished as they could be."
</p>
<p>
"That left us with a difficult choice," it continued, "delay the release once again to add more depth, or release it as-is, knowing players may feel it falls short. We believe the current content is enjoyable, but we're not blind to what's missing, and to bring it to the level you deserve, we need more time... We're assessing feedback from our early access group and mapping out what we want to improve when the expansion launches - which we are now expecting in Q4 of this year. This is still a beautiful expansion, and we're excited about what it will add to your city. We just want to ensure it adds enough to meet your deservedly high expectations."
</p>
<p>
Cities: Skylines 2 players won't, however, be left waiting for new content until the end of this year. Colossal Order has elected to release the free update it was originally intending to ship alongside Bridges &amp; Ports on 11th June, offering "a bit of content that gives a slight sneak peek of what is to come in the expansion". It'll include two new bridges, three leisure piers, and three quays, with <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/free-patch-and-updated-plans.1760205/">more details available in today's forum post</a>.
</p>
<p>
As for Cities: Skylines 2's much-delayed console port, there's still no hint as to when that might arrive. It was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cities-skylines-2-console-release-gets-delayed">originally due to launch alongside the PC version</a> back in October 2023, but has remained in limbo since then, with Colossal Order admitting it has struggled to overcome "hardware limitations" impacting performance on Xbox Series X/S and PS5. Back in March, it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cities-skylines-2s-troubled-console-release-sounds-like-its-still-some-way-off">warned</a>, "We will not have a release before summer", but there's been no update since then.

			<p>Developer Redemption Road Games has <a href="https://x.com/Kingmakers_Game/status/1927416166772801659">announced</a> that Kingmakers, its third-person shooting strategy game that sends you back in time to the medieval era with an assault rifle, will arrive on PC in early access on October 8, 2025.</p>
<p>When Kingmakers was first revealed in <a href="https://x.com/Kingmakers_Game/status/1759943842466582568">February 2024</a>, it had a small viral moment with its admittedly hilarious announcement trailer, where you watch a pickup truck smash through legions of armored knights that can't do anything but ragdoll against modern horsepower. Cut to watching a soldier firing shotgun shells into enemies chasing after him with swords, and Kingmakers immediately appeared to be a fun, chaotic time.</p>
<p><iframe title="Kingmakers - Early Access Release Date Trailer | tinyBuild Connect 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/52u8LIuzA-Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>That moment helped Kingmakers reach more than a <a href="https://x.com/Kingmakers_Game/status/1868768562388910113">million wishlists on Steam</a>, with excitement continuing to build since. It'll be interesting to see how players react when they're able to play it themselves at launch this coming October.</p>
<p>It'll be launching as an early access game, of course, so we should expect that it won't be perfect. But the core concept of being able to run through armies of knights with a gun or a tank looks like it'll be a roaring good time, and hopefully, Kingmakers is able to make that key draw to the gameplay feel as good as it looks.</p>

It’s a great way to get quick healing without having to chug some potions in the middle of a hunt.</p><p>As a restorative mantle, Mending will work for whatever setup you have.

Taking damage will decrease the amount of time you have left.</p><p><strong>Rocksteady is the mantle to choose if you want to feel like a tank</strong>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/parrying-is-the-worst-thing-in-video-games.1199856/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/parrying-bad<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Long before parrying became the topic of the day thanks to <em>Clair Obscur</em>, I was a firm believer in a truth many of you are just now discovering: parrying is bad, and video games should stop having it.</p><p>And look: I get that I’m known on this site for <a href="https://aftermath.site/i-hate-double-jump" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unpopular opinions</a> about <a href="https://aftermath.site/indiana-jones-great-circle-camera" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">beloved mechanics</a>, but with anti-parry sentiment at an all-time high, you might be feeling more open to my point of view. Many haters of <em>Clair Obscur</em>’s parry system are coming from the pro-parry camp, taking umbrage with the timing or animations compared to other games. But rather than filling your head with <em>more</em> parry thoughts, rather than ranking games with some unnecessary rubric, rather than playing armchair developer to Sandfall and getting into arguments on Steam forums, you could join a righteous cause (mine) and free yourself from this problem altogether.</p><p>Parrying in video games sucks. It features in <a href="https://gamerant.com/soulslike-games-best-parry-mechanics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">many games</a> with hand-to-hand combat, giving you the opportunity to deflect an enemy’s attack and, unlike a dodge that just keeps you from taking damage, knock an enemy off-balance or do some damage of your own. I can see why the promise of the parry is appealing, but think about the reality: It is precise and finicky, relying on an audio cue or narrow timing window to perform successfully. If you’re in a hectic combat situation, you already have enough to pay attention to.</p><p>I won’t hide the fact that my stance is informed by the fact that I am terrible at parrying. But I would argue this is not my fault. In real life, I briefly took a fencing class in college, so I understand the <em>concept</em> of what it is to parry, and it is an action I have pulled off with variable success in the physical world. But, whatever the boosters might say, I don’t think this action translates well to video games. In third-person games like <em>Clair Obscur</em>, it can be hard to understand when precisely you should parry; these kinds of games have to give you wind-ups and clues to help you know when to enter into their simulation of objects moving through space. Parrying is inherently a first-person activity; if you are seeing it in third-person it means you’re not part of the parrying situation, and as such have no need to know when someone should parry. Mind your own business!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In first-person games, like my <a href="https://aftermath.site/stealth-game-no-detection" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">beloved</a> <em>Dishonored</em> and its betrayal via parry inclusion, the sort of calculations you’d do in the physical world are functionally impossible when ported to the virtual. In real life, you inherently sort of <em>know </em>how to work with the length of a sword, how fast it’s moving, how long your own sword is, and how far away you are. The oft-overlooked miracle that is moving your body through space is just <em>what bodies do in space</em>; when you remove the bodies and the space, the whole concept basically falls apart. Video games have to turn parrying into an animation that must be entered into correctly; they have to introduce all those clues you’re required to parse, turning the whole thing into some kind of cruel rhythm game, because there is no way to recreate actual parrying. You lose the spontaneity, the freedom, the responsiveness imparted to you as a bonus gift for having a human body. And you then use that human body to fumble through some cruel shadow of “parrying” with your fingers, cheapening not just the idea of the parry, but the full potential of your human form.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>When discussing my stance with my Aftermath colleagues, the conversation quickly devolved into points about iframes and hit boxes; i.e., shit for sickos. Do you want to be a sicko? Do you want to have to not just learn about but <em>care about</em> ticky-tacky coder stuff when you are just a person trying to play a video game? Any mechanic that requires a fine appreciation of code is not a mechanic for the people; it is an exercise in exclusion and elitism. Are those your values? Is that the side of history you want to stand on?</p><p>You don’t need any of this shit. Even if you aren’t like me, a man who doesn’t care for the finer points of video game combat and just wants to look at cool monsters while mashing buttons, surely you must recognize that video game combat is sufficient without the addition of the hateful parry. Consider the <a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/compare/MAT.6.28-33#:~:text=Matthew%206%3A28%2D33%20New,arrayed%20like%20one%20of%20these." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lilies of the field</a> and be satisfied with what you have. Acknowledge the abundance already before you. Simplify your life. Reject the parry.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/parrying-good"><h3>Parrying Is The Best Thing In Video Games</h3></a><p>Everybody’s gangsta until somebody parries your bullshit</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/doom-bathroom-renovation-something-awful-for-sale"><h3>Please Know That The House With The Doom Bathroom Is For Sale</h3></a><p>Calling it a 'uniquely remodeled home' seems like an understatement</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/hockey-stickhandling-video-game-dangleverse"><h3>This Video Game Is Also a Hockey Training Tool</h3></a><p>Dangleverse, which I've been using to practice hockey off the rink, is in beta right now</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/parrying-good<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Gaming, much like life, offers a range of responses to sticky situations, especially in action games. Whether it’s an boss slowly walking toward you or a fighting game rival ready to signal the choir to “<a href="https://youtu.be/GqM_-p_wK_U" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">somebody’s getting fucked</a>,” players typically face three choices: freeze — staying locked in place eating shit until their foe drops a combo; flight — playing footsies, creating distance, and reassessing a smarter angle of attack; or fight, meeting the challenge head-on, pressing buttons, and praying you get a couple good hits in edgewise. But there’s a hidden fourth response — fawning, the art of appeasing stress to sidestep conflict, where you play the role of the immovable object to an unstoppable force. You don’t flinch, you don’t dodge, you don’t flee. You stand firm, nullifying attacks with pure precision, proving that you can see through your adversaries' nonsense and that countering it is light work for you. In my twisted mind, this response is the quintessential instinct behind parrying, the ultimate flex in video games.</p><p>Parrying is one, if not the, most satisfying mechanics in video games. Unlike its more reserved cousin, the block, parrying is the golden child of combat-oriented games—the one who earns a spot at the adults’ table at family get-togethers, gets their cheek lovingly pinched by grandma as she dotes on her favorite little pookie bear whenever it recounts moments where it took a high-risk gamble that paid off thanks to its uncanny ability to turn defence into dominance.&nbsp;</p><p>Parrying is my favorite thing in gaming. Although it may not be the safest option in battle, it yields the greatest reward by willingly putting yourself in harm's way and coming out the other end unscathed. The only thing dashed against the rocks in the wake of a well-timed parry is your opponent’s pride.&nbsp;</p><p>As the parry-er, the mechanic is one of the most empowering elements you can earn in gaming. It’s an art that proves your ability to get the proverbial camel through the eye of a needle, shutting down an enemy’s offense before it starts. In the most Pavlovian sense, games like <a href="https://youtu.be/8NqX3Kj6qec" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Elden Ring</em></a> reinforce a successful parry with a sharp, satisfying clang. This soundbite, like the high-pitch ding of a headshot in a shooter, is like the game patting you on the head for being the smartest (and most disrespectful) player in the room. Congrats, you just effortlessly batted that attack away like it’s nothing. Your dick is huge.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="RULES OF NATURE" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WM33Hr94SKw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Games hold up their end of the deal by rewarding this mastery of fisticuffs. A well-timed parry can leave an opponent wide open for an all-out assault, like <a href="https://youtu.be/QkWa-hxv3A4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Tekken 8</em>’s universal low parry</a>. It can also signal fun times ahead, serving as a flashy preamble to bombastic games like <a href="https://youtu.be/q2MHp6_SSMs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance</em></a>, a great equalizer in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/review/563522/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review-ps5-pc-xbox#comments" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></a>, a <a href="https://youtu.be/R2Lboca6KUQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">damage multiplier in<em> Sea of Stars</em></a>, or even the only path to victory in games like <a href="https://youtu.be/R2Lboca6KUQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Battle Fantasia</em></a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Parries are so quintessential to an action game’s depth that they’ve become a staple across the genre. While not all parries are made the same, many have narrow timing windows, with high scrutiny for what counts as a parry. Some games introduce the elusive perfect parry, which completely dismantles an enemy with a devastating stun effect by countering at the very last second. Games like <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em> act as an ideal introduction to the killer mechanic, weaving parrying into its rhythmic gameplay to help players intuitively grasp the timing. This instinct naturally develops over time. Parrying is almost like using The Force, but instead of blindly firing into the Death Star, you’re tapping into the rhythm of an enemy’s attacks, finding the perfect beat to cut in, and executing a devastating counter, turning defence into a dominant dance of health-bar draining syncopation.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="ICONIC Esports Moments: EVO Moment 37 - &quot;The Daigo Parry&quot; (Street Fighter)" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/klaWV-szmnY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Witnessing a parry is just as hype as executing one. Case in point: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzS96auqau0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Evo moment #37</a>—the legendary fighting game showdown where Daigo pulled off an almost impossible comeback against Justin Wong in <em>Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike</em>. Instead of holding back and blocking, which would have led to inevitable chip damage and defeat, Daigo <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzS96auqau0&amp;pp=ygUNZXZvIG1vbWVudCAzNw%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">parried every hit from Chun-Li’s super</a>, Houyoku-Sen, with surgical precision. Fifteen strikes on the ground and mid-air nullified in the FGC’s most remarkable display of a player hard reading their opponent in the clutch, creating the perfect opening to punish and steal victory from the jaws of defeat.</p><p>One of my absolute favorite parries in games is <a href="https://youtu.be/NnkDgq_E1qQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kiryu Kazuma’s Tiger Drop</a> in the <em>Yakuza</em>/<em>Like a Dragon</em> series. Tiger Drop is so absurdly powerful that the subsequent titles use it as the carrot on the stick as one of the final items in its skill tree, with flavor text that casually reminds players that it negates all damage. A fact made even funnier when you remember Kiryu patented it in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mc_hQr-2sk&amp;pp=ygUOa2lyeXUgdnMgdGlnZXI%3D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fight against two tigers</a>.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Dante VS Vergil DMD SSS motivation" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/p79oSkNMhIY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>And then there’s Dante’s <a href="https://devilmaycry.fandom.com/wiki/Royalguard_Style#Devil_May_Cry_3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">royalguard</a>, a technique that teeters between being a block and a parry (but we’ll count it). The <em>Devil May Cry</em> wahoo pizza man builds up negated damage with a calm, kung fu stance before detonating it straight back onto his enemies. In the manga, Dante himself admits to hating the move, saying its busted style robs him of the joy of testing out his flashy rolodex of weapons and fighting styles in his arsenal. But in battle, it’s the ultimate “nuh uh,” capable of <a href="https://youtu.be/ShFPq_eDS7U" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ending a boss fight before it even begins</a>.</p><p>Parrying is the ultimate risk-reward gamble, a mechanic that adds an irresistible layer of challenge to action games. It’s the moment where the player stops being the hunted, flips the script, standing ten toes down against the storm and seizing control. With perfect timing, the player orchestrates the flow of combat, shifting momentum in their favor like a benevolent hand tipping the scales of battle. Parrying is challenging to master, but then again, nothing as euphorically gratifying ever comes easy.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/doom-bathroom-renovation-something-awful-for-sale"><h3>Please Know That The House With The Doom Bathroom Is For Sale</h3></a><p>Calling it a 'uniquely remodeled home' seems like an understatement</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/hockey-stickhandling-video-game-dangleverse"><h3>This Video Game Is Also a Hockey Training Tool</h3></a><p>Dangleverse, which I've been using to practice hockey off the rink, is in beta right now</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
