            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> has a daily XP cap and yes, that applies during double XP weekends, too.</p>
<p>Players believe they've uncovered proof that once you've hit 1.5 million XP in a single day, you "literally earn nothing" until the day resets.</p>

<p>That may not sound like a big deal for most players - there's no danger of it happening to me - but the cap also apparently applies when there's a double XP weekend, with one player reporting you can "hit that cap in just 4-5 hours of playing".</p><p>"In a $70 'AAA' game not a mobile free2play title you're being told how much fun you're allowed to have per day," wrote one player. "This isn't a free live service grindfest. This is a full price shooter with a F2P gacha like system glued on top."</p>

</span></p><p>"EA somehow managed to make progression time gated in a premium game, and almost nobody's talking about it. You buy the game, pay for cosmetics, battle pass, AND now you're limited on how much XP you can earn daily? Unreal.It's disgusting and antiplayer to the core.</p>
<p>"Players deserve to know this before buying. Stop pretending this is fine just because it's Battlefield."</p>
<p>"I got 200k XP for a single win in RedSec yesterday, the game was 21 minutes long," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1oqzchg/comment/nnmn21y/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">added</a> another player. "1.5m doesn't really seem that insane to be fair."</p>
<p>"Not that crazy. I got 140,000 XP for a gauntlet game yesterday," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1oqzchg/comment/nnmnl8c/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">opined</a> another.</p>
<p>Not everyone's outraged, however.</p>
<p>"If you hit 1.5m xp in one day you gotta go outside," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1oqzchg/comment/nnmj3cs/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">replied</a> another player, while someone else <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1oqzchg/comment/nnmky9n/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">said</a>: "While I see their point, I think if you're hitting enough daily playtime for this to be an issue that it might be time to reconsider some things about your life."</p>
<p>Even those who wouldn't hit the cap do agree with the spirit of the complaint, though.</p>
<p>"I won’t hit an exp cap either because I can only put myself thru 2hrs max. But I agree with OP, a game that I pay $70 for I should be allowed to grind until my mouse/controller falls apart if I want to," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1oqzchg/comment/nnmnd5d/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">opined</a> someone else.</p><p>Yesterday, we reported that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bots-are-returning-to-battlefield-6s-conquest-breakthrough-and-rush-modes">Battlefield 6 was "reintroducing bots to verified experiences"</a>. Bots were originally removed as part of efforts to "support healthier matchmaking", but they've now been returned to Conquest, Breakthrough, and Rush, with up to 12 popping up in each game mode.

<p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-challenges-are-being-made-far-easier-following-intense-community-feedback">EA and Battlefield Studios made sweeping changes to challenges</a>, reducing the required milestones for class assignments, weapon assignments, gameplay and mastery assignments, and more.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Lieutenant Titus from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-ii">Space Marine 2</a> has become one of the most recognizable faces in all Warhammer 40,000 following the enormous success of the video game. We’ve already seen Games Workshop double-down on the Ultramarines hero with merch, an appearance in the Warhammer 40,000 episode of Amazon's animated anthology, Secret Level, and various cameos across the setting. But now things have leveled up — not just for Titus as a Space Marine, but his place in the ongoing Warhammer 40,000 narrative.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This week, Games Workshop unveiled Captain Demetrian Titus, Master of the Watch, which means Titus has had a much-deserved promotion since the now canon events of Space Marine 2 and Secret Level. Titus is once again Captain of the Ultramarines Second Company, a position he had already held before he was taken into custody on suspicion of heresy by the Inquisition after the events of the first Space Marine game. What does Titus' promotion mean for Sevastus Acheran, the former captain of the Second Company and Master of the Watch who we see in Space Marine 2? Let’s be real here: he’s probably dead. I guess he couldn’t spare enough men.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For Titus, his promotion comes with bigger and tougher responsibilities: he’s been put in charge of defending the Five Hundred Worlds of Ultramar, the realm of Space Marine poster boys, the Ultramarines. With Primarch Roboute Guilliman off gallivanting with his Indomitus Crusade, Titus is now in charge of keeping things safe and sound back home, where new Necron threats have emerged, as they always do.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Games Workshop released a new trailer, below, to hype up this narrative expansion, and it features Titus front and center as he accepts his new job title and what he calls his “impossible mission.” He’s had an eye-catching glow up since we last saw him, and he has a cool new model for use in the Warhammer 40,000 tabletop game to boot. Titus is joined by friends his fans will know well: Ancient Gadriel from Space Marine 2, and Veteran Sergeant Metaurus from Secret Level (he lives!).</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">500 Worlds: Titus is the name for the next major narrative expansion for Warhammer 40,000. According to a post on <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/fm2tm39s/world-championships-preview-captain-titus-battles-nekrosor-ammentar-for-the-five-hundred-worlds-of-ultramar/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Warhammer Community</a>, that includes a set of four books that will tell the story of the Ultramarian Reclamation and the embattled Vespator Front, where Titus and the Ultramarines Second Company "are locked in a desperate struggle against a Necron force rife with the Destroyer curse."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is a big moment for Titus but also the Space Marine video game franchise. It is evidence of the importance of the character to Warhammer 40,000, and the seismic impact Space Marine 2 has had on the setting.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/space-marine-2-developer-says-a-large-chunk-of-fans-have-assumptions-about-the-warhammer-40000-universe-that-are-not-correct-as-a-result-of-the-huge-success-of-the-game">Speaking to IGN at gamescom 2025</a>, Tim Willits, development chief at Saber Interactive, said Space Marine 2’s popularity had opened the door to the grimdark Warhammer 40,000 setting for an army of new fans who weren't necessarily clued up about the intricacies of the universe.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I heard that lots of people now think that Thousand Sons are the only Chaos faction because that's what we had in the game,” Willits said, reflecting on Space Marine 2’s first year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And so people are like, ‘Oh, I guess Thousand Sons, they're Chaos.’ It's like, ‘Actually no it's not.’ They're actually just a small faction. But people are just like, ‘That's the one I played against.’”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This assumption about Chaos extends to the Space Marines themselves. The Ultramaines — the chapter used by Games Workshop itself when introducing newcomers to the tabletop via starter sets — are the protagonists of the Space Marine 2 campaign, although many other factions are available to play as in the PvE and PvP modes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“People have assumptions about the Warhammer 40,000 universe that are not correct,” Willits continued. “Like Thousand Sons being the only Chaos faction. That is kind of humorous. And like, ‘Oh Space Marines are only blue!’ That has been quite humorous to be honest, which is good for us.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the big questions going into the already confirmed Space Marine 3 is whether Saber will venture beyond the Ultramarines and the Thousand Sons in terms of the next campaign. The story seems to set up the addition of the Necrons, which at this point probably wouldn't come as much of a surprise for Space Marine 3. But could other Space Marine chapters also appear? Perhaps other Chaos factions, too? <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/with-the-inquisition-watching-tight-lipped-saber-chief-wont-say-much-about-warhammer-40000-space-marine-3-but-he-has-revealed-games-workshop-is-offering-up-some-ideas-that-are-amazing"><u>We asked Willits about Space Marine 3, but he remained tight-lipped</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But now Titus is firmly back in the fold, we have to wonder, what does the overly suspicious Chaplain Leandros think? He spent pretty much the entirety of Space Marine 2 threatening to end poor Titus at the first sign of corruption, and even after Titus’ heroics, a commendation from Chapter Master Marneus Calgar, and what some think was a word of encouragement from the Emperor himself, Leandros remained unconvinced. If Titus manages to complete this impossible task and defend the 500 worlds, will he finally win Leandros over? Somehow I doubt it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All of this probably feeds into Space Marine 3 in some way. Assuming Space Marine 3 picks up after the events of 500 Worlds, we may well see Titus lead armies into battle, rather than a single squad. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

              <p>Most people assume that they need to spend over a thousand dollars on a MacBook Air to get a decent laptop that will run everyday tasks smoothly. This <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5402/">HP 15.6″ laptop flips that assumption on its head by providing solid performance, a generous 16GB of RAM, and a massive 1TB SSD for just $599, down from $2,599</a>. That’s roughly half the price of Apple’s entry-level laptop but with more storage and a bigger screen. Suddenly, this becomes a no-brainer, based on what you actually get for your money.</p>

<h2>Performance That Covers All Your Bases</h2>
<p>The processor at the heart of this HP laptop is an <strong>Intel Core i3-N305 that runs at 1.8GHz, turbocharging at 3.8GHz</strong> when you need it to. This eight-core chip runs multiple browser tabs, video calls, document editing, and media streaming without choking or forcing you to wait. The 6MB cache memory makes it possible for the processor to access data sooner because such data has been previously accessed repeatedly, which means faster performance when switching between applications or loading up programs you use regularly.</p>
<p>That 16GB of DDR4 RAM makes all the difference in the usage of the laptop: The operating systems and web browsers of today are voracious devourers of memory, so with 16GB, you’ll be able to keep dozens of tabs open at the same time, run Microsoft Office apps, stream music, and handle video conferencing-all without lag. The 1TB PCIe SSD provides blazing-fast boot times and application launches while giving you enough room for years of documents, photos, and videos.</p>



<p>The 15.6-inch FHD touch screen features a 1920 x 1080 resolution for crisp text and detailed images. The IPS panel technology keeps colors accurate and vibrant when you’re looking from an angle, which comes into play when sharing content with others or using the device in different positions. Coming with a screen brightness of 300 nits, you can comfortably use this without squinting at a screen that’s too dimly lit, in well-lit rooms or near windows.</p>
<p>Touch capability brings convenience for those kinds of actions that are just awkward on a trackpad: scrolling through long documents, zooming into images, and navigating <strong>Windows 11’s touch-optimized interface</strong> are all more intuitive when you can simply reach out and touch the screen. The anti-glare coating cuts down on reflections from overhead lights and windows to help save your eyes during long work sessions. The <strong>Intel UHD Graphics run video playback and light photo editing with ease</strong>, though you’ll want a dedicated GPU if you’re planning serious gaming or professional video work.</p>
<p>The USB Type-C port transfers data at 5Gbps to let you move large files to external drives in record time. Dual USB Type-A ports accommodate older peripherals-mice, keyboards, and external hard drives that haven’t made the jump to USB-C. An HDMI 1.4b port connects to an external monitor or TV for a dual-screen setup that’s pretty much a productivity necessity. Wi-Fi 6 delivers faster wireless speeds and better performance in crowded networks than earlier Wi-Fi standards, while Bluetooth 5.4 connects your wireless headphones, mice, and other accessories with improved range and stability.</p>
<p>For $599, you’re paying less than a quarter of the original $2,599 price, which is an absurd discount that puts this laptop within reach of buyers who think decent computing power requires a four-figure investment.</p>

<p>This week marks the arrival of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a> on the Switch 2, and it's packed with a <em>huge</em> cast of characters.</p>
<p>As part of the Zelda Musou's recent launch, the voice actors of many of the characters have now been officially revealed. Fan site <a href="https://x.com/ZeldaUniverse/status/1986445762134155524">Zelda Universe</a> notes how there are a total of 34 English voice actors in this new entry.</p>
<p>This includes the return of Patricia Summersett as Zelda, and talent such as Matt Mercer (known for his role as Ganondorf). You may also recognise other voices like Joe Zieja, who also voiced Claude in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/fire_emblem_three_houses">Fire Emblem: Three Houses</a>.</p>
<p>Here's the full credits list, and below this are as many announcement messages as we could find on social media. These attach the name (and voice) to each character in the game.</p>

<h3>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment Voice Actors:</h3>





















<p>If you're still not sure whether to check out this game, be sure to take a look at our review here on Nintendo Life. Here's a summary:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<em>With Zonai devices to play with, a cracking roster, tons of sexy Sync Strikes to pull off, and a ludicrously slick recreation of early Hyrule to set about kicking ass in, this is dream time for hack-and-slash fans and Zelda enthusiasts alike. Yes, map layouts are still a bit bland, and co-op mode is 30fps, but everything else here combines to make for the best entry in this spin-off franchise to date."</em></p>

<p>In a showdown that lived up to its billing as the ‘Telecom War,’ T1emerged victorious over KT Rolster in the 2025 League of Legends World Championship Grand Final, held in Chengdu, China. The best-of-five series went the distance, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lol-worlds-prediction-grand-final-t1-vs-kt-rolster/">as I predicted</a>, with T1 edging out KT Rolster 3 – 2 in one of the most thrilling finals in recent memory.</p>



<p>This marks history for T1, securing the third consecutive League of Legends World Championship title, pushing Faker ever deeper into the annals of League esports.</p>



<h2 id="h-t1-and-kt-rolster-secure-record-breaking-viewership">T1 and KT Rolster Secure Record-Breaking Viewership</h2>



<p>The matchup between T1 and KT Rolster wasn’t just a battle for the Summoner’s Cup; it was a clash of legacy. It was T1 attempting to further cement its place as the most remarkable esports organization in the world, and KT Rolster’s desire to make a name for itself by winning its first LoL Worlds trophy.</p>



<p>While T1 entered the finals as the defending champion, aiming for a three-peat, KT Rolster had reached the GF of Worlds for the first time after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kt-rolster-shatter-worlds-2025-finals-first-time/">decimating Gen.G</a>.</p>



<p>The tournament shattered viewership records, with the final match drawing millions of fans worldwide. T1’s quarter-final against Anyone’s Legend peaked at a whopping 3.27 million viewers, which made up a massive chunk of the 90.3 million watch hours recorded across the entire event.</p>



<p>There’s a reason why League Worlds is considered the most valuable esports tournament in the world.</p>



<p>Lee ‘Faker’ Sang-hyeok has had a stellar year thus far, but this latest win propels him even further into the record books. Alongside his squad, he’s cemented himself as the undisputed GOAT of esports.</p>



<p>With this win, T1 not only secures their fourth overall Worlds title but also becomes the first team with three consecutive wins, a record that might <strong>never be beaten </strong>for as long as League of Legends exists.</p>



<p>Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> if you enjoyed this year’s League of Legends World Championship grand final.</p>

<figure data-uuid="0a54ee38e4828"><a title="Dragon Power - BAB" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0a54ee38e4828/dragon-power-bab.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Hello everyone, and welcome to another edition of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/box-art-brawl">Box Art Brawl</a>!</p>
<p>Last week, we checked out the wonderful Animal Crossing: Wild World for the DS and, as expected, the western design won the day with a whopping 84%. Good effort Japan, but this one just ain't it.</p>
<p>This time, we're looking at <strong>Dragon Power</strong> for the NES. Released in 1988, this was a top-down adventure game not entirely unlike Zelda II, in which you would explore environments before shifting to a side-scrolling viewpoint when facing off against enemies. It's said to be based on the Chinese novel Journey to the West in which a kung-fu protagonist is on a quest to recover the Crystal Balls.</p><div><figure data-videoid="PA87rC9nG4k" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PA87rC9nG4k?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytPA87rC9nG4k" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/PA87rC9nG4k?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PA87rC9nG4k?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38f11flqirjw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>838k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>We've got North America, Europe, and Japan all vying for the prize today, so let's get cracking!</p>
<h2>North America</h2>
<figure data-uuid="d388c84d7aea5"><a title="Dragon Power US" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d388c84d7aea5/dragon-power-us.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/169272-dragon-power">Bandai / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Okay, so this is very typical of those early NES box art designs, right? We've got the protagonist in the bottom left sporting a pretty large foot with teeny, tiny twinkle toes, while the background is mostly covered by a menacing green dragon. Doesn't it look a little familiar, though...?</p>
<h2>Japan</h2>
<figure data-uuid="765dbbe637db7"><a title="Dragon Ball JP" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/765dbbe637db7/dragon-ball-jp.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/169272-dragon-power">Bandai / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Hahaaa, <em>yes</em>! Some of you might have already known, but Dragon Power in the US is actually a Dragon Ball game. Released in Japan as <strong>Dragon Ball: Shenlong no Nazo</strong> and in Europe as <strong>Dragon Ball: Le Secret du Dragon</strong>, the American design basically got rid of all references to the hit manga/anime series.</p>
<p>This cover art features the iconic Goku in the foreground with Bulma and Yamcha in the background, presumably either levitating or running atop the back of the dragon Shenron.</p>
<h2>Europe</h2>
<figure data-uuid="80009f6568181"><a title="Dragon Ball EU" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/80009f6568181/dragon-ball-eu.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/169272-dragon-power">Bandai / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Okay, so Europe's design basically features the same artwork as Japan, but we've also got some character portraits in the bottom left, with everything surrounded by a pretty basic blue background. Japan and Europe also share the same art style for the title, and dare we say that North America's approach with this might be a tad better..?</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/09/how-ghost-of-yotei-foreshadows-a-dark-period-in-japanese-history/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/how-ghost-of-y%C5%8Dtei-foreshadows-a-dark-period-in-japanese-history.1348057/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>After the stellar reception that <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/ghost-of-tsushima">Ghost of Tsushima</a> received, you might have expected that the team at <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/sucker-punch-productions">Sucker Punch Productions</a> were ready to wade into the nation-spanning conflict that was the Sengoku Jidai. Instead, the developers chose a timeline and setting for Ghost of Yōtei that would skip the Warring States period, and it’s a choice that really worked to their advantage.</p>
<p>Ghost of Yōtei transports players to Ezo, the northern island region of Japan which we now know as Hokkaido. Set three hundred years after the original game, the year is 1603: the same year that Tokugawa Ieyasu is appointed shogun, ushering in an era of peace and stability after centuries of infighting between powerful warlords. Dubbed the Edo period, this golden age in Japanese history would last for more than 250 years, prior to The Meiji Restoration of 1868 and the end to the isolationism that kept Western influences at bay that this brought.</p>
<p><iframe title="Ghost of Yōtei - Launch Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sLcksHR30UA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In 1603, our protagonist, Atsu, returns to her homeland in the shadow of the towering Mount Yōtei. At this time in history, Ezo wasn’t formally a part of Japan, and existed as a wild frontier beyond the reach of the emerging Tokugawa shogunate. It’s been sixteen years since Atsu was last here. Sixteen years since she was left for dead after a band of ronin slew her family forcing her to flee south where she became a sword for hire, fighting in the peasant infantry that lost the Battle of Sekigahara.</p>
<p>Left unchallenged, the rogue samurai known as The Yōtei Six have now established themselves as a formidable faction in Ezo, exploiting the native people and crushing any who oppose them. That’s until Atsu shows up of course, vowing to hunt down the outlaws who slew her parents and brother. She’s not the only one who has these ronin in her crosshairs: among the rebellious cast of companions that accompany Atsu, there is also the Matsumae clan.</p>

<p>Descendants of the Takeda, one of the big players during the Sengoku period, the Matsumae were considered the northern gatekeepers of Japan, establishing a stronghold in southern Ezo. From here, they began to exert their influence by forging political alliances with the indigenous Ainu people, whose descendants had occupied the land for many centuries.</p>

<p>With their own language, societal structure, and deeply spiritual beliefs, there was always going to be a culture clash between the semi-nomadic Ainu and their Matsumae neighbours. In <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yōtei</a>, players are presented with a thoughtful insight into Ainu life when Atsu visits the many kotans (villages) spread across Ezo, learning more about their way of life. From their rituals and crafts to their gathering-focused economy, every aspect of Ainu life is conducted in a way that harmonises with the natural world, which they believe is governed by spirits known as the Kamuy. During her time with the Ainu, Atsu tracks a band of thieves who turn out to be a family stealing clothes and food for their newborn. Instead of punishing them, the villagers welcome them into their egalitarian community with open arms. Atsu also rescues an orphaned bear cub which the kotan raises as their own, promising to later kill the animal in an “iomante” ritual, honouring the bear by releasing its divine spirit back to the kamuy world.</p>
<p>Not all Ainu practices are compatible with our own sensibilities, yet there’s a wholesome spirituality there – something that the growing number of southern settlers would soon exploit. Over time, the native peoples of Ezo would become more reliant on trade with the Matsumae, exchanging natural goods such as fish and furs for sake, tools, and cloth. Predictably, as their reliance on this trade deepened, the Matsumae took the opportunity to drive up prices, unfairly tipping the scales in what was once a mutually balanced relationship. Those colonising tendrils continued to unfurl and squeeze the Ainu when the mainlanders began to eye Ezo’s rich natural resources, competing with their fisheries, and descending on the region’s lucrative gold mines.</p>
<p>In Ghost of Yōtei, we don’t get to see the full extent of this exploitation, though it’s clear that many of the Ainu are concerned about losing their autonomy and way of life as the shadow of the shogunate spreads further across their ancestral lands. One interesting example of this comes early on in-game when the Matsumae employ Atsu to guard the construction of a bridge. She discovers that the seemingly peaceful Ainu are responsible, not a group of marauding bandits. Despite the progress that infrastructure such as roads and bridges will bring to Ezo, not all of its inhabitants are willing to let the samurai extend their foothold.</p>

<p>Even when the disparate Ainu tribes united, they ultimately couldn’t prevent the steady advance of their occupiers. The Matsumae didn’t relent in squeezing them further, even driving some tribes to the brink of starvation, until they had no other option but to revolt. In 1669 the Ainu chieftain, Shakushain, led an armed rebellion that initially succeeded in driving back the Matsumae, who were severely outnumbered even if they were more technologically advanced.</p>
<p>This rebellion threatened the shogunate’s rule over Ezo. In response, several neighbouring samurai clans swiftly attacked and snuffed out the resistance, executing Shakushain and accelerating the subjugation of the Ainu. Forced to sign a peace treaty, tribe leaders were truly powerless as the Matsumae freely established more trading posts, inflating prices and tightening their economic chokehold.</p>

<p>Much later, during the Meiji Restoration (which saw Japan return to imperial rule after dissolving the shogunate) Ezo would be formally annexed, thereafter known as Hokkaido. This was part of Japan’s modern movement towards shedding dogmatic isolationist policies and fully embracing industrialisation. Needless to say, this didn’t improve the Ainu’s standing in Japanese society. Adopting a similar approach to the United States, the native Ainu were forcibly expelled from their homeland to make way for settlers, with those who remained forced to assimilate and denied the right to speak their ancestral language.</p>
<p>Again, we only see the seeds of this travesty begin to take root in Ghost of Yōtei. But behind Atsu’s katana-waving quest for revenge there’s plenty of foreshadowing that makes the game’s setting far more interesting than another spin on the Sengoku Jidai. Much like its predecessor, the sequel hones in on a fascinating historical flashpoint where the setting becomes the main character, portraying the samurai as complex and nuanced instead of idly romanticising them.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Now that Dying Light: The Beast has been on the market for several weeks, Techland has reorganized its developers and intends to get back on the Dying Light 2: Stay Human train. In a post on social media, franchise director Tymon Smektala asked the community what it would like to see prioritized in the coming months, suggesting that at least half a year of content is planned.</p>



<p>This was always on the cards, as Techland stressed that Dying Light: The Beast represented an important stopgap in the ongoing support of Dying Light 2: Stay Human, the live-service title that debuted in 2022.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-next-for-dying-light-2-stay-human">What’s Next for Dying Light 2: Stay Human?</h2>



<p>The post on social media published by Techland’s franchise director of Dying Light has exciting implications for Dying Light 2: Stay Human, the live-service, open-world zombie apocalypse title that dropped in 2022.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">As The Beast was released we can now move more people to support DL2:SH as promised. What are the most important things we should handle? What kind of content/updates/fixes you’d expect right<br>now or in 3-6 months?</p>— Tymon Smektała (@smektalaTM) <a href="https://twitter.com/smektalaTM/status/1987249247402578122?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 8, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>In a community-led decision, Techland has opted to have fans decide what comes next, with Smektala reaching out to the players to see what they’d like prioritized. Techland has always been focused on the community with Dying Light, and hosts a submissions function on the game’s themed website that users can lean on to make their requests and wishes heard.</p>



<p>The Dying Light series has plenty left in the tank. Following the launch of Dying Light: The Beast, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dying-light-the-beast-techland-dying-light-3/">a new era of sorts was established</a>, and the game’s ending directly links to future projects that can easily be predicted. With a universe that still has plenty to give, there’s no telling where the road will eventually take Dying Light.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nyt-connections-hints-solutions-november-9-882/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nyt-connections-hints-today-882-%E2%80%94clues-and-answers-for-sunday-november-9.1348039/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Another week comes to a close, and I’m hopeful that your NYT Connections streak has kept up for the duration. I’m also optimistic that I’ve <strong>helped you </strong>maintain that streak by providing you with the best NYT Connections hints and solutions all week long. If you want more of that today, read on.</p>



<p>Today’s NYT Connections tips and solutions are waiting just below.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-november-9">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (November 9)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #882:</p>



<ul>
<li>NOODLE</li>



<li>BRUSH</li>



<li>CRANIUM</li>



<li>MIRROR</li>



<li>PUFNSTUF</li>



<li>REFLECT</li>



<li>TIGHT</li>



<li>MUSE</li>



<li>COMPACT</li>



<li>LUNAR</li>



<li>NAIL FILE</li>



<li>THICK</li>



<li>DENSE</li>



<li>DELIBERATE</li>



<li>CRONUT</li>



<li>TWEEZERS</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>Think beauty tools or grooming essentials you might stash in a makeup bag or bathroom drawer.</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em>These words all describe things that are tightly arranged, thickly clustered, or densely filled</em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>Each of these verbs evokes contemplation, pondering, or mental wandering—perfect for a philosophical mood.</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>This group blends real and invented terms that share a playful, oddball vibe—some are names, some are snacks, some are just fun to say.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, November 9.</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-for-today-november-9-882">NYT Connections Answers for Today, November 9 (#882)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– BRUSH, MIRROR, NAIL FILE, TWEEZERS</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – COMPACT, DENSE, THICK, TIGHT</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – DELIBERATE, MUSE, NOODLE, REFLECT</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – CRANIUM, CRONUT, LUNAR, PUFNSTUF</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[ARC Raiders Refuses to Slow Down and Secures Another Peak Player Record]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-new-peak-player-count-secured/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/arc-raiders-refuses-to-slow-down-and-secures-another-peak-player-record.1348036/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>ARC Raiders continues to take the world by storm, this time generating a new all-time high peak player count record on Steam more than a week after release. It’s proving to be the most sensational title to hit the market in years, and everyone from casual gamers to hardcore extraction shooter fans is getting involved.</p>



<p>On Steam, ARC Raiders just hit 416,517 concurrent players, up from the recent high of 354,000. It’s indicative of something remarkable, as ten days into the game’s lifecycle, it’s bucking trends and continuing to soar.</p>







<p>In the numbers, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-review-refreshing-extraction-shooter/">the reviews</a>, and the ratings, ARC Raiders is the most popular extraction shooter ever made. The sentiment surrounding this game is enough to throw the likes of Escape from Tarkov, Hunt: Showdown, Arena Breakout: Infinite, and Delta Force out the window entirely.</p>



<p>People are soaking up every element of ARC Raiders, from the aesthetic that’s dripping in retro-futurism to the social mechanics that are making ARC Raiders a joy to explore.</p>



<p>On Steam, ARC Raiders just hit <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-hit-new-peak-player-count-broke-servers/">another all-time high</a> peak concurrent user count, which is rare considering the game has been out for <strong>ten days</strong>. In most cases, games start to inevitably ebb in terms of player count at this point, but ARC Raiders is <strong>evolving</strong>.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>What’s more impressive is that it’s only getting better. Embark Studios has lined up <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-new-2025-roadmap/">a roadmap of content</a> and upgrades that it’ll drip feed into ARC Raiders, and the team wants to support the ambitious extraction shooter for a whopping <strong>ten years</strong>.</p>



<p>Things could take a bit of a dip this coming week, as Escape from Tarkov, arguably the most prolific spearhead extraction shooter ever made, finally <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-tarkov-1-0-being-released/">hits a 1.0 release</a> and emerges on new platforms, namely Steam. If anything can poach players from ARC Raiders, it’ll be that, so it’ll be interesting to see what loyalty ARC players have stumped up in the short term.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> Global Test Ride is currently taking place this weekend, and it looks like the game engine it's running on might have been uncovered.</p>
<p>It's Bandai Namco's new in-house engine SOL-AVES. Thanks to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1or8w63/kirby_air_riders_appears_to_run_on_the_solaves/">some detective work</a>, the engine's logo has been spotted in the game demo's Intellectual Property Notices. We've taken a look ourselves and can confirm it's listed. The <a href="https://www.trademarkia.com/sol-aves-79369433">trademark for this engine</a> was filed in "late 2024", but it's apparently been in the making since around 2019, and was <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/bandai-namco-is-still-working-on-new-in-house-game-engine-update-reveals/">initially revealed in 2022</a>.</p><div><figure data-videoid="WA6pqBIEskk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytWA6pqBIEskk" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4035aelukwgx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>838k</span></a></p>

<p>Recruitment and training for the engine is supposedly ongoing, and its first major public test appears to be this new title by legendary game director Masahiro Sakurai. Below you can see new engineers testing it out. This new game engine has also previously <a href="https://bandainamcostudios.snar.jp/jobboard/detail.aspx?id=bew5uZn3nmm_5RVLIxMdPg">shown up on Bandai Namco's official website</a> in job listings.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Bandai Namco Studios develops its own in-house game engine. As part of their training, new engineers had the opportunity to try out our in-house developed game engine! During the training, after learning the basic operations, the participants created a simple game. The ease of use of the in-house game engine has been very well received."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the past, Bandai Namco has made use of video game engines such as Unity and Unreal Engine for major releases.</p>

This may be one of the game's most basic quests, but as with many of its outings, the act of getting there and getting back out can be more challenging than anything. So, we'll share the exact location of the quest below so that you can take some of the guesswork out, allowing you to focus on making the magic happen.</p><p>You won't need to extract to complete Power Out, but you may potentially be making quite a trek to reach the quest location. It's not a bad idea to toss on a combat-focused augment with a good gun and shield, as well as plenty of ammo and healing items to ensure you're prepared to take on anyone standing in your way.</p><p>When you're ready to tackle Power Out, follow the steps below.</p><h2>How to complete the Power Out quest on Spaceport</h2><p>The first step to completing Power Out is to head all the way south on Spaceport to find the Electrical Substation. Depending on where you spawn on the map, this could be quite a trek, so while the area itself is pretty tame, don't be shocked to run into trouble on the way there.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4599087-19a64cbf91d32-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4599087" data-ratio="0.55981595092025" data-width="1956" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4599087-19a64cbf91d32-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4599087"></a><figcaption>Electrical Substation location</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4599087-19a64cbf91d32-screenshoturl.jpg"></figure><p>Once you arrive, you'll be prompted to find signs of an engineer who has gone missing, which is very easy to find.

Unfortunately, due to being so far south on the map, you're going to have to walk quite a way to get to an elevator. Your choices are the South Elevator to the northwest or the East Elevator to the northeast, so make sure you're reloaded and healed up, then set off. We'll be rooting for your survival.</p><p>For more on Arc Raiders, check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-arc-raiders-quests-full-mission-list/1100-6535922/" data-ref-id="1100-6535922">f</a><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-arc-raiders-quests-full-mission-list/1100-6535922/" data-ref-id="1100-6535922">ull quest list</a>.</p>

Flickering Threat requires you to jump into the Dam Battlegrounds map and fix up a power generator, so don't think you're getting any time off today. And if you're feeling a little lost on how to complete this quest, we're here to help you out.</p><p>While you don't need to extract to complete Flickering Threat, <strong>you will need 4 Wires to repair the generator during the quest</strong>, so make sure to add those to your inventory or loot them from the Power Generation Complex while you're exploring. Without these in your inventory, the quest can not be progressed.</p><p>When you're ready to tackle Flickering Threat, follow the steps below.</p><h2>Where to find the Generator Hall</h2><p>The Generator Hall is located on the left side of the Power Generation Complex in the northern region of the Dam Battlegrounds map. It's a high-traffic location that is often filled with both ARC and raiders, so come prepared for a fight just in case.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4599078-19a64cc0f7624-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4599078" data-ratio="0.56468906361687" data-width="1399" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4599078-19a64cc0f7624-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4599078"></a><figcaption>Generator Hall</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4599078-19a64cc0f7624-screenshoturl.jpg"></figure><p>Once you reach the Generator Hall, you'll be prompted to repair a generator.

<p>Classic building and resource management gets cosy</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>If you're a fan of cosy-style games and don't mind some classic building and resource management sim action, you might be interested in the upcoming Switch release <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/little_rocket_lab">Little Rocket Lab</a>. This game originally made its <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2025/09/little-rocket-lab-is-a-timed-xbox-exclusive-coming-to-game-pass-this-october?utm_campaign=related-articles&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_source=nintendolife.com&amp;utm_content=in-article">console debut in October on the Xbox</a>.</p>
<p>After being <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/round-up-every-game-from-wholesome-snack-2024-coming-to-nintendo-switch">announced during the 'Wholesome Snack 2024' presentation</a> last December, it seems it might finally have a release date. According to the official store page on Nintendo's website and eShop, it will launch next month on <strong>10th December 2025</strong> for $19.99 (or your regional equivalent).</p>
<p>This game is compatible with the Switch 2 and will apparently take up 1.8 GB on both Switch systems. Here's the official description, and you can see the original announcement trailer above:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You play as Morgan, an aspiring engineer headed home to complete your family's dream project - a rocket ship! Finding home not quite how she left it, Morgan will need to research and build clever contraptions and sprawling factories to help the locals. From simple drills and furnaces to complex assemblers, cranes and miles of conveyor belts, you'll convert local resources into useful materials and bring industry back to sleepy St. Ambroise.</p>
<p>- Build clever contraptions and sprawling factories to solve puzzles and help the town<br>
- Get to know the locals, make lifelong friendships and become the heart of the community<br>
- Research and invent new machines, energy sources and mechanical friends<br>
- Discover a heartwarming story as Morgan, an aspiring engineer with high hopes for town!<br>
- Finally build your family's rocket ship!</p>
<p>Outside of smashing together crazy contraptions, you'll need to mine out resources, explore coasts, railyards, quarries and underground areas - each part of town has its own materials to inspire you! You'll need to complete challenges, incorporate electrical elements, water, cranes, furnaces, crafting, automate through robotics, and loads more to ensure St. Ambroise returns to its former glory. Are you ready to roll up your sleeves?</p>
<p><em>"Little Rocket Lab is a classic building and resource management sim, set in a cozy village filled with NPCs who want to help... and sometimes hinder. With friendships to rekindle, puzzles to solve and a huge world to explore, everything is in place to make this experience a blast from start to finish."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Over on Steam, this title has received "Very Positive" user reviews, so if you're into this kind of game, it might be worth keeping tabs on. It was also released in October for PC Game Pass.</p>

<p>Is Crash finally back?</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="56093ff1da2ad"><a title="Crash Team Racing" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/56093ff1da2ad/crash-team-racing.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Activision</em></figcaption></figure><p>Crash Bandicoot hasn't been sighted for a while now, but Crash fans think they might have spotted something that could be tied to a new game project or at least a return in some way or form.</p>
<p>This development comes from the <a href="https://x.com/BeenoxTeam">official Beenox social media account</a>. Beenox, in case you need a refresher, is the same team that worked on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/crash_team_racing_nitro-fueled">Crash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled</a> and has also helped out with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/crash_bandicoot_4_its_about_time">Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, the developer <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/crashbandicoot/comments/1op4zhp/beenox_changed_his_banner_and_crash_appears_twice/">uploaded a banner featuring Crash in a kart</a> and then removed it shortly after. What's interesting about this is it appears to be based on Crash's character model from the fourth outing - a title that was released well after the most recent racing game.</p>

<p>So, that's it for now, but if there are any other significant updates or developments here, we'll be sure to let you know.</p>
<p>Interestingly, this happens to follow a rumour in October about Crash Bandicoot <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/rumour-sonic-prime-studio-reportedly-working-on-crash-bandicoot-animation-for-netflix">potentially getting his own animation on Netflix</a>. If you missed it, it's claimed WildBrain Studios - the same team behind Sonic Prime (and also helping out with the upcoming <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/minecraft">Minecraft</a> animated series on Netflix) is behind it. 2026 will also mark Crash's 30th anniversary.</p>
<p>For now, the current stories circulating about Crash Bandicoot are just rumours - so nothing has been officially confirmed or announced, and there's no guarantee this discovery will necessarily lead to a new project, reveal or update.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-slashes-this-1500w-power-station-to-peanuts-7-outlets-save-you-during-winter-blackouts.1347964/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Winter storms have a way of knocking out power at the worst possible times but the <strong>Jackery Explorer 1000 (1500W) portable power station</strong> offers a solid solution to keep your essentials running when the grid goes dark. Right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5401/">Amazon has slashed the price from $899 to $449</a>, which makes this one of the best times to grab reliable backup power without emptying your wallet. You’ll also get a <strong>free 3-port 103W fast charger as a bonus</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5401/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<h2>Delivers Power When You Need It Most</h2>
<p>The Explorer 1000 houses a 1<strong>,070Wh LiFePO4 battery within its compact frame, weighing only 23.8 pounds</strong>. This capacity translates to real-world performance that matters during an outage: running a full-size refrigerator for roughly 10 hours to preserve your groceries, powering a space heater for about 1.5 hours to stay warm, or keeping your internet router and laptop running for an entire day to work from home. Most household appliances are handled easily with its<strong> continuous output of 1,500W, while the 3,000W surge capacity</strong> is there when devices like refrigerators need that initial power boost to start.</p>
<p>The LFP battery chemistry separates this model from the more affordable options: Typical lithium-ion batteries do not last long, but this LiFePO4 arrangement retains <strong>upwards of 70 percent of its original capacity after 4,000 charge cycles</strong>. That kind of longevity equates to well over a decade of service, making that $449 price tag seem much more reasonable if you calculate it on a cost-per-year-of-ownership basis. This battery technology is also less susceptible to temperature extremes than a standard lithium-ion cell.</p>



<p>Getting from empty to full in just one hour through the emergency charging mode via the Jackery app changes how you can use this power station. If you hear about an incoming storm, you can top it off quickly instead of waiting overnight. The default 1.7-hour charging mode balances speed with battery health for everyday use, which helps explain that 10-year lifespan claim. <strong>ChargeShield 2.0 technology automatically regulates voltage and temperature</strong>, and safeguards both the power station and whatever devices you plug into it.</p>



<p>Port selection matters when you try to keep multiple devices alive during an outage: The <strong>Explorer 1000 has three AC outlets for standard plugs, two USB-C that provide up to 100W for fast charging laptops and tablets, one USB-A for older devices, and a DC car port for 12V equipment</strong>. This means not having to choose between charging your phone and powering your CPAP machine.</p>
<p>The <strong>foldable handle and relatively light weight</strong> make this truly portable despite its capacity. You can take it down to your basement during bad weather, toss it in the back of your truck for that weekend camping trip, or bring it to an outdoor concert where your band requires power for amps and mixers. Lighting from built-in LED lights helps navigate through darkened homes during nighttime power outages, with no fumbling for flashlights in the dark.</p>
<p>At $449, you’re getting backup power that costs less than a typical emergency generator while offering more flexibility and cleaner energy. Gas generators require fuel storage, regular maintenance, and produce fumes that make indoor use impossible. The deal is a massive 50% discount from the regular $899 price (and you get a free fast charger as well) which makes this an all-time low worth grabbing before winter weather arrives in full force.</p>

            <p>
MiHoYo appear to be eternally busy. After printing copious amounts of money with games like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/honkai-star-rail">Honkai: Star Rail</a>, they are continuing to do so with future releases like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/genshin-impact-devs-next-game-looks-so-much-like-animal-crossing-im-almost-not-sure-why-it-exists">Petit Planet</a> (or Not <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/animal-crossing">Animal Crossing</a>) and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/theres-a-new-honkai-game-on-the-way-with-characters-from-star-rail-and-impact-3rd-and-it-sure-does-look-like-a-pokemon-clone">Honkai: Nexus Anima</a> (Not Pokemon). Now, it turns out, they're also working on an MMO, seemingly codenamed Genesis, that seemingly in some capacity incorporates AI, it's just unclear what kind.
</p>
<p>
As spotted over on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/mihoyo-is-working-on-new-open-world-game-mmo-pvp-ue5-ai.1346665/">ResetEra</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hoyoverse-releases-first-tease-for-new-unreal-engine-5-fantasy-mmo-and-yes-it-uses-ai">Eurogamer</a>), miHoYo shared a very short kind of teaser video acting as a sort of recruitment post for said MMO that's described as a "fantasy realism open world game." Details are quite slim, unsurprisingly, but here are the ones of note. It'll be made in Unreal Engine 5, it'll have PvP, "Intellectual NPC," and the two potentially controversial bits, an "Artificial Intelligence Stimulated Eco System," and "All-Terrain Battle AI."

A few points worth mentioning here. Something could have been lost in translation here, so it might not be talking about the bad kind of AI you and I hate. AI as a term has obviously been used to describe NPC behaviours for a long time too, so it could just be that. But miHoYo are no strangers to AI usage, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zenless-zone-zero-studio-uses-ai-technology-to-smoothen-development-process">they've even done so in Zenless Zone Zero</a>, and I'm not sure what an AI stimulated eco system could mean other than the bad kind. So, take all of this cautiously and skeptically until there's more details.

Judging from the very short teaser that exists, whatever Genesis ends up being like, it'll probably be a lot less anime (as vague a descriptor as that is) than games like Genshin Impact. A potential divergence for the company that relies on people getting much too invested in jiggly, overly cute women. Well, and the occasional man these days too. Diversity win!

<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-falconeer">The Falconeer</a> turns five years old next week, and ahead of that its developer Tom Sala has put in the work for a pretty big update. Update undersells it a touch I think, because it's being billed as a full-on remaster, complete with a touched up look, and plenty of mechanical changes. So, let's detail those details!
</p>
<p>
For one, landing sounds like it should be a lot easier, as you can land just by flying close to a perch without having to press a button. Speaking of buttons, the dash and acrobatics have been changed to have separate buttons and controls. Collision accuracy has been improved now too, with tighter movement to boot.

<p>
It's not just mechanics that have been updated, your warbird itself is looking fresher with individual feathers and more detail. Its head stays leveled when turning "(as birds of prey do)," and there are now wing flexing and steering animations. Landing and diving animations have been improved too, and player bird collision avoidance should be less annoying. I'm always striving to be less annoying! There's a long list of quality of life improvements, control tweaks, visual changes, bug fixes, and even just outright new stuff that you can check out in this <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1135260/view/591787131954790437?l=english">Steam post</a>.
</p><p>
Talking in more depth in an earlier <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1135260/view/506217467911078264?l=english">Steam post</a> about the remaster - which is out now and completely free for those that own the game, and is included if you haven't bought it yet - Sala was quite open about the base game's launch. "Every release is horror, but this one was pretty bad by every account," Sala wrote. 
</p>
<p>
"And let's be honest the PC launch suffered in many ways, some my own mistakes biting me, some consequences of releasing an indie console launch title in a week where both Xbox and Playstation were launching their next gen." Sala went on to explain how this is his chance at "doing it better," and better reflecting a game that's deeply personal to him, spending his free time working on this remaster whenever he could. As always, making games is hard! Nice work.
</p>
<p>
If you don't own The Falconeer, you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1135260/The_Falconeer_Revolution_Remaster/">try out it and its new remaster on Steam right now</a> completely for free until November 10th.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The original Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 may be coming to Xbox Game Pass. While not confirmed, a fan found an official advertisement showing the game off.</p>



<p>There’s a lot to be excited about if you’re a Call of Duty fan right now. The biggest, of course, is the release of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-release-date-remains-unchanged/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 7</a>, the next big game in the franchise. With constant updates to Black Ops 6 and Warzone, it’s a good time to be a fan. Fortunately, many titles in the series are available on Game Pass, both Xbox and PC. Well, a new Xbox advertisement may have spoiled one of the next entries to come to the service.</p>



<h2 id="h-xbox-game-pass-possibly-getting-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-2-soon">Xbox Game Pass Possibly Getting Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 Soon</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>The rumor comes from Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/XboxGamePass/comments/1ory64g/mw2_coming_to_game_pass/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TypicalNarr</a>, who discovered a simple Xbox Game Pass Premium ad on their console. In it, it shows many of the games on the service like Sea of Thieves and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-game-pass-adds-over-90-new-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hogwarts Legacy</a>. However, one game caught the user’s eye that isn’t on there: the original Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 from 2009.&nbsp;As of writing, the game has never been on Game Pass, so the usage of the game’s cover art is a bit suspicious.</p>



<p>While it does appear official, take it with a grain of salt. One user on Reddit mentioned that 2022’s Modern Warfare 2, part of the reboot trilogy, is on the service, so perhaps it was a mix-up. Still, fans have been hoping for classic Call of Duty titles to come to Game Pass. It’s long been rumored that titles like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-world-at-war-and-infinite-warfare-appear-with-included-with-game-pass-online/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">World at War</a> would drop on the subscription service with Activision’s purchase by Xbox. Hopefully, if true, more games like Black Ops 2 and Modern Warfare 3 can come out for newer fans to try out.</p>



<p>What do you think of Modern Warfare 2 going to Game Pass? Which older Call of Duty games do you want to see on the service? World at War? Black Ops? More Modern Warfare? Let us know in the comments and on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the official Insider Gaming Discord</a>!</p>

Slightly serious one here folks! The studio behind <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-blue-prince">Blue Prince</a>, one of this year's best received games, is asking for some help for one of their lead playtesters, Matthew "Iggy" Kowalski. As shared on Bluesky, Iggy has polycystic kidney disease, leaving him with only a few months to find a living kidney donor.
</p>
<p>
Developer Dogubomb wrote on Bluesky that "Iggy was an invaluable tester and contributed so much to the project.

Iggy lays his situation out very plainly on his <a href="https://www.iggyland.org/">personal website</a>: "I have a disease that requires a living kidney donor. There are no other viable options for me. I have only a few months before I will need to have this surgery before getting extremely sick and dying." He explains that his disease causes his kidneys to "have cysts grow all over them and make them massive in size. As they do so, the kidneys grow less and less in function. Think like the chest buster in Alien, except it’s not an alien baby and we don’t anticipate it coming to theatres this fall."
</p><p>
I share this with you because quite frankly, if you have a kidney you don't need, it would be nice if you could help out a dev in need! Iggy even clarifies that you don't need to be a perfect match, as some collaboration can be done with other donors to find the best-fit. There's more details on Iggy's website, so tell a friend even if you can't do it yourself!

			<p>Yesterday was N7 Day, the yearly franchise appreciation day that Mass Effect developer BioWare has held every November 7 since 2012. In the game, N7 is a vocational code in the Systems Alliance military, where the N designates special forces and the 7 refers to the highest level of proficiency, thus referring to the main character, Shepard, and his strike team.</p>



<p>N7 Day 2025 <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-mass-effect-continues-to-be-in-development-amidst-new-features-to-build-and-romances-to-figure-out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delivered confirmation that the studio, despite the layoffs, is still working on the next Mass Effect game</a>. In the blog post, long-time Executive Producer Mike Gamble inserted a secret message that the fans eventually decoded, revealing a new artwork from the upcoming game. The art depicts Krogan characters and features the subtitle 'Civil War'. This hints at one of the themes we may discover in the game: a major division within the Krogan race between at least two factions. </p>



<p>Those who have played previous Mass Effect games are certainly familiar with the Krogan, a species of large, reptilian bipeds native to the planet Tuchanka. They famously survived despite the harsh environment of their home world, only to destroy it themselves in a nuclear war. The survivors split into tribes that were constantly at war with one another. Indeed, they are considered a warrior race, but some of them do not necessarily wish to perpetuate the seemingly endless cycle of fighting that has characterized the Krogans. This may be the primary source of the disagreement, though it's only speculation at this point, of course.</p>



<p>The next Mass Effect is at least three to four years away, and fans may have to make do with just art teasers in the near future. There is, however, <a href="https://wccftech.com/mass-effect-tv-series-in-development-at-prime-video-with-fast-and-furious-9-writer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Amazon TV series in development</a>, and BioWare confirmed that it will be an original story (written by Daniel Casey and directed by Doug Jung) set after the original Mass Effect trilogy. We'll keep you updated once there are casting news on the show.</p>

While there is a notable enough sentiment that old games are worse because they are old, so should therefore be either let to rot or to be remade so that they are "better," I think this argument goes out the window when you look at something like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-xi">Final Fantasy 11</a>. That thing came out in 2022! And it launched on PS2 first! Yet here it is more than two decades later, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/even-23-years-on-final-fantasy-11-is-still-getting-updates-with-one-coming-thatll-let-you-change-how-your-character-looks">still getting updates</a>, and now, potentially, an entire new zone.
</p>
<p>
This week saw a new Freshly Picked Vana'diel, a semi-regularly held livestream from the Final Fantasy 11 team similar in nature to Final Fantasy 14's Letter from the Producer streams that details upcoming additions or changes, that sort of thing. It was held in Japanese, which I don't speak, but luckily some <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxi/comments/1oqvpee/freshly_picked_future_plans/">Redditors</a> who do explained that the team is seemingly preparing for the ability to make new areas.

As mentioned, this was originally a PS2 game, the PC release came a short while after, and that fact also appears to be a problem for the FF11 team. Everything is still made using the original PS2 dev kits, which obviously will be massively outdated by this point. Judging from some of the comments, on-stream the team discussed that they're working on plans in the event that these dev kits don't work anymore so that they can make new equipment still, and in particular start making new areas again.
</p><p>
I may not have spent any time with Final Fantasy 11 myself, but it really can't be understated how valuable it is that this 23 year old <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-mmos-mmorpgs">MMO</a> is still going, let alone the fact it's still getting new content. These spaces become second homes (or even a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/second-life">Second Life</a>) for some people, and sure, we should strive to not be too beholden to our computers, but they are still realms of virtual existence that deserve to be maintained. A new area would be pretty significant as there hasn't been a big new one since its 2015 expansion Seekers of Adoulin. Fingers crossed for those of you still playing!
