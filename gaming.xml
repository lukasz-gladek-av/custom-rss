            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/17/our-most-wanted-games-of-2025-1-ghost-of-yotei/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>There’s an incredible looking year of games ahead of us, both in terms of what we already know about with the likes of Monster Hunter Wilds, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/10/our-most-wanted-games-of-2025-10-to-6/">GTA 6</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/10/our-most-wanted-games-of-2025-10-to-6/">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/15/our-most-wanted-games-of-2025-3-doom-the-dark-ages/">Doom: The Dark Ages</a> and so, so much more… but only one game can top our list of most wanted games of 2025. That game is Ghost of Yōtei.</p>
<p><iframe title="Ghost of Yōtei - Announce Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7z7kqwuf0a8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In anticipation of a Ghost of Tsushima sequel’s almost inevitable announcement, we were all wondering the same thing. How can Sly Cooper and inFamous creators, Sucker Punch Productions, possibly follow up on one of the most celebrated PlayStation exclusives of the past decade? By sacking off the main character, of course, jumping the game some 300 years in the future, and taking us to a completely different part of Japan. It’s so obvious!</p>


<p>Jokes aside, the change of setting makes perfect sense for Ghost of Yōtei. As much as we enjoyed Jin Sakai’s Mongol-murdering revenge quest, he wasn’t the most compelling of characters, the mantle of “Ghost” now free to pass onto another protagonist. There’s a lot we don’t know about newcomer warrior, Atsu, or what motivates her but we love the idea of telling different sagas throughout history, instead of clinging to a single storyline and its cast of characters.</p>


<p>That said, we expect Ghost of Yotei to hit many of the same beats as its predecessor in terms of gameplay, visuals, and the sequel’s approach to open world game design. The new Hokkaido setting will give us yet another gorgeous slice of feudal Japan to explore, while the 17th century timeline allowing for a new arsenal of weapons and technologies. Where the Mongols mainly fought with swords, bows, and cheap tricks, Atsu will likely encounter an array of newfangled gunpowder arms.</p>
<p>The Edo period of the 17th century contrasted with the chaotic Sengoku period that preceded it. Set in 1603, Ghost of Yōtei will be right at the time that Tokugawa Ieyasu was given the title of Shogun by Emperor Go-Yōzei, settling the now unified country into a period of relative peace and stability, albeit with increasing restrictions on social heirarchy and, by 1639, a strict isolationist policy that booted almost all foreigners out of the country. Ghost of Yōtei will be just at the tipping point of this era, and it will be fascinating to see the tale that Sucker Punch tell on this backdrop – of particular note, Atsu’s status as an onna-musha, a female warrior, naturally clashes with the neo-Confucianism and the lessening and changing roles that women had more generally in this world.</p>

<p>Where <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/07/14/ghost-of-tsushima-review/">Ghost of Tsushima</a>, along with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/06/12/the-last-of-us-part-2-review-ps4-tlou2/">The Last of Us Part II</a>, helped push the PS4 to its limits just month before the PS5’s arrival, we’re fascinated to see how Sucker Punch makes use of Sony’s newer console, especially the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a>. We’re hoping to see larger, more cinematic battles, with Hokkaido’s many beautiful vistas brought to life with stunning fidelity.</p>
<p>For now, we still know very little about the game apart from its 2025 release window. If there’s one request we’d like to highlight on our wishlist, it’s the return of Legends, the fantastic online co-op mode that kept us coming back to Ghost of Tsushima long after the original credits rolled.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-leaked-clock-speeds-8nm-no-dlss/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 leaked clock speeds, which look rather legitimate, further suggest how the system is powered by an 8nm chip, according to a new analysis.</p>
<p>During the latest episode of their podcast, the tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> took a good look at the<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-docked-undocked-tflops-have-been-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> leaked clock speeds</a> of the new system, highlighting how they look reasonable enough for the type of system the Nintendo Switch 2 will be, although with some caveats, such as the handheld GPU clock speed looking a little low for the type of cooling the system has, and the CPU clock speeds, which are not particularly low for an 8nm CPU sporting eight Cortex A78 cores, being higher in portable mode than docked. The latter is particularly interesting, as it suggests there is still something we do not know about how the system works in this case, as it might disable cores in portable modes to save battery, or could have different CPU frequency modes in docked mode. Still, everything considered, these clock speeds are definitely in line with what an 8nm chip can achieve, further suggesting that it is the process node used for the T239 chip that powers the system. Speaking about the specs, one point of concern could be the low memory bandwidth in portable mode, especially if the system uses a 1080p screen as rumored. The reveal trailer, unfortunately, did not specify if the screen sports a higher resolution than the one of the original system.</p>
<p>What the Nintendo Switch 2 reveal trailer also failed to show is how the system will take advantage of the T239's Ampere architecture. The short Mario Kart footage was not at a very high resolution, and it looked aliased as the vast majority of Nintendo games, and in no part, it showed evidence of using NVIDIA DLSS or any other advanced feature that the architecture can deliver. Speaking about NVIDIA DLSS, Digital Foundry rightly highlights during the podcast how the Nintendo Switch 2 could be able to use the new Transformer Model, but its viability remains a question, considering the new model is computationally heavier than the current CNN model and wasn't developed for a mobile system that's essentially a few generations old at this point. Considering the recent patent essentially details a <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-dynamic-ai-upscaling-ports-xbox-series-s/">lightweight DLSS</a> for the Nintendo Switch 2, we are unlikely to see the same identical desktop Transformer model running on the system due to computational limitations.</p>

<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 launches worldwide later this year. More information on the console will be revealed in a dedicated Direct scheduled for early April.</p>

            <p>
Mario Kart fans are pouring over <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-announcement-reveals-new-mario-kart-game">yesterday's reveal of a new entry in Nintendo's racing series for Switch 2</a> - and have come up with a few more clues on how the game might play. 
</p>
<p>
Our first look at Mario Kart 9 - or whatever it ends up being called - was, on the surface, a pretty straightforward affair. We saw one racetrack, 12 returning characters and not a lot else.
</p>
<p>
Except for the fact, as we noted yesterday, there are now 24 spaces on the track's starting grid. Huh! Let's hope Nintendo has improved its online servers to allow for 24 players.
</p>
<p>
Overnight, fans have analysed the trailer in more detail - with an eye to working on what Mario Kart 9's main 'gimmick' might be. We've had underwater racing and gliders, anti-gravity tracks, and now... could Mario Kart 9's big change revolve around conserving fuel?
</p><p>
One fan spotted a rather conspicuous fuel tank added to the side of Mario's otherwise familiar kart, labelled "1-UP Fuel". The same fan also pointed to the mysterious glowing power-up seemingly placed outside a pit-stop burger joint - perhaps a fuel-replenishing power-up.
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">haven't seen anyone else talk about this but the gimmick of mario kart 9 is definitely a fuel tank<br>karts have conspicuous fuel tanks now and there's something on this track that doesnt look like an item box <br>it'll be a resource you can use freely to boost <a href="https://t.co/bhGnEOe8Xo">pic.twitter.com/bhGnEOe8Xo</a></p>— chloe (@payapaberii) <a href="https://twitter.com/payapaberii/status/1879956048762794250?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 16, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>
Another fan pointed to the presence of a large gas station by the track itself, with a large sign that reads: "Fire Flower Gas Station". 
</p> <div>

<p>
Other changes  noted yesterday include slight tweaks to Mario and Donkey Kong's character designs. (We think they now deliberately look more similar to those seen in the Super Mario Bros. Movie!)
</p>
<p>
For lots more chat about Mario Kart 9 - including our theories on whether the game might be open-world, or feature user-made courses, be sure to watch the latest episode of the Eurogamer Newscast, below.

            <p>Nintendo said it believes "in giving proper credit" to those who work on its games, after recently omitting the original development team at Retro Studios from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd">Donkey Kong Country Returns HD</a>'s credits.</p>
<p>Donkey Kong Country Returns HD is a remaster of 2010's Wii release, which was originally developed by Retro and published by Nintendo. This year's remaster, however, has been helmed by Forever Entertainment, which is front and centre of the new release's credits. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd-removes-retro-studios-staff-from-credits">Nintendo has omitted the original developers from the ending</a>,  simply stating the HD remaster was "based on the work" of the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-country-returns">Donkey Kong Country Returns</a> team.</p>
<p>Now, in a statement to Eurogamer regarding its crediting policy, Nintendo said: "We believe in giving proper credit for anyone involved in making or contributing to a game's creation, and value the contributions that all staff make during the development process."</p>

<p>Nintendo did not state why then it had still omitted the original Donkey Kong Country Returns team from the HD remaster's credits. We have asked for further clarification on this, and will update if we hear more.</p>
<p>Nintendo has previously been called out for missing those who worked on a game from its credits. </p>
<p>In 2023, former Retro Studios engineer Zoid Kirsch said he was "let down" by the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-retro-studios-engineer-let-down-by-metroid-prime-remasters-lack-of-credit-for-original-team">lack of individual credits in Metroid Prime Remastered</a>. Meanwhile, last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/external-translators-hired-for-nintendo-projects-bemoan-lack-of-credit-in-almost-every-big-title">translators contracted from firms outside of Nintendo voiced their disappointment at not being credited for work on high-profile games</a>.</p>

In the aftermath of what Lumon has dubbed the “Macrodat Uprising” involving the Macrodata Refinement crew’s Innies awakening in the outside world, Lumon has tried to clean up its act in a way only a soulless corporation would if their insidious operation was exposed to the public. Harmony Cobel (Patricia Arquette) has been replaced by Seth Milchick (Tramell Tillman) as the floor manager, with her manipulative intrusion into Mark S’s life reduced to her being a sadist scapegoat who “developed an erotic fixation on [Mark S.], and had plans to pursue [him and his Outie] in what may be termed a ‘throuple,’” according to Mr. Milchick. </p><p>The break room is now a lounge instead of a punishment chamber, a new family visitation room will allow Innie Dylan George (Zach Cherry) to spend time with his Outie’s wife, and Innies can walk around freely with a Hall Pass like grade schoolers. Lumon’s rebrand is suspicious at best, and deceptive at worst. And Ms. Huang is a reminder of how evil that company truly is.</p><p>Outside of the baby goats, no type of child has been seen on the severed floor, which makes sense because the work of adults is seldomly appropriate for a child. The fact they brought her in after an employee tried to hang themselves, another employee bit a superior and broke into the security room to wake themselves up, and the former floor manager was stalking one of the other employees either means they have no regard for a child’s safety, or that child is frighteningly equipped to deal with all of that. By the looks of the Season 2 premiere, it might be the latter.</p><p>Ms. Huang’s jovial nature is as contrived as that of any Lumon superior, and she can go from friendly to ferocious frighteningly fast. When Mark S. sarcastically intimates that she’s one of his new friends, she shoots him one of the iciest stares in <em>Severance </em>history before telling him, “I have to remind you I’m a supervisor...not a friend.” Then, she lets her subtle scolding hang in the air in a staring standoff with Mark S., almost as a way to let him know she is not to be fucked with like past supervisors. </p><p>There’s no telling how brainwashed the youngest<em> Severance</em> speaking character is but even so, the Season 2 premiere put enough fear in our hearts of just how depraved Lumon will reveal itself to be in the new season. <br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/all-pga-tour-2k25-editions/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Another PGA Tour title, another dilemma about which edition to buy. PGA Tour 2K25 has more editions than I have holes-in-one (zero, for what’s it worth), and each one has a unique selling point designed to pull you you in.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pga-tour-2k25-release-date-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PGA Tour 2K25</a> is the next iteration of 2K’s next-gen golf game. 2K23 was a step up from 2K21, but 2025’s big dog is ready to eat. It’s sporting new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-courses-in-pga-tour-2k25-dlc-courses-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">courses</a> and revamped features across the board. It’s like the excitement of the new Driver season where you can’t wait to see what the big brands have been cooking up.</p>



<p>2K hasn’t just been hard at work on gameplay and longevity, we have new editions to peruse.</p>



<h2 id="h-every-pga-tour-2k25-edition">Every PGA Tour 2K25 Edition</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Decisions, decisions. Credit to 2K</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>A Standard, Deluxe, and Legend Edition are available to pre-order for PGA Tour 2K25. </strong></p>



<p>Choosing a new launch’s edition is the equivalent of standing on a tee and deciding whether to slice the ball OB or snap hook it in the trees. All options are possible—and inevitable—but the choice is a tough one.</p>



<p>If 2K25 is your first foray into simulated golf or a new season in your accomplished career, we’ll help you with this agonizing decision.</p>



<h2 id="h-pga-tour-2k25-standard-edition-explained">PGA Tour 2K25 Standard Edition Explained</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Standard Edition. Credit to 2K</figcaption></figure>



<p>Standard is the basic edition of PGA Tour 2K25. It comes with the game—a cool pre-order bonus—and that’s it! If you’re mainly after 2K25 in its most basic and simplistic form (and cheapest), the Standard Edition is probably the one for you.</p>



<p>Here’s everything you get with the Standard Edition of PGA Tour 2K25:</p>



<ul>
<li>A base copy of PGA Tour 2K25.</li>



<li>Extra Butter x Adidas Pack

</ul>



<h2 id="h-pga-tour-2k25-deluxe-edition-explained">PGA Tour 2K25 Deluxe Edition Explained</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Deluxe Edition. Credit to 2K</figcaption></figure>



<p>Upgrading to the Deluxe Edition gives you a few extra yards off the tee—probably not, but you never know. I can say for sure you get the game, the pre-order bonus, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-play-pga-tour-2k25-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Early Access</a>, and a few more goodies. The Deluxe Edition might be digital-only, meaning you have to buy it from an online storefront if you want it.</p>



<p>This is everything included in 2K25 Deluxe Edition:</p>



<ul>
<li>7-Day Early Access.</li>



<li>A base copy of PGA Tour 2K25.</li>

<figure><figcaption>Legend Edition. Credit to 2K</figcaption></figure>



<p>If you didn’t think your bag could get any more full, in steps PGA Tour 2K25 Legend Edition. Again, this seems to be a digital-only edition. But getting it gets you six extra bundles to go along with Early Access and the game itself. This is for the ultimate golf enthusiast and also Tiger Woods fans.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-trading-unveiled-but-is-so-poorly-received-the-developers-had-to-respond<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-tcg-pocket">Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket</a> developer Creatures Inc. has finally unveiled how the incoming trading feature will work, but the community response was so poor it had to release a follow-up response.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As expected, and perhaps feared, by the Pokémon TCG Pocket community, there are fairly severe restrictions on the incoming trading mechanic, which still lacks a release date despite being confirmed for January. Creatures Inc. announced these on <a href="https://x.com/PokemonTCGP/status/1880012156504084895" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">X/Twitter</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Complaints are headlined by the inability to trade cards of 2 Star rarity or higher. This means no ex level alternate art cards can be traded, not in their basic forms, rainbow bordered forms, immersive forms, or gold (Crown rarity) forms.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Creatures Inc. said only "certain cards from the Genetic Apex and Mythical Island booster packs will be able to be traded," though it's unclear if this solely refers to the 2 Star or higher restriction or if there are further cards banned from trading.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every Alternate Art 'Secret' Card in Pokémon TCG Pocket: Genetic Apex</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This all but confirms trading will arrive alongside the next full set, however, which is also due in January. Creatures Inc. is likely emphasizing that those new cards cannot be traded upon their release, but will seemingly be opened up to the feature later when it's less relevant. It also means the often timed exclusive Promo cards cannot be traded.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other restrictions to trading apply too. Cards can only be traded between friends, which the community has deemed makes sense, and only cards of the same rarity can be traded, which has been accepted too. The last element that's frustrated many, however, is that "items must be consumed in order to trade."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's unclear what this means exactly. Pokémon TCG Pocket uses Hourglasses to pace certain features including pack opening, wonder picks, and event battles. One booster pack can be opened for free once every 12 hours, and one Pack Hourglass, for example, reduces that amount of time by one hour.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's therefore possible Trade Hourglasses will be implemented as an item, essentially restricting how often players can trade without spending real-world money. Another popular theory is that Shinedust, an item considered by many to have little value as it solely changes the visuals of cards, will work for trades too.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Pay Day</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">This mechanic, alongside the other restrictions, are likely being implemented to encourage (and maintain) player spending, as Pokémon TCG Pocket arrived October 30 and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-estimated-to-have-crossed-200-million-mark-already-outperforming-pokmon-sleep-and-unite">is estimated to have made $200 million in its first month alone</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This huge amount of money comes as the digital TCG follows the standard mobile and free-to-play game model, flooding players with rewards in the first few days before soon drying up, with spending real-world money the only real way to re-experience that early thrill <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-reveals-mew-led-set-coming-next-week-and-60-million-download-milestone">outside of the occasional set drop like Mythical Island</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Completing Genetic Apex, the first set of cards which totals 226 officially but also contains 60 rare alternate art cards, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/it-takes-almost-2-years-to-complete-just-the-first-pokmon-tcg-pocket-set-unless-you-spend-money">will take players not spending money around two years according to one estimate</a>, while <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-player-reveals-exactly-how-long-it-takes-to-complete-the-first-set-after-spending-1500">those looking to make it rain can wrap up the collection after dropping around $1,500</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Trading is undeniably a strong addition to Pokémon TCG Pocket that will improve the overall player experience, but fans have complained it's also fairly clearly being implemented as a means of increasing revenue too. Items being consumed in order to trade certainly alludes to this, as whether it's Trade Hourglasses or Shinedust or something else, players wanting to trade more regularly than the game deems okay will have to pay real money to do so.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's also evidenced in the inability to trade cards of 2 Star rarity or higher, which after almost three months of play for dedicated fans, are the majority of cards they are still missing. But making these cards available to trade would be a threat to Creatures Inc.'s revenue; if players could immediately trade for their missing cards, they wouldn't need to spend $10 or $100 for a random chance of getting them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As noted by the player who spent $1,500 on completing the first set, it's these final few pieces that are most difficult to get and thus require the most money spent. The standard $9.99 purchasing option grants 57 PokéGold, an item which can be used to replace any of the Hourglasses otherwise available but at an increased rate. One PokéGold replaces two Pack Hourglasses, for example.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Spending $9.99 therefore lets players open 28 booster packs for a total of 140 cards. Booster packs work in the same as their real-world counterparts, or in digital terms, loot boxes, meaning nothing of (relative) value is guaranteed, never mind the specific card players are looking for.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon TCG Pocket does offer a mild alternative to finding these cards in the form of Pack Points; players earn five for every pack opened, and these can be exchanged for any card in the set.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Exchanging a 2 Star rarity card costs 1,250 Pack Points, however. This means players must open 250 booster packs in total, or around $220 worth of PokéGold, for a single card. Considering there are 29 different 2 Star rarity cards in the first set alone, plus three 3 Star rarity cards which cost 1,500 Pack Points and three Crown rarity cards which cost 2,500, there are fairly sobering restrictions to this mechanic.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Trading Complaints</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Trading was therefore seen as a saving grace for players looking to collect every card (which is encouraged in-game via missions and rewards), but those hopes are all but dashed given Creatures Inc.'s announcement.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Not being able to trade 2 Star at least really makes me want to drop the game," said lilgalois on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1i30m2w/tcg_pocket_official_update/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit</a>. "Trash system," said Ashamed-Teaching6837. "So extra 3 Star cards are just dead cards. What a crock," said Analogmon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Social media is full of such complaints, which seemingly grew so excessive that Creatures Inc. had to issue a rare response.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Thank you, everyone, for your immediate thoughts on this topic," Creatures Inc. said in a follow-up <a href="https://x.com/PokemonTCGP/status/1880027099836411924" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">X/Twitter</a> post. "Your concerns are seen. Once this feature becomes available, I'd like to invite everyone to try it and provide feedback. This way, the game can continue to evolve in an enjoyable way for everyone." Crucially, Creatures Inc. failed to say it would consider this criticism and aim to make changes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-marvel-rivals-bot-conspiracy-explained<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">There are no strings on me.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">While <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a> continues to land atop Steam and Twitch charts, one issue has fans suspicious of their time with NetEase Games’ new hero shooter: bots.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The superhero-themed competitive multiplayer experience launched in December to critical acclaim and praise from fans thanks to its style and creative use of iconic characters like Spider-Man, Wolverine, and, most recently, the Fantastic Four. It’s achieved so much success that hundreds of thousands of gamers are still firing up Marvel Rivals every day on Steam alone (via <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2767030/charts/#1w" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>SteamDB</u></a>). While NetEase’s new hero shooter has managed to dodge some of the pitfalls that trap other competitors in this space, fans have spent weeks raising concerns regarding how AI enemies have been implemented across several of its game modes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I know people may feel differently but playing against bots in (Quickplay) just doesn’t feel good at all to me,” one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1hnamlz/comment/m41caaq/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Reddit user commented</u></a>. “AI should be in AI modes and that’s it.”</p><div id="marvel-rivals-tier-list-best-heroes" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Marvel Rivals Tier List: Best Heroes</h3><h3>Marvel Rivals Tier List: Best Heroes</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Like other multiplayer games released over the last 15 years, Marvel Rivals offers practice modes that make it clear players will be competing against what many refer to as “bots.” These AI-driven opponents can often have their difficulty tweaked to a user’s liking, cementing these modes as valuable tools for those looking to improve their skills or cool down between the often more intense matches against human players. Where the Marvel video game is running into trouble is the appearance of what many believe are bots in standard Quickplay matches.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For weeks, social media has slowly flooded with posts from users concerned that they are being tossed into matches against low-level bot players, with some reporting that their teammates are also occasionally being replaced by bots. The jury’s out on what triggers these bot matches, but the working theory is that Marvel Rivals will match players into these comparatively easier matches after the occurrence of one too many losses. It’s a tactic that could keep players from feeling so defeated that they quit the game, and it may help users load into Quickplay matches without delay instead of sitting through long queue times.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, there is little transparency from NetEase regarding which players are bots or if there are bots in Quickplay matches at all — and the company has remained quiet thus far (IGN has asked for comment). More than a few posts caught fire on social media in the weeks since launch as players tried to establish what is and isn’t a red flag in the hope of finding their own solution. Examples include bizarre-but-repetitive behavior in-game to similarities between each teammate’s names, including team names filled with single words and all capital letters or names split between one full name and one half name. The most telling sign, though, is when every enemy’s career profile is labeled “restricted.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The fact that you can even get bot games after wins and that the game doesn't tell you that you're against bots is what gets me about this,” another <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1hnamlz/comment/m42u5ep/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Reddit user said</u></a>. “You don't want to learn new heroes in comp because people will understandably rage at you for doing that, but if you try to learn a hero in (Quickplay) you now have to second guess if you actually are getting any better on that hero or if the game is just making you think you are because it's handing you free wins in the form of bots.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The use of bots in multiplayer games is far from new; players have argued about how bots could be impacting their Fortnite performance for years. As for Marvel Rivals, some have called for the option to toggle bot matches on or off, while others want the feature removed completely. There is also a selection of players who don’t mind fighting against the occasional bot lobby, explaining that they use these matches as an opportunity to complete a few specific hero achievements.

            <p>Riot Games is running in-game events from next week to raise funding for those impacted by the LA fires.</p>
<p>After hundreds of thousands of people were placed under evacuation orders and the devastation of the wildfires sweeping across Los Angeles became apparent, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/riot-tells-staff-impacted-by-la-wildfires-that-what-matters-most-is-taking-care-of-yourselves-and-each-other">Riot was one of several video game companies to reach out to employees</a> to tell them to take care of themselves ahead of work.</p>
<p>Now Riot is inviting its players to support those impacted by the catastrophe via in-game donations through <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a> and Valorant.</p>
<p>From 22nd-30th January, Valorant's EX.O Collection will become a Give Back Bundle, with proceeds from weapon skins and accessories in the bundle going to the Riot Games Social Impact Fund, a donor-advised fund account sponsored by ImpactAssets.</p>
<p>In League of Legends, from 23rd January until 5th February, proceeds from Firefighter Tristana - who will be unvaulted for this fundraiser - will also go to the Riot Games Social Impact Fund.</p>
<p>Riot also launched a "double-donation" campaign last week, tripling the charitable contributions of its staff to organisations like the California Fire Foundation, Los Angeles Fire Department Foundation, International Medical Corps, American Red Cross, and World Central Kitchen. Riot has also made direct donations to the California Fire Foundation and International Medical Corps to support relief efforts.</p><p>"While these are incredibly difficult times and there is a long road to recovery ahead, I’m grateful that we’re collectively in this together - no matter where we are in the world," said CEO A. Dylan Jadeja. "Thank you for all of your support."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The Dragon Age: The Veilguard Game Director is reportedly leaving BioWare after having worked on the game since February 2022.</p>
<p>As&nbsp;<span>reliable journalist <a href="https://x.com/JeffGrubb/status/1880113210470371790" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jeff Grubb</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-game-director-leaving-bioware" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eurogamer reported</a></span>, Corinne Busche will depart the team responsible for so many excellent role-playing games in the coming weeks. The studio, on the other hand, will not be affected by any other changes. According to Eurogamer, the game's performance on the market did not affect this departure.</p>
<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard definitely did have an easy development. The new entry in the celebrated series has been in the works for over ten years and went through a few development reboots before finally releasing last year. Despite all the development troubles, the game turned out well, as Alessio highlighted in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-age-the-veilguard-biowares-back/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">review</a>, but sales likely haven't been stellar, as both BioWare and EA have not commented on them since launch.</p>
<p><em>With Dragon Age: The Veilguard, BioWare has largely returned to its roots, casting aside the temptations of open world and/or live service games. Instead, Veilguard is a great mission-based RPGs with a memorable story that will leave fans enthralled by the revelations, an awesome combat system that perfectly blends action and tactics, and lots of loot and secrets to uncover through its 80-hour playthrough.</em></p>
<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>

<p>Announced today, Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth PC will be playable on the Steam Deck on release day.</p>



<p>When Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth PC is released on January 23, 2024, Steam Deck owners <a href="https://x.com/finalfantasyvii/status/1879895195178901895" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">can play the game</a> anywhere they want: on the train, in the park, on a flight, or in the car. The official announcement post also features the game running on the handheld console, and it seems the device can handle the title seamlessly, with no visible stuttering or performance issues.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To celebrate the arrival of Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth on Steam Deck, Square Enix has revealed a limited-edition Fluffy Chocobo Steam Deck. The custom edition covers the entire handheld console in bright yellow Chocobo feathers. The game developers have stated that they don’t advise wrapping up “high-tech gaming gear in fur at home, ” so they have made the casing removable.</p>

Depending on your setup, you can also benefit from improved framerates and image quality with NVIDIA DLSS.

            <p>
Japanese police have arrested a man accused of modifying and selling Nintendo Switch consoles.
</p>
<p>
It's the first time someone under suspicion of breaking the country's Trademark Act by handling modded Switch consoles has been arrested, <a href="https://news.ntv.co.jp/n/rkc/category/society/rcc5bf23d3d9bd40b5bc4da1bb34648d49">NTV News</a> (via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/japanese-man-arrested-for-selling-modded-nintendo-switch-consoles-setting-a-new-precedent/">Automaton</a>) reports, potentially setting a new, harsher precedent for the future.
</p>
<p>
The 58-year-old suspect is believed to have made a business out of modifying second-hand Switch consoles so that they play pirated games, and reselling these modded units for 28,000 yen (about £150) apiece.

<p>
The man, who has reportedly admitted to the charge, also offered a bundle of 27 pirated games to play on the modded consoles for an additional fee.
</p>
<p>
Today's news comes just days after the deputy general manager of Nintendo's Japanese intellectual property department said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-attorney-explains-why-its-strengthening-measures-against-illegal-emulation">the company was beefing up its stance against illegal emulation</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Nintendo is of course no stranger to legal action when it feels its products are under threat, and has made an example out of individuals in the past.
</p>
<p>
In 2022, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/jail-term-for-nintendo-pirate-gary-bowser-was-unique-opportunity-to-set-example-court-documents-reveal">Nintendo lawyer pressed to ensure the maximum five-year jail time was handed down to the infamous Gary Bowser</a> - who worked as part of another business that enabled Switch piracy - as it would be "a large benefit to further education of the public".
</p><p>
Speaking last year, Bowser - now freed from prison but in financial debt to Nintendo due to fines for the rest of his working life - said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gary-bowser-says-nintendo-wanted-to-send-a-message-with-sentence">his sentence had been designed like a message</a> "to other people that [are] still out there, that if they get caught ... [they'll] serve hard time".

            <p>Director and writer David Lynch, known for his surreal work across film and television, has passed away at the age of 78.</p>
<p>Announcing his death on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/davidlynchofficial/posts/pfbid04LuZED6SrWevszQ1UZoEED6x95znKc7scJxXFL5B1icBKgCiu4T2qYLHsErFNzELl?rdid=581XjlBlb3GqM8zP#">Facebook</a> yesterday, Lynch's family wrote: "It is with deep regret that we, his family, announce the passing of the man and the artist, David Lynch. We would appreciate some privacy at this time. There’s a big hole in the world now that he's no longer with us. But, as he would say, 'Keep your eye on the donut and not on the hole'. It’s a beautiful day with golden sunshine and blue skies all the way."</p>
<p>While Lynch is best known for his work on TV series such as Twin Peaks and films like Mulholland Drive, the creator is also a memorable part of PlayStation's history, responsible for several iconic PS2 adverts which arrived with that unmistakable Lynchian brand of surrealism and shades of neo-noir.</p>

<p>The most famous of these adverts is the brilliantly bonkers black-and-white affair known as Welcome To The Third Space. Kicking off with a wailing siren, a voice asks through a speaker: "Where are we?" A man walks through a corridor, his head detaches from his body, it reattaches, an arm comes out from his mouth.</p>
<p>"Welcome to the Third Place," quacks a suited duck. </p>
<p>The iconic trailer was shared by <a href="https://x.com/PlayStationAU/status/1880104053184811213">PlayStation Australia</a> in the early hours of this morning. "RIP David Lynch," PlayStation AU wrote. You can experience the trailer once again in the video above.</p>

<p>Posting on social media last night, Remedy boss and Alan Wake writer Sam Lake shared his sadness at Lynch's passing. "David Lynch has been a huge inspiration to me and a huge influence on my work," he wrote. "Rest in peace."</p>
<p>In a separate post, Lake revealed that Remedy's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</a> team had used the code name "Big Fish" for its surreal sequel, a nod to Lynch's autobiography and self-help guide Catching the Big Fish: Meditation, Consciousness, and Creativity.</p>
<p>"I think David Lynch is swimming with the big fish now," Lake shared with an image of the book. "His influence goes far and wide and will live on."</p>

<p>It’s not even been a full day since the Nintendo Switch 2 was revealed, and the pre-order sign-ups have already started popping up for the upcoming console. Best Buy was the first to join the fray.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorders-sign-up-for-notifications-at-best-buy/1100-6528859/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GameSpot</a>, you will see a new sign-up page for Nintendo Switch 2 pre-orders if you go to <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/nintendo-switch/nintendo-notifications/pcmcat1736965129196.c?id=pcmcat1736965129196" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Best Buy’s website</a> right now. However, the signup doesn’t confirm the pre-order for you; instead, it sends out notifications when pre-orders go live, announcements regarding games for the upcoming console are released and more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Details such as pricing or availability have not been provided on Best Buy’s Nintendo Switch 2 pre-order sign-up page, as the company has yet to release that information. However, Nintendo will reveal the pricing, release date, games arriving for the console, and the device’s capabilities during the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-the-nintendo-switch-2-direct/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exclusive Direct event</a> for the Switch 2 on April 2, 2025.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Currently, only the console and some of its functionality have been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-announces-nintendo-switch-2-launching-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a>. The Switch 2 will feature a larger console and joy-cons that snap to the device now instead of sliding in. The console’s colour has changed too, with the company going for an all-black casing with red and blue accents.

            <p>Looks like Sony have caught the live service jitters. The company have cancelled two online multiplayer games, including one based on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/god-of-war">God Of War</a>, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-16/sony-cancels-two-more-playstation-projects">a report</a> by Bloomberg journalist Jason Schreier. Two different Sony-owned studios were recently told to stop development on their projects. One of those studios is Bluepoint, known for their work on the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/demons-souls">Demon's Souls</a> remake. They were making the unannounced live service God Of War game, according to Schreier. The other studio is Bend, developers of open world zombie 'em up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/days-gone">Days Gone</a>. We don't know what they were working on, aside from the fact it was also to have a live service business model. In any case, both have been canned. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>The natural worry here is that the decision will lead to layoffs. Sony confirmed the cancellations, saying they took place after an internal "review". However they wouldn't commit to an answer about employee job security, saying only that they didn't intend to close the studios. Meanwhile, a memo was sent in an effort to reassure staff, letting them know PlayStation would try to "ensure there is minimal business impact". The company would be working with the studios to figure out what they'll be working on next, PlayStation <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lfvfrztbks25">told Bloomberg</a>. </p>
<p>"Bend and Bluepoint are highly accomplished teams who are valued members of the PlayStation Studios family," they said in a statement to Bloomberg, "and we are working closely with each studio to determine what are the next projects."</p>
<p>Ominous. We didn't hear much talk about the God Of War game before now. But we knew something was afoot at Bend when they began <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/days-gone-devs-are-getting-back-in-the-saddle-and-hiring-someone-with-live-service-experience">hiring for staff with experience making blockbuster live service games</a>. Even at the time it seemed unusual for this single player studio to pivot to live service, but this is a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plans-to-launch-more-than-10-live-service-games-before-march-2026">general trend chased by Sony</a> since 2022, albeit one they seem to be abandoning of late. The company have cancelled a few other live service projects in recent years, including <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/naughty-dog-cancel-the-last-of-us-online-while-teasing-new-single-player-projects">a multiplayer game based on The Last Of Us</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/alleged-leaked-spider-man-the-great-web-trailer-shows-off-insomniacs-cancelled-co-op-spin-off">a co-op Spiderman</a> game. </p><p>Cancellations are fairly common in the industry, so arguably this is not that unusual. But it does look like the fear has truly been injected into Sony by hydraulic needle following the fate of online hero shooter <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/concord">Concord</a>, a flop estimated to have cost the company at least $200 million, with the real cost likely being higher than that. That includes the human cost of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sony-write-off-ill-fated-200-million-shooter-concord-as-a-loss-by-closing-studio-permanently">all the workers who lost their jobs</a> when the studio was shuttered as a result.</p>
<p>Live service is an interesting monster in the grander ecosystem of videos gamesing. Huge corporations are attracted to the model thanks to certain heavy hitters like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> retaining a magical dollar-shitting ability for years and years and years. But they can be massively attention-demanding for the average player - how many of this type of game can you really play on the reg? My feelings about games-as-a-service is broadly in line with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-should-redefine-live-service-games-as-the-living-dead">Edwin's recent eloquent scribblethoughts</a>. Here's a good part of that: </p>
<blockquote>Even before they became ubiquitous, live service games felt like a burden. They are inherently exhausting to think about. The business model is the experience in a way that it isn't for anything you "buy once" and theoretically enjoy in your "own time", away from the sludgepumps of commerce - it breaks the golden rule that art created under capitalism should at least feel like it's an escape from capitalism, by forcing you to think of playing as an on-going interaction with an evolving product.</blockquote>

            <p>Nintendo's share price has dropped in the wake of the Switch 2's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/if-switch-2-is-the-end-of-innovative-nintendo-theres-much-to-be-sad-about">"safe" debut</a>.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2025/1/17/nintendo-shares-tumble-as-switch-2-reveal-disappoints-fans">Al Jazeera</a>, stocks fell by as much as 7.2 percent after the hardware's formal announcement. Prices did bounce back a little, but by 4pm local time, share prices were still down 4.2 percent.</p>
<p>That said, since the end of last year, Nintendo's share price <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NTDOY/?guccounter=1">has been so strong</a>, the Japanese firm's stock value still sits on a near all-time high.</p>

<p>Whilst many factors contribute to a company's share price - and we still don't yet know all the technical specifications - it's widely speculated that due to the furore generated by the rumours over many weeks and months and the perceived lack of innovation between the two generations of hardware, the reception to Switch 2's debut from some quarters was somewhat flat.</p>

            <p>After eons of waiting, Nintendo has <em>finally </em>debuted its next console. Yes, the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Switch 2</a> - as we can now call it officially - was revealed yesterday, with a brief teaser video full of magnetic Joy-Cons and some really rather yummy noises.</p>
<p>We here at Eurogamer have our own thoughts on Nintendo's reveal (be sure to check out Bertie's feature<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/if-switch-2-is-the-end-of-innovative-nintendo-theres-much-to-be-sad-about"> If Switch 2 is the end of innovative Nintendo, there's much to be sad about</a> and Donlan's one <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/if-the-switch-2-is-safe-then-im-jason-statham-and-i-want-to-star-in-it">If the Switch 2 is safe, then I'm Jason Statham and I want to star in it</a>, for two sides of the discussion).</p>

            <p>Superheroes often conceal their identities behind masks, capes and in my case, a pungent snood-and-hoodtop combo that makes me look like I've crawled out of a drain. No, don't ask what my real superhero identity is. After all, knowing my secrets might expose you to the wrath of my enemies. And in any case, I don't trust you. It turns out <em>some</em> of you people have been keeping secrets from me, as well. You have been furtively playing superhero shooter <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a> with a keyboard and mouse adapter, which makes it look as though you're playing with a controller, so that you can take advantage of controller features such as high-sensitivity aim-assist in competitive play. </p><!--more-->
<p>Well, get ready to be unmasked, you awful sneaks, because developers NetEase are planning to crack down on this duplicitous practice. If they catch you faking a pair of analogue sticks, they might even suspend your account.</p>
<p>"We define keyboard and mouse adapters as the use of software or hardware to mimic controller inputs with a keyboard and mouse," explains <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/announcements/20250113/40955_1206338.html">a post on the game's forums</a>. "This method can grant an unfair edge in competitive play, for example, harnessing high sensitivity with the aim-assist features. Some common adapters include the XIM series, Cronus Zen series, Titan Two series, KeyMander series, and Brook Sniper series, among others. Any device enabling keyboard and mouse emulation of controller inputs, even if not explicitly listed, will be considered a keyboard and mouse adapter."</p>
<p>Perhaps you think you can slip the strong grasp of Justice by means of ratlike cunning. Fool! Ratlike cunning is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Tomalin">the exclusive preserve of journalists</a>. And besides, NetEase "have forged a strong detection tool" which they will "couple with the keen judgment of our watchful human eyes to accurately identify those using keyboard and mouse adapters."</p><p>I know that it's written in character, but I'm slightly alarmed that NetEase feel it necessary to specify that their eyes are human. Perhaps it's all a ruse. Perhaps everybody in the office is an Ultron clone, and banning mouse and keyboard adaptors is all part of some globe-toppling Master Plan.</p>
<p>Even if it is, I can't argue with the point that tricksy M&amp;K bolt-ons give some users an unsporting edge. "We believe that gaining an unjust advantage through such methods significantly impacts the gaming experience for our players," the NetEase post continues. "Therefore, whether on PC or console, we will take measures to vanquish this nefarious behavior. Penalties for users of keyboard and mouse adapters may include temporary or permanent account suspensions, removal from leaderboards, or other punishments depending on the circumstances."</p>
<p>Marvel Rivals continues to be very popular. And chaotic, given that the entire cast are superheroes. This is a game in which everybody needs to feel like they could dominate. I don't envy the devs trying to distinguish the superpowered from the overpowered, let alone flush out the cheaters. If you missed it earlier in the week, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marvel-rivals-to-get-two-new-heroes-every-three-month-season-say-netease-and-no-theyre-not-adding-role-queue">they're planning to add two new characters a season</a>, so the balancing is only going to get more complicated from here.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Allow me to explain.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Silksong/comments/1i31gas/what_we_know_so_far_about_the_william_pellen/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Supersleuths on the Hollow Knight subreddit</a> noticed that on January 15, co-director of Team Cherry William Pellen had changed his Twitter/X profile picture to a picture of a chocolate cake. Pellen tweeted: “something big is coming. keep your eyes closed tomorrow.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">something big is coming. keep your eyes closed tomorrow</p>— little bomey (@everydruidwaswr) <a href="https://twitter.com/everydruidwaswr/status/1879751713621725206?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 16, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">At the time, Nintendo’s Switch 2 reveal was rumored for January 16, and so it proved. That was the day <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-finally-reveals-its-next-gen-console-confirms-switch-2-name">Nintendo finally announced the Switch 2</a>, although there are still a number of burning questions we have about the next-gen console. Had Pellen really asked followers to keep an eye out for the Switch 2 reveal? If so, why?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is the point where the Hollow Knight community went into overdrive — or off the deep end, depending on your point of view. Fans reverse-searched the picture of the cake, which led them to a recipe for Brooklyn Blackout Cake on cooking website <a href="https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/blackout-cake" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bon Appétit</a>. The date the recipe was published: April 2, 2024.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/17/screenshot-2025-01-17-094610-1737107179081.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Is the cake a lie? Image credit: <a href="https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/blackout-cake">Bon Appétit.</a></figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Why would that date be important here? Because Nintendo has confirmed Nintendo Direct: Nintendo Switch 2 will air on Wednesday, April 2, 2025. That’s right, fans think Pellen has kicked off a Silksong alternate reality game (ARG) with that tweet and that picture of the cake.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans haven’t stopped there. They’re currently trying to work out what Pellen’s new X/Twitter handle, @everydruidwaswr, means, if anything. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Silksong/comments/1i36zi6/comment/m7l3uqu/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Redditor Representative-True has the best theory I’ve seen so far</a>: “The character limit on Twitter handles is 15 characters, which is the length of ‘everydruidwaswr.’ I think “wr” is likely the start of a word, like wrong or something. I have yet to decipher this, but the Druid of the Moss Temple is a Silksong NPC.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The plot thickens! Pellen has a new X/Twitter name to go along with the new handle and profile picture: little bomey. What’s that about? Fans have noticed Little Boomey is a wine from Southern Australia, where Team Cherry is based, but the spelling is different. What could it mean?!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth remembering that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/02/14/hollow-knight-sequel-announced-for-pc-and-nintendo-switch">when Hollow Knight: Silksong was announced</a>, Team Cherry confirmed launch platforms as Windows, Mac, Linux, and Nintendo Switch. But that was six years ago. Has Nintendo snapped up Hollow Knight: Silksong as a Switch 2 launch title? Is it a timed exclusive? Is this all just bonkers behavior from information-starved fans?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We have a few months to find out. In the meantime, check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-heres-everything-announced-and-confirmed">everything announced at Nintendo's Switch 2 reveal</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/17/what-we-played-marvel-rivals-kingdom-come-dynasty-warriors-origins/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>I’ve been starting 2025 with a bout of flu – thanks, 2025 – but on the plus side that’s meant I’ve been tucked up in bed with my ROG Ally, Balatro, and the end of Metaphor ReFantazio. These are all good things. Other than that, I’ve been slowly making my way through <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/16/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-is-best-experienced-as-a-serial-just-like-the-films-that-inspired-it/">Indiana Jones and The Great Circle</a> (Microsoft’s cloud streaming for this is impeccable), some Kingdom Come: Deliverance to see what it’s all about, and a tiny bit of Marvel Rivals too. Life could be worse, in other words.</p>
<p>But what about everyone else? <strong>Aran</strong> played Space Marine, the first one, as it’s been in his backlog forever. He told us, “It’s a nice throwback to the PS3 and 360 era of third-person shooters with obvious heavy influence from Gears of War. I was also surprised to see that the online was still quite active. I’ve also been playing more Witcher 3 and have just landed on Skellige.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, <strong>Jim</strong> has been hopelessly glued to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/13/dynasty-warriors-origins-review-the-best-musuo-game-ever/">Dynasty Warriors: Origins</a> which he says is easily the best game in the series to date. Giving us some detail, he said, “After the mess that was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/02/13/dynasty-warriors-9-review/">DW9</a> I honestly didn’t have much hope for the series, but somehow Omega Force has managed the impossible. Although there was a cathartic joy in mindlessly hammering out button combos, Origins offers a genuine test of skill and a wealth of content I’m actually eager to explore and replay. Hopefully its glowing critical reception will translate into commercial success, cementing a sequel, and an “Origins” style shake-up for Samurai Warriors.”</p>
<p><strong>Tuffcub</strong> has played the System Shock remake, which he says “could have done with a bit more remaking, I get it’s a classic game but it just feels so dated.” He hasn’t really enjoyed much gaming this week, to be honest, saying, “I also played The Stanley Parable and I am going to be a grumpy old man and say I didn’t think much of it at all, the narrator started getting on my tits mansplaining everything. I also played Suicide Squad (spot the theme here?) which I didn’t get past the Shark guy tutorial because it was so fricking dull, it felt like someone had tried to make Destiny by committee. I also played the new Destiny 2 episode which wasn’t particularly great either. I do have LEGO Horizon sat on my table so I’m hoping that will save the week.” Let us know if it’s saved the day TC!</p>


<p><strong>Gamoc</strong> has continued playing Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 for review next month, Cuisineer also for review, and a bit of Black Ops 6 Multiplayer for not review. That’s not all, but much like TC, the further gaming hasn’t been all that enjoyable – “I’ve also been playing Veilguard, which is about fifteen layers of disappointment. It feels shallow, dialogue is poor, a main character’s voice can’t pull off the role, I can’t explore during actual missions without hitting twenty dead ends I have to come back to later. The only thing it almost excels at is graphics, but even then the generic aesthetic where even Qunari don’t look particularly alien anymore is just shite.”</p>
<p><strong>Reuben</strong> has only been playing Marvel Rivals, hammering away at the season pass and getting reasonably good with Squirrel Girl and Rocket Raccoon. He says, “I’m loving the new additions to the game with Season 1 and looking forward to seeing what the second half of the season brings.”</p>

<p><strong>Steve</strong> has played through the first Gears of War on Series S (360 rather than remaster) as he fancied actually playing the series through (previously only played the remaster of 1 on PC). What did he think? “It was fun but hasn’t aged that well. Started the second one now which feels like a pretty big leap forwards. I’ve reinstalled Another Crab’s Treasure after getting distracted and completely forgetting what I was doing in it and it is still one of the best Souls-likes out there. Not resorted to using the gun yet but leaving it open as an option if I get super stuck. Picked up Blade Chimera on Steam (cheaper if you already own Bloodstained) as that’s been on my radar for a long while.”</p>
<p>And we’ll round things out with <strong>Tef</strong>. He dabbled with a little bit of the original Space Marine, similar to Aran dragging it out of his backlog, stomped through the opening level of RoboCop: Rogue City (which he previously played for preview), and played something secret and shadowy that he’ll talk about next week. He’s also just about to start playing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/16/assetto-corsa-evo-early-access-is-out-now/">Assetto Corsa EVO</a> and a roguelike Tetris kind of thing called Drop Duchy.</p>
<p>What about you? What have you played?</p>

        <p>After 18-year career at EA.</p>

Corinne Busche, who served as game director of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-walkthrough-tips-and-tricks-guide">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> since February 2022, is departing BioWare. 
</p>
<p>
Whispers of her exit began circulating online last night, and were first confirmed by journalist <a href="https://x.com/JeffGrubb/status/1880113210470371790">Jeff Grubb</a>. Eurogamer can also confirm Busche will depart BioWare in the coming weeks.
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer understands BioWare itself is otherwise unaffected by any other changes, contrary to rumour.

</figure>
<p>
Busche, working closely alongside creative director John Epler, helped oversee The Veilguard's final stretch of development from early 2022 onwards, until its final release last October. 
</p>
<p>
The Veilguard slogged through a mammoth decade-long development and several reboots before the version we finally saw launch arrived, steered by Busche.
</p>
<p>
Critically, The Veilguard has been received well, and commercially sales have been decent - but there's also been a suggestion that sales have not exceeded expectations. Still, Eurogamer understands The Veilguard's commercial performance was not a direct factor in Busche's departure. 
</p><p>
Alongside her work on The Veilguard, Busche has served as a designer and design director within publisher EA for 18 years, working on numerous entries in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/video-game-franchises/the-sims">The Sims</a> series, including <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sims-3">The Sims 3</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sims-4">The Sims 4</a> and The Sims Mobile.
</p>
<p>
Post Dragon Age: The Veilguard, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioware-teases-mass-effect-5-title-plus-answers-to-trilogy-ending-questions">bulk of BioWare is now turning its attention fully to the next Mass Effect game</a>, which is being <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-5-wont-dabble-with-stylised-visuals-like-dragon-age-the-veilguard-director-says">led by a separate small team of veterans</a>.
</p>
<p>Eurogamer spoke with both Busche and Epler in December for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-big-dragon-age-the-veilguard-post-release-interview-it-was-never-going-to-match-the-dragon-age-4-in-peoples-minds">our big Dragon Age: The Veilguard post-release interview</a>. "The reality was whatever we came out with, it was never going to match the Dragon Age 4 in people's minds and people's imaginations," Epler said.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/microsoft-denies-report-it-could-have-shut-down-xbox-business-in-2021/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft-denies-report-it-could-have-shut-down-xbox-business-in-2021.1084956/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/microsoft-denies-report-it-could-have-shut-down-xbox-business-in-2021/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Earlier this week, tech insider website The Information <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/microsofts-gaming-business-falls-short-despite-activision" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella faced a difficult choice in 2021 regarding the Xbox business. He could either wind down the whole thing or double down by making massive investments, such as the $68.7 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard (following that of Bethesda's parent company, ZeniMax).</p>
<p>He obviously chose the latter option. However, The Information makes the case that the gaming business is failing to keep up with Microsoft's growth plans despite these investments, starting with the fact that they didn't even come close to reaching the 11% target necessary to trigger Nadella's bonus, since growth stopped at 5.8%. It was the only division that fell short of reaching the bonus threshold for the Microsoft CEO.</p>
<p>The Information also shared a few comments on the situation gathered from investors and analysts. Denny Fish, a Janus Henderson Investors portfolio manager whose clients own over $800 million in Microsoft stock, said that the acquisition of Activision Blizzard has been disappointing so far.</p>
<p><em>It’s also a business that had some degree of consistency over, like, a three- to five-year period but was highly volatile from year to year, because you’re so dependent on the big releases like Call of Duty.</em></p>
<p>Truthfully, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-sets-franchise-and-game-pass-records/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">did very well this year</a>, though the jury is still out on whether its day-one inclusion on Game Pass was beneficial from a financial standpoint. Despite the boasting about record numbers, Microsoft did not reveal any updated figures for Game Pass subscriptions. The last official number we have is February 2024's 34 million subscribers. As a reminder, the original plan before the Activision buyout was to reach 100 million active subscribers by 2030.</p>
<p>This was also <a href="https://wccftech.com/game-pass-to-reach-100-million-when-activision-games-are-added-says-pachter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Michael Pachter's prediction</a> for when the Activision titles would be added to Game Pass. Most of them are there now, though, and clearly, the numbers aren't anywhere near that lofty figure. Pachter still sounds confident in the plan, anyway. Here's what he told The Information:</p>
<p><em>Seventy billion dollars is not a pittance—it’s a lot of cash. They might lose money in the short term, which is fine, as long as they can prove that in the long run Game Pass is a solid source of recurring revenue.</em></p>
<p>Another investment manager, Gus Zinn from Macquarie Science and Technology Fund, has a different view:</p>
<p><em>I just think the majority of the game market doesn’t really want a Game Pass.</em></p>
<p>There are highly conflicting views on Microsoft's game subscription service. Some developers <a href="https://wccftech.com/game-pass-sales-higher-rockfish/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">absolutely swear by it</a>, while others are skeptical, to say the least. <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-games-lose-80-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to former GamesIndustry.biz head Christopher Dring</a>, developers can usually expect to lose up to 80% of premium sales on Xbox consoles if their game is on Game Pass.</p>
<p>Anyway, a Microsoft spokesperson has now denied the aforementioned rumor that Satya Nadella could have shut down Xbox a few years back. In a statement <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-activision-deny-report-regarding-financial-performance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to Insider Gaming</a>, they have noted Microsoft CEO's prior comments about being <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-ceo-were-all-in-on-games-xbox-series-sx-are-our-fastest-selling-consoles-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">all-in on gaming</a>.</p>
<p>On another, not entirely unrelated note, Microsoft has cut some jobs in gaming as well as other divisions (security, devices, experiences), as <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/microsoft-lays-off-more-staff-in-gaming-division" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported by PC Mag</a>. The cuts are reportedly very small compared to last year's <a href="https://wccftech.com/four-months-after-the-merger-with-activision-blizzard-microsoft-is-laying-off-1900-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">massive 1900+ layoffs in January</a>.</p>

            <p>Trading will be added to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket">Pokémon TCG Pocket</a> later this month.</p>
<p>The Pokémon Company teased the feature at the game's launch - it's been right there, "coming soon", since the app launched - but finally we have more information about which cards will be tradeable.</p>
<p>Firstly, trades can only be done between friends and only with cards of the same rarity. So no swapping one of those millions of Ponyta for a shiny Mewtwo.</p>

<p>The Pokémon Company also stated that only certain cards from both the Genetic Apex and Mythical Island booster packs will be available to trade. "We are planning to continue to expand the selection of booster packs that you can trade from," it said.</p>
<p>Cards with a rarity of 1-4 diamond and 1 star can be traded. This excludes both Ex cards (generally the rarest of all) and Promo cards found in events.</p>

<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Hello!

<p>Lastly, an item will need to be consumed in order to trade, presumably to stop the feature being overused (and surely provides another monetisation opportunity).</p>
<p>"We'll continue to monitor player feedback and assess future updates to the trade feature while keeping in mind how to balance both the ease and enjoyability of collecting," The Pokémon Company said.</p>
<p>Further, the statement confirms the next booster pack will also be added this month, though no more details were given.</p>
<p>The last booster pack was the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mew-headlines-next-pokemon-tcg-pocket-booster-packs">Mythical Island pack</a>, headlined by Mew, that was released in December.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Sony has cancelled two more unannounced games that were part of its broad push toward live services, potentially putting jobs at risk at Bend Studio and Bluepoint Games, it’s reported.</p>
<p>A company spokesperson confirmed the cancellations to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-16/sony-cancels-two-more-playstation-projects?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTczNzA2ODk1MywiZXhwIjoxNzM3NjczNzUzLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTUTdFWjJUMEcxS1cwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.OtpjLAX_fLRPjeIhmdZSXLhsiFNDef1RlL6IxoCIQes&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">Bloomberg</a>, who broke the story overnight, saying that the two games were cancelled “following a recent review”, but also stating that neither studio will be shut down as a consequence of this.</p>


<p>“Bend and Bluepoint are highly accomplished teams who are valued members of the PlayStation Studios family, and we are working closely with each studio to determine what are the next projects,” the spokesperson said.</p>
<p>As unannounced projects, we don’t know for sure what either team was working on, though <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2022/12/15/seasons-greetings-2022-playstation-blog-and-friends/">Bluepoint teased something God of War related</a> in Christmas well-wishes from 2022. Bend Studio</p>
<p>There’s obviously the potential for job losses as a consequence of this, and it’s not clear if these were the only projects that either studio was working on, but in an internal memo that Bloomberg has seen, Sony said that it’s “working closely with Bend and Bluepoint to determine what are the next projects and plan to do everything we can to ensure there is minimal business impact.”</p>

<p>It’s the latest embarrassing fumble from Sony in what will go down as one of the worst games industry pivots in recent memory. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/02/02/ps5-10-live-service-games-march-2026-last-of-us-guerrilla-bungie-london-studio/">Announced in 2022 to investors</a>, Sony had plans to launch 12 live service games by 2026, and while there have been some success stories, like last year’s breakout hit <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> or the bankable popularity of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/games/gran-turismo-7">Gran Turismo 7</a> (which can be considered a live service game here), there’s been far more ignominious failures.</p>
<p>The biggest flop by far was obviously <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/concord">Concord</a> last year, which made it to release but was almost immediately pulled and shut down, with Firewalk Studios shut down a couple months later. That followed the closure of London Studios, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/10/28/london-studio-is-making-a-fantasy-online-co-op-game-for-ps5/">reportedly working on a fantasy online co-op game</a>, Naughty Dog <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/12/15/the-last-of-us-online-has-been-cancelled/">canning their The Last of Us multiplayer game</a>, Firesprite’s Twisted Metal live service game being <a href="https://twitter.com/jasonschreier/status/1762503092593999913?s=46">canned while in pre-production</a>, shutting down <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/09/deviation-games-has-shut-down/">Deviation Games</a>, and seeing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/02/reports-destiny-spin-off-cancelled-and-the-final-shape-underperformed-but-bungie-layoffs-were-always-planned/">major struggles for Bungie</a> as they try to broaden their scope from the end of Destiny 2’s main narrative to releasing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/marathon">Marathon</a>.</p>
<p>Some live service projects are still underway, including <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/05/24/haven-studios-fairgame-playstation-exlcusive/">Fairgame$ from Jade Raymond’s studio Haven</a>, a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/11/09/a-horizon-mmorpg-is-reportedly-in-development-by-ncsoft/">Horizon MMORPG</a>, an unknown live service game from Jason Blundell (who was previously at Deviation), and a game called Gummy Bears, which was spun out from Bungie last August.</p>
<p>Games are cancelled and pivoted all the time, but having announced their plans for so many live service games and an intention to latch onto the consistent revenue streams that they can provide, this has become a consistent failure point from Sony. We’re glad that there’s no layoffs right now, but unless Bend Studio (whose last game was 2019’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/04/25/days-gone-review/">Days Gone</a>) and Bluepoint Games (whose last game was the 2020 <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/11/20/demons-souls-review-ps5/">Demon’s Souls</a> remake) can be pushed onto other projects, job losses and studio closures could follow.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/vegas-falcons-respawn-8s-tournament-cod/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/vegas-falcons-support-cod%E2%80%99s-pro-scene-with-a-10-000-respawn-8%E2%80%99s-tournament.1084947/</guid>

<p>Call of Duty’s pro scene isn’t in a good place. From lengthy gaps between stages to Black Ops 6 being in a pit thanks to cheaters, the Call of Duty League isn’t all that appealing right now. That’s a huge sticking point for both fans and pro players, most of whom rely on COD’s competitive ecosystem to make a living.</p>



<p>To support the floundering esports scene, Vegas Falcons, which entered the CDL this season, has stood up a Respawn 8s tournament with a sizeable cash prize to keep the content flowing.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-falcons-on-top">Falcons on Top</h2>



<p>Despite being at the bottom of the CDL standings, the Vegas Falcons are trying their darndest to help the scene out as much as possible. One of the biggest issues in the Call of Duty esports ecosystem is the lack of content. Outside of the CDL, there’s not much to watch, leaving the scene’s brands and creators to organise tournaments and events.</p>



<p>And the less said about Warzone, the better. It’s in a shocker of a spot right now.</p>



<p>Today, the Vegas Falcons revealed a $10,000 Respawn 8s tournament, set to run from today through the weekend (17 – 26 Jan). On <a href="https://x.com/VegasFalcons/status/1880057467968934354" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a>, the organisation wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Introducing the Vegas Falcons Ladder</p>



<p>A pick-up game initiative designed to bring together the best talent to fight for $10,000 over 10 days. </p>



<p>Who will be crowned king ahead of Major I?</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Major I is the most highly anticipated event of the CDL season thus far. It’s taking place in Madrid between January 30 and February 2, marking the first EU Major in Call of Duty League history. After that, things return stateside for Major II, which will take place in Texas, and then Major III, set to surface in Florida in April.</p>



<p>Do you think it’s fair that organisations have to scrape together to arrange events just to keep the fans switched on? Let us know your thoughts on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <p>
This week on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/newscast">Eurogamer Newscast</a>, there's only one story in town: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Nintendo's long-awaited unveiling of Switch 2</a>.
</p>
<p>Today's video laid out the bare bones of Switch 2, and it looked exactly as expected: like a slightly-larger Switch with an extra button and mysterious optical sensors. We also got a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-announcement-reveals-new-mario-kart-game">very brief look at a new Mario Kart</a>, which looks... like a Mario Kart game. If anything, today's video only prompted more questions.</p>
<p>What will Mario Kart 9's main new feature be? Today's gameplay snippet - while brief - offered up a couple of intriguing clues. And when will Switch 2 actually arrive? Well, between the announcement of a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-direct-confirmed-for-april-with-more-info-following-todays-brief-reveal">proper Nintendo Direct in April</a> and the console's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-announces-switch-2-public-hands-on-tour">upcoming public hands-on tour</a>, we think there's a relatively narrow window. Joining me this week to discuss everything we saw - as well as what we're still waiting to hear about - are Ed Nightinale and Victoria Kennedy.</p>

            <p>Sony has cancelled two more of its once-envisioned live service Playstation projects.</p>
<p>Back in February 2022, Sony stated it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plans-to-launch-more-than-10-live-service-games-before-march-2026">aimed to launch over 10 new live service games</a> over the coming years. A month later, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-exec-jim-ryan-believes-live-service-games-will-dominate-over-subscriptions">then-Sony exec Jim Ryan said he believed live service games were a key part of gaming's future</a>, confident in PlayStation's live service push.</p>
<p>However, since then, the company has been pulling back on this vision, with several proposed projects cancelled. And now, two more live service games have been added to that list.</p>

</figure>
<p>A report by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-16/sony-cancels-two-more-playstation-projects">Bloomberg</a> now reveals two further live service games - one from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/days-gone">Days Gone</a> developer Bend and one from Bluepoint - have been cancelled by PlayStation following a "recent review".</p>
<p>The company did not say whether these cancellations will lead to any layoffs, however it said neither of the two affected PlayStation studios will be shut down. "Bend and Bluepoint are highly accomplished teams who are valued members of the PlayStation Studios family, and we are working closely with each studio to determine what are the next projects," a spokesperson told Bloomberg.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a memo sent to staff stated Sony was going to do "everything" it can to "ensure there is minimal business impact" following the recent cancellations. In the meantime, PlayStation will continue making both online and single-player games.</p>
<p>As for what the impacted studios were working on, according to reporter <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lfvfm2febc2e">Jason Schrier</a>, Bluepoint was developing a live service game within the God of War series.</p>
<p>Bend, meanwhile, revealed it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bend-studios-new-ip-builds-upon-the-open-world-systems-of-days-gone">working on a new IP which would include multiplayer and "[build] upon the open-world systems of Days Gone"</a> back in 2022. In March of last year, a recruitment advert was posted to the studio's website, which revealed the team was looking to secure a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bend-studios-next-project-will-be-a-aaa-live-service-game">lead project manager with "hands on game development experience in leadership roles shipping AAA live-service games"</a>.</p>

<p>Today's news that Sony has cancelled two more live service projects sees PlayStation stepping further back from those lofty plans it shared just a few years ago. While the company has had a success story in the shape of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> - which released last year and quickly became a hit - others have not fared so well.</p><p>Most prominently, Sony's 5v5 sci-fi shooter Concord was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-pulled-from-sale-as-sony-admits-our-initial-launch-didnt-land">taken offline just two weeks after its PC and PS5 debut</a>, following a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-sales-fail-to-lift-off-on-steam-where-just-660-people-played-at-launch">lackluster launch and weak sales</a>. The game had been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-was-in-development-for-roughly-eight-years-firewalk-dev-confirms">in the works for eight years</a>, it had been said.</p>
<p>Numerous other live service games have been cancelled by Sony, including London Studio's co-op game, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-laying-off-900-playstation-employees-london-studio-to-close-in-its-entirety">the studio also shut down last year</a>. In 2023, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-online-officially-cancelled-by-naughty-dog">Naughty Dog cancelled its standalone multiplayer game set in the world of The Last of Us</a>. Additionally, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-studio-firesprite-has-been-shedding-talent-amidst-accusations-of-toxic-culture-staff-say">live service Twisted Metal project at Firespite was cancelled</a>. In March of last year, footage of a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/footage-of-insomniacs-seemingly-canceled-live-service-spider-man-the-great-web-appears-online">cancelled co-operative live service Spider-Man game from developer Insomniac</a> - titled Spider-Man: The Great Web - appeared online.</p>
<p>While some live service projects still remain in the pipeline, in 2023, it was said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonys-live-service-pivot-may-not-pay-off-the-way-jim-ryan-had-once-hoped-says-industry-insider">Sony was "uncomfortable"</a> about outgoing PlayStation boss Jim Ryan's pivot to games as a service.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Friends, another soul is departing the RPS treehouse today. Ed has decided to lay down the mantle of reviews editor and rejoin polite society. Come join me in saying goodbye.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Ed started at RPS back in 2020. He had been working on Metabomb, another site operated by RPS's then-owners which was closing down. We already knew how good a writer Edders, as we call him, was at that point - and what a lovely man, from chatting around the office - so we grabbed hold of him with both hands and didn't let go.
</p>
<p>You ought to know Ed's work by now. He's been reviews editor around these parts <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/say-hello-and-welcome-to-our-new-reviews-editor-ed-thorn">for around 18 months</a>, but he was a senior staff writer for over two years before that. He <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/why-is-it-so-hard-to-plant-carrots-in-valheim">obsessed over Valheim carrots</a>, mused on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lost-ark-is-the-mmo-equivalent-of-grey-carpet">grey carpets</a>, and explained <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gears-of-war-and-badminton-have-more-in-common-than-you-might-think">how badminton and Gears Of War were alike</a>. That last one is a favourite of mine, as is Ed's similar piece on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/for-two-years-kento-momota-had-the-best-game-in-the-world">his favourite badminton player retiring</a>.

<p>As reviews editor, Ed's been responsible for wrangling code from developers and words from the team and from freelancers, which is no mean feat. He's also written a cavalcade of excellent reviews himself. I'm most fond of his take on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/shin-chan-shiro-and-the-coal-town-review">Shin-chan: Shiro And The Coal Town late last year</a>, which drew on his personal history with Japan, or his frequent, breathless writing about his love of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/yakuza-like-a-dragon-review">various</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-review">Yakuza</a> games.
</p>
<p>You should also check <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/that-oblivion-feeling">Ed's own reflections on his departure in a separate article</a>. It's a good trip down memory lane, at least for those of us who work here.</p>
<p>We've had more goodbyes than welcomes at RPS of late, but that should change in the months to come as we'll be hiring for a new reviews editor. Yet there will only ever be one Reviews Edders. Join me in wishing Ed an RPS In Peace in the comments below.
