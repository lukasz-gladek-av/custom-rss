              <p>Several retailers kick off the new year by rolling out sales right away, and many of those deals stick around. Almost every category out there sees massive drops, making it a great time to stock up on holiday essentials, plus grab the items that feel a little out of reach the rest of the year (TVs, laptops, tablets, premium headphones, etc). You can even grab games for less, both board and digital ones!</p>
<p>If you’re looking for something action-packed, we just spotted Battlefield 6 by EA on sale at Amazon.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6650/"> The PS5 and Xbox Series X version are going for $64, after a nice 43% drop</a>. If you’re planning to relax and get some much-deserved playtime in during the holidays, today is a good time to prep for it. Note that if you don’t spot a discount on the page, click “See All Buying Options” on the left to view all the drops available. You might want to act fast, as the title is high in demand, and we’re not expecting the drop to stay around for long. In fact, keeping past trends in mind, it might not even make it through the weekend.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6650/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>The Ultimate Warfare Experience</h2>
<p>Tactile movement and overhauled gunplay make every shot and movement feel more precise, setting an entirely new standard of FPS combat. High-intensity infantry combat or aerial dogfights, you’re going to enjoy full control over every action, just the way you like it. There is more than one way to win and play; go for large-scale modes like Conquest, Breakthrough, and Rush to unleash chaos, or push your limits with fast-paced action with King of the Hill, Domination, and Payload.</p>



<p>Upgraded Battlefield Portal is a sandbox that lets you customize your gaming experience by changing rules, scaling things, and even duplicating objects; the possibilities are endless, and you can quite literally have anything you could think of. Want to have something entirely based on your own imagination? It makes it easy to develop a unique game mode using NPC scripting and a customizable UI, which can then even be picked as an official Battlefield mode. Then there’s Campaign, which puts you in an elite squad of Marine Raiders fighting tirelessly to save the world, so you’re constantly adapting and improvising to tackle what every moment unfolds.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6650/">On a regular day, the upgraded Battlefield 6 would run you around $70, but this deal lets you pick it up for $40 for PS5 and Xbox Series X.</a> We know it’s huge discount, and considering how the game doesn’t go on sale often, definitely one that’s worth it. Plus, it makes it easy to pick a few titles during the sale without blowing your budget. Again, the sale is around for a short time, so it’s best to grab it quickly. Our shopping team is covering the best gaming deals as they come, so it’s worth keeping an eye out. More drops will surface as the sale goes on, and you can use this time to prepare a holiday library for that well-earned downtime.</p>

<figure data-uuid="69e77682d8424"><a title="Myles Metroid" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/69e77682d8424/myles-metroid.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>When <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4</a> previews dropped <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/previews/metroid-prime-4-beyond-is-great-but-i-want-to-kill-one-of-its-characters">back in November</a>, series fans were rightly worried that the biggest killer in the game may not be scourge of the Space Pirates and bounty hunter extraordinaire Samus Aran, but a geeky sidekick apparently out to murder the series' pensive, lonesome tone with his inane geekery and unwanted guidance.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/round-up-the-final-previews-are-in-for-metroid-prime-4-beyond">Not every previewer found him grating</a>, but the general pre-release sentiment was that chatter from Myles MacKenzie and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/metroid-prime-4-beyond-meet-the-team">the Galactic Federation team</a> risked destroying the mood which feels like a defining characteristic of the series.</p><div><figure data-videoid="6TAq6m9hxyY" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt6TAq6m9hxyY" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed76f4cetuhnlv&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>Fortunately, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">on playing the full game</a>, it became apparent that the engineer — who can only be the product of a tryst between Gordon Freeman, Zack Braff, and Rick Moranis — wasn't half as obnoxious as he came across in the opening section.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">In his review</a>, Ollie said he "genuinely came to enjoy" the presence of the Troopers, and Myles' pinging in the Sol Valley was only a mild irritation in the grand scheme. Perhaps Nintendo should have done a better job showcasing the wider experience for the preview, because MacKenzie made a poor first impression on a lot of people.</p>
<p>Now that the game's been out for a full month and everyone's had time to step into Samus' shoes and witness firsthand Galactic Federation types geeking out over her, we wonder: <em>Have your thoughts on Myles mellowed?</em> Have you, in fact, come to appreciate his help and upgrades? Or have you been a fan from the beginning?</p>
<figure data-uuid="0644f05110cbb"><a title="Myles Metroid" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0644f05110cbb/myles-metroid.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Myles was definitely, appropriately, a point of conversation early doors, but it <em>feels</em> like people have warmed up to him in the last few weeks. Some discoveries and interviews since release have also shed some light on the developers' thinking behind the game's design, encompassing Myles and his loquacious comrades.</p>
<p>A little datamining <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/fans-uncover-unused-dialogue-from-metroid-prime-4">in the weeks post-launch</a> brought to light over 30 minutes of Federation Trooper dialogue that was left on the cutting room floor, so it seems Retro and Nintendo trimmed back some of the game's chatter for one reason or another. Team Ninja's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/metroid_other_m">Other M</a> divided opinion for (among other reasons) being a fairly 'talky' Metroid, and Retro — the studio behind the previous three Prime games — was presumably conscious of maintaining tonal continuity, even if many people from the original Prime dev team are long gone.</p>
<p>In a recent interview with Famitsu, Nintendo <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/nintendo-suggests-metroid-prime-4s-tortured-development-meant-it-was-divorced-from-the-changing-of-times">said</a> that the game's protracted development and intentional choices to stick with an original vision produced in a game "divorced from the changing of times", resulting in a more "limited" open world than we've grown accustomed to over the Switch generation.</p>
<p>Would a more expansive, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild">Breath of the Wild</a>-style Viewros have affected Myles' patter? You might assume it would increase the quota of 'helpful' radio chatter, but Navi wasn't back and bothering Link in BOTW's Hyrule, was she? An open-world approach would have necessitated a total redesign, though — as discussed in the Famitsu interview — and Nintendo wasn't going to start from scratch again. The solitary ambience is a key part of the Metroid experience, but so too is exploring and unlocking areas on a contained map. As the "Nintendo spokesperson" put it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Metroid’s core element of ‘increasing the amount of explorable areas by unlocking powers’ is not very compatible with the ‘freedom to go anywhere from the beginning’ of open worlds."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That doesn't mean you <em>couldn't</em> design a Prime game with that in mind, but that's a very different concept requiring a different approach — and a different pace — to let the terrain do the talking.</p>
<figure data-uuid="81346e26c382d"><a title="Myles Metroid" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/81346e26c382d/myles-metroid.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Having gotten used to more intelligent design, especially from Nintendo, Myles' chatter is a throwback which rubs some people the wrong way. Perhaps it's nothing to do with his personality - he's just the personification of tired game design that feels old and irritating at best, patronising at worst.</p>
<p>Beyond the Navi-like hand-holding, you could argue that he's part of a proud tradition of Nintendo characters that fans love to hate. Does a cult-like following await the maligned, misunderstood 'Metroid Myles'? Will his name one day be whispered in the reverent tones of a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/soapbox-20-years-after-his-last-mainline-appearance-tingle-deserves-a-comeback">Tingle</a> and an <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/soapbox-a-love-letter-to-my-favourite-new-character-in-zelda-totk">Addison</a>? Will Jim be cracking out his <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/soapbox">soapbox</a> for a staunch defence in the coming weeks?</p>
<p>For now, let us know below if you think he deserved the Jar Jar-brand vitriol or if a month of MacKenzie has revealed his charms to you. In the ranks of all-time Myles/Miles, he's certainly no Prower or Morales or <em>O'Brien</em>, but who is? Let's not hold that against him.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Fans of <strong>Western roleplaying games</strong> can start the year a little more hopeful that <strong>The Blood of Dawnwalker</strong> will indeed launch in 2026, following the release of the <a href="https://youtu.be/pi53m9XLE00" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">developer's '<strong>Launch Year Special</strong>' video</a>. </p>



<p><strong>Konrad Tomaszkiewicz</strong>, founder of <strong>Rebel Wolves</strong> and former Game Director of <strong>The Witcher III: Wild Hunt</strong> at <strong>CD Projekt RED</strong>, joined Global Community Lead <strong>Dominika Burza</strong> to share this message:</p>



<p><em><strong>Dominika Burza</strong>: It's been one full year since we gathered here and <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-blood-of-dawnwalker-open-world-rpg-revealed-with-gorgeous-trailer-and-in-game-sneak-peek/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unveiled The Blood of Dawnwalker to the world</a>, and what a year it was!</em></p>



<p><em><strong>Konrad Tomaszkiewicz</strong>: We are really honored and humbled by your amazing reactions to our first intro cinematic trailer, our gameplay videos, and presentations. </em></p>



<p><em><strong>Dominika Burza</strong>: Yes, and it's been incredible to meet so many of you in person at the events all over the world, including Gamescom, PAX East and West, TwitchCon, and Poznan Game Arena. </em></p>



<p><em><strong>Konrad Tomaszkiewicz</strong>: I want to thank you all, because hearing from you is what motivates us and inspires us.</em></p>



<p><em><strong>Dominika Burza</strong>: Also when it comes to the feedback. We're making this game for you, and that's why we always want to show you the game in its current state as we progress through different stages of development, even if it sometimes means showcasing content that doesn't fully represent the final quality we're aiming for. </em></p>



<p><em><strong>Konrad Tomaszkiewicz</strong>: We can't promise to implement all of your suggestions, but we do appreciate them, and we always check what can be done. We would like to ask for your trust. We want this game to be great as much as you do. </em></p>



<p><em><strong>Dominika Burza</strong>: Yes. Looking forward, The Blood of Dawnwalker launches this year. We won't reveal the release date today, but you can expect to start hearing from us more and more. </em></p>



<p><em><strong>Konrad Tomaszkiewicz</strong>: We still have so much content to show you. Gameplay features, locations, characters.</em></p>



<p><em><strong>Dominika Burza</strong>: Exactly! You haven't even met the entire main cast of characters yet. Or creatures, or music. </em></p>



<p><em><strong>Konrad Tomaszkiewicz</strong>: So, to begin 2026 on a high note, we are really excited to present you the new The Blood of Dawnwalker main musical theme.</em></p>

<p>Rebel Wolves have already proven they are indeed listening to fan feedback regarding pre-release gameplay footage and features of The Blood of Dawnwalker. As <strong>Creative Director Mateusz Tomaszkiewicz</strong> told us <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-blood-of-dawnwalker-qa-vampiric-nature-impact-coen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in an exclusive Gamescom 2025 interview</a>, the directional combat is still in the game, but because some gamers expressed concerns with it, the developers also introduced the ability to play the game more like a traditional action roleplaying game. That was just one change that came from the community's feedback; others include active abilities being more seamlessly integrated into combat, the radial menu no longer causing time to stop (now it slows down), and the ability to customize the camera's proximity to the main character separately for combat and exploration.</p>



<p>The Blood of Dawnwalker <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-role-playing-games-of-2026-legends-and-legacies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">easily made our shortlist of the five most promising RPGs scheduled in 2026</a>. The game, powered by Unreal Engine 5, will be released for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

            <guid>1396699</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>It appears Ubisoft have settled on a name for their heavily leaked remake of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag/">Assassin’s Creed Black Flag</a> as a domain has been registered with the game’s name and “Resynced” added to the end.</p>
<p>The Black Flag Resynced domain was registered 25 days ago by a company Ubisoft has used previously, including for the registration of the latest Prince of Persia game.&nbsp; Ubisoft have said they would be plundering their back catalogue for remakes and remasters but they have yet to officially announce this remake. That has not stopped lots of details leaking out.</p>


<p>It seems like the remake, which will use Anvil Pipeline engine, is going to feature some fairly big changes. The most notable change will be the removal of all the modern-day sequences so we will not see Rebbeca, Shaun and the others. The modern-day plot, which worked really well in the first few games with Desmond, has gradually been side-lined and only appears as text in Assassin’s Creed Shadows. Replacing it will be “a few extra hours of content” including content that was cut from the original release, such as parts of Mary Read’s story.</p>
<p>Gameplay is said to be closer to the RPG style of the more recent games, with loot, stats for weapons, and a new inventory. The combat is is also said to lean more towards the style of the recent games. The map is the same size but will have more things to do, and modern systems mean there will be no loading screens when docking your ship and heading to land.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qngrBQnukFc">report from the respected Jeux Vidéo Magazine s</a>uggests the game will now launch in early 2026, probably in March, which is a little later than previous reports. Ubisoft Singapore, Belgrade and Bordeaux are working on it, and some assets from Skull &amp; Bones may be reused to save costs.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Year In Review: 2025 Is The Year The Console Wars Ended]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/year-in-review-2025-is-the-year-the-console-wars-ended/</link>
            <guid>1396696</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>As a 32-year-old who was in high school during the peak of the PlayStation and Xbox war, 2025 was surreal to me. I was raised as a PlayStation gamer, and even to this day, I have never owned an Xbox console. When the PS3 was being absolutely dominated by the Xbox 360 by all metrics in the mid-to-late 00s, it sucked. The PlayStation 2 is the best-selling console of all time, and the PS3 did an awful job of following it.</p>



<p>It had few must-have exclusives for years, while the Xbox 360 was throwing out the likes of Halo, Gears of War, Forza, Banjo-Kazooie, Viva Piñata, and Left 4 Dead like there was no tomorrow. Eventually, the PS3 went on an exclusive hot streak, and the tide seismically shifted Sony’s way with the PS4 and Xbox One. This has continued with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/five-years-of-ps5-what-the-numbers-say/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PS5</a> and Xbox Series X|S, to the point where it’s evident Microsoft has waved the white flag in the console wars once and for all.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-gears-of-war-is-over">The Gears of War…Is Over</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to The Coalition</figcaption></figure>



<p>Xbox’s game plan shifted with the Xbox One, tailoring the experience more toward an all-purpose media device, as opposed to Sony and PlayStation’s single-minded vision for the PS4: Gaming. I feel this is the pivotal moment where Xbox got everything <strong>wrong</strong>, allowing PlayStation to catch up, and the blue brand hasn’t looked back since.</p>



<p>The PS4 outsold the Xbox more than 2 to 1 (which is huge), but Microsoft managed to find a way to engage and retain a healthy amount of its player base—the allure of Xbox Game Pass. A paid subscription service offering a huge catalog of games, including Xbox exclusives, and giving players a new Xbox exclusive on day one.</p>



<p>This was an effective tactic for the longest time. But the model has long been touted as destructive to the industry: Ask <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arkane-studios-founder-game-pass-unsustainable/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arkane Studios’ founder, who branded Game Pass as ‘Unsustainable’ and ‘Damaging’</a>. 2025 saw the infamous <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-tries-to-defend-xbox-game-pass-price-increase/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Game Pass price hike</a> that left everyone in shock, but it doesn’t seem to have had the big negative impact that was feared.</p>



<p>Microsoft is still making games, but there’s talk that future Xbox ‘exclusives’ are PS5-bound. This is probably expected after a manic 2025, which has effectively seen the console wars end, and Microsoft give up its biggest IPs to its once-rival.</p>



<h2 id="h-halo-for-your-thoughts-xbox">Halo For Your Thoughts, Xbox?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Image from Microsoft</figcaption></figure>



<p>There’s probably an alternate timeline somewhere where Xbox Elite controllers are being used to guide Nathan Drake to Shambhala, strum a guitar in The Last of Us Part 2, and help guide Kratos and Atreus through the fires of Muspelheim. We’re in <em>this </em>timeline, where the Horizon festival is bouncing on PS5 Pros, and Astro Bot-themed devices are having their analog sticks twiddled and turned in an effort to combat Gears of War Reloaded’s Locust.</p>



<p>2025 has been a mega year for PlayStation gamers such as myself. Forza has always eluded me, so has Gears of War, and it’s been a pleasure to soak up these legendary franchises that have stood tall as pillars of Microsoft’s success. However, you can pinpoint the moment when hell froze over, the skies were rife with airborne pigs, and the cows finally came home.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/halo-combat-evolved-remake-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Halo: Campaign Evolved was officially announced</a> on October 24, and I think it was the <strong>final nail in the coffin for the console wars</strong>. </p>



<p>The biased, 14-year-old Sony fanboy in me felt smug, but maturity hits different. I don’t know how I feel now. A unified platform where games can be played on one console is logically the most consumer-friendly solution. Obviously, Nintendo will never let this happen as it doesn’t need to. But it’s almost shocking that it’s come to this: PlayStation logos appearing in Xbox trailers, and even future Xbox games will likely be coming to PS5 to maximize Microsoft profits. </p>



<p>But where does Xbox go from here? If the biggest Xbox games can be played on PC and PS5, why own an Xbox? Blind brand loyalty? Years of digital purchases and investments forcing you to stick to Xbox? This is where Insider Gaming wants to hear from the community. Do you agree that the console wars are officially over? What’s the best thing Microsoft can do from here?

            <guid>1396690</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Welcome back to our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/most-wanted-2026">Most Wanted Games of 2026</a> countdown where we now enter the Top 40, as though we were counting down the top 40 songs of the week. In this list, there is a real big mix of genres with no game here quite like the other. We’ve got fighting in space, fighting in space again, fighting on the streets, fighting in the jungle, and then fighting in a cartoon. Yes, there is lots violence and some resource management ahead.</p>
<h2>40 – Battlestar Galactica: Scattered Hopes</h2>
<p><em>PC – Q1 2026</em></p>
<p>The early 2000s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/battlestar-galactica">Battlestar Galactica</a> is one of my favourite TV series, even if it did lose its way towards the end. A story of humanity fleeing through space while being chased by the unrelenting Cylons, and the personal stories of the people living through it all really grabbed the attention of millions of people. There have been Battlestar Galactica games before, but <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/battlestar-galactica-scattered-hope">Battlestar Galactica: Scattered Hopes</a> provides a new way to experience this universe.</p>
<p><iframe title="Battlestar Galactica: Scattered Hopes | Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jNCBvhusit8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>You are not part of Admiral Adama’s fleet, but a Gunstar Captain who is on their own journey leading a fleet of survivors trying to join Admiral Adama. However, the journey will be tough, and the gameplay will lend to that. That’s because Battlestar Galactica: Scattered Hopes is roguelite where your choices determine how resources are allocated across the fleet, how you manage each faction’s demands, and how you survive encounters with the Cylons. With each run, you will learn which tools work for different situations and get unlocks that will provide some advantage in your future runs. Battlestar Galactica: Scattered Hopes is essentially <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ftl">FTL</a> on a grander scale.</p>

<h2>39 – R-Type Dimensions III</h2>
<p><em>PS5, NSW2, NSW, PC – May 2026</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/r-type-dimensions-iii">R-Type Dimensions III</a> is one that side scrolling shooter fans should be keeping an eye on. It is a game using rebuilt assets of R-Type III: The Third Lightning, allowing players to experience classic gameplay in both 2D and 3D options visual options. You can see it the announcement trailer how the two styles look.</p>
<p><iframe title="R-Type Dimensions III Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bXOKxxPsUvs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Alongside the visual upgrade, R-Type Dimensions III will also feature local co-op multiplayer with a change in the scoring along with new survival mechanics. It will also made advanced mode available from the very beginning, and new accessibility options too.</p>
<h2>38 – Samson: A Tyndalston Story</h2>
<p><em>PC, Consoles – 2026</em></p>
<p>When one of the main creators of the Just Cause franchise announces a new game with their new studio, Liquid Swords, you sit up and listen. Just Cause built up a huge fan base for its open world where players could use their imaginations to cause havoc in various ways. Now Christofer Sundberg and the team at Liquid Swords are taking elements of that legacy to create a new, more grounded experience in Samson: A Tyndalston Story.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="SAMSON | Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OQ4z_yQE5Xo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Samson is in a load of debt, and the people he owes are now coming to collect. To pay that money back Samson has to take on various missions from hits to getaway driving to try and pay the debt down. What is interesting about Samson is that you cannot just go and do every mission, with only so many missions that can be done in a day. There is no mission fail state either, so you have to deal with the consequences of your actions. Liquid Swords has also said that vehicle combat is going to be a key element of the game and every vehicle can be used as a weapon, as well as items in the environment when getting into street fights. We also know that the main story of Samson: A Tyndalston Story will last around 10 hours, but over double that if players choose to explore the city in depth.</p>
<h2>37 – Hell Let Loose: Vietnam</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – 2026</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/hell-let-loose">Hell Let Loose</a> is one of the most intense multiplayer experiences I have taken part in. Massive battlefields with teams of 50 going against each other in battles that can be slow and suddenly have bursts of action, with players needing to communicate to really get the best of the game to complete objectives. It was a tough enough experience in the setting of World War II, so the sequel being set in Vietnam is going to add a whole new set of challenges for players.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Hell Let Loose: Vietnam | First Gameplay Reveal Trailer | World Exclusive with @IGN" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5bwfPLwLwQk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Instead of the open battlefields of the original, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/hell-let-loose-vietnam">Hell Let Loose: Vietnam</a> puts you in the dense jungles where American and Vietcong forces battled a mix of open and guerrilla warfare. Players are going to have access to a lot more tools with helicopters and boats both being core vehicles to use to navigate, along with the tunnels the Vietcong constructed to bypass and ambush soldiers. Hell Let Loose: Vietnam has the potential to be one of the most ambitious and memorable multiplayer experiences of 2026.</p>
<p>Check out <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/03/hell-let-loose-vietnam-preview-choppers-tunnels-and-a-new-era-of-war/">our early preview of the game</a> from Gamescom in August.</p>
<h3>36 – Mouse: PI For Hire</h3>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – 19th March 2026</em></p>
<p>Mouse: PI For Hire looks like the kind of game that could absolutely become a cult classic. It essentially takes the animation artstyle of the 1930s and bends it into video game form, making the whole thing set in the city of Mouseburg and making all the character mice that would fit in any early Disney cartoon. It then adds the great twist of taking that family friendly style and turning it into a noir-styled first person shooter.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="MOUSE: P.I. For Hire | Official Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IlwZMgDK-kQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In Mouse: PI For Hire you are Jack Pepper, who is being voiced by Troy Baker. Things start off with the classic damsel in distress opening that a cornerstone of a lot of noir fiction, but what is said to follow is a dive into the corrupt criminal underworld of Mouseburg where not everything is as it seems. You will be able to explore places like the city streets, the sewers, a casino, a film studio, and the docks, with each having loot and collectibles.</p>
<p><em>Five more games down, and it doesn’t take a private investigator (mouse or otherwise) to figure out that there’ll be another fistful of games coming in a list tomorrow as well!</em></p>

<figure data-uuid="f83aa3661410b"><a title="RE4 Wii Edition - BAB" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f83aa3661410b/re4-wii-edition-bab.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Hello folks, and welcome to the first 2026 edition of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/box-art-brawl">Box Art Brawl</a>!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/poll-box-art-brawl-ice-climber">Last time</a>, we looked at the iconic, if under-appreciated <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/ice_climber">Ice Climber</a> for the NES, and would you believe it, we had a tie! North America and Japan achieved a total of 38% each, with Europe trailing at 24%. In our opinion, the Japanese design is <em>slightly</em> better in this case, but we'll leave it as a tie.</p>
<p>Now cast your mind back to 2019. In <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/08/poll_box_art_brawl_3_-_resident_evil_4">one of our very first editions of Box Art Brawl</a>, we looked at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/08/poll_box_art_brawl_3_-_resident_evil_4">Resident Evil 4</a> for the GameCube. We gave a brief mention to the Wii and PS2 covers at the time, but they weren't a part of the official poll. We're going to change that now by looking specifically at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/resident_evil_4_wii_edition">Resident Evil 4: Wii Edition</a>, originally released in 2007.</p><div><figure data-videoid="L6F_QBKeXfU" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L6F_QBKeXfU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytL6F_QBKeXfU" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/L6F_QBKeXfU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L6F_QBKeXfU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4033abrtqiyz&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>Boasting motion controls for aiming and quick-time events, RE4 on the Wii is considered by some to be the best version of the game, though it does (in this writer's opinion) make what was already a fairly breezy entry in the series a little too easy at times. Still, it's a banger either way, and we urge you to give it a shot if you haven't already.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/wii/related-articles:1377 @ 1767533861 -->
<h2>North America</h2>
<figure data-uuid="a83ab2924c4a4"><a title="RE4 Wii Edition - NA" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a83ab2924c4a4/re4-wii-edition-na.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/4201-resident-evil-4-wii-edition">Capcom / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Y'all are pretty familiar with this key art by now, huh? Yes, here we see Leon Kennedy front and centre, with a bunch of villagers and Bitores "The Big Cheese" Méndez surrounding him. It's an atmospheric piece that does a good job at conveying the sinister circumstances of the game, though logically, Leon striking a pose like that while in such immediate danger doesn't make a whole lot of sense.</p>
<h2>Europe</h2>
<figure data-uuid="684cb9abc85bc"><a title="RE4 Wii Edition - EU" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/684cb9abc85bc/re4-wii-edition-eu.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/4201-resident-evil-4-wii-edition">Capcom / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Europe's design is pretty cool, taking direct inspiration from the original GameCube release in the region back in 2005. We can see Dr. Salvador, A.K.A. The Chainsaw Man, standing in the bottom left and surrounding by tree trunks. There are some cool shadow effects here, but we reckon it's not <em>quite</em> as impactful as the red GameCube original.</p>
<h2>Japan</h2>
<figure data-uuid="75b9add0cb2b3"><a title="RE4 Wii Edition - JP" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/75b9add0cb2b3/re4-wii-edition-jp.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/4201-resident-evil-4-wii-edition">Capcom / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Japan decided to use the same image as North America, but zoomed into Leon and cut out the enemies in the background (apart from a random villager's arm over on the right), all the while making the colours a little bit cooler. The keen focus on Leon is nice and it makes for an eye-catching design, but we'd like to see more.</p>
<p>Naturally, it also utilises the Japanese 'biohazard' title in place of Resident Evil, and despite being unlucky over in Japan, the stylised number 4 is also pretty prominent.</p>

<p><em>Thanks for voting! W</em><em>e'll see you next time for another Box Art Brawl.</em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/features/poll-box-art-brawl-resident-evil-4-wii-edition]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[The Sims 4: Royalty & Legacy is the Game’s Upcoming 21st Expansion Pack]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/sims-4-royalty-and-legacy-final-expansion-pack/</link>
            <guid>1396684</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Sims 4 is set to be expanded <strong>yet again </strong>very soon with the game’s <strong>21st expansion pack </strong>since it was released in September 2014. Fans have been wondering what’s coming for the longest time, as it’s almost inevitable that there always was going to be <strong>at least one more</strong> expansion.</p>



<p>However, the newly uncovered Royalty &amp; Legacy expansion should be the <strong>last expansion pack </strong>ever released for The Sims 4. Electronic Arts is planning to move on after more than a decade of crafting content for the best-selling life sim title.</p>



<h2 id="h-royalty-amp-legacy-is-coming">Royalty &amp; Legacy is Coming</h2>



<p>Recently, it was discovered that the South Korean ratings board had registered The Sims 4: Royalty &amp; Legacy as the 21st, and potentially final, Sims 4 expansion.</p>



<p>In a listing published on December 26, it’s explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The 21st expansion pack for The Sims 4 allows players to become nobles and build a long-lasting dynasty.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It seems like the perfect final expansion for The Sims 4, which has been running for more than a decade. Giving players the ability to create a lasting dynasty in a royal setting is a decent farewell.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.gcrb.or.kr/Statistics/Popup/Pop_ReasonInfo.aspx?app=ZUa9f5yNjhI=&amp;type=xl/kTOU3dYU=" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Korean ratings board</a> issued a ‘For ages 15 and up’ certificate on account of the expansion having ‘indirect and limited sexual expressions’ and ‘realistic expressions of violence’, which are nothing new for The Sims.</p>



<p>Woo-hoo, right?</p>



<p>The filing was submitted by Electronic Arts Korea Ltd., and while it’s the first rating of its kind, it won’t be the last. We checked the ESRB and PEGI ratings boards but couldn’t find a similar listing at the time of publishing.</p>



<p>Typically, these ratings start getting logged mere days or weeks before an announcement or reveal is made by the developer or publisher. We could be very close to getting a full look at what might be the last Sims 4 expansion ever made.</p>



<p>What are you expecting from Royalty &amp; Legacy? Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[NYT Connections Hints Today (#938)—Clues and Answers for Sunday, January 4]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nyt-connections-hints-solutions-january-4-938/</link>
            <guid>1396681</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>How is your 2026 going so far? Let’s hope your NYT Connections streak is still running strong and that today you can push that a little further. Today’s puzzle isn’t so challenging, but if you want the fastest solution possible, I’ve got the NYT Connections hints and answers you need down below.</p>



<p>Feel free to scroll down and resolve today’s NYT Connections as quickly as you can!</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-january-4">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (January 4)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will prompt your brain to take action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #938:</p>



<ul>
<li>TACKLE</li>



<li>EDITION</li>



<li>REEL</li>



<li>GRUMP</li>



<li>BLOCK</li>



<li>COIL</li>



<li>ISSUE</li>



<li>DREAR</li>



<li>CRANK</li>



<li>SACK</li>



<li>SCAN</li>



<li>WIND</li>



<li>COPY</li>



<li>BLITZ</li>



<li>ETAIL</li>



<li>PRINT</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>Think about words that show up when something is published, reproduced, or released to the public.</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – Picture something that <strong>rotates, twists, or winds up</strong>.</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>These are all actions you’d hear shouted by commentators during a <strong>high‑pressure defensive moment in American football</strong>.</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>These look like normal words — until you notice they’re hiding something.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, January 4:</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-for-today-january-4-938">NYT Connections Answers for Today, January 4 (#938)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– COPY, EDITION, ISSUE, PRINT</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – COIL, CRANK, REEL, WIND</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – BLITZ, BLOCK, SACK, TACKLE</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – DREAR, ETAIL, GRUMP, SCAN</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

<p>Use these active Roblox Walk or Die monthly redeem codes to get free rewards like Dollaz in the game, and get ahead of the competition.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Inspired by Stephen King’s The Long Walk, Walk or Die is a survival <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-drift-36-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> experience that lives up to the phrase “survival of the fittest.” Players must keep walking behind a military truck, collect resources along the way, and avoid falling behind or face death by gunfire. On top of that, the map throws deadly disasters at you, including different types of spikes, fire, and more, causing many avatars to drop dead during the long march. To become the last one standing, you’ll need the best Classes, storage upgrades, and other survival-focused tactics. Since these cost a lot of Dollaz, you can use the active Walk or Die codes to fill your treasury and buy them without grinding.</p>

<p>Switch Online GameCube controller support also confirmed</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/grid-legends-deluxe-edition">GRID: Legends: Deluxe Edition</a> was announced for the Switch 2 at the end of last year and will be "coming soon" to Nintendo's new hybrid system.</p>
<p>It's already been confirmed this version of the game will feature graphics and performance modes, and more details about these modes have now been revealed by the developer Feral Interactive during a chat with fans on Reddit.</p>
<p>Here's what was confirmed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"GRID Legends will have both ‘Graphics’ and ‘Performance’ presets for docked and handheld play (where you can expect 30fps and up to 60fps respectively), as well as dedicated ‘Balanced’ and ‘Battery Saver’ presets exclusively for handheld. So you can choose your preferred mix of frame rate and fidelity.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>"As for graphical effects, Switch 2 will retain all the fireworks, tyre smoke, sparks and backfire you’ve come to expect from mobile &amp; other console versions."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The team also mentioned how this release will support the Nintendo Switch Online variant of the GameCube controller:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes - GRID Legends will support the NSO variant of the GameCube controller, offering analog trigger support for acceleration and brake. That’s all been tested and verified here</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can find out more about GRID Legends: Deluxe Edition for the Switch 2 in the announcement post here on Nintendo Life:</p>

<p>When Capcom lifted the lid on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mega-man-dual-override">Mega Man: Dual Override</a> at the end of last year, it also announced a new Robot Master Design Contest.</p>
<p>This latest competition asked fans to submit a unique design for a Robot Master with a "giant suction arm" and provided an existing template to work off. As it's now past <strong>1st January 2026</strong>, this contest has officially concluded.</p>
<figure data-uuid="734e680b15efd"><a title="Mega Man" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/734e680b15efd/mega-man.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Design Model — <em><span></span> Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Capcom has followed this up with an update, thanking fans for their "wonderful" submissions, and mentioning how staff will now review the entries. From there, 20 designs are selected to progress to the next round of voting, and then fans will vote in their "top 6" through the CAPCOM ID system.</p>
<p>This will get underway later this month on <strong>30th January 2026</strong>, and there'll even be a voting participation reward in the form of a special icon.</p>
<p>After the top six are selected, Capcom will pick the best design, and this design will be used in Mega Man: Dual Override. You can see the prizes for the winners below along with an example entry.</p>

			<p><strong>Valve</strong> has just <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamawards/2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> the winners of the <strong>2025 Steam Awards</strong>, and the biggest surprise is finding out that the <strong>Game of the Year</strong> prize went to <strong>Hollow Knight: Silksong</strong> instead of the massive favorite <strong>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</strong>. According to <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-has-third-most-goty-wins-in-single-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a report from earlier this week</a>, Sandfall Interactive's beloved turn-based JRPG has already <strong>dethroned Baldur's Gate III as the third game with the most GOTY awards</strong>, trailing only <strong>Elden Ring</strong> and <strong>The Last of Us Part II</strong>.</p>



<p>Even so, Steam users have chosen their preferred game released last year, and they have gone with <strong>Team Cherry</strong>'s long-awaited Metroidvania sequel. Valve does not disclose percentages or anything like that, so we'll never know the exact margins, but a win is a win. </p>



<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong also wins the '<strong>Best Game You Suck At</strong>' award, which is a category that includes the most challenging titles. The other finalists, for the record, were Path of Exile II, Elden Ring Nightreign, Marvel Rivals, and Where Winds Meet.</p>



<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 does still win a prize for the best soundtrack, though. The other winners are:</p>



<ul>
<li>The Midnight Walk - VR Game of the Year Award</li>



<li>Baldur's Gate III - Labor of Love Award (for a game supported well long past its launch date)</li>



<li>Hades II - Best Game on Steam Deck Award</li>



<li>Peak - Better With Friends Award</li>



<li>Silent Hill f - Outstanding Visual Style Award</li>



<li>ARC Raiders - Most Innovative Gameplay Award</li>



<li>Dispatch - Outstanding Story Rich Award</li>



<li>RV There Yet? - Sit Back and Relax Award </li>
</ul>



<p>In <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-games-of-2025-year-of-the-indie-ish/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our shortlist of the best ten games released in 2025</a>, I called it <strong>the year of the indie-ish</strong>, and that's very much shown in the 2025 Steam Awards. Which game did you vote for, anyway? Let us know in the comments section!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Matt Firor Quit ZeniMax As ‘The Game He Waited His Entire Career to Create’ Was Canceled]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/matt-firor-quit-zenimax-project-blackbird-cancelation/</link>
            <guid>1396504</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In July, Matt Firor left ZeniMax Online Studios after 18 years at the company. He stepped down from the position of President after years of spearheading the development of The Elder Scrolls Online. Two days later, details emerged online about Project Blackbird, ZeniMax’s <strong>canceled MMO</strong> that was slated to be the studio’s next big title after ESO.</p>



<p>Blackbird had been in development for several years, but the strong arm of Microsoft came down heavy on the project and the studio amid a wave of layoffs and cost-cutting actions during the rocky summer of 2025.</p>



<p>In a new post on social media, Matt Firor has finally confirmed that he resigned from ZeniMax after almost two decades because Blackbird was shut down.</p>







<h2 id="h-confirming-what-many-suspected">Confirming What Many Suspected</h2>



<p>Matt Firor has emerged on social media six months to the day since <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/zenimax-online-studios-president-matt-firor-leaving-company/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">he departed</a> ZeniMax Online Studios, which might be linked to some kind of post-departure NDA or privacy clause having expired. He made a lengthy statement that clearly explained why he’d departed the studio he’d devoted almost half his life to.</p>



<p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:sdsbjnwwyzxwz3b4lqtbtwd5/post/3mbeicw5hgw2f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">In his words</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Answering the second-most common question, about what led (to me) leaving ZOS, the most obvious explanation is the correct one.</p>



<p>Project Blackbird was the game I had waited my entire career to create, and having it canceled led to my resignation. My heart and thoughts are always wwith the impacted team members, many of whom I had worked 20+ years with, and all of whom were the most dedicated, amazingly talented group of developers in the industry.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Firor revealed that he’s still evaluating what comes next while he consults on some other projects and lends his experience and knowledge to other startups ‘in an unofficial capacity.’</p>



<p>He also confirmed he has been actively investing in studios that will ‘play a big part in changing the industry in the future,’ but hasn’t considered opening his own studio.</p>



<p>When Project Blackbird was canceled, it was alongside a claim that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/phil-spencer-loved-zenimaxs-new-mmorpg-but-it-was-canceled-anyway/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Phil Spencer loved the game</a>, as did other ‘Xbox executives’, but it wasn’t enough to keep the project safe.</p>



<p>In another report, it was claimed that the focus of Blackbird would have been around ‘vertical gameplay’, offering players a grappling hook and other tools that would allow them to climb and wall-run across the game’s many surfaces, almost in a Spider-Man style.</p>



<p>It featured augmented humans with a deep character customization system that would allow users to ‘sculpt’ their bodies with biomodifications, cybernetics, outfits, and more. It would have been a classic human vs. AI story fused with anti-capitalist themes and a cyberpunk vibe.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Well, I can confidently say one thing about being “the Xbox guy” at IGN: it’s never boring. Granted, it <em>is </em>often <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-and-xbox-developer-the-initiative-closed-as-part-of-devastating-microsoft-layoffs"><u>frustrating</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-makes-significant-layoffs-across-gaming-division-xbox-boss-phil-spencer-confirms-in-memo-to-staff"><u>depressing</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/halo-campaign-evolved-announced-for-xbox-pc-and-yes-ps5-heres-everything-we-know-so-far-including-new-missions"><u>weird</u></a>, and occasionally <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-activision-blizzard-buy-acquisition-acquired"><u>shocking</u></a>. But there’s almost never a dull moment. So went Xbox’s 2025. As I looked back on last <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/what-to-expect-from-xbox-in-2025"><u>year’s version of this column</u></a>, I found that I got plenty of my forecasting right, a few things wrong, and there was some stuff I could’ve <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-raises-the-price-of-all-xbox-series-consoles-xbox-games-confirmed-to-hit-80-this-holiday"><u>never</u></a> <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-console-prices-are-going-up-in-the-usagain"><u>predicted</u></a>. And so as I look ahead to Xbox’s 2026, I will once again expect the unexpected – but I’ll also dig into everything we can reasonably surmise about what could maybe, possibly be the last full calendar year of the Xbox Series generation before Microsoft seemingly gears up to release <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/it-sure-sounds-like-the-next-xbox-will-be-a-gaming-pc"><u>a console/PC hybrid</u></a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The thing is, a month ago, this piece would’ve been a heck of a lot easier to write. It would’ve been all about Microsoft’s Big Four – Halo, Gears of War, Fable, and Forza – all returning in the same year for the first time in over a decade(!) to deliver Xbox’s biggest and possibly best lineup since the Xbox 360 days. But then Galactus, aka Grand Theft Auto 6, showed up to consume everything in its path, as it’s been <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-is-delayed-again-until-november-2026"><u>delayed</u></a> from May to November of 2026 and will now effectively have November onwards – a key holiday-shopping window of Q4 every year – all to itself. Any game company executive that willingly ships a game anywhere near GTA 6 should be fired and institutionalized. It’s not just a bad idea, it’s business suicide. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Clash of the Titans</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/17/gears-of-war-e-day-1765961009398.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">And yes, nearly every major publisher will be affected by this to some degree; Sony has the long-anticipated Marvel’s Wolverine <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonys-ps5-exclusive-wolverine-game-finally-gets-gameplay-reveal-at-state-of-play-2025"><u>slated</u></a> for the Fall, and Nintendo…well, maybe Nintendo is the exception to the Grand Theft Auto rule. But Microsoft is potentially the most screwed by Rockstar’s shifted timeline. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/halo-campaign-evolved">Halo: Campaign Evolved</a> is surely intended to ship right near Halo’s 25th anniversary on November 15. Uh-oh. Meanwhile, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/gears-of-war-e-day">Gears of War: E-Day</a> was almost certainly scheduled for the Fall (to wit: none of the five mainline Gears games has ever shipped outside of the Fall season), <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fable">Fable</a>’s hugely anticipated revival was probably penciled in for the holiday season after Playground Games <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fable-delayed-to-2026-microsoft-reveals-brand-new-pre-alpha-gameplay"><u>delayed</u></a> it, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/forza-horizon-6">Forza Horizon 6</a>? OK, I’d bet on that one dropping sooner rather than later, because a Forza Horizon game doesn’t need a big public relations or marketing campaign. It’s such a powerhouse franchise with a sterling reputation that all fans need to know is where it’s set (Japan), what new cars are in it (TBD), and how soon they can play it. Once Forza Horizon 6 was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/forza-horizon-6-set-in-japan-launches-2026"><u>announced</u></a> at the Tokyo Game Show in late September, I figured it would probably be out within six months. And I still think that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And what about Call of Duty for 2026, which the franchise’s alternating development timeline suggests is probably Modern Warfare 4 from Infinity Ward? Historically, Activision’s annual juggernaut always arrives within a two-week window between the last week of October and the first week of November. Considering how much overlap I’d guess there is between Call of Duty and GTA in the Venn Diagram of Casual-Leaning Gamers Who Only Buy a Couple Games a Year, which one do you think those people are going to choose if they can only afford to buy one of them (particularly given that they’re each likely to cost <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-price-many-in-the-video-game-industry-hope-for-80-if-not-100-analyst-says"><u>at </u><u><em>least </em></u><u>$80</u></a>)? I know which one I’d pick… </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Step Up or Back Off?</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/17/fable-1765960913468.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">In fact, what happens to all of Microsoft’s big presumed Fall plans now that Rockstar has planted its flag in the ground for November 19? The short answer is that I’m not sure all five of Xbox’s biggest first-party games can ship in 2026 anymore. Not if Microsoft wants to make any money on them, anyway. The good news is that all of these games have a great chance to be fantastic titles that score big with critics and fans alike. Microsoft just has to make sure they don’t get squashed like bugs under Grand Theft Auto 6’s Godzilla-sized feet. It’s reasonable to expect one or both of Fable and Gears of War: E-Day to push into the first half of 2027, while I’d bet on Call of Duty being moved up as much as possible – mid-October might be as far forward as they can pull it without crunching all of its developers to death. And if Forza Horizon 6 isn’t already planned for the first half of 2026 (and again, I’m confident that it is), I’d guess that somewhere around August is the new plan.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And that’s not even everything. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/state-of-decay-3">State of Decay 3</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/clockwork-revolution">Clockwork Revolution</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/od-a-hideo-kojima-game">Hideo Kojima’s OD</a> feel like they’re a little further out than next year, but there’s one lesser-known game that might stand toe-to-toe with anything else Xbox has coming up: promising pixel-art potential masterpiece <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/replaced">Replaced</a>. The debut game from Sad Cat Studios will finally land as an Xbox exclusive in 2026. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/replaced-is-a-beautiful-brilliant-25d-cyberpunk-thriller-gamescom-2025"><u>I’ve played it</u></a>, and it sets off my Spidey Sense as something that could be truly special – a possible generation-defining indie game, like how Limbo and Braid were for the Xbox 360 and Inside was for the Xbox One.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Cavalry Has Arrived</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/17/halo-campaign-evolved-1765960824592.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Regardless of exactly when each of Xbox’s blockbusters finally drop, though, the Xbox’s Big Four couldn’t be lining up to land at a better time, because the Xbox brand image is in tatters. Repeated mass layoffs. Game cancellations. Studio closures. Halo heading to PS5, which was the biggest, clearest white flag Microsoft waved to tell gamers, “It’s fine, you don’t need an Xbox; you can play any and all of our games on other platforms if you want to.” It was a Covenant energy sword through the heart for long-loyal Xbox fans. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">All Xbox gamers have ever wanted is a Sony-like pipeline of awesome games on a consistent basis. It would seem we’ve finally got what we’ve wanted – over the past 12 or so months, Xbox has shipped Black Ops 6 and 7, STALKER 2, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, Avowed, South of Midnight, Flight Simulator 2024, Doom: The Dark Ages, Ninja Gaiden 2 Black and Ninja Gaiden 4, Gears of War Reloaded, The Outer Worlds 2, and The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered — but not without the monkey’s paw curling in the process. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Split Personality</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">And so as we look ahead to what to expect from Xbox in 2026, software shines brighter than ever. Hardware…well, rumors of the next-gen Xbox/PC hybrid are <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/its-funny-that-people-think-about-the-console-pc-as-two-different-things-microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-drops-biggest-hint-yet-that-the-next-xbox-is-basically-a-pc"><u>flying</u></a> fast and furious, so could that mean an official announcement at the 2026 Xbox Showcase in June followed by a release in Fall 2027? And as for the platform? I'm not sure what, if anything, can be done to revive excitement in that. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">So where does that leave Xbox heading into Year 6 of the Series X|S generation? Paradoxically, it is both better and worse off than it’s ever been, for all of the reasons I’ve already gone over. Exclusives are dead, but great games are plentiful. Hardware is <em>more </em>expensive than it was at launch, but there’s a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-review"><u>pretty sweet handheld</u></a> now. Life as an Xbox fan is both awesome and terrible, and I’m not sure I can sum it up any better than that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan McCaffrey is IGN's executive editor of previews and host of both IGN's weekly Xbox show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/watch/unlocked">Podcast Unlocked</a><em>, as well as our monthly(-ish) interview show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/04/ign-unfiltered-every-episode-ever">IGN Unfiltered</a><em>.

<figcaption>Your food and water needs can be satisfied by collecting alien plants or finding food as loot in abandoned structures. Unfortunately, there's no real farming system yet.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>Living on a Prison Planet</h2><p>While the player character in <em>StarRupture</em> is thematically a prisoner, you functionally get the same sort of standard survival crafting experience that you might expect. You'll need to gather materials, craft items, consume food and water, and survive both environmental dangers and hostile fauna.</p><p><em>StarRupture</em> stands out a bit from other games in the genre by featuring a manufacturing system rather than a simple crafting system. This makes it a bit closer to games such as <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/satisfactory" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ad287941-87b4-47ba-9bfa-1184bd27b53c" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Satisfactory</em></a>. A handful of items can be made on demand at indoor crafting stations, but you'll be making most of your stuff using gigantic machines outdoors.</p><p>That's not to say you'll be stuck at your base all day; there's a fairly large open-world area to explore, bordered by a combination of impassable mountains and a cloud of radiation. You can find resource deposits, dead bodies, lost shipping drones, and even entire abandoned facilities that will have useful loot for you to collect.</p><p>Unfortunately, you're not alone on this world — hostile bug-like creatures populate most of the region outside of the starting area. The star of this solar system periodically erupts into a devastating wave of fire every now and again, burning the entire surface of the planet and instantly killing you if you're not safely inside a structure.</p><p>Suffice it to say, there's plenty to do and a lot of area to explore in <em>StarRupture</em> at first glance. I've explored nearly the entire playable space over approximately 60 hours of gameplay, and I now have somewhat more mixed feelings about the overall experience in the Early Access launch version of the game.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>Sadly, StarRupture lacks the robust survival system of Green Hell; instead, we get something a little more standard for the genre.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>Stepping Back from <em>Green Hell's </em>Survival</h2><p>Naturally, the second game from a developer invites comparison to the first game. <em>Green Hell</em> and <em>StarRupture</em> both have survival elements, and I was somewhat disappointed to see Creepy Jar tone down the complexity of survival mechanics in <em>StarRupture</em>.</p><p>If you haven't played <em>Green Hell</em>, it arguably has one of the better survival systems out there, despite being seven years old. There is no "food" meter, for example — you need to supply your character with a mix of protein, fats, and carbs to stay healthy. (Of course, you also need to stay hydrated as well.)</p><p>This same depth of detail applies to injuries and diseases. There are a bunch of different ways that you can get sick or injured in <em>Green Hell</em>, and several different types of medicine or first aid need to be correctly applied to cure your ills. Sanity is a factor, too; if your health is poor, you'll start to go a bit loopy and begin hallucinating.</p><blockquote><p>Creepy Jar created some truly fun and engaging survival mechanics in Green Hell, and replacing them with simpler survival systems in StarRupture is a massive step backward.</p></blockquote><p>With that knowledge in mind, I was excited for the possibilities of <em>StarRupture's</em> survival system. Surely, strange diseases and psychological hazards would be a concern on an alien planet — especially when you're literally on the ground by yourself with no other humans to help you.</p><p>Sadly, the survival mechanics in <em>StarRupture</em> aren't all that different from most other survival games. You need to manage health, hunger, and thirst, along with a "toxicity" metric that can build up from eating certain foods. Diseases requiring specialized treatment are replaced with simpler debuffs that can often be healed by waiting them out.</p><p>I was disappointed with this discovery, to say the least. Creepy Jar created some truly fun and engaging survival mechanics in <em>Green Hell</em>, and replacing them with simpler survival systems in <em>StarRupture</em> is a massive step backward.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>The rail system for transporting items between factory machines is prone to jamming and difficult to set up for complex manufacturing.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>Manufacturing's a Mess</h2><p>Manufacturing and crafting are a big part of <em>StarRupture</em>. In fact, you wouldn't really be able to unlock new technology without setting up a factory to automate your crafting. Building factories to make items at scale is an important part of gameplay. Unfortunately, it has some seriously rough edges.</p><p>Your factory starts at ore deposits where machines will mine up raw ore. This raw ore is processed into bars with smelters, and these bars of material are subsequently moved to other machines (such as furnaces and fabricators) to make them into more complex materials.</p><p>Some of the mid-game items require multiple stages of manufacturing. Let's use the "Rotor" item as an example. You'll need to mine Titanium and Wolfram ore and process both of those into bars. You must then make Titanium Rods and Wolfram Wire at fabricators, and then combine Titanium Rods and Wolfram Wire in another fabricator.</p><p>The problem is the way items are transported between machines. Instead of conveyor belts, <em>StarRupture</em> uses small drones traveling along rails akin to small trains. It is difficult to design a rail system like this in such a way that items can criss-cross over each other to reach different machines without a lot of overengineering.</p><blockquote><p>The rail system in StarRupture is such a pain to use that it's easiest to simply destroy and rebuild your setup each time you need to make a new item.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Another issue with the rail system is that there is no easy way to purge leftover items; you have to jump up next to any leftover items and manually remove them. Sometimes, items won't disappear at all, and you'll have to destroy your rails and place them elsewhere to get around this bugged item.</p><p>Finally, and perhaps most critically, there is no remote control for these machines. You need to go to each machine, start the manufacturing process, and then move down the line for each subsequent machine. These systems should be remotely controllable from a console so you don't have to run around everywhere, but they're not.</p><p>In other games, you can design a factory system in such a way that you can make different items without having to rebuild your item transportation system. The rail system in <em>StarRupture</em> is such a pain to use that it's easiest to simply destroy and rebuild your setup each time you need to make a new item. This feels like suboptimal game design.</p><figure role="group">

<h2><em>StarRupture</em> Early Access Preview | Final Thoughts</h2><p>From what I've seen, the foundations of a good game are there with <em>StarRupture</em>, despite its flaws. The manufacturing system is fun enough despite the quirks of the rail transport system. Running around fighting bugs is plenty entertaining.</p><p>That said, there's one major thing lacking at launch: a story. There's not much guidance once you get past the tutorial. You can explore the world and find some lore at points of interest, but there really isn't much to do beyond progressing your corporation reputation by manufacturing the next tier of items.</p><p>You can see machines and structures in the deadly radioactive cloud surrounding the playable area; this suggests that we'll see the playable area expand in the future. However, not much has been done with the fairly large game world as it stands now.</p><p><em>Green Hell</em> had an engaging, interesting story, and I'm sure Creepy Jar will eventually deliver the same for <em>StarRupture</em>. Still, the game as it stands now is a slightly wonky factory base-building game with a game world mostly devoid of significant stuff to do.</p><p><em>StarRupture</em> is worth checking out if you're one of those factory game nerds who have a few hundred hours in <em>Factorio</em> or if you're looking for a bit of a diversion by exploring a new setting for a few hours. If that's not you, it may be best to wait for the gameplay and story to be fleshed out a bit more in a future update.</p><hr><p><em>StarRupture</em> was previewed over approximately 60 hours of gameplay on PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1631270/StarRupture/" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Steam</a> with a key provided by the publisher. All screenshots were taken during the preview process.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <p>2025 has been the worst year on record for Xbox console sales in the UK.</p>
<p>That's according to The Game Business' Chris Dring, who reports Xbox console sales were down 39 percent in the UK, "making it comfortably the worst year on record".</p>

<p>Dring didn't share his workings or comparative data for elsewhere in the world, but it's broadly in line with other data shared across the year. While all three major hardware manufacturers - Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft - have reportedly seen year-on-year (YoY) declines, Xbox sales in the US are allegedly down a whopping 70 percent, according to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-us-console-unit-sales-just-reached-an-all-time-november-low">IGN</a>, thanks in no small part to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/us-xbox-fans-hit-with-another-hardware-price-hike-just-four-months-after-the-last-increase">two price hikes in quick succession</a>.</p>

<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Sales of Xbox consoles were down 39% in the UK during 2025, making it comfortably the worst year on record for Xbox consoles. With the return of favourite Xbox franchises in 2026, might things improve this year?</p>— Christopher Dring (@Chris_Dring) <a href="https://twitter.com/Chris_Dring/status/2007156688923836635?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 2, 2026</a></blockquote></div>

<p>Of course, we've long known that profits are tight in gaming hardware, and it's software and games that typically make money. That currently seems to be Microsoft's focus: bringing its first-party games and its Game Pass subscription service to hitherto rival systems to maximise reach and sales.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, it's a sobering read, especially for fans who have committed to Microsoft's console.</p>
<p>It's been a tough year for Xbox, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-begins-substantial-layoff-process-across-gaming-division-king-and-zenimax-impacted">with thousands of layoffs</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-june-2025-tracking-the-situation-as-it-happens">cancelled games</a>, including The Initiative's Perfect Dark, Rare's Everwild, and an unannounced ZeniMax MMO, flagging hardware sales, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-sales-expert-opinion">even its tentpole shooter, Call of Duty series, is struggling</a>. In fact, marketing budget constraints were rumoured to be the reason why Xbox may have been the only company on the planet <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-report-claims-xbox-wrapped-2025-isnt-happening-this-year-due-to-marketing-budget-constraints">not to release a "2025 wrapped"-esque summary of the year</a>.</p><p>Microsoft's president of game content and studios, Matt Booty, however, reports, Xbox will be hosting one of its Dev Direct streams later this month, claiming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/well-have-more-stuff-next-year-after-being-somewhat-absent-from-the-game-awards-xbox-boss-teases-a-dev-direct-for-january-2026">"we've got more stuff coming up than we can fit in one show"</a>. That means we can probably expect updates on the upcoming Fable game and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/forza-horizon">Forza Horizon</a> series, and perhaps a couple of updates from other games that come under the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/xbox-game-studios">Xbox Game Studios</a> umbrella.</p>
