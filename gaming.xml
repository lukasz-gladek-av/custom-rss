<p>Most played games of 2025:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a></li>
<li>Game Boy - Nintendo Classics</li>
</ul>
<p>Okay, I was expecting to see two of these, but how the hell did I spend 34 hours in the NSO Game Boy library? I played a lot of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/marios_picross">Mario's Picross</a> last year (what can I say? It makes me happy!), but surely not <em>that</em> much. Hey ho, welcome to the podium, little guy.</p>
<p>68 hours in Mario Kart World doesn't completely surprise me, given how long I spent searching for those damn <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/mario-kart-world-all-p-switch-locations">P-Switches</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/mario-kart-world-all-peach-medallions-and-locations">Peach Medallions</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/mario-kart-world-all-question-panel-locations">? Panels</a>. Maybe one day I'll be able to come back to it with an open mind and an open heart... but I'll leave it another couple of months.</p>
<p>And finally, the least surprising of them all: Donkey Kong Bananza. It turns out that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">reviewing</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/donkey-kong-bananza-walkthrough">guiding</a> a game like this one takes quite a bit of time, and I poured 112 hours into this bad boy to make sure that it was 100% wrapped up. An absolutely sublime reintroduction into the 3D platforming space for the prized primate.</p>
<p>All in all, a somewhat meatier year — though one where I still racked up triple figures on my PS5 with some tasty releases that haven't come our way yet. I put 456 hours into 51 games, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Silksong</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> <em>just</em> missing out on a top-three ranking. Bring on 2026 and another ~500 hours of gaming!</p>

</ul>
<p>Is it really any surprise that my most played game of 2025 is Metroid Prime 4: Beyond? Having written <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">our review</a> for Retro Studios' latest, along with a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/metroid-prime-4-beyond-walkthrough-all-collectibles-tips-and-tricks">100% completion guide campaign</a>, yes, Beyond managed to completely dominate my life for a good few weeks there.</p>
<p>The Hundred Line - Last Defense Academy isn't too far behind, mind you. This is still my favourite game of 2025, and to be honest, even with all of the time I put into Prime 4, I'm kinda shocked The Hundred Line didn't bag the top spot. I'm really tempted to play through it again from scratch in 2026, so we'll have to see if it winds up on my top three again this time next year.</p>
<p>Finally, I've been dipping in and out of Street Fighter 6 so often in 2025 that it's just about managed to nab third place. I've been testing and reviewing a whole bunch of arcade controllers for the Switch 2 recently, and SF6 is the go-to game to really put them through their paces. More of the same this year, please!</p>
<p>I also feel compelled to mention that none other than <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_6">Resident Evil 6</a> <em>just</em> missed out on the top three. Look, I love this game, and I spent so much time in The Mercenaries No Hope mode. I just can't get enough.</p>

<li><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/xenoblade_chronicles_x_definitive_edition">Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition</a></li>
<li>Pokémon Legends: Z-A - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</li>
</ul>
<p>...well, one of these is <em>not</em> like the others, eh? I'm not sure what happened at the beginning of the year, but I apparently couldn't put down Hello Kitty and friends, which I played for *gulp* <em>173 hours</em>. Was I okay for the first half of 2025? I think so?</p>
<p>Otherwise, my other two games I actually predicted would pop in my 2024 write-up — unsurprising given that Xenoblade Chronicles X is absolutely massive, and I rolled credits at the 112-hour mark. And between reviewing, the DLC, and guiding it, Pokémon Legends: Z-A clocked in at 94 hours. <em>Woof</em>. Some of that is donut farming, idling, and taking screenshots, of course.</p>
<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong was close to the top three at 83 hours, while <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Fantasy Life i</a> is nipping at Hornet's ankles at over 70 hours. Otherwise, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, Donkey Kong Bananza, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/animal_crossing_new_horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a> are all around 50 hours.</p>
<p>Overall, a darn good year! 2025 was a <em>much</em> busier year for my Nintendo consoles than 2024 was — I've clocked in 1029 hours between the Switch 1 and Switch 2. I have a feeling that'll slip a little in 2026 for life reasons, but we'll see!</p>

<li>Donkey Kong Bananza</li>
<li><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hades">Hades</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I was mainly channelling the 'Oh crap, I need to finish that before the sequel drops' energy in 2025.</p>
<p>I'd escaped Hades several times before, naturally, I just hadn't gotten to the surface the 10 times needed to get the proper ending. One thing led to another, and yep, another 28 hours on the clock. As for Hollow Knight, I bought it on sale <em>years</em> ago but never got to it. I'm now sitting on 86% completion with 35 hours on the clock, and I imagine the NS2 Edition will encourage me to push that higher.</p>
<p>And sandwiched between those two, there's Bananza, a game I like a <em>little</em> less every time I return, but I've still managed 32 hours and counting. Probably time to call it a day, unless the kids badger me for more "Ooo, banana!" and the Zebra Bananza music.</p>
<p>Bubbling under that, it was a bitty year - 272 hours across 61 games, including a first-play of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/metal_gear_solid">Metal Gear Solid</a> and a big ol' chunk of time with both Mario Kart World and that hot new 2025 release, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/katamari_damacy_reroll">Katamari Damacy REROLL</a>. Give the kids what they want, I say. <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMH49ieL4es">Naaa na-na na-na-na na-na...</a></em></p>

<p>In all honesty, I didn’t do too much gaming in 2025 due to that age-old excuse of life (and work) getting in the way. Oh… and playing on other platforms, primarily PC (<em>s</em><em>orry</em>!). 2025 began with me starting yet another Stardew save in an attempt to reach Perfection, and even though I’m nowhere near that milestone, it was a nice routine of mine before and after work.</p>
<div><p>Saying that, getting my hands on the Switch 2 gave me a kick up the bum to finally get some games from my backlog completed. I mostly sank my teeth into indies, cosy games and generally games with shorter runtimes. I often got lost in Night City (or found myself recklessly speeding in the outskirts) and creating a new ACNH island just for kicks, whilst abandoning my OG island on my old Switch. Although I’m over 850 hours on ACNH, I’m itching to up them even more now that the update is here.</p><p>

Considering I played a bit of catch-up in December with Pokémon Legends: Z-A and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/persona_5_royal">Persona 5 Royal</a>, I honestly thought they’d make the cut! I guess they must have been a wee bit behind, so here’s hope for next year’s review. I’m hoping now that I’ve joined the Nintendo Life team, I can get my hours back up and finally have time for games!</p></div>

<p>I'm surprisingly happy with how my top three has ended up this year, as it pretty much reflects my actual faves overall for 2025. Just about.</p>
<p>Usually there's a little bit of review time cross-contamination (and XCX is defo there for this reason), but these are all worthy of top three spots in terms of how much I love 'em, too. Hades 2, although I don't adore it <em>quite</em> as much as the OG, is still a masterclass and head and shoulders above most examples of its genre in terms of overall quality of gameplay and narrative.</p>
<p>XCX, I've ranted and raved enough about by now, you can <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition">check out my 10/10 review</a> if you don't believe me, and The Ivalice Chronicles, well, besides being so far up my street it's moved into my house, it's a wonderfully well-realised and endlessly endearing thing.</p>
<p>What else was up top for me in terms of playtime? Bananza, Mario Kart World and Silksong are all in there, obviously, but so is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fast-fusion">Fast Fusion</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/axiom_verge_2">Axiom Verge 2</a> (back on that replay vibe) and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/divinity-original-sin-2-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Divinity Original Sin 2</a>, which is just one of those games that I'm forever and always mucking about in!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Last year, <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-mass-gaming-layoffs-have-begun/"><strong>Microsoft</strong> laid off <strong>9,000+</strong> people across the entire company</a>, including its gaming division. The layoffs saw studios like <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-cancelled-the-initiative-shut-down-microsoft-layoffs/"><strong>The Initiative</strong> entirely shut down</a>, while others like <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-online-new-mmorpg-canceled/">ZeniMax Online,</a> <a href="https://wccftech.com/candy-crush-microsoft-laid-off-developers-being-replaced-by-ai-tools-they-built/">King</a>, </strong>and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/rare-everwild-cancelled-microsoft-gaming-layoffs/">Rare</a></strong> were hit by major cuts and project cancellations. At the time of the layoffs, <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-workers-call-out-microsoft-mass-layoffs-inhumane-disgusting/">former and current ZeniMax workers aptly called the cuts "<em>inhumane</em>" and "<em>disgusting</em>,"</a> so it's uplifting to see yet another studio rise up out of these cuts, as former ZeniMax developers have come together to form a new studio, <strong><a href="https://ironrootgames.com/">Ironroot Games</a></strong>.</p>



<p>Ironroot Games is the second studio to specifically come from former ZeniMax Online workers, after <a href="https://wccftech.com/ex-zenimax-online-devs-form-sackbird-studios-working-original-project/"><strong>Sackbird Studios</strong> was formed in October 2025</a>. The news of the new team comes from an interview with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/former-zenimax-online-devs-form-ironroot-games-following-traumatising-layoffs">GamesIndustry.Biz</a>, where Ironroot Games' chief executive officer and creative director, <strong>Quentin Cobb</strong>, says he is still trying to work through what happened at ZeniMax Online, where he was the studio's principal gameplay designer. Cobb also goes as far as to add the word "<em>traumatic</em>"  to the list of ways to describe the cuts at ZeniMax and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-online-new-mmorpg-canceled/">cancellation of <strong>Project Blackbird</strong></a>.</p>



<p>"<em>I thought it was going well, personally, and it was shaping up,</em>" said Cobb. "<em>A thing that I struggle with is you wrap your identity up into your work. It's tough for that to get flushed down the toilet. I was there for almost five years. It's gone. All gone. It was a shock, and, to be honest, extremely traumatic</em>. <em>There are a lot of people still struggling with the ramifications of what happened that day. Blindsided is an understatement, that's for sure. It was a tough day, something that I'll never forget.</em>"</p>



<p>It's then no surprise that, after an experience like that, Cobb and fellow founding member, <strong>Elaine Gómez</strong>, who also acts as Ironroot Games' principal gameplay designer and studio culture leader, wanted to create their own space to try and avoid going through something like that again. Gómez is one of the few members of Ironroot who doesn't come from ZeniMax layoffs, but instead has their own self-described "<em>traumatizing</em>" triple-A layoff story from their time at <a href="https://wccftech.com/mass-effect-writer-and-director-announces-worlds-untold-split-with-netease-work-on-the-sci-fi-game-is-paused/">former NetEase-backed studio, <strong>Worlds Untold</strong></a>.</p>



<p>"<em>We didn't see it coming,</em>" Gómez begins. "<em>We were told we were fully funded for the entirety of the number of years that this project was going to be on.</em> <em>We were doing great. We passed our prototype flags with flying colours. Everybody was happy with our work. And then all of a sudden it was like, right before Thanksgiving, 2024, 'Hey, everybody, we're just gonna rip the band-aid off</em>."</p>



<p>Moving forward, part of how Cobb and Gómez are trying to build a better future for themselves and their coworkers starts with Ironroot's foundation as a <strong>developer-owned</strong>, "<em><strong>people-first</strong>"</em> studio. "<em>You're not just a cog in a machine</em>," Gómez says. </p>



<p>"<em>The CEO or the top few people in the team taking a gigantic portion of the revenue, and the team getting scraps, is common practice in corporate America and it's disheartening</em>," Cobb said when discussing how he intends to be incredibly transparent when it comes to how the team is paid and the studio's revenue-sharing structure. "<em>I really feel very strongly that the people who make the game should earn the money that the game makes, period</em>."</p>



<p>As for what the studio is working on, Cobb and Gómez are keeping that under wraps for now. "<em>I'm dying to talk about it,</em>" said Cobb. "<em>But it's just so early now that I don't want to put too many details out there and then have to backtrack or change things.</em>" What they would say is that it is a "<em>personal</em>" game with a small budget.</p>



<p>While work on that first project may be a bit slower due to the studio being a small team and starting with some of its members, like Gómez, only working part-time to begin, it is heartening to see another team come up out of the mass layoffs that have plagued the industry over the last few years. Hopefully, studios like Ironroot Games and Sackbird Studios can help create a better future for the industry.</p>

In the almost six years since, Nintendo has sporadically kept up with the game, adding seasonal items and content, including the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22727354/animal-crossing-switch-update-date">Happy Home Paradise DLC</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/3/22762709/animal-crossing-2-0-update-released-early-nintendo">the massive 2.0 content</a> update that Nintendo claimed, at the time, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZ3QC8e1_yg&amp;t=699s">would be the game’s last</a>. But the arrival of the Switch 2 heralds <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/809975/animal-crossing-new-horizons-is-getting-a-big-switch-2-upgrade-in-january">a new update for the game</a> that has fans itching for more opportunities to play with friends, create their dream homes, or return to cozy island life. For some, the series has been a constant part of their lives. “My entire internet experience as a child was just the Animal Crossing forums,” Soleil tells <em>The Verge.</em></p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@soleilplaysgames">Soleil is a cozy game YouTube creator</a> and diehard <em>Animal Crossing</em> fan who has been playing the series since its early days on the GameCube. “When I started playing, my neighbor, who I had a crush on, was playing,” she tells <em>The Verge</em>. She has all the games in the series, including Japanese versions that she can only play with the help of Google Translate, and has clocked over 4,000 hours in <em>New Horizons</em> specifically. “It just became more and more of a cute escape,” she said.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->3</strong><span><figcaption>Some of Soleil’s cute escapes that she made on her island.</figcaption></span></p></section><p>With this third update known as “3.0”, Soleil is hoping for things that make the game as robust as its predecessors. Though Soleil says <em>New Horizons</em> is the best game of the bunch, she always felt like it was released unfinished. “Over the years, [Nintendo] introduced patches which have improved gameplay quite a bit, but it still misses some of the mark of what <em>Animal Crossing</em>, up until now, has been,” she said. The new update is two-fold and may bring the game more in line with her initial expectations.</p><p>On January 15th, Nintendo will launch a paid Switch 2 update that offers exclusive features like mouse controls and 12-player online co-op. The 3.0 update, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/861725/animal-crossing-new-horizons-3-0-update-early-launch-nintendo-switch">which launched a bit early</a>, is free for both Switch and Switch 2 players offering several quality of life enhancements and new features. Players will finally be able to create multiple items at once, the new Slumber Islands offer yet another place to show off player decoration skills, and, perhaps most importantly, there’s now strafing. (Hell yeah!)</p><p>But one of the things Soleil is really looking for improvement on is the villagers.ons According to Soleil and others, New Horizon villagers are more passive than their counterparts from previous games. “One of the most common complaints over the years among casual and hardcore players is that the villagers are just kind of lifeless,” she said. <em>New Horizons</em>’ 2.0 update addressed some of those issues, bringing villagers closer to the prickly, opinionated residents from earlier games. “I hope that in 3.0 that they’ve tweaked [that] some more,” Soleil said. Better, ruder villagers aren’t her only wish. “I’m really hoping that they add more dialogue [...] more shop upgrades, and the ability to redesign our buildings like we could in <em>New Leaf.</em>“</p><p>But beyond wishes and wants, it’s the little things in 3.0 that excite Soleil the most. “The fairy in a bottle item. Oh my gosh, I literally screamed,” she said. “I loved the Majora’s Mask item in every game, I’m very excited that it’s back.”</p><p>Fernando, <a href="https://allmylinks.com/truefernie">another YouTube gaming creator</a>, is also excited by the prospect of <em>The Legend of Zelda </em>themed items in <em>Animal Crossing</em>. Like Soleil, Fernando has been playing the game since the GameCube era, but says that “I really developed a huge appreciation for [the game] like everybody else during the pandemic.” For Fernando, <em>Animal Crossing</em> brought him to his own new horizons. “I grew up playing mostly shooter games, <em>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater</em>, that sort of stuff,” he said. “<em>Animal Crossing</em> brought me over to another side of gaming that I wasn’t very familiar with, and I found out how much I really like this type of game.”</p><p>Though he has over 500 hours in the game, he didn’t keep up with it over the years. The DLC, <em>Happy Home Paradise</em>, wasn’t for him and after sporadic check-ins he fell off the game entirely until the 3.0 announcement trailer. “The thing that’s really bringing me back is the collaborations with <em>Zelda,</em>” he said.</p><p>But it’s another kind of collaboration that’s wooing Fernando back as, before the 3.0 update, <em>New Horizons</em> did not allow players to decorate in multiplayer mode. “That’s the thing that I am most excited about,” he said. “Being able to decorate with my wife, and go through our ideal house is going to be just a lot of fun.”</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->3</strong><span><figcaption>Some of the rooms in Fernando’s current Animal Crossing house.</figcaption></span></p></section><p>Since it’s his favorite game series, Fernando plans to <em>Zelda</em>-ify both his island and his house. In addition to adding <em>Zelda-</em>themed items, in 3.0 scanning either the Tulin or Mineru Amiibo from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23718926/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Tears of the Kingdom</em></a> will allow them to visit your island or even move in. Fernando said he plans to add Tulin to his village but is mildly disappointed that Nintendo didn’t go for the more obvious <em>Zelda</em>-themed villager. “It’s a huge missed opportunity not adding a villager based on Epona.”</p><p>Like Soleil, Fernando felt <em>New Horizons</em>’ villagers were blander than their predecessors. But similarly he has nevertheless grown attached to them. That attachment is causing both Fernando and Soleil issues as 3.0 forces them to confront the biggest decision an <em>Animal Crossing</em> player can make: what to do about their island. With all the fancy new decoration items, AC’s robust community of custom pattern makers, and the sheer wealth of customization options available, it can be tempting to start over from scratch. But with that reset, everything goes away — including the villagers that have come to call a player’s island home.</p><p>“Clay, specifically, he’s like an OG and I love him,” Fernando said. “So I don’t want to see him go.” Soleil is no less fond of her own villagers, but has taken a different perspective. “On this island, I’m a god, I can do whatever I want at any time,” she said. “I can just get them back.”</p><p>For both players, <em>Animal Crossing </em>has been an escape over the years, especially during the pandemic and with 3.0’s release imminent, it seems poised to offer gentle distraction in a time of crisis again. “It’s comfort food for me,” Fernando said. “Especially with everything happening in [the US] specifically.”</p><p>For Soleil though, <em>Animal Crossing</em> is something she reaches for in personal times of stress. “With personal crises, I’m more willing to delve into <em>Animal Crossing</em>,” she said. “But when it comes to things that are harming my community, my friends, I’m much more willing to ignore video games for that.”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTAy"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Ash Parrish</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/861760/animal-crossing-new-horizons-update-community-reaction]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Next week, <em>Forza Horizon 6</em> is set to be one of the main focuses of Xbox’s upcoming Dev Direct Showcase. But thanks to an in-game leak, we don’t have to wait until then to find out when the open-world racer will launch. And thankfully, we’ll be speeding around Japan soon when <em>Horizon 6</em> arrives in May.</p> <p>On January 14, <a href="https://x.com/XBOXF10/status/2011429719800180925/photo/1">Xbox Infinite</a>, an Xbox news account based in Saudi Arabia, posted a screenshot on Twitter of what it claims to be an ad for <em>Forza Horizon 6</em> that popped up ahead of schedule. The ad claims that <a href="https://kotaku.com/forza-horizon-6-location-microsoft-tokyo-game-show-2000628658"><em>Forza Horizon 6, </em>which was officially announced in September 2025,</a>&nbsp;will be available to play four days early, on May 15, for those who pre-order the Premium Edition of the game. This implies that <em>Horizon 6</em>‘s actual release date is May 19. <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/forza-horizon-6s-release-date-may-have-been-revealed-early-by-an-in-game-ad/"><em>VGC</em> reports</a> that its sources have confirmed this release window as accurate.</p>

 <p>“Discover the breathtaking landscapes of Japan in over 550 real-world cars and become a racing Legend in <em>Forza Horizon’</em>s biggest open world driving adventure yet,” reads text included in the ad. Here’s the list of what else you get for pre-ordering the Premium Edition, according to this leaked promo:</p>

 <blockquote><p>• Early Access – Play 4 days early, starting May 15<br> • VIP Membership<br> • Welcome Pack<br> . Car Pass<br> • Time Attack Car Pack<br> • Italian Passion Car Pack (coming post-launch)<br> • 2 Premium Expansions (coming post-launch)</p></blockquote> <p><a href="https://x.com/XBOXF10/status/2011452908550926481">According to Xbox Infinite,</a> the leaked ad appeared as they were playing a different <em>Forza</em> game. <em>Kotaku</em> can’t confirm if the ad is real, but we’ve seen things like this before, and <em>VGC</em> corroborating the release window seems to verify this is a real leak.</p>

 <p>It also makes sense that it popped up now, just a week before the Dev Direct event. Some wires got crossed, it seems, but we can likely expect the release date and more to be confirmed on January 22 at the showcase. Also expected at the event is <em>Pokémon</em> studio <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-developer-game-freak-reveals-beast-of-reincarnation-at-xbox-games-showcase">GameFreak’s AAA action RPG </a><em>Beast of Reincarnation,</em> as well as a deep dive into the oft-delayed <em>Fable</em> reboot. <em>Forza Horizon 6</em> is launching on Xbox, PC, and Game Pass, with a PS5 port rumored to arrive at a later date.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>We’ve learned a new detail about <em>Grand Theft Auto 6′</em>s multiplayer via the ongoing court case over <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-rockstar-games-union-busting-delay-2000640525">Rockstar Games’ firing of over two dozen employees</a>, despite the <em>GTA</em> maker’s lawyer trying to keep the info secret.</p> <p>While Rockstar has started to share more information about <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-release-date-red-dead-2-2000658151"><em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em></a>, launching this November, it has basically said nothing about the upcoming open-world game’s multiplayer mode. Following the massive success of <em>GTA Online, GTA 6</em> will likely feature a similar, possibly bigger, online spin-off. But what that will look like, how it will work, and when to expect it (<em>GTA Online</em> launched a few weeks after <em>GTA V</em>), well, we have no idea. But hey, at least I can confirm to you that <em>GTA 6</em>‘s online mode will support at least 32 players.</p> <p>This new, tiny detail comes from the ongoing court case between Rockstar Games and over two dozen employees it fired back in October 2025. The company claims they were let go after sharing confidential information in a Discord server. The devs and the Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain claim it was an act of union-busting. <a href="https://kotaku.com/rockstar-wins-initial-ruling-against-fired-gta-6-devs-we-regret-that-we-were-put-in-a-position-where-dismissals-were-necessary-2000658984">On Monday</a>, an employment tribunal in the UK ruled that Rockstar won’t have to pay fired employees back pay during the case. But during this hearing, as reported by <em><a href="https://youtu.be/dnuipPQDd_w">People Make Games</a>,</em> Rockstar was forced to share some of the messages from the devs, which included a detail about<em> GTA 6′</em>s online mode that Rockstar’s legal spokesperson wasn’t comfortable reading out loud because it was extremely confidential.</p>

  <p>In October, one fired employee sent a message in Discord claiming Rockstar didn’t want more than five people taking time off for any reason, as it made it harder to fill playtest sessions of the online mode with 32 players. “Not sure how that was difficult,” added the developer, as seen in court docs by <em>PMG</em>. Someone else replied: “Sounds like you have multiple studios of QA testers, surely someone can manage to organise a 32 player session and let people have their time off.”</p>

 <p>And that’s it.&nbsp;<span>As I mentioned, it’s not a significant detail and not surprising either, as&nbsp;<em>GTA Online</em> currently supports 32 players online (30 players and</span> 2 spectators).&nbsp; And we also don’t know for certain if <em>GTA 6</em>‘s online mode will support exactly 32 players at release, or if other modes, like a possible freeroam mode, might support even more or fewer players. Still, it is a detail about <em>GTA 6</em>‘s barely-talked-about multiplayer mode that Rockstar was apparently so determined to keep hidden that it got nervous about it in court and allegedly fired someone over sharing it in a Discord chat.</p>

              <p><span><a href="https://kotaku.com/everything-you-need-to-know-animal-crossing-kappn-update-switch-2-2000654252"><em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons’</em> 3.0 update</a> is out now—a day earlier than expected for many players. While the free update is out now, the Nintendo Switch 2 upgrade is still unavailable, and likely won’t be out until that version’s official release date of January 15.</span></p> <p><span>The reason the 3.0 update dropped early is assumed to be because it’s already January 15 in certain time zones, like New Zealand. The paid Switch 2 upgrade, though, is seemingly tied to timing in different regions; once it hits midnight where you are, it’ll be available for purchase. To access the free update, just update your <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em> game from the Switch homepage. Once the game launches, you’ll know the update is live because Isabelle will shout out the new hotel opening.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Animal Crossing: New Horizons Version 3.0 is NOW AVAILABLE for download on Nintendo Switch &amp; Nintendo Switch 2! 🎉 🎉 🎉 <a href="https://t.co/ukHHOS1HJC">pic.twitter.com/ukHHOS1HJC</a></p> <p>— Animal Crossing World 🏝️ (@ACWorldBlog) <a href="https://twitter.com/ACWorldBlog/status/2011394946977149116?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 14, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>Fans have been prepping for months ahead of the content update, which was announced late last year. The announcement itself was a huge surprise—Nintendo’s 2.0 update was the last major release in 2021, and was widely expected to be the last update for the game. The new update adds a bunch of new content, like the Kapp’n family hotel, located on the pier. </span></p>

 <p><span>But players are also </span><span>excited for quality-of-life updates that make the whole experience better, like bulk crafting and the <a href="https://kotaku.com/animal-crossing-3-0-update-prep-restart-island-resetti-2000658987">Resetti clean-up service</a> for quickly resetting portions of the island. The Switch 2 upgrade uses the new console’s hardware capabilities to support mouse controls and larger multiplayer groups.&nbsp;</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Though we’re getting further and further away from the release of </span><i><span>Stranger Things</span></i><span>’ </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-season-5-finale-reaction-byler-acting-2000656424"><span>divisive final season</span></a><i><span>, </span></i><span>fan scrutiny, speculation, and criticism only seems to be getting turned up, with one of the latest narratives being that creators the Duffer Brothers used ChatGPT to write the finale that’s got a subset of fans so mad, they’re crossing their fingers for </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-conformity-gate-secret-netflix-crash-2000658155"><span>a secret finale that will fix it all</span></a><span>. Now the director of the documentary that inadvertently gave rise to these accusations has offered her own comment on them, and although she may have intended to dismiss any such concerns, her words are unlikely to have that effect.</span></p> <p><span>The genAI accusations were born out of a shot in the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-season-5-documentary-chatgpt-reddit-2000659351"><i><span>One Last Adventure </span></i><span>documentary </span></a><span>about the making of the final season in which some fans believed they saw tabs for the chatbot open in a web browser while the Duffers were working on the script. </span><a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-features/stranger-things-5-documentary-director-interview-chatgpt-1236472338/"><i><span>The Hollywood Reporter</span></i></a> <span>interviewed documentary director Martina Radwan about the two-hour film, and naturally, the topic of these ChatGPT rumors came up. In the ensuing exchange, Radwan doesn’t confirm or deny the allegations that the Duffers used ChatGPT as a writing tool, but her comments probably won’t help quell the notion.</span></p>

 <p><span>Interviewer Tony Maglio asks Radwan point blank if she’s aware of any ChatGPT use by the Duffers while they were writing the </span><i><span>Stranger Things </span></i><span>season 5 scripts, and she pretty unambiguously says “no.” The lead-up to that answer, though, is…well, let’s just read it.</span></p>

 <blockquote><p><span>Maglio: You’ve got super fans pausing and zooming in on individual frames of your documentary. One allegedly shows one of the Duffers with a ChatGPT tab open on their computer. Did they use ChatGPT in your presence, and if so, what for?</span></p> <p><span>Radwan: I mean, are we even sure they had ChatGPT open?</span></p> <p><span>Maglio: I’m personally not, but the internet seems sure.</span></p> <p><span>Radwan: Well, there’s a lot of chatter where [social media users] are like, “We don’t really know, but we’re assuming.” But to me it’s like, doesn’t everybody have it open, to just do quick research?</span></p> <p><span>Maglio: I do.</span></p> <p><span>Radwan: How can you possibly write a storyline with 19 characters and use ChatGPT, I don’t even understand.</span></p> <p><span>Maglio: I don’t think many fans truly believe the Duffers had gen-AI write their scripts, I think it’s more of an aversion to the use of the technology in general in Hollywood.</span></p> <p><span>Radwan: Again, first of all, nobody has actually proved that it was open. That’s like having your iPhone next to your computer while you’re writing a story. We just use these tools … while multitasking. So there’s a lot going on all the time, every time. What I find heartbreaking is everybody loves the show, and suddenly we need to pick it apart.</span></p> <p><span>Maglio: So just to button-up the topic: You didn’t witness an unethical use of generative-AI in the writers room?</span></p> <p><span>Radwan: No, of course not. I witnessed creative exchanges. I witnessed conversation. People think “writers room” means people are sitting there writing. No, it’s a creative exchange. It’s story development. And, of course, you go places in your creative mind and then you come back [to the script]. I think being in the writers room is such a privilege and such a gift to be able to witness that.</span></p></blockquote> <p><span>Radwan asking, “Doesn’t everybody have [ChatGPT] open?” has </span><a href="https://x.com/SThingsMeme/status/2011358226487582816?s=20"><span>put off a lot of people</span></a><span>, both in and out of the </span><i><span>Stranger Things </span></i><span>online drama. Because, no, we don’t all have ChatGPT open. I’ve never used the thing, and neither have a lot of people. Some of us don’t need a chatbot to tell them how to write, think, or do their research for them. Radwan is still adamant that she never saw the Duffers using ChatGPT to write the script, but the implication that they were using the tech at all is still just ammunition some can use against a finale they didn’t like.</span></p>

 <p><span>Even if the Duffer Brothers were to look into a camera and swear up and down they didn’t use ChatGPT, I don’t know that it would be enough for some of the more conspiratorial </span><i><span>Stranger Things </span></i><span>fans who are now </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-season-5-finale-matt-duffer-interview-2000656663"><span>taking pretty much any potshot</span></a><span> they can at the show. </span></p>

                <p>Sid Meier's Civilization 7 Arcade Edition will be added to the Apple Arcade game catalog on February 5 alongside a smattering of other new games. This new version of the game will be playable on iPhone, iPad, and Mac, and there does not appear to be plans for an Android port at this time.</p><p>Released last February for PC and consoles, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/sid-meiers-civilization-vii-review/1900-6418332/" data-ref-id="1900-6418332">Civilization 7</a> is a 4X strategy game where players guide a civilization through several different ages of history. Like the mobile port of Civilization 6, Civilization 7 Arcade Edition's content is comparable to the PC and console versions of the game, so this isn't some sort of radically inferior spin-off.</p><p>The most novel thing about Civilization 7 Arcade Edition is that its UI has been specifically tailored to support touch controls on iPhone and iPad. Currently, the closest you can get to that is using the touchscreen for your cursor on a PC handheld or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sid-meier-civilization-7-preorder-nintendo-switch-2-physical-edition/1100-6531441/" data-ref-id="1100-6531441">Nintendo Switch 2</a>.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1849/18498836/4635268-civilization7mobile.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4635268" data-ratio="0.5635838150289" data-width="1384" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1849/18498836/4635268-civilization7mobile.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4635268"></a><figcaption>Sid Meier's Civilization VII Arcade Edition</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1849/18498836/4635268-civilization7mobile.jpg"></figure><p>This port was developed by Behaviour Interactive, the studio behind <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silent-hill-and-castlevania-characters-are-coming-to-dead-by-daylight/1100-6535998/" data-ref-id="1100-6535998">Dead by Daylight</a>. It's not the company's first mobile game, as Behaviour Interactive previously developed games like Worms Across Worlds and Fallout Shelter.</p><p>Although it's certainly the most notable game coming to Apple Arcade in the coming weeks, Civilization 7 Arcade Edition isn't the only title coming to Apple's gaming subscription service. The <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2026/01/popular-pc-franchise-civilization-comes-to-apple-arcade-on-february-5/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a> announcing the port highlights several other games and events coming to Apple Arcade soon.</p><p>On February 5, Apple Arcade will also add the retro game collection Retrocade, the rhythm game Felicity's Door, and a microtransaction-and-ad-free version of I Love Hue Too. A Paddington-themed event is also coming to Apple Arcade's Crayola Create and Play+ on January 22, if that's something that tickles your fancy.</p>

At the time of publication, Hytale has around 112,000 viewers <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/directory?sort=VIEWER_COUNT">on Twitch</a>, putting it only behind games like League of Legends and Grand Theft Auto V. In addition, a massive rumored concurrent-players for Hytale has been making the rounds, though the figure--2.8 million--seems too good to be true. It all stems from a stream posted by Hytale News <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZh2rw5517M&amp;t=21278s">on YouTube</a>. GameSpot has reached out to developer Hypixel Studios about the statistic.</p><p dir="ltr">Keep in mind PUBG holds the Steam record for most concurrent players with over 3.2 million people in January 2018. So, it's seemingly hard to believe Hytale is close to that achievement within 24 hours of release, especially considering you need to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-play-hytale-editions-price-and-more/1100-6537363/">download the game from the Hytale website</a>.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://hytale.com/news/2026/1/hytale-is-finally-here" rel="nofollow ">A Hytale blog post</a> has stated "demand has exceeded our expectations," reinforcing the strong start for the game.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Today, <strong>Loric Games</strong> announced the new early access launch date for its upcoming airship-themed cooperative survival RPG, <strong>Echoes of Elysium</strong>. As you might recall, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/echoes-of-elysium-early-access-release-date-loric-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was supposed to be released on December 4</a>, but there was a <a href="https://wccftech.com/echoes-of-elysium-gets-last-minute-early-access-delay-to-january-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">last-minute delay to January 2026</a>. The new date has now been set for <strong>January 27</strong>, although there's been no info yet on pricing.</p>



<p>Brian Johnson, the CEO and Co-Founder of Loric Games, said in a statement:</p>



<p><em>We’re taking Echoes of Elysium to Early Access because we want to build this game with our community. Too often, games are built in a vacuum - developers spend years creating something in isolation, only to find the world doesn’t connect with it. We’re a small team, and rather than disappear for years and release something fully formed without player input, we want to build openly alongside our players. Early Access lets us shape Echoes of Elysium together - a survival RPG where the airship truly is your home, and where you survive and thrive in the skies. We know players joining early may encounter bugs as we continue to improve the game, and we want to reward that trust. This is about creating something together.</em></p>

<p>In a recent blog post published <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2644050/view/526490645242578962" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on the game's Steam page</a>, Loric Games noted that early access is being chosen to make the game alongside the community. As such, systems and features will evolve over time based on the fans' feedback. They also showed some improvements to the animations and combat of Echoes of Elysium. Animations have been smoothed out, and physics are now integrated across all player outfits, constructs, and flying constructs, allowing details such as skirts and capes to trail naturally. The result is a more fluid and dynamic movement for both players and enemies. Thanks to an animation import tool, they also added new wrench attack animations. </p>

            <p>What's that screaming around the bend, tyres squealing and RPMs peaking? It's Forza Horizon 6's release date arriving ahead of schedule, assuming a pop-up ad allegedly spotted in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/forza-horizon-5">Forza Horizon 5</a> is the genuine article. If that's the case, then the open-world racing series' trip to Japan is booked to arrive in May this year.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The alleged ad that's the source here was originally posted by a Saudi Arabian Twitter account with the handle <a href="https://x.com/XBOXF10/status/2011429719800180925">@XBOXF10</a> (as spotted by <a href="https://xboxera.com/2026/01/14/forza-horizon-6-release-date-leaks-in-fh5/">Xboxera</a>), which as you might expect appears to focus on posting Xbox-relevant gaming news. The pop-up outlines a bunch of stuff you'll apparently get for pre-ordering Horizon 6's premium edition, including the chance to play it four days ahead of regular purchasers as part of paid early access kicking off on May 15th.</p>
<p>So, using the power of maths, folk have surmised that as pointing to May 19th as the racer's proper release date for those who don't believe in lobbing out more cash just to run to the front of the queue. This would be a tad atypical a time for a Horizon entry to arrive, with all five previous entries having dropped in the second half of their launch year's, usually around October or November. That said, Horizon 5's PlayStation release did take place in April last year, so that could be precedent for a switch towards launches earlier in the calendar.</p>
<p>Going back to the pop-up ad, it cites Horizon 6 as boasting "over 550 real-world cars", which isn't too far off the 534 cars the <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/forza-horizon-5/Car_List">Ian Games Network</a>'s big car list cites Horizon 5 as having packed into its garage at launch. VIP membership, a welcome Pack, car pass access, a Time Attack car pack, an Italian Passion car pack, and two "premium expansions" are the other goodies listed as coming the way of swanky version pre-purchasers, with the latter two specified to be coming post-launch.</p><p>

Horizon 6 is set to rock up at Xbox's Developer Direct showcase on January 22nd, and if this release date is something that was set to be revealed there, it'd follow in the wheeltracks of the game's Japanese setting being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/first-forza-horizon-6-image-reveals-japan-setting-for-launch-in-2026">revealed early by a rogue Instragram post last September</a>. If you fancy reading some words about why Horizon 6 is one of the games I'm most looking forward to giving a go this year, you can <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marks-most-anticipated-pc-games-for-2026">find 'em here</a>.

            <guid>1405801</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you’ve ever been in a predicament where you’ve run out of battery at the worst time possible, you probably want to have a charger that’s easier to use and access all the time, no matter where you are. But which one do you get, since there are so many out there and more being manufactured all the time? We’ve found a particularly good one that you won’t want to miss, and it’s on sale for an excellent price.</p>
<p>You can find the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6755/">Anker Zolo USB-C 4-port wall charger on Amazon for $25,</a> down from $30 (17% off).</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6755/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A small but mighty charging block for multiple devices</h2>
<p>It’s made for people that are constantly charging their phone, tablet, headphones, etc. It’s small enough to fit in a bag or purse or even a charger, too. That makes it great for travel, the office, or even for just going from room to room in your house. You no longer have to keep two chargers that way, with one for your desk and one for your bed.</p>
<p>But keep in mind that it’s small but mighty. It can charge your smartphone, tablet and many other USB-C products much faster than most other chargers on the market. That means it saves you some time and frustration, especially if you get tired of swapping out chargers that go with certain devices. Those are especially easy to lose, after all.</p>



<p>Because the charger has a USB-C port, you can use a variety of cables to charge multiple devices. For example, you can use a USB-C cable to charge a newer smartphone, or you can use a USB-C to Lightning cable to charge an older iPhone. No one wants to deal with all those cables, so this should help you cut down on the clutter significantly. That’s how you end up dealing with a significant amount of tech waste, after all. And we’ve got landfills full of all of that, so we don’t need to make it any worse from here.</p>
<p>Anker included several safety features within the Anker Zolo USB C Charger Block to protect your devices. One of these features includes protection from overheating and overcurrent. Another feature includes protection from short circuits. Although you cannot see these features working behind the scenes, you will feel comfortable knowing that your expensive devices are being protected.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a quick and easy way to make sure everything you have is charged speedily and with all the safety precautions you need, this affordable option is one you won’t want to pass up on. Make sure you get one while it’s on sale, and if you want to make sure you’re covered at all times, it’s not a bad idea to grab a couple.</p>

<p>Ahead of next week’s Xbox Developer Direct, the Forza Horizon 6 release date may have been leaked. An alleged screenshot has made its way online that appears to show when players will get their hands on the next installment in the popular racing series.</p>



<p>Early Wednesday morning, Xbox Infinite posted the screenshot online that says that the Forza Horizon 6 Premium Edition will open up for players on May 15. With the ability to “play 4 days early”, that would suggest a Tuesday, May 19 release.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-else-is-coming-with-forza-horizon-6">What Else Is Coming With Forza Horizon 6?</h2>



<p>In addition to the early access release date, the image, which looks like an ad for the game, mentions other features for those who buy the Premium Edition. Those include:</p>



<ul>
<li>VIP Membership</li>



<li>Welcome Pack</li>



<li>Car Pass</li>



<li>Time Attack Car Pack</li>



<li>Italian Passion Car Pack (coming post-launch)</li>



<li>2 Premium Expansions (coming post-launch)</li>
</ul>



<p>Players will also get a “pre-tuned and exclusive” Ferrari J50 if they preorder the game. </p>



<p>Forza Horizon 6 was first announced in September at Tokyo Game Show. The game heads to Japan for the first time, and will feature more than 550 cars in what is being labeled as <strong>“Forza Horizon’s biggest open world driving adventure yet”.</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>As always, none of this has been confirmed by Xbox or Playground Games, nor has it been independently verified by Insider Gaming. Until that happens, please take the information with a grain of salt.</p>







<p>The first look at gameplay for the upcoming racing title will come during the aforementioned Xbox Developer Direct showcase on January 22 at 1pm ET/6pm GMT. Insider Gaming will have full coverage of the event and bring you all of the latest details. </p>

                <p>Cygames, the developer and publisher behind the popular series of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/granblue-fantasy-relink-review-smooth-sky-sailing/1900-6418176/" data-ref-id="1900-6418176">Granblue Fantasy video games</a>, just opened an AI-focused studio. In response to the backlash toward this announcement, Cygames put out a message trying to assuage players' fears about generative AI's use in its games. The message isn't very reassuring, though.</p><p>This kerfuffle started on January 9, when a post on <a href="https://www.cygames.co.jp/news/id-24704/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Cygames' Japanese website</a> revealed that Cygames AI Studio had been established. The announcement explains that this new studio will research and develop its own models and provide services to others while drawing on Cygames' game development history and expertise.</p><p>The use of artificial intelligence, specifically generative AI, has become a very hot-button issue in the video game industry as of late. Games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-is-my-game-of-the-year-but-its-use-of-generative-ai-really-sucks/1100-6537140/" data-ref-id="1100-6537140">Arc Raiders</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/us-congressman-calls-for-ai-regulations-after-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-debate/1100-6536263/" data-ref-id="1100-6536263">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> have faced backlash over their use of the technology, and each new AI-related gaming announcement online usually draws the ire of fans.</p><p>This announcement in particular made the fans of Granblue and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/umamusume-pretty-derby-is-galloping-up-the-charts-on-steam/1100-6533094/" data-ref-id="1100-6533094">Umamusume: Pretty Derby</a> nervous, as many don't want to see generative AI in their favorite games. In response, Cygames released the following message on X, hoping to quell player fears:</p><p>The biggest takeaways from the statement are that generative AI art isn't currently being used in Cygames' titles, and that the company "won't implement generative AI into our products without prior notice."</p><p>While Cygames goes on to say it wants to respect the "dignity, passion, and heart of the creators and artists who act as the architects of gaming culture," that message wasn't exactly reassuring. Many don't just want a warning over the use of generative AI, but for it to not be used at all.</p><p>The establishment of Cygames AI Studio and this message definitely mean players should keep a close eye on Cygames' releases going forward to see whether or not they'll use generative AI.</p>

            <link>https://gameinformer.com/2026/01/14/animal-crossing-new-horizons-update-30-is-live-now-a-day-early</link>
            <guid>1405777</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Animal Crossing: New Horizons was a massive hit when it launched <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/animal-crossing-new-horizons/a-wholesome-island-oasis-animal-crossing-new-horizons-review">just over six years ago</a> (man, time flies!), but it seemed like Nintendo's support for the game had come to an end. Then, the company surprised us all when it unveiled <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/10/30/animal-crossing-new-horizons-is-getting-a-big-free-content-update-and-an-improved-switch">the game wouldn't just be getting a performance-enhanced Switch 2 version, but there would be a huge, completely free, content update for all players</a>. Both the update and Switch 2 version were set to drop tomorrow, January 15, but Nintendo had one last surprise in store for us – the 3.0 update is available now.</p><p>After seeing commotion about it online, we at <em>Game Informer</em> have personally verified that the update is available now, and based on similar reports from the fine folks at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/surprise-animal-crossing-new-horizons-free-30-update-for-switch-releases-early"><em>Eurogamer</em></a>, this early launch does not seem to be isolated to the US.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7nODHyw3lgs"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7nODHyw3lgs" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>There's no special trick to acquiring it either – 3.0 started downloading on my console as soon as I woke it up this morning. If it doesn't download for you right away, hover over the application on your Switch's home screen, press the plus button on the right side of your controller, and head to the "Software Update" portion of the menu, and select "Via the Internet."</p><p>While the 3.0 update is live, the Switch 2 Upgrade is not live. It's a purchase in the Switch 2 eShop ($4.99 in the US) set to go live tomorrow, and at the time of writing, Nintendo hasn't pulled the trigger on launching it quite yet.&nbsp;</p><p>That said, if I could only pick one of the two updates to launch early, this would be the one. Animal Crossing: New Horizons' 3.0 update has the bulk of new content, including the hotel on Kapp'n's pier, the addition of Slumber Islands, and several new lines of crossover furniture. By contrast, the Switch 2 upgrade provides a performance boost, allows you to play with more people online, and integrates some of the Switch 2's new features (like mouse controls and GameChat) into regular gameplay.</p><p>For more on the new content, check out <a href="https://gameinformer.com/preview/2025/12/16/new-amenities-but-not-renovations">my impressions from a hands-off preview from last month</a>.</p><hr><p><em>Will you be jumping back into Animal Crossing with the new update? Let us know in the comments!</em></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2026/01/14/animal-crossing-new-horizons-update-30-is-live-now-a-day-early]]></content:encoded>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Right now, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-4">Fallout</a> is one of the largest video game franchises around. Amazon's highly successful TV show only <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4-new-vegas-player-numbers-skyrocket-thanks-to-the-unavoidable-impact-of-fallout-season-2">took the series popularity to the next level</a>. However, before Bethesda decided to take things in a different direction after acquiring the series from Black Isle Studios and Interplay Entertainment, the series wasn't nearly as famous. In fact, veteran narrator Ron Perlman has revealed his first payment for work on the games was hilariously meager.</p>
<p>"They invited me to do the very first Fallout back in the 90s, I think. They gave me 40 dollars and a sandwich," the actor revealed during <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5iSCL4o61w">an appearance in The Joe Vulpis Podcast</a>. The renowned Hollywood actor was very specific about the sum of money offered, but we don't know for sure if that was <em>everything </em>or just his way of saying he was paid very little, as <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fallout/fallout-was-always-seen-as-a-b-project-28-years-since-the-post-apocalyptic-rpg-launched-its-original-creators-reflect-on-a-long-legacy-starting-with-that-very-first-bomb/">the game had a notoriously difficult journey to completion and release</a> and was generally seen as a big risk for the original developers.</p>
<p>In the end, the RPG became a critical hit and sold enough copies to warrant a sequel which came out in October 1998, a year later. "A year and a half" after recording his part for Fallout 1, Perlman had already forgotten about the gig (or so he says, now, in 2026), so he was shocked to hear a sequel was happening because the original had gone "through the f***ing roof." Past that point, the actor's voice became an essential part of the Fallout series, and we can only assume that the remuneration got better as the franchise grew larger.</p>
<p>"I didn't see that coming," he concluded before moving on to discuss other voice acting roles. And if you're wondering whether he played any of the Fallout games, the answer is: no. It's all about dollars and sandwiches for him. His last credit on the series is 2018's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a> as the Speaker, so there are reasons to believe we'll be hearing him again in the future (whenever that might be, for the game series).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, some fans are convinced Perlman has a surprise cameo in Fallout Season 2 based on <a href="https://x.com/FO4News/status/1998341465735307751?s=20">his presence at the premiere</a> and a suspicious deep voice in one of the trailers. We'll find out soon enough.</p>

		<p>34BigThings has announced that Carmageddon: Rogue Shift is going to be released on February 6th, with the game coming to PC, PS5, Xbox Series XS, and Switch 2. The release date has been revealed as part of a new gameplay trailer for Carmageddon: Rogue Shift which shows some of the different vehicles and weapons that can be used in the carnage of the races.</p>
<p><iframe title="Carmageddon: Rogue Shift - Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uW2iH9gNDxY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Last month, 34BigThings gave details five <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/17/carmageddon-rogue-shift-first-five-vehicles-have-been-detailed/">Carmageddon: Rogue Shift’s vehicles,</a> which are shown in the above trailer. The Eagle GT is considered a good allrounder muscle car, while the Clunker is a tankier option. &nbsp;The Firecracker Turbo will be for players who value speed over everything else, and the SQR-NE55 is one that balances all the vehicle stats. Finally, the Hawk GT has high offensive capabilities and acceleration, but sacrifices handling as a result.</p>
<p>Carmageddon: Rogue Shift is set in the year 2050, where the streets are overrun by the Wasted at night, meaning humanity has to shelter in their homes during the dark. That is unless they are a street racer looking for money, prestige, and a chance to get off of the planet to safety. Carmageddon: Rogue Shift will feature 15 vehicles, a mix of FWD, RWD, and AWD, with each having their own unique stats. There are also 13 weapon classes from shotguns to rocket launchers, and these are upgradeable too. Players will also have access to over 80 perks to further customise vehicle loadouts as they race across tracks that have a dynamic weather and day and night cycle. All campaigns will be unique as the events are randomly generated, with players taking part in races to boss battles as progress is made. In each event players will sustain damage so it planning routes to the shops dotted around will also be key, to make repairs and buy upgrades.</p>

		<p>Rockstar chalked up the first win in their <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/06/rockstar-responds-to-union-busting-accusations-says-fired-employees-were-leakers/">dispute with fired employees</a>, as a UK tribunal rejected the former developers their request for interim pay while pursuing allegations of union busting by the studio.</p>
<p>Denying this request, Judge Frances Eccles said that the staff would have had to demonstrate a “pretty good chance of success” in proving they were fired for unionisation efforts, and that they had not managed to do so at this early juncture. Of course, the case will still go ahead and it’s possible for further arguments and evidence to come to light.</p>


<p>A Rockstar spokesperson issued a statement saying:</p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">“The Glasgow Employment Tribunal has rejected the union’s application for interim relief. We welcome the decision, which is consistent with Rockstar’s position throughout.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">“We regret that we were put in a position where dismissals were necessary, but we stand by our course of action as supported by the outcome of this hearing.”</span></p>

<p>The IWGB shared a statement with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fired-employees-at-gta-6-studio-rockstar-denied-interim-pay-by-uk-tribunal-union-highlights-firms-flimsy-grounds-for-defence">Eurogamer</a>:</p>
<p>“We are emerging from this hearing, having now had a glimpse of Rockstar’s flimsy grounds for defence, feeling bolstered in our claims that these firings were not just deeply unjust but also plainly unlawful.</p>
<p>“[…] the judge stated in her ruling that: ‘There was no evidence of the respondent having suffered any adverse consequences as a result of these postings'”. The IWGB additionally said Rockstar had broken multiple procedural guidelines with its firing of the affected employees. This included the lack of disciplinary meetings, employees being unable to appeal “until six weeks later”, and zero evidence of an investigation.”</p>
<p>However, further background from the ruling includes that the judge noted the volume of non-employees featured within the IWGB Discord ground, including someone who had written press articles about video games, that some fired employees were based in Canada and thus could not have been union members, and that there were those expressing support for unionisation that were not dismissed.</p>
<p>People Makes Games were in court and shared details of the evidence that was demonstrated.</p>
<p><iframe title="Rockstar vs. Union: We Went to Court and Saw the Evidence" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dnuipPQDd_w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Per Chris Bratt’s account of viewing the hard copies of submitted evidence, it seems that one employee was fired for expressing that they were not working ‘crunch’ hours yet, about generative AI being approved for use by legal, and further stuff that was branded as so top secret by Rockstar’s barrister that they didn’t want it read out loud in court. Except it could easily be read and is valid to be reported on by PMG. This included complaints over difficulty to book time off, including mention of a team’s staffing size, mentioning 32-player online sessions (which would be an increase in lobby size from 30 players in the current GTA Online).</p>
<p>These details were claimed to be “highly confidential and commercially sensitive” in Rockstar’s arguments, whose stance is that any kind of leaked detail, even seemingly innocuous like if you were in crunch or not, can have a dramatic impact, such as with the billions of dollars wiped off Take Two’s valuation after announcing GTA 6’s delay to November 2026. For that reason, Rockstar fired employees immediately.</p>
<p>So, Rockstar has won this day in court, but there’s a long way to go and a variety of different outcomes. The judge will have to decide, once further arguments and evidence has been presented, whether these dismissals were fair and meet the threshold of “gross misconduct”, and from that point, whether this was Rockstar engaging in union busting.</p>
<p>It’s entirely possible that we end up in a middle ground where Rockstar is able to dodge the union busting charge, but still get dinged for unfair dismissal. In the meantime, unionisation efforts at Rockstar can continue with all those employees that Rockstar couldn’t find cause to dismiss, and certainly will be much wiser about keeping their conversations within a clearly closed group.</p>

			<p><strong>Update 14/01/2026:</strong> Following the publishing of this article, a statement sent to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ubisoft-confirms-29-jobs-lost-at-abu-dhabi-mobile-studio">GamesIndustry.Biz</a> confirmed that Ubisoft has laid off <strong>29 developers</strong> from its Ubisoft Abu Dhabi studio.</p>



<p>"<em>In November, Ubisoft made the difficult decision to restructure its Abu Dhabi mobile studio, discontinuing some projects in order to focus on Growtopia</em>," the statement begins. "<em>As a result, this change impacted 29 team members. We remain deeply grateful for their contributions and are providing support to them throughout the transition.</em>"</p>



<p><strong>Original Story:</strong></p>



<p><strong>Ubisoft</strong> is starting 2026 in a similar fashion to how it started 2025. The Assassin's Creed company shut down its <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-closes-uk-studio-lays-off-185-staff/">Leamington-based studio in January 2025, laying off <strong>185 people</strong></a>. To start 2026, between the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-shuts-down-ubisoft-halifax-claims-decision-had-nothing-to-do-with-studio-unionizing/">shuttering of <strong>Ubisoft Halifax</strong></a> and yesterday's layoffs at <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-lays-off-55-people-ubisoft-massive-stockholm/"><strong>Massive Entertainment</strong> and <strong>Ubisoft Stockholm</strong></a>, Ubisoft has already laid off an estimated <strong>126 developers</strong>. Now, that number is definitely a little higher, as a new report from <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-ubisoft-laying-off-staff-at-abu-dhabi-studio">Game Developer</a> reveals layoffs have continued at <strong>Ubisoft Abu Dhabi</strong>.</p>



<p>According to the report, cuts at the Abu Dhabi studio began back in December 2025 and have continued into the new year, with some staff, like former art director <strong>Daniel Kovacs</strong>, sharing on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/daniel-kovacs-206b2316a_i-took-some-time-to-reflect-after-being-impacted-activity-7401147823175639040-t3WE?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAADTlvBcBPTBRScN2Be454jnla503919DOfI">his personal LinkedIn page last month that he had been laid off</a>. "<em>I took some time to reflect after being impacted by the recent layoffs at Ubisoft Abu Dhabi, and at the risk of sounding a bit sentimental, I just want to say how grateful I am for these three and a half years</em>," wrote Kovacs.</p>



<p>"<em>Signing off as Ubisoft Abu Dhabi's social media manager as I've been affected by the recent layoffs</em>," added <strong>Raiza</strong> <strong>Veridiano</strong>, who also <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-7400125428398485507-ZyjH?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAADTlvBcBPTBRScN2Be454jnla503919DOfI">shared the news that they had been laid off last month</a>. "<em>I’m incredibly grateful for the 4 years and 9 months I’ve spent here.</em>"</p>



<p>Other former staff, like game support specialist <strong>Zohaib Shafiq</strong>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/zshafiq_opentowork-opentowork-ubisoft-activity-7416772579723665409-Xgp6?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAADTlvBcBPTBRScN2Be454jnla503919DOfI">shared the news only yesterday,</a> indicating that the cuts have continued into 2026. "<em>Due to recent restructuring, my journey at</em> <em>Ubisoft Abu Dhabi is coming to an end after an amazing 4.5 years. It’s been a chapter full of learning, collaboration, and growth; I am incredibly grateful for the experiences, challenges, and people that made this chapter so meaningful.</em>"</p>



<p>Ubisoft Abu Dhabi has a team of 60 people, <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/company/careers/locations/abu-dhabi">according to its website</a>, which also calls the studio "<em>Ubisoft’s Regional Hub for games development</em>" in the area. The Abu Dhabi team is responsible for titles like Growtopia and CSI: Hidden Crimes.</p>



<p>According to Ubisoft, these cuts are part of  "<em></em><em>company-wide actions to streamline operations, improve efficiency, and reduce costs</em>." Last year, the company <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-announces-imminent-closing-transaction-with-tencent-minority-stakeholder-vantage-studios/">established a new branch with <strong>Tencent</strong> called <strong>Vantage Studios</strong></a>, which is now the home to the company's most significant IPs, including Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six.</p>

Doing so nets you a number of goodies, including extra cars and access to two "premium expansions".</p><p>Perhaps more interestingly for our purposes, however, a pre-order also advertises the possibility of playing <em>Forza Horizon 6 </em>"four days early starting May 15th", which would seem to point to an official release date of May 19th.</p><figure role="group">

<p>As a reminder, <em>Forza Horizon 6 </em>was officially unveiled by Xbox <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/forza-horizon-6-revealed-ps5" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="7ede297d-3bdf-4de5-b00a-3479b4a33aab" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">during the Tokyo Game Show last year</a>. It'll be coming to PS5, just like its predecessor, although that release will be happening later than the game's PC and Xbox Series X|S arrival.</p><p>We don't know a great deal about <em>Forza Horizon 6 </em>yet, although we do know the game will be taking place in Japan, and that it'll feature a number of real-world locations, including Tokyo, Hokkaido, and the imposing Mt. Fuji.</p><p>We also know that <em>Forza Horizon 6 </em>is one of the reasons that Turn 10 Studios decided to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/forza-motorsport-updates-ending" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="28526b82-2c26-415e-b595-273f31c08d2e" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">can further content updates</a> for the more hardcore <em>Forza Motorsport</em>, since the studio is assisting Playground Games with development on the simcade racer.</p><p>It's likely the release date for <em>Forza Horizon 6 </em>will be revealed during <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-developer-direct-january-22nd-2026" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="2c8e5f78-4ad9-43f4-bd6b-54b81360f376" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">next week's Xbox Developer Direct</a>, where we'll also get more information about the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fable-reboot-delayed-2026" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="48a951d3-c822-4051-88a7-e27a8ee10808" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">long-delayed <em>Fable </em>reboot</a> and Game Freak's <em>Beast of Reincarnation</em>.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>I’m going to keep this one as succinct as possible, because every word is causing me psychic damage. Former Activision CEO Bobby Kotick has alleged that an ongoing lawsuit accusing him of rushing Microsoft’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-are-buying-activision-blizzard-for-69-billion">$69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard</a> to avoid the fallout from company-wide sexual misconduct allegations was, in fact, secretly orchestrated by noted <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/embracer-have-laid-off-8-of-their-global-workforce-since-their-restructuring-began">layoff manufacturer</a> Embracer Group to boost sales of Embracer’s own games.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/bobby-kotick-activision-microsoft-ap7-lawsuit-embracer-group">Game File</a>, a Swedish pension fund called Sjunde AP-Fonden, aka AP7, filed the lawsuit in Delaware’s Court of Chancery in 2022. The suit names Microsoft, Activision Blizzard and the company’s former board of directors, including Kotick, as defendants. It claims that Kotick
"hastily negotiated a merger to protect himself, agreeing to sell Activision to Microsoft for $95 per share", after being faced "with increasing pressures to leave Activision."</p>
<p>Back in 2022, Activision Blizzard were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/new-lawsuit-alleges-harassment-and-retaliation-at-activision-blizzard">weathering fresh allegations of sexual harassment in the workplace</a>, having already been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/activision-blizzard-sued-by-california-over-alleged-culture-of-sexual-harassment-and-discrimination">taken to court the previous year</a> by the State of California on the charge of cultivating "a breeding ground for harassment and discrimination against women". Activision-Blizzard ultimately <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/activision-blizzard-will-pay-55m-to-settle-sex-discrimination-lawsuit">settled the latter court case for $55 million</a> in December 2023, shortly after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-finally-buys-activision-blizzard-as-last-legal-hurdles-fall-away">the finalisation of the Microsoft Activision Blizzard buyout</a>, with the State commenting that "no court or any independent investigation has substantiated any allegations [of] systemic or widespread sexual harassment at Activision Blizzard".</p>
<p>Kotick himself has been accused of being aware of the harassment allegations, and failing to take appropriate action. In November 2021, Activision-Blizzard employees launched a petition <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/activision-blizzard-employees-demand-ceo-bobby-koticks-removal-amid-several-new-abuse-allegations">calling for his removal</a>. A group of shareholders also subsequently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/an-activision-blizzard-shareholder-group-want-bobby-kotick-removed">demanded his resignation</a>. Kotick has denied any wrongdoing. In February last year, he also <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-activision-ceo-bobby-kotick-blasts-fake-lawsuits-against-us-and-riot-games-claiming-union-workers-used-harassment-claims-to-drum-up-members">blasted the lawsuits as “fake”</a>, arguing that they were orchestrated to drum up support for unions.</p><p>Which brings us back to this Swedish pension fund business. In October 2025, Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick of the Delaware Chancery Court <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/activision-officials-must-face-claims-over-microsoft-takeover-judge-rules-2025-10-03/">said</a> that shareholders in AP7’s proposed class action could pursue their "core" claim that Kotick and other Activision directors breached their fiduciary duties, while dismissing other claims against Microsoft. If you want to get into the weeds of it, here’s McCormick's <a href="https://courts.delaware.gov/Opinions/Download.aspx?id=385520">83 page memorandum opinion</a> submitted in January 2025.</p><p>

In a recently filed ‘answer’ to the AP7 lawsuit, Kotick and his lawyers are claiming that the ulterior motive here is “to exert collateral harm on Activision” and to help Embracer, who are also headquartered in Sweden.
</p><p>Kotick and his legal team claim that the suit “was apparently aimed to help pave the way for Embracer to increase its foothold in the California market at the expense of Activision, making it more difficult for Activision to recruit talent and expand through [merges and acquisitions] activity of the sort that Activision relied on to grow historically.”</p>
<p>Among Kotick’s justifications for this argument is that AP7’s view chairman Emma Ihre was an executive at Embracer at the time of the lawsuit’s filing. As such, he thinks the lawsuit was filed to mount a “collateral attack on Activision [that] also appears to be tied to Embracer’s desire to boost sales of its games while leaving Activision hamstrung in the development of its own games that competed against Embracer’s titles”.</p>
<p>Game File has obtained a response from Embracer, who are playing the whole thing for giggles. “We are humbled of Mr Kotick’s remark that we were competing with Activision on this level [sic],” an Embracer Group representative told the publication. “Nevertheless, perhaps difficult to accept for Mr Kotick, but we did not and do not need any help from a Swedish pension fund in competing with Activision.</p>
<p>“Thus, in short, there were no coordination or collaboration between Embracer and AP7 relating to any of Mr. Kotick’s statements,” the statement concludes. “No agenda or instructions were directed from Embracer via Emma Ihre or directly to AP7.”</p>
<p>At the time of the AP7 lawsuit's filing, Embracer were <a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/05/24/embracer-group-deal-collapse">attempting to cobble together a $2 billion funding deal with Savvy Games</a>, a company funded by the Saudi Arabian government. The collapse of that deal would precipitate an enormous round of cuts, job losses, cancellations and closures over the following few years. I wouldn't put it past Embracer to 'do a Peter Thiel' on Kotick and Activision, but it seems like they had plenty other fish to fry.</p>
