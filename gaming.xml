            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/warframe-is-getting-the-big-techrot-encore-update-on-march-19/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, during the latest Digital Extremes stream, the Canadian developer shared more details about the upcoming Warframe update Techrot Encore. Due to launch on March 19, this big update will add the 60th Warframe to the game, Temple.</p>
<p>Playing as this character, users will fire off heatwave projectiles, summon Techrot Subwoofer minions to buff nearby fans and debuff the haters, sing a Solo of the century to set off flame jets, and even call upon the sapient Infested guitar named Lizzie as an Exalted Weapon capable of firing projectiles at the pluck of a string and transforming into a flamethrower for a limited time.</p>
<p>There are also four new Protoframes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Flare (Temple), who aims to be the ultimate work of art, transcending the boundaries of both gender and biology.</li>
<li>Minerva (Saryn) and Velimir II (Frost), two hardened military veterans, once in love, and the adoptive parents of <a href="https://wccftech.com/warframe-1999-is-available-everywhere-today/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Warframe: 1999</a> antagonist Major Rusalka.</li>
<li>Kaya (Nova), voiced by Juzel Bagabuyo, is the self-taught engineering genius of the new crew with a special interest in cracking time travel.</li>
</ul>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/TECHROT-RECAP2-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>

<p>When it comes to new content, the developers are introducing two new mission types to the game. One is Stage Defense, which reimagines the traditional defense mission type. In this one, you must defend Flare as they put on a memorial concert for the band members lost to the Scaldra's oppressive takeover of the city. Temporal Archimedea, on the other hand, is the most challenging Warframe mission type. In this new version, players group with Minerva and Velimir II to take on three back-to-back randomly selected missions, using Kaya's new Peely Pix system to select upgradeable modifiers that change the flow of each attempt. Lastly, as part of the studio's Make-A-Wish commitment to James Conlin, Techrot Encore adds the latest atomic racing mini-game as part of the Höllvania Mall Hub arcade collection, Ollie's Crash Course.</p>
<p>Today also marks the release of the Open Beta for the new Warframe mobile companion app, featuring Steam login support, improved navigation, and a redesign of the settings page. You can get it for iOS <a href="https://testflight.apple.com/join/KPfve5cm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> and for Android <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.digitalextremes.warframenexus" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>

<p>Megan Everett, Director of Community at Digital Extremes, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>Warframe will officially turn 12 years old on March 7, a milestone none of us ever thought we would hit when we first started. We want to make sure our players know how thankful we are for them through our content plans this year. Techrot Encore marks not only the first major update of our 12th year but also the biggest ‘echoes’ update we’ve ever made to expand out something like Warframe: 1999. We’re stoked to finally bring our surreal space virus boy band to life and everything that comes with them, so get ready for the party of your lifetimes on March 19!</em></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Tree2-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Today, Digital Extremes also aired a new live stream dedicated to <a href="https://wccftech.com/digital-extremes-soulframe-devstream-showcases-companions-new-social-hub-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Soulframe</a>, the upcoming fantasy-themed game. The team offered more details on the latest update for Preludes (Pre-Alpha Test) players, including two new social hubs tied to the faction system, a faction-based side-quest system, and gameplay of the new caster weapon type. In addition to the previously announced Silent Rose faction, players can now pledge allegiance to two other factions if their goals align: Alca's Children and Kith of Kings.</p>
<p>There are two new social Enclave hubs reserved for each faction, where players can take on a new type of side quest to further each group's goals. Lastly, the aforementioned new caster weapon type shown in the stream is capable of firing bolts of energy from both hands and even tricking enemies into thinking you're unarmed.</p>

            <p>Coatsink have announced a sequel to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/islanders">Islanders</a>, their pastelcore seaside town-arranger, which was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/islanders-review">the last game Alec Meer ever reviewed for RPS</a>. Until he <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/kentucky-route-zero-act-v-review">reviewed Kentucky Route Zero: Act V</a>, a year or so later. If I didn't know better, I'd say Alec had planned that deliberately to screw me up. But I'll forgive him because the KRZ review is very good and thoughtful, and also because the first trailer for Islanders: New Shores is extremely calming. Here you go.</p>

<p>Out summer 2025, New Shores adheres to the first game's formula of carefully plonking down buildings to milk various adjacency bonuses and achieve a certain level score. Over the course of each stage, you unlock more and fancier buildings, each alighting in your inventory with that gentle kiss-pop effect that has become the cosy gaming genre's acoustic signature - a sort of Wilhelm Scream for creators of games about soft sunsets and rake-wielding bunnies making friends.</p>
<p>New Shores contains some new shores, obviously - we can expect "50 dynamic island generators offering endless variety". It also harbours new features. Foremost among them are boons - "one-time power ups unlocked on each stage as you collect points, offering a helping hand that will become vital as you take on the game's tricker levels". These might let you duplicate buildings in your inventory or replace those you've already built, among other "intriguing new twists". Sounds like that might come in handy with the new "advanced scoring systems that reward clever tactics".</p>
<p>There's also a new Sandbox mode (with separate save files), "44 unique building types", seven "stunning island properties", and a juicy photo mode with a spread of filters and a turntable camera setting. Streamers, meanwhile, get Twitch integration which lets viewers vote on building choices.</p>
<p>It all seems like Good Stuff, though I do consider it a little malapropos that one of the islands at the end of the trailer appears to be an active volcano. Did Islanders have volcanoes? I never unlocked any.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/halo-infinite-is-embracing-tac-shooters-with-search-destroy-mode-coming-this-year/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The Halo team <a href="https://www.halowaypoint.com/news/seek-and-deploy-extraction" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> today that S&amp;D Extraction, a round-based competitive mode based on tactical shooters and Call of Duty’s Search &amp; Destroy mode, is coming to Halo Infinite in 2025. S&amp;D Extraction will be a part of Halo Infinite’s esports scene, and a $20,000 contest for maps for the new mode will be held as well.</p>







<p>S&amp;D Extraction is Halo Infinite’s take on popular tactical shooters like CS2, VALORANT, or Call of Duty’s Search &amp; Destroy. The Halo Infinite mode’s full name, Seek and Deploy, is a clear reference to popular bomb plant/defusal mode from Call of Duty.</p>



<p>In S&amp;D Extraction, teams of four take turns on offense and defense. The offense tries to “initiate an Extraction” (plant the bomb) on one of two sites, while the defending aims to stop them by defeating all opponents or “converting” (defusing). An S&amp;D Extraction consists of 11 rounds, meaning the first team to win six wins.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Like CS2 or VALORANT, players have to manage an economy in between and during rounds of S&amp;D Extraction. Players earn credits for planting or defusing the bomb and getting kills, but can also secure extra credits at “neutral devices on the map.” Between rounds, players can buy weapons, grenades, equipment, and power equipment like Active Camo, Drop Wall, or Threat Sensor.</p>



<p>A unique mechanic coming to S&amp;D Extraction in Halo Infinite is a buy back mechanic, something that’s not common in other tac shooters. Players that have died in a round and have enough credits can “buy back” into the round, respawning at the spawn point with a base loadout. While exact numbers aren’t clear, the team at Halo Studios says buying back will be expensive, and will require several rounds of saving credits to afford.</p>



<p>As mentioned at the top of the article, a $20,000 S&amp;D Extraction map contest is being held by Halo Studios and ForgeHub. Halo Studios has also hired Forge community mapmakers Artifice and Mikrips to build the mode and its custom map. The first look at the new mode is scheduled for the FaZe Kaysan Invitational on March 29, and will be broadcast on the official Halo Twitch channel.</p>



<p>Halo Infinite has seen dwindling player numbers for some time now. Is this enough to give the player base a much needed spike? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/call-of-duty-2025-in-development-for-last-gen-consoles.1711/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official Insider Gaming Forums.</a></p>

Now, Coatsink has announced that a sequel, Islanders: New Shores, is coming to consoles and PC this summer. In the first-look video below, New Shores retains the appealing aspects of the first Islanders while teasing some of the new features that will be integrated into the gameplay.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lAgsVJxyJ4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8lAgsVJxyJ4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>As in the first game, New Shores allows players to develop cities and structures on a series of breathtakingly gorgeous islands and transform them as they see fit. Each level begins with a number of buildings at players' disposal, but they also have consider where the structures should be placed in order to get the maximum amount of points during the stage. Earning those points allows additional buildings to be unlocked, which opens the door to even more options.</p><p>One of the new features introduced in New Shores is called boons. It's a one-time power-up that's unlocked on each stage as players collect points. Boons can allow players to perform some of the more difficult tasks in a single action, including the creation of duplicate buildings and the destruction of others to make way for something new. However, boons should be used sparingly, since some of the trickier levels may need them more than the earlier levels do.</p><p>New Shores is introducing an additional sandbox mode that has a save system that is separate from the high score mode. A photo mode has also been added to preserve players' favorite creations or even just pictures of the beautiful islands themselves. To share the experience, Coatsink is adding Twitch integration to New Shores, as well as the option for viewers to vote on which buildings to pick.</p><p>Islanders: New Shores will be available on Nintendo Switch, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC. Beyond the Summer 2025 window, Coatsink hasn't set a specific release date yet.</p>

            <p>
More than 110 former Metro series developers have come together as a new studio, known as Reburn, and its first project - La Quimera - is sci-fi shooter set in Latin America that's being co-written by Drive director Nicolas Winding Refn.
</p>
<p>
The specifics of the announcement have lead to some confusion as talk of rebranding has gone around, but Reburn essentially appears to Metro developer sub-studio 4A Games Ukraine breaking away from 4A Games' Malta-based headquarters to do its own thing. As for the 4A Games that remains, it continues to work on a new IP and the next Metro project.
</p>
<p>
Reburn, though, consists of over 110 former Metro developers, including gameplay designers, artists, sound engineers, and programmers - all led by former 4A Games Ukraine CEO Dmytro Lymar. And its debut project is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2282350/La_Quimera/">sci-fi FPS La Quimera</a>, promising "familiar tense gunplay and intimate storytelling" in a futuristic Latin American megalopolis and lush jungle setting.

La Quimera sees players - either going it solo or co-operatively with up to two friends - stepping into the customisable exosuit of a down-on-their-luck PMC soldier battling against rival factions. There's talk of "unique and highly detailed environments, characters and weapons", as players experience a world and narrative written and created by Nicolas Winding Refn (Drive, Only God Forgives, The Neon Demon) and E.J.A. Warren.

You can get a taste of that in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u_qFKhoB8c&amp;t=57s">La Quimera's announcement trailer</a> above. But Reburn - which also has a presence in Cyprus alongside its Ukraine and remote teams - says it'll share more on the PC game, alongside additional "supporting visuals", in the coming months.

I’ve landed on four standout game demos that are worth your time now and whenever their full games release.</p><div><p id="the-talos-principle-reawakened"><h2>The Talos Principle Reawakened</h2></p></div><p>The best way to describe <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F2806640%2FThe_Talos_Principle_Reawakened%2F" rel="sponsored"><em>The Talos Principle: Reawakened</em></a> is if <em>Portal </em>was harder, less funny, and written by C.S. Lewis if he knew what a robot was. <em>Reawakened</em> is a remaster of 2014’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2014/12/17/7411513/the-talos-principle-review"><em>The Talos Principle</em></a>. But according to the developers at Croteam, <em>Reawakened</em> doesn’t just take the original and slap on a next-gen coat of paint; it also adds new story content and a new puzzle editor so players can create their own challenges. </p><p><em>Reawakened</em> strikes the perfect difficulty balance – not too simple, not too frustrating – that makes its puzzles delightful to figure out. In the demo, you play as a robot tasked with solving puzzles using lasers, signal jammers, and your own burgeoning sentience. The game gives you no tutorial on how exactly to use the tools you’re given. And while that can be annoying if their function is too esoteric to parse, learning what I’m being asked to do and how to use the tools to do it was part of the fun. With the lasers, it was thrilling figuring out that I can split a beam in multiple directions, something I only learned by going, “Hey, wonder if I can do this?” and finding out that I could.</p><p>As for the story, there is an overarching narrative involving the architects of the open-world place you’ve been dropped in, but the game’s graphics on the Steam Deck made those narrative sequences – which involve you using a computer terminal – impossible to read and therefore parse. I didn’t mind it because I’m just here for the little thrills you get completing a challenge which were manifold in the 40-minute demo. </p><div><p id="bundle-of-joy"><h2>Bundle of Joy</h2></p></div><p><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F3138370%2FBundle_of_Joy%2F" rel="sponsored"><em>Bundle of Joy</em></a> was the most touching and heartfelt of the games I played. It’s a narrative minigame-a-palooza ala the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/20/22632465/warioware-get-it-together-nintendo-switch-preview"><em>WarioWare</em></a> games in which you’re a new dad tasked with caring for your new baby and maintaining your sanity in the middle of the pandemic lockdown. Every day is split into tasks like making bottles, putting on baby’s socks, and making trips to the grocery store. The minigames are simple like hitting buttons in the right sequence and timing to rock your baby to sleep, but because being a new parent is inordinately stressful, each task adds to an ever growing stress meter. Fill it up, and you have a breakdown. Your partner taps in to take the baby while you take a breather. </p><p>What I loved about this demo was the sweetness and empathy with which it treats its subject matter. I don’t have kids (yet), but there was something about being asked to input my skin tone, my partner’s skin tone, and my baby’s skin tone that just <em>got </em>me. I’m a Black woman in an interracial relationship and it was really cool to see the game account for a family dynamic like mine would be. Also when you have a breakdown, it’s not treated as a failure, only as a fact of parenthood. The game encourages you with messages like “You’re doing great. It’s okay!” that I think would make any new or aspiring parent feel reassured when it comes to the ultimate game: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/c/24278723/comic-baby-monitor-surveillance-history-tech">raising a kid</a>.</p><div><p id="creepy-redneck-dinosaur-mansion-3"><h2>Creepy Redneck Dinosaur Mansion 3</h2></p></div><p>Listen, I don’t know how you could see a game named <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F2116510%2FCreepy_Redneck_Dinosaur_Mansion_3%2F" rel="sponsored"><em>Creepy Redneck Dinosaur Mansion 3</em></a> and not play it. Same with anything the developers at Strange Scaffold put out. According to the description, <em>CRDM3</em> (which, hilariously, is actually the first game in the series) is a comedic match-3 and metroidvania, which the developers helpfully call a “matchroidvania.” But it is so much more.</p><p>In it, you play as JJ Hardwell, an agent of the Alcohol, Tobacco, and Super Science Bureau who is tasked with investigating a mansion for suspected dinosaur activity. You use match-3 action to take down the evil saurians while choosing which way to go through the mysterious maze of a mansion. Along the way, the choices you make contribute to JJ’s abilities that help him overcome the mansion’s many obstacles. An observation made in one area will, later on, open up a path that would have otherwise remained blocked off.</p><p>The match-3 elements are surprisingly deep, allowing you to use items and abilities powered by the gems you match to defeat enemies. <em>CRDM3</em> is funny as hell, with all kinds of meta jokes about game development that I suspect will delight the players who know their way around Unity or Godot.</p><div><p id="promise-mascot-agency"><h2>Promise Mascot Agency</h2></p></div><p>In <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F2585830%2FPromise_Mascot_Agency%2F" rel="sponsored"><em>Promise Mascot Agency</em></a>, you play as a disgraced yakuza sent to a derelict town to raise $80 million by managing a mascot business. But instead of sending out real people in adorable cat or poop costumes to birthday parties or to promote a new business opening, you’ve got a larger-than-life sentient severed pinky or a partially eaten and crying block of tofu. As for the actual game mechanics, they don’t seem to matter all that much in relation to the story, but in a good way. You get job requests, send out mascots who fit the requirements, and if they get into trouble, there’s a turn-based, card battler minigame you play to overcome the issue. There are also open-world elements where you drive around in one of those <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kei_truck">kei trucks</a> that have recently <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/autos/kei-trucks-are-gaining-popularity-us-small-size-low-prices-rcna156653">become all the rage</a>, picking up collectibles, finding spare cash, and recruiting new mascots to help your business.</p><p>Once you get beyond the wacky premise, the <em>Promise Mascot Agency</em> actually has real heart. Yes, your coworker is a walking, talking, foul-mouthed severed pinky who is so unsettling and cute at the same time that I can’t stop <em>staring</em> at her. But your job is to work with her to revive a town that’s seen economic and social devastation by fostering real connections with the people who live there. </p><p>The singular best thing about discovering games via Next Fest is seeing developers’ creativity on full display. In games, the default way to drum up interest is by making something that’s easily explainable – <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/22/24047087/palworld-early-access-steam-xbox-gamepass"><em>Pokémon</em> but with guns</a>, for example. But for Next Fest, I loved finding games that defy succinct explanations like “surrealist Japanese mascot management simulator.”</p><p>Yes, that may make it hard to sell to the average consumer, but games don’t and shouldn’t have to be broadly appealing to be successful. The developers of these games know exactly what they are and that they are not for everybody. And in making these weird little freak games, they’ve managed to punch through all the “x but make it y” noise to truly stand out. Play them — or use Next Fest as an opportunity to venture outside your comfort zone to find something truly special.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>NetEase Games has announced today that the cross-platform test for Once Human has begun, where it will be testing the cross-platform feature for mobile devices and PC in particular. This will benefit players greatly, as it will widen the pool of players available to interact with, as well as giving them more of a chance to build, engage in combat, and explore the post-apocalyptic world that has been taken over by Lovecraftian creatures.</p>
<p>At the moment, Once Human is only available on PC, but the game will be available on Android and iOS devices come April 2025, and the versions will be cross-compatible.</p>
<p>For those who are interested in joining Once Human's current cross-platform test, it is currently live and will be available to participate in until March 30. Players across Europe, Japan, and North America can sign up to participate. To sign up, you can either <a href="https://research.easebar.com/htmls/863iir/paper.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">complete a survey</a> within Once Human or join through the official social media for Once Human. There are limited slots for this test, so make sure you sign up quickly.</p>
<p>For those who want to test the game on mobile, iOS users will have to participate through TestFlight, while Android users will have to install the game's APK from the official website. Of course, for those on PC, the process is significantly easier, and you can jump into the test via the game's official client once you've been added to the test.</p>
<p>It's also been confirmed that the cross-platform test will be using the current global server environment from the PC version of Once Human. This means that those joining on mobile or PC will get access to all Scenarios, as well as the Visional Wheel and Lunar Oracle.</p>
<p>In addition to the cross-platform test, pre-registration is now live for the mobile version of Once Human. The full launch of the mobile version is scheduled for an unmentioned date in April 2025. You can<a href="https://usw2.nyl.as/t1/129/f42m6hk9tex0ofpxkzu7weoo7/3/c52da950fe9ce2ab511d86047fac03b84befe1d1625a354bd30a7d621e7f76c9" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> pre-register</a> your interest in playing the mobile version of Once Human, where you can then win in-game rewards, which include some great weapons and items that can prove beneficial to your journey. You can also try your luck by pre-registering, as you'll be entered into a draw to win an iPhone 16 Pro Max.</p>
<p>Since its release, Once Human has performed very well and has received a multitude of updates, including specific PvP Scenarios and<a href="https://wccftech.com/once-human-august-update-out-includes-animal-ranching/"> Animal Ranching</a>, for those who prefer to have a little bit of a farm life in the game.</p>

But it is a step up from the 2022 RPGs in that it’s more colorful, uses smaller environments to get more details and textures on screen, and at least in the trailer, it looks like it’s running better than <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet</em> do, too. I’m open to conversations about whether <em>Legends: Z-A </em>looks bad, but I feel like anyone who thinks it looks <em>worse</em> than the ugly open world of Paldea probably hasn’t booted up <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet </em>in a minute or is wearing rose-colored glasses. The side-by-side comparisons are pretty damning.</p><p>For all the discussion happening in the <em>Pokémon </em>fandom, <em>Legends: Z-A </em>feels like a calculated pivot away from the pitfalls of the series’ recent open-world entries. It’s focusing on a smaller world by taking place entirely in Lumiose City, which means we’ll hopefully not be subject to the same framerate culling and texture pop-in that plagued <em>Legends: Arceus </em>and <em>Scarlet</em> / <em>Violet</em>. But even if it’s a technical step up earned through careful planning, does <em>Legends: Z-A</em> beat the ugly artstyle accusations? That’s the question fans can’t seem to agree on.</p><p>I’m still interested in some of the mechanical changes <em>Legends: Z-A </em>is implementing like real-time battles, but the longer I’ve thought about it, the more I’m disappointed that visually, the <em>Legends</em> subseries isn’t following in the superior footsteps of <em>Legends: Arceus</em>. Yes, <em>Arceus</em> had some of the same technical troubles that impacted <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet</em>, but it was generally pretty to look at because it adopted a colorful cel-shaded look. Seeing <em>Legends: Z-A </em>fall in step with <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet </em>is a bummer because moving away from the open-zone structure could have, in theory, given Game Freak the chance to focus on smaller environments with some visual flair and personality. <em>Sword </em>and <em>Shield</em> was the last game that featured (primarily) smaller environments, and it had some real standout towns that popped on screen and had a real sense of place. I look back at the city of Ballonlea, which is adorned with colorful, bioluminescent mushrooms, as a reminder that Game Freak can create gorgeous environments when it scales back. Lumiose City looks better than anything in <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet</em>, but if it were more stylized, it could look even better.</p><p>Hopefully, we’ll see something more visually striking between now and when <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A </em>launches on Switch later this year. Until then, at least I haven’t seen anyone <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/c0l58j/why_is_this_ok/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/c0l58j/why_is_this_ok/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">getting mad about the trees.</a></span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In the post, they answered over a dozen fan questions about how the upcoming open-world stealth game will perform on consoles, specs needed on PC, upscaling and raytracing options, and more. And in this new post, Ubisoft confirmed that <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> on Steam won’t, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-connect-steam-assassin-s-creed-valhalla-1849809946&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-connect-steam-assassin-s-creed-valhalla-1849809946">like past many Ubisoft PC games</a></span>, require players to download and install Ubisoft Connect.</p><p>So yes, here’s the good news: According to Ubisoft, you won’t need to muck about with a separate launcher when playing <em>Shadows </em>via Steam. The company says that <em>Shadows </em>includes a “lite embedded version” of Ubisoft Connect in it. </p><p>However, you’ll still need to link your Steam account to a Ubisoft Connect account to play <em>Shadows</em>. Ubisoft promises this is a “one-time” thing and once you link the accounts you will be good to go, but it is still a weird barrier between Steam users and the game. And for those worried that this means you have to be online to play <em>Shadows</em>, that’s not the case. Ubisoft confirmed you only need an internet connection to install the game. Then you can play offline. </p><p>Now for some bad news: Steam Deck users won’t be playing <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> at launch. In today’s tech Q&amp;A, Ubisoft very bluntly responded to a question about <em>Shadows </em>on Steam Deck with: </p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>At launch, the game will not be compatible with Steam Deck, due to the fact it is below our minimum specs for PC.</p></blockquote><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/steam-deck-2024-big-games-unplayable-space-marine-2-pc-1851669933?_gl=1*1lj6v08*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MDc2NTY5Ni4xNy4xLjE3NDA3NjY1NjAuNjAuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/steam-deck-2024-big-games-unplayable-space-marine-2-pc-1851669933?_gl=1*1lj6v08*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MDc2NTY5Ni4xNy4xLjE3NDA3NjY1NjAuNjAuMC4w">This isn’t surprising, as more and more games are struggling to run on the aging Steam Deck</a></span>. However, the fact that Ubisoft specified it won’t be playable <em>at launch</em> is interesting. Perhaps in a future update the company will add some Steam Deck options to make it playable on Valve’s portable PC. But if you don’t have a computer that can play <em>Shadows</em> and rely on a Steam Deck to play PC games, I’d hold off on buying the new <em>Assassin’s Creed.</em></p><p><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> is nearly here. The game launches on Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC on March 20. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But one trio of monsters that fans were really hoping to see did NOT appear: the elemental monkeys Panpour, Pansage, and Pansear.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Why are fans so hung up on the monkey trio? It's a bit complicated. The three monkeys and their evolutions have been a part of an increasingly shrinking list of Pokémon that are currently unavailable in any Nintendo Switch game. If you want to truly catch 'em all, you still can, by transferring them from other Pokémon games pre-Switch to Pokémon Home. But at the moment, the following Pokémon are unavailable for capture natively in any Nintendo Switch Pokémon game:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Panpour</li><li>Pansage</li><li>Pansear</li><li>Simipour</li><li>Simisage</li><li>Simisear</li><li>Patrat</li><li>Watchog</li><li>Furfrou</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">This list used to be much longer, but Game Freak added a ton of new Pokémon in the DLC for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet that culled the list down to these nine. What's more, the trailer we saw yesterday showed both Patrat and Furfrou, confirming these two at least will be available in Legends: Arceus. And since Watchog evolves from Patrat, it's a safe bet it will be in the game too. So that just leaves the three monkeys.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The elemental monkey trio was first introduced in Pokémon Black and White, and are somewhat beloved by fans due to the unique way the player obtains them. In Black and White, the first Gym the player encounters will use a typing that the player's starter Pokémon is weak against. However, if the player visits a certain person in the Dreamyard, they'll receive the monkey that has an advantage against that Gym, making it easier to tackle. Their designs are also memorable for being based on the "Hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil" wise monkeys of Japanese folklore.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/28/pokmon-legends-z-a-releases-in-late-2025-3-1740761188956.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Furfrou lets out a lakeside howl in Pokemon Legends Z-A.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Realistically, the odds of the monkey trio showing up in Legends: Z-A are actually pretty good. It would be very surprising for Game Freak to leave them out of what could possibly be the last major Pokémon game on Nintendo Switch, and given that they appeared in the Kalos region PokéDex back in the day, it only makes sense for them to still be there in Z-A.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even if the monkeys are included, there's still one other problem Game Freak needs to solve: Spinda. Spinda is catchable on Nintendo Switch in Brilliant Diamond/Shining Pearl, but due to an error in how the game reads its spot patterns, it cannot be transferred to Pokémon Home. You can still get a Spinda from pre-Switch games transferred to Home, but the weird stuck nature of Spindas on Switch means that the dizzy little bear could probably use a functional Z-A appearance too, if Game Freak feels amenable.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-first-trailer-reveals-rooftop-running-gameplay-and-late-2025-release-window">first real look at Pokémon Legends Z-A</a> gave us a lot to take in, and we're still dissecting the footage to find all the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-fans-are-frantically-trying-to-work-out-how-pokemon-legends-z-a-connects-to-other-pokemon-games">connections between this and other, past Pokémon games</a>.

Here’s how it works: once you reach level 25 on a class, you can buy a Prestige Level that will unlock a unique Prestige Perk.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Choose them wisely,” Focus and Saber said, “because you won’t be able to change your selected Prestige Perks before unlocking the four Prestige Levels.” On top of that power boost, each class will have a unique cosmetic reward that emphasizes the class’ iconic armour part.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Space Marine 2 will get Public Test Servers (PTS) on Steam only in March before Patch 7 comes out. This will give fans early access to the upcoming features and the chance to share feedback so the developers can refine the content ahead of launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Focus and Saber teased the upcoming launch of Horde mode, a feature Space Marine 2 players have been looking forward to ever since the game came out last year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“You’re very eager to get more info on the Horde Mode, it’s one of our top priorities right now,” Focus and Saber said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“One thing we can say is that it will be very different from the Space Marine 1 Horde Mode, and that there are surprises we can’t wait for you to find out about.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Once we get really interesting things to show you about it, we will do it!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Bear with us.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the same post, Focus and Saber also <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-dev-stamps-out-live-service-game-talk-amid-backlash-to-fomo-community-events">stamped out live service game talk amid a backlash to 'FOMO' Community Events</a>.

If all goes well, your character should be able to cling onto a target's back, which leads to a minigame of sorts.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4451992-monster-hunter-wilds-mount-monsters-guide-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4451992" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4451992-monster-hunter-wilds-mount-monsters-guide-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4451992"></a><figcaption>Get ready to hop and wallop a giant beast on the head.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4451992-monster-hunter-wilds-mount-monsters-guide-1.jpg"></figure><h3>What to do once you're on top of a monster?</h3><p>Assuming you're able to mount a monster in Monster Hunter Wilds, don't celebrate prematurely. First, take note of the control prompts and information on your screen:</p><ul><li>The upper-left corner of the screen shows your stamina meter. It will gradually drain while you're riding the creature.</li><li>Monsters will attempt to buck and toss you away. If this occurs, press and hold the brace button to minimize stamina depletion.</li><li>You can press the attack buttons to strike a monster's body parts. Once you've opened a wound, press the corresponding prompt--i.e. R1, RB, or Left Shift, depending on your control scheme. This lets you perform a Focus Strike that causes tremendous damage.</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4451993-monster-hunter-wilds-mount-monsters-guide-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4451993" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4451993-monster-hunter-wilds-mount-monsters-guide-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4451993"></a><figcaption>Strike a wounded body part while you're mounted to perform a flashy finisher.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4451993-monster-hunter-wilds-mount-monsters-guide-2.jpg"></figure><p>Apart from attacking outright, you may continue to move around a monster's body to find a specific weak spot that you want to target. You may also cause it to ram into walls, pillars, and other obstacles to temporarily stun it.</p><p>That does it for our guide on how to mount monsters in Monster Hunter Wilds.

                <p>4A Games and 4A Games Ukraine might sound like part of the same organization, but as the Metro developer recently clarified, that's not actually the case anymore. In <a href="https://www.4a-games.com.mt/4a-dna/2025/2/28/4a-games-studio-update" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">an update</a>, 4A Games explained that though the majority of its workers remain in Ukraine, the other studio 4A Games Ukraine (now known as Reburn) is now a completely separate entity.</p><p dir="ltr">In the update, 4A explains that the original founders of the studio formed 4A Games Limited to create a new HQ in Malta with 50 members of their team back in 2014. When Metro Exodus was released in 2019, 4A Games Limited created a separate studio in Kyiv and hired roughly 50 employees from their existing Kyiv office 4A Games Ukraine, which then spun off into its own separate studio no longer affiliated with 4A or the Metro franchise, now called Reburn.</p>

      </div>
<p dir="ltr">This name and studio confusion stems from Reburn's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metro-dev-4a-games-rebrands-to-reburn-announces-new-sci-fi-fps-la-quimera/1100-6529689/">recent announcement</a> of its new project, La Quimera. It's described as a first-person shooter with a "heavy focus" on narrative, world design, and characters. The game's world and story have been created by Nicolas Winding Refn, best known for directing Drive and The Neon Demon, and it draws from Latin-American folklore.</p><p dir="ltr">4A Games was formed back in 2006 by former developers from Stalker: Shadow of Chernobyl studio GSC Game World. They are best-known for the Metro series, based on a series of novels by Russian author Dmitry Glukhovsky.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/islands-and-trains-steam-next-fest-demo-impressions-pc<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I was almost <em>scared </em>to open up<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/nextfest" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Steam's Next Fest tab</a> earlier this week. There are simply too many demos of too many good games going around; how would I even know where to start? Thankfully, Steam instantly made a very helpful suggestion: maybe try <em>this </em>demo first, since it's for a game you already have wishlisted.</p><p>That game is called <em>Islands And Trains</em>, and between the name and the screenshots you can probably tell where this is going. If you can't, here is perhaps the best elevator pitch for a video game I have ever seen:</p><blockquote><p>Craft tiny railway dioramas in a stress-free island sandbox. No rules or timers - just design, build, and enjoy.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>I don't know about you, but I <em>love</em> little trains. I hate stress, I love islands, I dig sandbox creation games. I hate rules and timers, and I really enjoy designing, building and...enjoying. So I smashed that install button, and 100MB later I was playing.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Islands &amp; Trains - New Teaser Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/x8w-xEMce10?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Turns out, in a rare W for truth in advertising, <em>Islands And Trains</em> is everything it says it is! Imagine the free-form construction of "<em>Islanders</em>, <em>Dorfromantik</em> and <em>Townscaper</em>"--and I'm not being reductive here,<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1957760/Islands__Trains/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> those are three games the developers list as their primary inspiration on their own Steam page</a>--but here you also build a little rail network and get to watch little trains toot around towns, through tunnels and under waterfalls.</p><p>The sandbox toolkit is snappy, the cosmetic options are plentiful (if restricted, since this is a demo) and everything looks <em>gorgeous</em>. I really appreciate the depth you can get to here; you're responsible for shaping everything, from the terrain of the island itself to its hills, forests and waterways, so even if you hate trains (though how could you?), I think you could still find joy just building an island with a town and some rivers and farms on it.</p><p>Though by doing that you'd miss out on the game's best part: after building a little train, you get to control the train with a little throttle on the right of the screen, which is such a tiny flourish. As a model train diorama enjoyer, it’s been a delight every time I'd nudged it to start, then nudged it to stop perfectly outside of a little train station that doesn't even have any people on it, but which I imagine has people on it, because I also built them little streets and a little school and a little football pitch behind the school that looks out over the ocean.</p><p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1957760/Islands__Trains/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Islands And Trains'</em> release date is TBA</a>, but being a sandbox game this demo lets you mess around with most of it; it's just the variety of options that are limited, so most of the stuff you can do here is the same as the full release, you just don't get as many buildings, terrain, climate or train options as you will when it's finally out.</p><figure><figcaption>There's the train controls on the bottom-right! You get to build everything AND move the little train!</figcaption></figure></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
