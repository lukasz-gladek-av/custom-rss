                <p>Valve released a new Steam Client Beta today, and it's focused on adding accessibility options to Big Picture Mode on PCs and SteamOS on handheld PCs like the Lenovo Legion Go S and Steam Deck.</p><p>Specifically, it is adding a UI scaling option, toggles for high contrast mode and reduced motion, and additional screen reader and color filter settings. These options can now all be found in an Accessibility sub-menu that's now part of SteamOS and Big Picture Mode's settings menus. The image below shows off exactly what this new menu looks like. With these additions, Valve now recommends that Steam users who require features such as screen readers use Big Picture Mode instead of the standard Steam client.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1849/18498836/4517851-a042795ddde3e336612076287008ff9520af6575.png" data-ref-id="1300-4517851" data-ratio="0.70100143061516" data-width="1398" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1849/18498836/4517851-a042795ddde3e336612076287008ff9520af6575.png" data-ref-id="1300-4517851"></a><figcaption>The new SteamOS accessibility menu with options for UI scaling, high contrast mode, reduced motion, color filters, and scren reader settings.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1849/18498836/4517851-a042795ddde3e336612076287008ff9520af6575.png"></figure><p>SteamOS specifically will see particular benefits from the Screen Reader and Color Filter updates. For the Screen Reader, players will now be able to adjust its pitch, speed, and volume and consistently hear it read out each item being highlighted. Meanwhile, there are now filters called Greyscale, Invert Brightness, and Invert Colors that people can use to adjust how both Steam and games are displayed while using SteamOS.</p><p>All of these features are still currently part of the Steam Client Beta, and Valve has not shared when exactly they will exit the beta. It is committing to improving accessbility options on Steam, teasing that "these new settings are only the first available of the accessibility features we're working on," <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements?snr=1_2108_9__2107" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in a blog post</a>. Steam has also added tools that allow game developers to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steam-just-made-it-easier-for-devs-to-promote-their-games-accessibility-features/1100-6531047/" data-ref-id="1100-6531047">highlight the accessibility features</a> in their games.</p>

              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>Blizzard recently blew the lid off <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft</a>'s upcoming 11.2 update, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-the-war-withins-ghosts-of-karesh-update-is-the-tbc-sequel-we-didnt-know-we-needed/1100-6532500/" data-ref-id="1100-6532500">Ghosts of K'aresh</a>, and players are now convinced a new specialization for Demon Hunters could be in the cards.</p><p dir="ltr">In the official Ghosts of K'aresh preview video, a moment around the two minutes and 38 second mark with three Demon Hunters sticks out. The Demon Hunter on the left looks to be Havoc (DPS) spec, while the one on the right, wearing bulkier armor, certainly looks like a stand-in for a Vengeance (tank) Demon Hunter. The third Demon Hunter, placed prominently in the middle of the screen, is decked out in Void-themed armor and wielding warglaives of distinct purple Void energy.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CE8zcDHcMA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2CE8zcDHcMA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The inclusion of a Void-powered Demon Hunter is certainly raising eyebrows, especially when combined with a datamined ability (via <a href="https://www.icy-veins.com/wow/news/did-blizzard-just-tease-a-new-demon-hunter-spec-nearly-a-decade-after-their-introduction/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Icy Veins</a>) from the upcoming 11.2 patch client literally labeled as "Demon Hunter Metamorphosis Void." That has led players to believe Blizzard is teasing a third Void-focused spec that could be coming soon.</p><p dir="ltr">It certainly seems possible that Demon Hunters will receive a new way to play either as part of Ghosts of K'aresh, in a subsequent patch, or with the arrival of the game's next Midnight expansion. It's worth noting the 11.2 update will introduce a new raid, Manaforge: Omega, which includes an encounter against a mysterious council of Void-powered Demon Hunters. With that in mind, it's easy to see how the game's existing Demon Hunters could find new power in the wake of defeating this council.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard isn't announcing anything at the moment, but it wouldn't be the first time a class has received a third specialization out of the blue. During Dragonflight, Blizzard added a third, unannounced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-dragonflight-new-augmentation-spec-is-a-first-for-blizzard-mmo-in-more-ways-than-one/1100-6515232/" data-ref-id="1100-6515232">specialization for Evokers called Augmentation</a> that had ties to the game's ongoing story, with a raid boss even using Augmentation spells like Ebon Might prior to the specialization being officially added. Demon Hunters are currently the only class in the game with just two specializations, so receiving a third one with ties to the game's current story would make complete sense.</p><p dir="ltr">For now, players will have to wait and see what Blizzard is cooking up, but there are still plenty of other features coming in Ghosts of K'aresh for players to be excited about. The update will serve as a surprising The Burning Crusade sequel, as players travel to the destroyed Ethereal homeworld to stop Dimensius, the largest boss in WoW history. In addition to a new zone, dungeon, and raid, players will earn an upgradeable artifact cloak that can be used to transform into an energy form in order to interact with the world in new ways. Ghosts of K'aresh will additionally add new asynchronous multiplayer features reminiscent of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-next-major-update-will-add-one-of-dark-souls-most-innovative-features/1100-6532496/" data-ref-id="1100-6532496">Dark Souls to WoW's Delves</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">As for when WoW's most anticipated new feature, player housing, will arrive, Blizzard still hasn't said. However, in a recent hands-on preview, we said even the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/we-tried-wow-player-housing-and-the-possibilities-already-feel-endless/1100-6531566/" data-ref-id="1100-6531566">early version of WoW's player housing system</a> already offers near-endless possibilities.</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, for the second week in a row, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> takes pole position by shifting another 134,900 copies in the week of 9th to 16th June. That's over 120k more than the next closest competitor, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/fantasy_life_i_the_girl_who_steals_time">Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time</a>, which sold another 11,217 copies this week. Absolutely nothing to sneeze at. We wouldn't be surprised if it hit a million next week.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/rune_factory_guardians_of_azuma">Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</a>'s Switch 1 version continues to do well, selling over 50k units since launch (almost another 10k this week), with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_kart_8_deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/minecraft">Minecraft</a> rounding out the top five.</p>
<p>Both <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Breath of the Wild</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Tears of the Kingdom</a>'s Switch 2 Editions have also made the top ten again, with BOTW edging out its sequel by a <em>single</em> sale. And aside from <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/elden_ring_nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>, it's an entire Nintendo sweep.</p>
<p>No newcomers this week, so let's look at the full breakdown for the top ten:</p>

<p>The big headline with the hardware here is that the Switch 2 has sold over a million units <em>already</em>. With a further 153,205 consoles selling this week, that's a total of 1.1 million Switch 2s sold in Japan alone. That's extremely impressive.</p>
<p>In terms of the Switch 1, it's still selling pretty well, shifting over 13k units this week alone. However, the PS5 (combined OG model, Pro, and Digital units) has surpassed it, selling over 15k consoles between its three SKUs.</p>

                <p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is proving to be a worthy successor to the original Switch, offering more processing power, a better display, and plenty of new functionality. Online multiplayer is also better on Switch 2 thanks to new features like Game Chat, Game Sharing, and faster download speeds. With all that new online functionality, you might be wondering if you should use a VPN with your Switch 2 when jumping online. Unlike Xbox Series X or PlayStation 5, which aren’t portable and typically connect to the same router every day, you can travel the world with your Switch 2, connecting to public Wi-Fi. As such, it might seem worthwhile to use a VPN with your Switch 2, though there are reasons to remain skeptical about their performance.</p><h2>Using a VPN on Switch 2</h2><p dir="ltr">First things first--yes, you can use a VPN on Switch 2. However, it’s not as straightforward as using a VPN on your PC. There’s no built-in VPN app for Switch 2, meaning you’ll need to either create a hotspot from another supported device or set up a VPN on your router. The latter can be tricky for beginners, and the process varies slightly depending on your specific VPN service.</p><p dir="ltr">If you’re thinking of setting up a VPN on your router, consider using ExpressVPN. The company offers its own line of Aircove routers that come preconfigured to route all traffic on your network through an ExpressVPN server. There are two models available: the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09VBXLGJR?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">$190 Aircove</a> and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CM6VL4PS?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">$170 Aircove Go</a>. Both feature WiFi 6 support and come bundled with a 30-day ExpressVPN free trial. Any device with WiFi or Ethernet connectivity can connect to the Aircoves, including the Switch 2, your PCs, other gaming consoles, smartphones, and more.</p><p dir="ltr">If you’re traveling, you can make use of a personal Wi-Fi hotspot. While smartphones are the most commonly used hotspot devices, most cannot natively share their VPN connection via a mobile connection. Instead, you’ll need to create a hotspot on your laptop or MacBook and connect your Switch 2 to it that way. Just enable network sharing on your device, connect to your VPN, then connect your Switch 2 to your laptop’s hotspot. The process varies slightly based on your VPN provider, but most offer detailed walkthroughs. For an example of what this might entail, check out <a href="https://www.expressvpn.com/support/vpn-setup/share-vpn-connection-windows/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">this tutorial from ExpressVPN</a>.</p><h2>Is Using VPN On Switch 2 Against Terms of Service?</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4517193-mariokartworld.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4517193" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4517193-mariokartworld.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4517193"></a><figcaption>Mario Kart World</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4517193-mariokartworld.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Just because you <em>can</em> use a VPN with Switch 2, that doesn't mean you <em>should. </em>A VPN can, theoretically, make your Switch 2's internet connection more private and secure. But there are some serious considerations to make before running your data through a remote server. For one, your speeds might be slower since VPNs encrypt your data and funnel it to another server, which takes time. More importantly, using a VPN can violate Nintendo's Terms of Service (TOS).</p><p dir="ltr">For example, using a VPN to circumvent regional pricing restrictions is against Nintendo's TOS, and various online games also restrict VPN usage. Using one can result in a ban if you're caught--or worse. Nintendo can remotely--and permanently--brick consoles for users who break certain rules outlined in the Switch 2 End User License Agreement. Because these regulations vary widely by game and region, there’s no one-size-fits-all answer.</p><p dir="ltr">In general, it's not necessary to use a VPN on Switch 2 if you’re sticking to single-player games or diving into casual online matches at home. The only possible edge case is if you’re worried about sketchy public Wi-Fi networks at cafes, airports, and hotels--but even then, it might be best to not connect to public networks if you're worried, or even play in Airplane mode. Still, if you're intent on using a VPN with your Switch, just make sure you deactivate it before using the eShop and confirm that using a VPN is not against an online game's terms of service.</p><h2>Other benefits of a VPN</h2><p>While it's hard to recommend a VPN for Switch 2 in most instances, the privacy and security benefits of a VPN can be helpful for other devices. Many VPN services also offer a wealth of other features like password managers, ad blockers, cloud storage space, identity theft alerts, and more. These won't be usable with your Switch 2, but they can be helpful for logging into your Nintendo Account on your PC or smartphone and monitoring your account for any security breaches. Luckily, most VPNs are affordable, costing just a few bucks a month. You can check out a few of the most popular VPNs at the links below.</p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-four-discontinued-donkey-kong-lego-sets-restocked-at-amazon/1100-6532560/">All Four Discontinued Donkey Kong Lego Sets Restocked At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-preorder-nintendo-switch-2/1100-6530595/">Donkey Kong Bananza Amiibo Costs $30, Available To Preorder Now</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-carries-nintendo-games-again-including-new-switch-2-exclusives/1100-6532451/">Amazon Carries Nintendo Games Again, Including New Switch 2 Exclusives</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-spider-man-magic-the-gathering-trading-card-restock-amazon-preorder/1100-6529819/">Marvel's Spider-Man Magic: The Gathering Preorders Restocked At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-bogo-50-off-movie-sale-includes-brand-new-4k-blu-ray-steelbooks-box-sets/1100-6529351/">Amazon BOGO 50% Off Movie Sale Includes Brand-New 4K Steelbooks &amp; Box Sets</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-book-sale-buy-one-get-one-50-percent-off-fantasy-sci-fi-horror-novel-box-sets/1100-6527091/">Amazon B1G1 50% Off Book Sale - Popular New Novels, Box Sets, And All-Time Greats</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/8bitdo-nintendo-switch-2-controller-compatibility-how-to-guide-best-switch-2-controller-deals/1100-6532267/">8BitDo's Best Controllers Get Switch 2 Support - How To Set Them Up And Why It's A Big Deal</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-5440-page-complete-history-of-middle-earth-box-set-is-only-106-at-amazon/1100-6526926/">The 5,440-Page Complete History Of Middle Earth Box Set Is Only $106 At Amazon</a></li>   </ul> </div>

			<p>Xbox is reportedly working on its Classics programs together with the team behind a popular emulator to bring original Xbox and 360 games to PC and Game Pass, complete with enhancements.</p>
<p>In a new video shared today, known Xbox Game Pass leaker <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@extas1s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eXstas1s</a> revealed that Xbox is working with the Xenia Canary development team on a sort of Classics program to create an emulation platform that will bring old games to Series X and S, PC, Game Pass, and xCloud, complete with visual and performance enhancements. The launch of this program will coincide with the brand's 25th anniversary, and games will reportedly launch in multiple waves that will be announced throughout 2026. Among the games that will launch via this new emulation platform will be Fable 2, Skate 3, Gears of War 3, and Batman: Arkham Asylum. Many other titles, however, are also under consideration, with the team evaluating potential technical and licensing issues.</p>
<p><iframe title="EXCLUSIVA 🔥 XBOX + XENIA se UNEN para revivir juegos de XBOX 360 en PC, nube y GAME PASS" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uub8TghbVSg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Considering how much importance Microsoft placed on backward compatibility in the past few years, what Exstas1s revealed today sounds reasonable enough, and pretty exciting as well, as this program would bring to PC games that are not available to play natively, like the aforementioned Fable 2, and the original versions of Ninja Gaiden and Ninja Gaiden 2, to name a few. Still, we must take everything with a grain of salt until an official announcement is made.</p>
<p>Though we don't know if Microsoft is indeed working on this Classics program, we do know the company is hard at work on its next-generation hardware. Together with <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-announces-multi-year-deal-with-amd-to-power-next-gen-devices/">AMD</a>, Microsoft is building gaming silicon that will deliver the next generation of graphics innovation with better visual quality, immersive gameplay, and improvements offered by AI while maintaining compatibility with the existing library of Xbox Games.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-out-now-after-a-strong-head-start-weekend/">Dune: Awakening</a> has only been out for a little more than a week (even longer if you've been playing since its premium early access release), and players are already looking towards what's coming next for the game.</p>
<p>It'll still be a while before Funcom releases any major content updates, but one element we can expect, according to the studio's community manager, Ignasis Miró Sastre, is that the team will add more "<em>Hagga-Basin-like</em><em> maps</em>" in future updates.</p>
<p>Writing on the Dune: Awakening Discord server (spotted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-new-maps-hagga-basin">Eurogamer</a>), Sastre wrote, "<em>I think Joel kinda leaked in the past that we plan to add more Hagga-Basin-like maps in the future as part of new content.</em>"</p>
<p>Hagga Basin is the starting area in Dune: Awakening, where players can start finding their <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/dune-awakening-tips-for-surviving-arrakis/">sand legs</a> before traveling further into the desert, and eventually to the deep desert and the game's more PvP-focused areas.</p>
<p>It's an area of the game that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1lcojf7/to_the_surprise_of_nobody/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">players have a strong fondness for</a>, if only because it doesn't have the same potential for the kinds of horror stories players have experienced with a trip into the deep desert. A new area like Hagga Basin would be more than welcomed by Dune: Awakening players, to have that same well-curated exploration on Arrakis that Hagga Basin delivers in a fresh way.</p>
<p>And it'll feel even better since it'll likely be free, as Sastre later comments that "<em>Content will come as part of free updates, as far as I am aware. If it ever comes as part of a paid package, I imagine it would be because it's something big. But for now I think we have said we plan to release content for free, and then optional stuff via optional DLCs so we can actually afford rent, lights, and pineapple on pizza</em>."</p>
<p>Hopefully we'll be able to hear about whatever the next Hagga-Basin-like map is soon, and it wouldn't be the biggest surprise if we did, since the studio also just confirmed in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1lehj35/comment/mymv65a/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">Reddit AMA</a> that it plans to release PvE-focused content "<em>every 3/4 months</em>."</p>
<p>"<em>Each of our major updates will always continue new story content and new PvE content, which will release at the same time as our DLCs come out,</em>" Funcom wrote in response to a question about PvE plans. "<em>Our goal is to have these release every 3/4 months</em>."</p>
<p>So for now, we can look to sometime in September/October for when the next major batch of content is out for Dune: Awakening. Though, the studio also stipulates <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1lehj35/comment/myn27y3/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">elsewhere in the AMA</a> that while it will always communicate its plans for what's next in the game with the community, it might not necessarily publish a static roadmap.</p>
<p>So far, Dune: Awakening is having an incredibly strong launch, with a new concurrent player count of <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1172710/charts/">189,333</a> players that was reached this past weekend. It'll be interesting to see how the game continues to grow with the coming updates.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-third-party-game-launch-sales-report<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new report claims that launch numbers for third-party games available on the newly-released Nintendo Switch 2 aren't great, and that customers seem to be favoring Nintendo's own games rather than those by publishers like Capcom, CD Projekt, and Sega.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/it-was-the-biggest-console-launch" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">The Game Business</a>, around 62% of physical Switch 2 game sales in the US during the console's launch week were for first-party games, and that doesn't include the&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World&nbsp;</em>console bundle, which comes complete with a digital copy of the racer.</p>

<p>The Game Business notes that "one third-party publisher" (who the publication doesn't name) referred to Switch 2 launch sales as "below our lowest estimates", so it sounds like non-Nintendo publishers releasing games on the Switch 2 aren't happy with sales so far.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-third-party-launch-numbers-cyberpunk-2077.jpg?itok=us_KQx7O 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-third-party-launch-numbers-cyberpunk-2077.jpg?itok=MWkIhCl- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Cyberpunk 2077&nbsp;</em>is one of the Nintendo Switch 2's third-party launch titles.</figcaption></figure><p>As The Game Business points out, while Switch 2 third-party numbers might look better than the original Switch's figures (81% physical first-party during the launch month), those figures should come with some caveats.</p>

<p>More third-party games launched alongside the Switch 2 - thirteen versus the original console's five - and the Switch 2 has also <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/switch-2-fastest-selling-nintendo-console" rel="nofollow">sold more consoles than the original machine did</a> during the same time period, so the higher percentage doesn't tell the whole story.</p>

<p>It's difficult to know what, if anything, these figures portend. Many of the Switch 2's third-party titles are several years old, meaning a lot of people will probably already have had their fill of them.</p>

<p>Additionally, the Switch 2's strange Game Key Card system, which means that many publishers don't actually include full game files on their Switch 2 carts, may have put off buyers from picking up games on Nintendo's platform. It's difficult to say without more in-depth qualitative data, of course.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mario-kart-world-nintendo-switch-2-third-party-launch-sales.jpg?itok=TXSQb1zp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mario-kart-world-nintendo-switch-2-third-party-launch-sales.jpg?itok=c5GTUjW7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Mario Kart World&nbsp;</em>has done predictably well for Nintendo, even if third-party sales are floundering.</figcaption></figure><p>As newer Switch 2 games and third-party exclusives (assuming such releases are planned by publishers) begin to arrive, we'll probably get a more complete picture of how people feel about Switch 2 third-party titles.</p>

<p>Still, Nintendo probably isn't too worried; it's always the company's first-party releases that do the best on Nintendo hardware, and as long as games like<i>&nbsp;Mario Kart World</i>, the two&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>Switch 2 Editions, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/donkey-kong-bananza-switch-2" rel="nofollow">the upcoming&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/donkey-kong-bananza-switch-2" rel="nofollow">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>&nbsp;</em>enjoy strong sales, Nintendo probably won't sweat too much.</p>

Absolutely,” Corso told the <em>BBC</em>. “We understand that they’re trying to bring some new stuff onto these releases, and if you’ve gotta make cuts, you’ve gotta make cuts. I don’t know why it had to be us, I feel like our song was really good on there, and it did really well.”</p><p>“I kind of get it,” said Mitchell, “That skating feels a little bit more like the punk side and we’re not a punk band, but I think that’s what makes a cool soundtrack, is a collection, being different.”</p><p>If the band wants to blame anyone, they can directly blame Tony Hawk himself. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tony-hawk-personally-made-changes-to-pro-skater-34-soundtracks-because-he-wants-you-to-discover-new-music&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tony-hawk-personally-made-changes-to-pro-skater-34-soundtracks-because-he-wants-you-to-discover-new-music" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In March</a></span>, the skateboard legend and star of the franchise explained that he was the one who made the call on removing some classic songs from the upcoming remaster in order to replace them with new tracks. </p><p>“It was my choice to pick some different songs by the same artists featured in <em>THPS3+4</em>. I’m hoping that discovery is half the fun, and a big reason that these soundtracks resonated in the first place. So listen and enjoy the ride.”</p><p>There is, as far as we know, not a single Alien Ant Farm song in <em>THPS 3+4</em>. So either Activision and Tony Hawk included something like “Movies” in the upcoming remake, or he just doesn’t like Alien Ant Farm very much, and they were totally cut from the game. </p><p>Well, <em>whatever</em>, Mr. Hawk, you can’t stop me from including some Alien Ant Farm in this very post!

		<p>Tougher bosses are starting to appear in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring: Nightreign</a> from today, as new variant Nightlords known as the Everdark Sovereigns emerge in FromSoftware’s multiplayer spin-off to the hit Soulslike.</p>
<p>A new Everdark Sovereign will be added to Limveld each week, a time-limited challenge for players who have defeated the boss in their original form to test themselves against. The reward for defeating them will be Sovereign Sigils that can be exchanged for special Relics, with additional Sigils awarded for the first time you defeat a particular Sovereign.</p>


<p>The First Everdark Sovereign is an enhanced version of Adel, Baron of the Night known as Gaping Jaw, and is now available to play. You have until June 26 9:59 JST / 1:59 BST / 2:59 CEST / 5:59 PM PDT to take him on.</p>
<p>In the next two weeks Sentient Pest and Darkdrift Knight will emerge, while others –&nbsp;Tricephalos, Augur, Equilibrious Beast and Fissure in the Fog – will be added to the rotation at a later date.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that Everdark Sovereigns are only available to battle if you’re playing in online mode.</p>

<p>While good, Elden Ring Nightreign has not gathered the universal acclaim of its predecessor and currently sits on a score of <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/elden-ring-nightreign/">77 on Metacritic.&nbsp;</a> We gave the game a solid<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/28/elden-ring-nightreign-review/"> 7/10 in our review,</a> with Jim saying, “Elden Ring Nightreign is a fun multiplayer offshoot, but it also doesn’t come close to the dizzying heights we’re used to seeing from FromSoftware. It’s an interesting experiment, and I am glad it exists despite my mixed feelings, but it’s a shallow happiness when I expect far more profound experiences from this company.”</p>

<figure><a title="Yakuza 0" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/45f84f9f16719/yakuza-0.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Sega</em></figcaption></figure><p>A new report from Chris Dring's <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/it-was-the-biggest-console-launch?utm_source=post-email-title&amp;publication_id=4150086&amp;post_id=166316380&amp;utm_campaign=email-post-title&amp;isFreemail=true&amp;r=357pt4&amp;triedRedirect=true&amp;utm_medium=email">The Game Business</a> highlights a few sales stats for launch games on the recently-released Switch 2.</p>
<p>According to the article, "most third-party Switch 2 games posted very low numbers" at launch, with the vast majority of players understandably gravitating towards <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>. As per data from NielsenIQ, 86% of physical Switch 2 game sales were first-party, including the MK World bundle. If we exclude the bundle, the result would be 48%.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, for the US, Circana states that 68% of sales were for first-party, excluding the bundle. By comparison, launch sales for the Switch 1 were 89% first-party in the UK and 81% in the US. So yes, while these numbers have dropped, it's important to note that there are far more physical Switch 2 launch games than there were Switch 1 launch games.</p>
<p>The best-selling third-party game was, as most would probably expect, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition</a>. Meanwhile, Sega is the third biggest third-party publisher for the Switch 2 with launch titles including <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-x-shadow-generations">Sonic X Shadow Generations</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-0-directors-cut">Yakuza 0: Director's Cut</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/puyo-puyo-tetris-2s">Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S</a>.</p>
<p>However, one unnamed publisher described initial sales as "below our lowest estimates", despite remarkably strong hardware sales.</p>
<p>It's thought that there could be a few potential reasons behind this. The first is that, as mentioned earlier, most people buy Nintendo consoles to play Nintendo games, first and foremost. The second is that the Switch 2 is backwards compatible, with many Switch 1 titles performing better on the new hardware, thus eliminating the immediate need to buy more new games.</p>
<p>The third is that most third-party games are indeed ports of older games that a lot of folks may have already played. Fourth, the vast majority of third-party titles are Game-Key Cards, which passionate fans have been against from the word go. This may have also contributed to Cyberpunk's higher sales, which notably includes the full game on the cartridge.</p>
<p>And finally, Nintendo's decision to hold back review units of the Switch 2 until the very last moment meant that consumers had no way to gauge just how viable the third-party games would be. Take <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hitman-world-of-assassination-signature-edition">Hitman World of Assassination</a>, for example: a strong game to showcase the Switch 2 on paper, sure, but one that falls short with some pretty dismal frame rate issues.</p>
<p>We'll keep an eye on how sales shake out over the coming months, but with the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> coming out this year from Nintendo, we suspect third-parties may continue to feel the sting for a little while longer.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-powerwash-simulator-2-gameplay-trailer<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>FuturLab has released a brand new&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator 2&nbsp;</em>gameplay trailer, and it shows off some of the game's new features, as well as the little cat you can presumably pet to your heart's content.</p>

<p>Naturally, if you're expecting&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator 2&nbsp;</em>to serve as a significant reinvention of the wheel, you might be disappointed. If, however, you're after more refined and more satisfying cleaning gameplay, it looks like FuturLab has you covered.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rLMus-sx1I" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">new trailer</a> kicks off with the player spraying some filthy structures with the titular power washer, including a teapot-shaped building, a still-operational fairground (surely a safety hazard?), and a car that looks like it desperately needs the TLC.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/powerwash-simulator-2-new-gameplay-trailer-spraying.jpg?itok=brerRuib 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/powerwash-simulator-2-new-gameplay-trailer-spraying.jpg?itok=kwVJKTgC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>PowerWash Simulator 2&nbsp;</em>will bring more of the satisfying cleaning gameplay you know and love.</figcaption></figure><p>While much of the gameplay looks similar to <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/powerwash-simulator" rel="nofollow">the first game</a>,&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator 2&nbsp;</em>will boast some innovations as well.</p>

<p>We get to see the player sitting in a chair on wires to reach harder spots (sorry, cleaning aficionados, but I'm not sure what this contraption is called), and we also get to see a window-cleaning platform extending to help with trickier places.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the trailer, we get to see the player customizing their base by hosing down a piano (which I wouldn't necessarily recommend doing in real life) before rotating it and placing it in their ideal spot. The trailer also shows off&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator 2</em>'s new co-op mode, which will let you take on tough cleaning jobs with a friend.</p>

<p>Finally, and perhaps most excitingly,&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator 2&nbsp;</em>will let you pet Ulysses the cat. Ulysses made an appearance in the original game, but you couldn't pet them, which I think is an actual breach of the law. Thankfully, that egregious oversight has been rectified in the sequel.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/capcom-spotlight-announced-resident-evil-requiem-pragmata<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Capcom has announced a new Spotlight showcase for next week, and you can expect to see new info about some of the company's biggest upcoming releases during the presentation.</p>

<p>As revealed on the official Capcom <a href="https://www.capcom-games.com/showcase/spotlight/en-us/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">website</a>, the new show will air on June 26th (that's next Thursday at time of writing) at 3pm Pacific/6pm Eastern. If you're in Europe, it's going to be a late one for you, unfortunately.</p>

<p>The show will apparently revolve around four Capcom pillars, two of which have yet to be released. You'll be getting new info about&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil Requiem&nbsp;</em>and<i>&nbsp;Pragmata</i>, both of which were <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-state-of-play-june-2025-recap" rel="nofollow">announced</a> during one of this year's Summer Game Fest-adjacent <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/summer-game-fest-2025-recap" rel="nofollow">shows</a>, and new info about&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter 6&nbsp;</em>will also be coming.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/resident-evil-requiem-capcom-showcase.jpg?itok=jZnO8gLD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/resident-evil-requiem-capcom-showcase.jpg?itok=0lIQXwtu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>More&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil Requiem&nbsp;</em>info is coming next week.</figcaption></figure><p>If I had to guess, I'd say we'll probably get some gameplay footage of&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil Requiem</em>, which is currently due to arrive in February next year. As for&nbsp;<em>Pragmata</em>, I wouldn't be surprised if Capcom revealed a release date for the game, which recently got a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/pragmata-preview" rel="nofollow">shot in the arm in the form of a revival</a> after several years of silence.</p>

<p>When it comes to the two already-released games, we'll probably get some more info about upcoming&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter 6&nbsp;</em>DLC fighters, and again, I'd be surprised if we didn't learn what's coming as part of the next&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>Title Update, which will <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-1-release-date" rel="nofollow">follow on from the first in March</a>.</p>

<p>Just in case you missed it, the world of the former recently invaded the latter when demon fighter Akuma <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-street-fighter-6-crossover" rel="nofollow">joined the ranks of&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-street-fighter-6-crossover" rel="nofollow">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>&nbsp;</em>hunters, complete with unique moves and visual effects.</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/games-review/689333/fbc-firebreak-review-xbox-ps5-steam</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fbc-firebreak-is-missing-control%E2%80%99s-weird-charm.1223124/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games-review/689333/fbc-firebreak-review-xbox-ps5-steam<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>With <em>FBC: Firebreak</em>, Remedy Entertainment has entered the world of the first-person co-op shooter. Set in its <em>Control</em> universe — specifically the site of the first game, the brutalist nightmare office called the Oldest House — players control a member of the titular three-person team of the Federal Bureau of Control (FBC), tasked with addressing various containment breaches. Unfortunately, all the aspects that make Remedy’s worlds so intriguing are completely absent in this bare-bones co-op shooter, which offers nothing for either longtime fans or those invested in existing shooters. </p><p>Players in <em>Firebreak </em>are like firefighters or disaster responders, with each member occupying a different role: mechanic, water carrier, electrician. Across five recurring levels, teams must work to stop the spread of corruption, called the Hiss (a mysterious red entity that turns people into raging zombies and other types of creatures). Objectives vary from destroying Post-it notes to fixing fans, all while being assailed by swarms of various nightmare monsters.</p><p><em>Control</em>, the central foundation of Remedy’s wider connected universe that also includes <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23934662/alan-wake-2-review-ps5-xbox-pc">Alan Wake</a></em>, is at its core weird. It’s how Remedy developers have described it — <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/10/07/control-confronts-us-with-a-very-specific-type-of-horror-a-lack-of-control">to me</a> and others — allowing for fluctuations between the terrifying, the quirky, the odd, and the hilarious. The Bureau itself is a government agency tasked with containing bizarre items and reacting to huge and strange world events: for example, a traffic light that, when it flashes red, sends people to different locations, or a fridge that eats people if you stop looking at it.</p><p>In Remedy’s universe, FBC workers document, monitor, and research these sorts of items with the gray-faced enthusiasm of every bored researcher. The number of times the toy duck teleports needs to be logged as much as how many coffee filters need to be replaced in the break room.</p><p>That stone-faced reaction to the weird is only mildly present in <em>Firebreak</em>, with brief interactions with mission provider Hank Wilder, the security chief, detailing bizarre tasks in a slight monotone. Even player character barks demonstrate this. One of the player voice options is called “Pencil Pusher,” who, when receiving friendly fire, screams that such actions “violate office policy.” Health restoration involves characters huddling in a shower together; you can fix equipment by hitting it with a wrench.</p><p>As someone obsessed with <em>Control</em>, I was eagerly anticipating a return — particularly in the shoes of ordinary personnel, rather than the almost godlike head of the agency, Jesse Faden (who you play in <em>Control</em>). But that sense of unease that plays off the quirkiness is not here. The Oldest House and its enemies feel like little more than an aesthetic, or even a kind of mod, for a generic co-op shooter. There is no sense of progression, no overarching goal to which you are working. Levels and tasks repeat. There aren’t even creepy big-level bosses, like the terrors in <em>Control</em>, except in one area. </p><p>You will have seen all the game has to offer within a few hours, since each level has only three or four stages (with each successive stage in the same level taking you further in), and some stages can be completed within three to four minutes. As an example, one stage involves destroying replicating Post-it notes. Once you have destroyed a sufficient number, you rush back to the elevator as a horde descends. The second stage requires the same objective, only this time you gain access to a second area to destroy more notes. The third stage repeats this, only you go further in and face a boss. All end with rushing back. </p><p>While the game offers modifiers — such as harder enemies and corrupting anomalies that can slightly keep you on your toes — the core aspect wears out quickly. I do not feel I am making any headway in clearing out an entire level, since once cleared, there’s no indicator our team made any difference. The only incentive is to obtain better gear. At least the game doesn’t push microtransactions and is quite generous in its rewards, especially on harder difficulties. </p><div><p><cite>Image: Remedy Entertainment</cite></p></div><p>You also level up various roles independently: playing mainly as the mechanic, you will have to start from scratch if you switch to, for example, the electrician role. These roles do feel distinct, as you are given different gear and abilities. The mechanic can almost instantly repair broken equipment, a very useful skill given how many broken machines there are. But the game is filled with various hazards, such as fire and gunk, which the water soaker character — with their water cannon — can negate. </p><p>Shooting feels good, but guns are standard: shotguns, machine guns, pistols. Don’t expect weird weapons like the Service Weapon from <em>Control</em>. This is meat-and-potatoes destruction.</p><p>That’s precisely what disappointed me: ordinary workers in a world where fridges eat people is what made me love <em>Control</em>, and the idea of being able to play one of the lowly workers was exciting. Yet that charm is largely absent. I barely felt part of the FBC and it didn’t seem like I was containing anything.</p><p>In <em>Control</em>, you would clear rooms and see the game world change permanently. Obviously a co-op shooter can’t do things in the exact same way. But why not tie something like this to the host player? If I have to see the same level three times, progressing further each level, why not show some permanent change from a previous run? There’s no indication the world is reacting to the Firebreak team’s efforts.</p><p>In reality, <em>Firebreak</em> feels like one of the multiplayer modes that used to be tacked on to big-budget single-player games (think <em>Mass Effect 3</em>, for example). If players don’t feel like they’re making a difference as part of a team trying to stop an outbreak, why should we bother? The levels are akin to hero-shooter arenas, devoid of the deep lore of a Remedy game. At least with hero shooters, playing against other people keeps play constantly fresh. This felt like it was stale within a few hours, an avocado of a game.</p><p>I genuinely don’t know who <em>Firebreak</em> is for. Longtime fans of <em>Control</em> won’t find collectibles, environmental storytelling, or anything to even read. And those looking for meaningful multiplayer shooters have plenty of options already. This is a strange dim light for a studio that usually produces brilliance.</p><p><sub>FBC: Firebreak <em>is available now on the PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X / S. It’s also available for Game Pass and PlayStation Plus subscribers.</em></sub></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-founders-of-playdead-are-having-a-legal-war-over-who-made-more-of-limbo<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Many moons ago, Danish developers Playdead released bleak platformer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/limbo">Limbo</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wot-i-think-limbo">proved beyond reasonable doubt</a> that Gamez R Art, while also giving a bunch of witless scriveners massive arachnophobia. Today, we learn that one of the studio's co-founders, Arnt Jensen, is suing the other, Dino Patti, amid competing claims about the scale of his contribution to Limbo. Because of course all great things must end in calamity.</p><!--more-->
<p>Our source of this story is Patti himself, who left Playdead in 2017 after the release of the wonderfully awful/awfully wonderful <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/inside">Inside</a>, and is currently boss of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/somerville">Somerville</a> developer Jumpship. He and Jensen have famously not been on great terms for years, but things <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/playdead-co-founder-dino-patti-claims-fellow-co-founder-keeps-legally-threatening-him">came to a boil in late 2024</a>, when Patti published an account of Limbo's development on LinkedIn.</p>
<p>Back in March this year, Jensen argued that the LinkedIn post exaggerates Patti's contribution to Limbo, insisting that "by providing recipients with core insights to the process of developing Limbo, you are falsely giving the impression that you played a significant role, including a creative role, in the development of the game." He also claimed that the post includes an "unauthorised" photo.</p>
<p>For this alleged infringement, Playdead asked for 500,000 Danish kroner or $72,630 as "suitable compensation and reimbursement." Now, Patti has revealed that Playdead's lawyers are taking him to court in a podcast interview this week with Danish site <a href="https://arkaden.dk/nyheder/dino-patti-der-kommer-en-retsag/">Arkaden</a> (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/limbo-and-inside-studios-new-game-is-a-3rd-person-open-world-sci-fi-adventure/">VGC</a>).</p>
<p>For his part, Patti contends that Jensen is trying to delete him from the game's origin story. "Arnt, please stop the bullying. I will not stop being who I am," he declared back in March. "I will never erase my own history. You can't rewrite the past just because of a bad breakup." In the Arkaden podcast, Patti is upbeat about the situation, commenting that it's an opportunity to set the record straight, but with all due respect to the guy, that's the kind of thing you say when you're being sued.</p>
<p>None of this interferes with my eagerness to hear about Playdead's next game, "a third person science fiction adventure set in a remote corner of the universe", which was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/playdead-reveal-art-for-their-secretive-inside-follow-up">revealed in 2017</a>. At the risk of sounding like I'm picking my favourite dad, I've yet to play Somerville, which Malindy Hetfield <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/somerville-review">described</a> as an "interesting, if not particularly deep" spin on the Playdead school of apocalyptic minimalism.</p>
<p>I will ask Playdead and Jumpship for comment.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

A fumbled launch can paint a system as the “loser” of a generation, while a strong one can write its name in the stars. Sometimes you don’t even need an incredible launch line-up; you just need one standout game that gets people to show up in droves to buy your box. Nintendo’s launches have run a wider gamut than those of any other contemporary console maker, from underwhelming to spectacular. Some of its launches have set the stage for those consoles to go on and revolutionize the industry, while others are widely regarded as some of the weakest console launches in the history of video games. With the Switch 2 out this month, we decided to look back at all of Nintendo’s console releases and see what were the company’s best and worst launches. Where does the latest system land on the list? Read on to find out.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="2c8cc2b120ef197e68937245093fe249" data-recommend-id="image://2c8cc2b120ef197e68937245093fe249" data-format="jpg" data-width="1540" data-height="1001" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A white Wii U system." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A white Wii U system." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2c8cc2b120ef197e68937245093fe249" data-recommend-id="image://2c8cc2b120ef197e68937245093fe249" data-format="jpg" data-width="1540" data-height="1001" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A white Wii U system." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Few console launches have become cautionary tales the way the Wii U’s has. Fresh off the incomprehensibly successful Wii, Nintendo had quite the act to follow in 2012. However, the system itself didn’t have much to offer at the outset that you couldn’t find on consoles you probably already had. <em>New Super Mario Bros. U </em>and <em>Nintendo Land </em>were decent exclusives, but the majority of the launch line-up was third-party games that had been out for months or years on the PS3 and 360. The system also launched at the worst possible time. The PS4 and Xbox One were looming, the Wii U was only about as powerful as systems people had been playing since 2005, and unlike the Wii or the Switch, the system’s gimmick was hardly a system-seller. The gamepad was a novel way to try and bring the “second screen” experience to home consoles after the surge of tablets and other mobile devices in the early 2010s, but it didn’t have the immediate appeal of the systems that came before and after.</p><p>I remember when my brother was picking up our Wii U on launch night, and the Walmart cashier (bless her heart) said it was a touchscreen accessory for the original Wii, rather than a new console. There’s nothing quite as damning as the person selling your product not knowing what it is, and that came down to a branding problem above all else. Perhaps that’s why Nintendo went with the numerical naming convention for the Switch 2, rather than something that could have seen it misconstrued as a peripheral. The Wii U never really gained any momentum after it stumbled onto store shelves, even with some excellent games. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="raqxgkid9g5jlh1xf6t0" data-recommend-id="image://raqxgkid9g5jlh1xf6t0" data-format="jpg" data-width="3760" data-height="2110" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A purple GameCube." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A purple GameCube." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="raqxgkid9g5jlh1xf6t0" data-recommend-id="image://raqxgkid9g5jlh1xf6t0" data-format="jpg" data-width="3760" data-height="2110" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A purple GameCube." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Some of Nintendo’s consoles had sparse launch line-ups but were carried by heavy hitters. While <em>Super Smash Bros. Melee </em>loomed just a few weeks post-launch, the GameCube’s actual day-and-date catalog was a bit underwhelming. The lunchbox-shaped console was novel with its quirky design and ugly-as-sin controllers that many people still swear by 24 years later, but its first wave of games was pretty weak. <em>Luigi’s Mansion </em>led the pack alongside <em>Super Monkey Ball</em> and <em>Wave Race: Blue Storm</em>, but most of the history books will remember <em>Melee</em>’s fashionably late arrival as the moment the console’s “real” killer app arrived. Sure, I could count it as one of the most culturally significant games in Nintendo history (even if the company doesn’t want you to view it as such), but to keep things clear and manageable here, I’m only considering actual launch games, not games released throughout a console’s ambiguous “launch window.” The GameCube had some real bona fide classics by the time the Wii launched in 2006, but that first month wasn’t so promising. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="85702e478d2587f7df2dfa96ffcbbd44" data-recommend-id="image://85702e478d2587f7df2dfa96ffcbbd44" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1373" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Switch 2 in its dock." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Switch 2 in its dock." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="85702e478d2587f7df2dfa96ffcbbd44" data-recommend-id="image://85702e478d2587f7df2dfa96ffcbbd44" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1373" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Switch 2 in its dock." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>We’re still kind of in the Switch 2’s launch period, given Nintendo’s second console/handheld hybrid is just about two weeks old, but despite <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-sales-fastest-selling-console-ever-1851784293&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-sales-fastest-selling-console-ever-1851784293">record-breaking sales</a></span> right out of the gate, the Switch 2’s arrival has hardly felt like a red carpet affair. Part of this is because Nintendo has managed to provide a solid supply for the demand, meaning it feels like a nice thing to have, rather than a hot commodity people are still scrambling for, and I’m not complaining about that. Another is that the Switch 2 is just…the original Switch, but bigger and better. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-better-tech-enshitification-google-review-1851784417&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-better-tech-enshitification-google-review-1851784417">That’s also a good thing</a></span>, to be clear, but it’s not quite as electrifying as the original Switch, with all of its novelty, felt in 2017. All that being said, the launch line-up is rock solid and showcases the device’s power. <em>Mario Kart World </em>is the headliner and is one of the finest kart-racing experiences Nintendo has put to cartridge, and impressive third-party ports like <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> and <em>Street Fighter 6 </em>show the system has legs. It’s been a bit underwhelming, but it’s also a smooth, pain-free console launch at a time when most things are bad, actually. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="3fb7c0525b151a7013ef73482e38dc1c" data-recommend-id="image://3fb7c0525b151a7013ef73482e38dc1c" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1391" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Nintendo Entertainment System." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Nintendo Entertainment System." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3fb7c0525b151a7013ef73482e38dc1c" data-recommend-id="image://3fb7c0525b151a7013ef73482e38dc1c" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1391" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Nintendo Entertainment System." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The years between the collapse of the market for Atari video games in the early 1980s and the arrival of the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1986 were long and harrowing for me, as a child whose earliest memories saw me developing a love for video games only for them to largely evaporate from the marketplace, their future uncertain. When they returned, it wasn’t with all the hype and fanfare we associate with console launches today. It was, for a bit, tentative and awkward, a case of the culture feeling out this new contender in the space. Nintendo, despite being the makers of beloved games like <em>Donkey Kong </em>and <em>Mario Bros</em>., both of which I’d played in arcades and on Atari 2600, wasn’t a name Americans were familiar with (my mom, god bless her, always pronounced it “Intendo”), and the initial arrival of the NES leaned heavily on R.O.B., a robot who looked cool and futuristic in advertisements but was somewhat frustrating to actually use. (In retrospect, however, I’ve come to appreciate R.O.B. as a wonderful novelty who may have been essential to securing Nintendo a foothold in the American market, letting the NES take up shelf space as a “toy” at a time when “game consoles” felt like poison to retailers.)</p><p>The moment I knew I wanted one—and first believed that video games were about to be back in a big way—was when I saw a big display kiosk touting the console at the Sears department store (RIP) in the Northridge Fashion Center. All the games looked colorful and amazing, leaps and bounds beyond what Atari had been able to deliver, but the one that looked like pure magic was <em>Super Mario Bros</em>. I’d already seen it in an arcade cabinet at my local 7-Eleven, this extraordinary game in which the little mustachioed hero of <em>Donkey Kong </em>now ran to the right into a whole world of mystery and adventure, and here was the promise of that same incredible experience at home. Before too long, Nintendo went from being largely unknown in the States to being a household name (even if my mom never learned to pronounce it correctly), and soon we were all reading issues of <em>Nintendo Power</em> and getting hyped for upcoming releases. It may not have been the most knock-your-socks-off launch in Nintendo’s history, but I think it was probably their most tactical, and it may always be their most historically significant. — Carolyn Petit</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="82b97ec20037b22be2f6cbabb4f5d930" data-recommend-id="image://82b97ec20037b22be2f6cbabb4f5d930" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1329" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A SNES." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A SNES." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="82b97ec20037b22be2f6cbabb4f5d930" data-recommend-id="image://82b97ec20037b22be2f6cbabb4f5d930" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1329" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A SNES." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>By the time the SNES rolled around, Nintendo had millions of loyal young American fans, and it could do a proper build-up and launch in the States for the first time. Our hype was fueled by <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/xYhGL5y4DPQ?si=0Ms8Rj9-bDZ-FRz-&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/xYhGL5y4DPQ?si=0Ms8Rj9-bDZ-FRz-" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">that commercial starring Paul Rudd</a></span>—we didn’t know he was Paul Rudd at the time, of course, but he looked awesome playing and enjoying those games, and we, too, wanted a taste of this “Super Power” the new console promised. For many parents, meanwhile, the SNES seemed like a scam, an effort to extort even more money from their Nintendo-addled kids. (For an incredible, time-capsule glimpse of what the period surrounding the SNES launch was like as many parents lamented the hold that video games had developed over their children, you simply must watch <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/MTzyz2TgGls?si=HRouMNxLHZNasr_Y&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/MTzyz2TgGls?si=HRouMNxLHZNasr_Y" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this video of a local news report</a></span> from 1991.)</p><p>But for those of us who were firmly in Nintendo’s grasp, the arrival of the SNES was cause for excitement, not concern. Today, game console launches often feel incremental; the PS5 felt like an important technological step up from the PS4, for instance, but not an awe-inspiring one. In the SNES era, however, new hardware could still inspire genuine awe. Oh my god, look at that 3D effect on those tracks in <em>F-Zero</em>! Look at all that color in <em>Super Mario World</em>! Sega’s Genesis had arrived two years prior, stepping up the technology that powered the games we played. Here, with the release of the SNES, Nintendo was firing its own salvo in the 16-bit wars, and once again, Mario was leading the way. The launch bundle included <em>Super Mario World</em>, maybe the best console pack-in of all time, giving players hours and hours of wonderful SNES gameplay right out of the box in a game that remains an enduring classic to this day. Now <em>that’s </em>how you make people feel good about their new console purchase, and eager to seek out the many wonderful new experiences that will be arriving for it in the months to come. — Carolyn Petit</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="b9495142c3062ff0c49f5859e48b7ae6" data-recommend-id="image://b9495142c3062ff0c49f5859e48b7ae6" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1280" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="An orange Nintendo 64." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An orange Nintendo 64." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b9495142c3062ff0c49f5859e48b7ae6" data-recommend-id="image://b9495142c3062ff0c49f5859e48b7ae6" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1280" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="An orange Nintendo 64." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The Nintendo 64 is one of the best examples of a launch immediately giving new players all they’ll really need by offering an incredible, generation-defining game right out the gate. Most consoles can’t claim to have the kind of system seller that <em>Super Mario 64 </em>was back in 1996. It didn’t matter that the Nintendo 64’s controller is the kind of sin that god will judge humanity for when we reach the pearly gates; Mario’s first leap into 3D felt like a true generational leap of the kind that’s become increasingly rare in recent decades. One game made such a succinct case for the console that some reasonably argue the N64 never surpassed it. In reality, as they arrived in the years that followed, games like <em>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time </em>and <em>GoldenEye </em>similarly demonstrated the capabilities and potential of the N64, but most companies don’t have this kind of paradigm shift on store shelves the same day their new console lands. Nintendo had done it twice before, though, with the NES having <em>Super Mario Bros. </em>right out of the gate and the SNES launching with the one-two punch of <em>Super Mario World </em>and <em>F-Zero</em>. And the company would go on to pull off this feat at least twice more, too… — Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="12188e0f855d638fccfaaf22fe90e327" data-recommend-id="image://12188e0f855d638fccfaaf22fe90e327" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1486" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Switch with blue and red joy-cons." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Switch with blue and red joy-cons." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="12188e0f855d638fccfaaf22fe90e327" data-recommend-id="image://12188e0f855d638fccfaaf22fe90e327" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1486" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Switch with blue and red joy-cons." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>When the Switch was unveiled, it sounded like some fanfiction futuristic device you’d made up as a kid. You’d whine to your friends that you wished you could play your Nintendo 64 games on long drives to grandma’s house, and then you’d draw up some impractical machinery that would allow you to pull your games off the TV and onto a handheld contraption. It seemed like science fiction growing up, and then Nintendo released a system that did just that. It wasn’t as powerful as the PS4 or Xbox One, but the portability gave it some actual utility that separated it from the competition and prevented it from falling into the same awkward catch-up phase the Wii U had. On top of it being such an incredible new device, it launched alongside <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em>, which, in addition to being a fulcrum point for open-world design as we know it, showed that the Switch also had the juice to host console-quality experiences on the go. It’s a double-edged sword that the Switch has become such an important pillar of the console market that Nintendo can’t really pivot away from it to make something new and experimental with the Switch 2, but the company pulled off something that felt like magic in 2017. As soon as it hit store shelves and people got a taste of a brand-new <em>Zelda </em>game in the palm of their hands, it was over. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="2b7a94004605749d15110f6166e52f23" data-recommend-id="image://2b7a94004605749d15110f6166e52f23" data-format="jpg" data-width="851" data-height="480" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A white Wii with a Wii-mote leaning on it." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A white Wii with a Wii-mote leaning on it." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2b7a94004605749d15110f6166e52f23" data-recommend-id="image://2b7a94004605749d15110f6166e52f23" data-format="jpg" data-width="851" data-height="480" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A white Wii with a Wii-mote leaning on it." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>All that being said, I don’t think we’ll ever have a launch quite like the Wii’s again. One of the smartest business decisions anyone at Nintendo ever made was to package <em>Wii Sports</em> with every Wii. One of the biggest hurdles video games must overcome is teaching someone how to play. The more complicated a game is, the more likely you are to lose someone in all the minutiae. Some of the best marketing Nintendo ever did was the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0p7uJp25BlE&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0p7uJp25BlE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“Wii Would Like To Play”</a></span> commercials that showed Nintendo employees bringing the system and its motion-controlled remotes into different families’ homes and showing them playing <em>Wii Sports</em>. As moms, dads, kids, and grandparents all swing the Wii-motes around and their movements are reflected on screen, everyone instantly understands what the system is about. Somehow, this pack-in collection of motion-controlled, sports-based games was a bigger system-seller than the new <em>Zelda </em>that launched alongside the console, and the possibilities seemed so endless. Eventually, the Wii became a dumping ground for shovelware, and Nintendo’s decision to stick with the device’s name for brand recognition with the Wii U ended up biting it in the ass. Still, unless Nintendo or another company comes up with something so intuitive that even your grandmother is hopping on to play, no one is catching lightning in a bottle this way ever again. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Embracer Group has reduced its workforce by over 1800 people in the past year.</p>
<p>The Swedish conglomerate today released its <a href="https://storage.mfn.se/dd9f3025-a71d-4aa7-9ddf-ecc688af29f4/embracer-group-annual-report-2024-25.pdf">annual report</a> (thanks <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/embracer-group-reduced-its-headcount-almost-2-000-employees-last-year">Game Developer</a>), detailing the internal headcount of each of its departments. By comparing with the previous annual report, we can estimate the workforce reduction over the past financial year.</p>
<p>The company's PC and console games segment has seen the biggest drop, from 6,404 employees to 4,918. That's a reduction of 1,486 people, or just over a quarter. The mobile segment has been reduced from 1,081 to 743 employees, while the entertainment and services segment has been reduced from 771 to 738 employees. That totals a loss of 1,857 people in the past year.</p>

<p>This loss does not account for the company's previous tabletop segment, as Asmodee has now split into a separate entity as part of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embracer-announces-plan-to-split-into-three-companies-including-middle-earth-enterprises-and-friends">plans to split the company into three</a>: Coffee Stain Group, Fellowship Entertainment, and Asmodee.</p>
<p>Of course, part of this workforce change will be natural turnover. Embracer lists its turnover rate at 20 percent in total, with 560 people leaving voluntarily and 517 leaving due to dismissal (as opposed to seven by retirement and zero due to death in service).</p>
<p>Much of this will be as a result of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saints-row-owner-embracer-announces-comprehensive-restructuring-program-to-close-studios-cut-jobs">Embracer's restructuring programme</a>, which began back in June 2023 in the wake of a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embracer-shares-plummet-after-proposed-2bn-partnership-collapses">proposed $2bn partnership collapse</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embracers-collapsed-2bn-deal-reportedly-with-saudi-arabia-funded-savvy-games">reportedly with Saudi Arabia's Savvy Games fund</a>.</p>
<p>Since then, the company has laid off thousands of employees and closed numerous studios. In May 2024, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-the-human-cost-of-embracers-restructuring-programme">Eurogamer reported the human cost of this restructuring</a>: a headcount reduction of 4,532 people, as well as 80 in-development projects being dropped.</p>
<p>In the months following that report, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alone-in-the-dark-reboot-developer-closed-by-embracer">developer of the Alone in the Dark reboot was closed</a>, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embracer-owned-studio-lost-boys-interactive-impacted-by-another-round-of-layoffs">Lost Boys studio suffered another round of layoffs</a>, and in March this year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embracer-groups-eidos-montreal-studio-lays-off-up-to-75-employees">Eidos-Montréal confirmed more layoffs</a> affecting up to 75 people.</p>
<p>As part of this year's annual report, Embracer has focused on its publicly available Sustainability Policy, stating its "commitments towards the people, environment and governance" and highlighting how it addresses working conditions, corporate culture, human rights and labour rights.</p>
<p>"At Embracer Group, we aim to maintain a safe and inclusive workplace where all employees can grow professionally," the annual report reads. "We focus on developing employee skills and competences and monitor their well-being through performance dialogues at the individual level and other measures. Diversity and inclusion in skillsets and perspectives are key components of the approach taken to create a dynamic and inclusive workplace."</p>
<p>It adds: "We understand the challenges posed by divestment, transformations and organisational change. Yet, we strive to maintain an environment where talents are nurtured and empowered."</p>
<p>The report also lists an increased gender imbalance, with a reduction of the female workforce from 30 percent to 27 percent. Embracer states this decrease "is primarily linked to organisational changes, mostly related to the Asmodee spin-off", though the drop in female managers is larger than the drop in "young female talent".</p>
<p>The company describes the "diverse skills and perspectives" of its workforce as "a source of pride". According to GDC's State of the Games Industry report 2025, women represent 25 percent of the game industry workforce.</p>
<p>Embracer CEO Lars Wingefors has written the opening remarks in the report, although <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-overseeing-thousands-of-layoffs-and-numerous-studio-closures-embracer-ceo-lars-wingefors-is-stepping-down">he is stepping down from his role at the company</a>. Instead, he will become its executive chair of the board.</p>
<p>"While the road has not always been straight, I am incredibly proud of the achievements made possible by our talented teams, which have created some incredible experiences for gamers," said Wingefors.</p>
<p>Despite owning 464 IP rights, Embracer's biggest success story this year so far has been the release of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-2">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a>.</p>
<p>Embracer boasts it has 108 game development projects. So what's coming next?</p>
<p>In its latest financial report, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embracer-plans-to-release-76-different-games-in-the-next-year-despite-previous-layoffs-and-studio-closures">Embracer stated it would release 76 different games over the next financial year</a>, 2025/2026. This will be a mix of new IPs, sequels, and remasters.</p>
<p>Arguably the biggest release will be Amy Hennig's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amy-hennigs-marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-delayed-into-next-year">Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra, which was delayed back in May into early 2026</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/rematch">Rematch</a>, the game about kicking it in the goal from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sifu">Sifu</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/absolver">Absolver</a> devs Sloclap, have launched today, June 19th. The folks behind it have rung in that occasion by outlining a bunch of their future plans, as well as saying they're very sorry you can't currently show off your mouse and keyboard skills by nutmegging some fool who owns one of those ex-boxers.</p>
<p>Don't worry, though, crossplay and a bunch of other stuff are in the works for future updates to the foot-to-ball thing Nic and James <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/james-and-nic-kick-a-thing-sloclaps-rematch-edition">dug the beta of</a>, and that currently sits fourth in Steam's top sellers list.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Kicking off a <a href="https://www.playrematch.com/post/rematch-launch-priorities-next-steps">launch message</a> (sorry, had to), Sloclap explained that crossplay didn't end up happening in time for Rematch's release because of "unforeseen technical complexities", continuing: "We should have communicated as soon as it became apparent that crossplay wouldn’t be available at launch, and we’re sorry for the inconvenience and frustration it caused to some of our players."</p>
<p>The devs said they have got a "basic working version from a technical standpoint", and getting that over the line is their "absolute highest priority" right now. So, you should be able to unleash your inner Roy Keane on some unsuspecting fool who bought a different video game box soonish.</p>
<p>Aside from that, SloClap are aiming to show a bunch of technical gremlins that folks reported throughout Early Access the red card (sorry again, I once took a football to the face as a small child and have never really recovered). Lag, stuttering, frame drops, and "player characters and the ball seemingly moving across the pitch unpredictably" are on the hit list.</p>
<p>The devs also have their eyes on a host of improvements and additions for future updates, including tournaments, the ability to create your own club, and bots you can train against. The likes of spectating your squad’s game when you join one and a way to let players team up and rematch with teammates they've liked having a kickabout with are also on the list in terms of social stuff, to go alongside that crossplay. </p>
<p>As for when all of this'll arrive, SloClap made clear not to expect everything by the end of this year, so you may well have to be patient if you've got your eye on one of those non-crossplay additions.</p>
<p>If it helps, imagine the devs dribbling through a circuit of well-placed cones that each represent a development thing equal in threat to a six foot four centre back called big Terry whose mum they've just insulted.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p><em>Remember when you’d walk into a local music, book, or video store and there’d be an adorable section where the employees would recommend what they were interested in that month?&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>Welcome to our little version of it, called Remap Recommends.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>It's a chance for the staff at Remap to let you know what they've been playing, reading, listening to, or watching.</em></p><hr><h3 id="patrick-recommends-pipistrello-and-the-cursed-yoyo">Patrick Recommends: Pipistrello and the Cursed Yoyo</h3><figure></figure><p>If you told me this was a "lost" game from the 16-bit era, I'd believe you. To the point that I'm actually a little upset I've put enough hours into this game that I can't rationalize starting over on my shiny new Switch 2, instead. Steam Deck it is.</p><p>I do not remember how <em>Pipistrello and the Cursed Yoyo, </em>what I can only describe as a fun mashup of <em>Mega Man </em>and <em>The Legend of Zelda</em>, came onto my radar, but it wasn't because a PR person told me. I've been doing this long enough that, at times, people will yell "hey, you should play this!" And they are often right, and in this case were very right, because <em>Pipistrello and the Cursed Yoyo </em>absolutely rips.</p><p>In fact, people have now understood my own weaknesses enough that they use them against me. No, <em>Pipistrello and the Cursed Yoyo</em> does not have a traditional grappling hook, but you use the yoyo in question much like one, whipping objects and enemies around. A grappling hook, at the end of the day, is just about manipulation of the world, and I'm always looking for games that play with that.</p><p>Some of the tiny details are my favorite parts too. </p><p>For example, the game has a familiar skill tree, but rather than acquiring new skills or stat upgrades by slowly acquiring experience points, you are burdened with debt and weakness. Let's say you want more points to equip additional trinkets that boost your character in different ways. Well, in exchange for +1 in that department, you are now going to sacrifice half the money you pick up from enemies towards paying off your debt <em>and</em> your attack power is reduced by one. I am very much into video games that force you to play a little differently over time.<em> Pipistrello and the Cursed Yoyo</em> does that a lot, making exploration of the world feel meaningfully different over time.</p><hr><h3 id="chia-recommends-rebel-princess">Chia Recommends: Rebel Princess</h3><figure><figcaption><span>Image courtesy of Bézier Games</span></figcaption></figure><p>There've been a myriad of trick takers in the last few years that aim to take this basic mechanic and warp it to new ends (see: my (board)game of the year from 2024, <em>Arcs</em>),&nbsp;but one in particular kept passing in front of me. <em>Rebel Princess</em> is a twist on the classic game of Hearts, and this basis makes it a great entry game into the wider, weirder world of board games.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-switch-2%E2%80%99s-first-post-launch-update-is-stronger-and-more-stable-er.1223070/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/19/the-switch-2s-first-post-launch-update-is-stronger-and-more-stable-er/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The first post-launch update for the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> is here, bumping the version number up to 21.0.5, and you’ll never guess what it does…</p>
<p>Actually, you probably will guess, because this is a minor version bump, and Nintendo has broken out the tried and true single line patch note for Switch System Update 21.0.5. Here’s what it does:</p>


<ul>
<li>General system stability improvements to enhance the user’s experience.</li>
</ul>
<p>And that’s it.</p>
<p>It’s all behind the scenes stuff, in other words. Stability can mean all manner of things, and could include stamping out any minor crash bugs, solving GameChat’s activation glitches – something we sadly cannot test again – sorting the strange battery reporting issue, and improving edge case performance for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/11/how-the-switch-2-fixed-bad-switch-1-frame-rates-even-without-patches/">backward compatible games</a> by updating the translation layer.</p>
<p>Similar to Microsoft’s cross-gen system software, Nintendo is keeping system updates in lockstep across the original Switch and Switch 2. So Switch System Update 21.0.5 is out now across the original model, Switch Lite, Switch OLED and Switch 2 all together.</p>

<p>While there’s some key system features for the Switch 2, including GameChat and GameShare, a bespoke new version of the Nintendo eShop, and a tweaked home screen design, the absolute core functionality and general layout has remained the same. The systems share Nintendo’s new digital licensing system of Virtual Game Cards, so it makes sense that they share the same core.</p>
<p>Anyway, more stable is nice. We like things to be strong and stable round these parts. Not weak and wobbly.</p>

<p>That really is updating the world</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time Hunter" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5c49a7337e494/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-hunter.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Level-5</em></figcaption></figure><p>Just under a month ago, Level-5 revealed that it would be releasing free DLC for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time</a>, which has been a huge success for the Japanese developer. The game has sold over 1 million copies across all platforms, and the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Switch 2 version in particular is absolutely fantastic</a>.</p>
<p>Now, the developer has <a href="https://www.fantasylife.jp/fli/en/topics/250619/">shared more details</a> about that upcoming free DLC, <strong>Update the World</strong>, and it really is updating the world, as Ginormosia will be transforming into a base for a roguelike, open world adventure (thanks, <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/06/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-free-dlc-update-the-world-to-add-new-mode-roguelike-open-world">Gematsu</a>!). A date hasn't been announced, but Level-5 is aiming to bring it to fans "as soon as possible."</p><p><figure data-videoid="vhRubWa3khQ" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vhRubWa3khQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vhRubWa3khQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vhRubWa3khQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed598179xmhwuv&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>823k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhRubWa3khQ">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>Alongside this massive-sounding mode, more powerful gear, new equipment, new mounts, some strange new items, and additional emotes and hairstyles will be coming. But, most importantly, look at this fuzzy new character who will play an important role in the DLC. Is he good? Is he bad? We don't care — he's got a very fluffy mane!</p>
<figure><a title="Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time DLC Character" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/eae014d763176/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-dlc-character.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Level-5</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Level-5 promises that, for as big as the world sounds, the upcoming DLC will offer "engaging content for both experienced players and newcomers alike." Well, the base game already does that, so Level-5 will be stealing more of our time in the near future.</p>
<p>We're delighted to see how successful and popular Fantasy Life i has become, and the Switch and Switch 2 versions are now totally up to date with other consoles <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/fantasy-life-i-scores-another-switch-1-and-2-update-here-are-the-full-patch-notes">as of today's free update</a>. Between this and Mario Kart World, we're never going to have time for anything else, are we?</p>
<p><em>Let us know if you're looking forward to this free DLC in the comments</em>.</p>
