            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rocksteady-layoffs-end-of-2024<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Batman: Arkham&nbsp;</em>developer Rocksteady Studios was apparently hit by yet more layoffs at the close of last year, according to a new report.</p>

<p>Per <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-developer-rocksteady-hit-by-end-of-year-layoffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Eurogamer</a>, which cites "half a dozen staff impacted by the redundancies", several Rocksteady staff lost their jobs at the end of 2024, although the report doesn't state exactly how many employees were let go.</p>

<p>According to the report, Rocksteady's "programming and artist teams" were affected by the layoffs, and yet more QA staff also lost their jobs after a round of layoffs <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rocksteady-layoffs-suicide-squad" rel="nofollow">hit that very same department back in September</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rocksteady-layoffs-2024-harley-quinn.jpg?itok=izD__q8B 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rocksteady-layoffs-2024-harley-quinn.jpg?itok=T-w-2p5E 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League&nbsp;</em>developer Rocksteady has been hit by yet more layoffs.</figcaption></figure><p>Eurogamer says it contacted Warner Bros. for a response but didn't receive one, which probably shouldn't come as a surprise; neither this round of layoffs nor the previous round in September were officially announced by the company.</p>

<p>Sadly, these layoffs also probably shouldn't be a shock, sad as they are. Back in December, Rocksteady <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/suicide-squad-seasons-ending-in-january-offline-mode" rel="nofollow">announced that it would end content updates</a> for&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad</em>&nbsp;following the game's fourth season and that it would implement the offline mode it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/suicide-squad-kill-justice-league-offline" rel="nofollow">promised in December 2023</a>.</p>

<p>That news came after Warner Bros. declared&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/suicide-squad-kill-justice-leagues-sales-disappointed-hogwarts-legacy-is-big-win" rel="nofollow">to be a financial disappointment</a> in February last year, with the game representing an embarrassing $200 million loss for the company's gaming division. There's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hogwarts-legacy-sales-30m" rel="nofollow">only so much&nbsp;<em>Hogwarts Legacy&nbsp;</em>can do</a> to offset a loss like that.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hogwarts-legacy-directors-cut-report" rel="nofollow">a report in June</a>, Rocksteady employees are helping to develop a Director's Cut version of that very same wizarding RPG, although no such project has been officially announced by Warner Bros (are you sensing a theme emerging here?).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hogwarts-legacy-rocksteady-wand.jpg?itok=aJMqi2vz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hogwarts-legacy-rocksteady-wand.jpg?itok=a_uyAz-j 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Rocksteady is reportedly working on a Director's Cut for&nbsp;<em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>That same report also claimed that Rocksteady is preparing to pitch a single-player game that would be closer to its&nbsp;<em>Batman: Arkham&nbsp;</em>roots than the live-service experiment of&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad</em>.</p>

<p>It isn't clear whether these recent layoffs will affect the studio's ability to successfully make that pitch, but I can't imagine it's easy being at Rocksteady right now. Stay tuned for more on this.</p>

<p>Rocksteady has been hit by another round of layoffs. As support for Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-updates-will-end-with-season-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">comes to an end</a> with the final season, the studio has seen a number of employees let go across various departments.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-developer-rocksteady-hit-by-end-of-year-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a> was the first to report on the layoffs after “half a dozen staff” who were part of the layoffs confirmed to the outlet that they took place. According to the report, employees in QA, programming, and art have been let go.</p>



<p>An exact number impacted or when the layoffs actually happened is currently unknown. Insider Gaming has reached out to Warner Bros. Games and Rocksteady for comment on the layoffs. As of publishing, however, no response has been received.</p>







<p>The latest layoffs mark the second in a handful of months as the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rocksteady-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">QA team saw staff reduced</a> by over 50% in September. Last May, during the company’s Q1 FY2025 earnings call, Warner Bros. revealed that Suicide Squad <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/suicide-squad-cost-warner-bros-200-million-in-revenue/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cost the company $200 million</a> in revenue due after a “disappointing” release. During its last earnings call, the company said that, moving forward, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warner-bros-games-focusing-on-batman-mortal-kombat-and-hogwarts-legacy-moving-forward/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it’ll put more of a focus</a> on “strong” game franchises like Batman, Mortal Kombat, and Hogwarts Legacy.</p>

            <p>A new report from People Make Games has detailed disturbing allegations of abuse towards employees at Indonesian studio Brandoville, a company used for art and animation support in games such as Age of Empires 4 and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>.</p>
<p>In 2021, People Make Games <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm7KUE1Kwts">reported on crunch culture and the industry's reliance on outsourcing</a> to external developers in order to meet deadlines. Brandoville Studios was one such developer. Little has changed in the industry since that report, but Brandoville's closure a few months ago has lead its employees to now share further stories of their experiences at the studio.</p>
<p>At the centre of this report is Christa Sydney, who worked at the company from 2019 until 2024 and says she was subjected to mental and physical abuse by commissioner Kwan Cherry Lai, wife of Brandoville CEO Ken Lai, who ran day-to-day operations.</p>
<p>The full report can be watched in the below video, though please note it contains some incredibly harrowing content and footage.</p>

<p>Sydney describes how Cherry Lai took her under her wing following a dispute early in her career, but how this led to toxic abuse. Initially, Lai imposed a strict working schedule on employees and would purposefully divide employees through gossip and demeaning words, Sydney said.</p>
<p>Sydney was actually part of People Make Games' previous report, but says she was later forced by Lai to film a statement in support of Brandoville against her will. Other employees felt she was being brainwashed, it's reported.</p>
<p>Sydney now says she was then continuously abused by Lai, including during a work trip to the XDS '22 conference where Lai micromanaged her time and only allowed her to sleep for a few minutes over the course of four days leading up to the event. Further abuse included imposing daily Christian worship, forcing Sydney to write lines like a schoolchild, daily check-ins over WhatsApp of her outfits as part of "quality control", and humiliating her in front of colleagues.</p>
<p>Eventually Lai's abuse became physical, forcing Sydney to film herself slapping her face 100 times as punishment, or hitting her head against a door frame until she was concussed before forcing an apology.</p>
<p>Another employee, Caesarion Balthazar, had an arrangement with Lai where she would take part of his salary to assist with his spending habits. This led to her, in Balthazar's words, stealing an amount of money equivalent to a month's salary. Additionally, Balthazar says he was told he owed money for expensive training programmes he hadn't yet taken when he tried to leave the company.</p><p>A third employee, Syifana Afiati, also says she was abused by Lai during her time at Brandoville from 2019 to 2024. Afiati fell pregnant, but was repeatedly overworked by Lai. At one point during the pregnancy Afiati says she was taken to hospital due to an issue, but was still asked to come into the office and work - to which she declined. Afiati's son was born two months prematurely and sadly died four months later in intensive care, however Lai still expected her to work and provided no sympathy or support from the company.</p>
<p>In August 2024, Brandoville Studios went into liquidation, though Cherry and Ken Lai convinced a handful of employees to stay and begin a new company: LaiLai Studios. Sydney was one such employee, but says she was subsequently subjected to direct physical violence from Cherry Lai on multiple occasions.</p>
<p>Sydney eventually escaped and compiled evidence against Lai. Media reports in Indonesia went viral, which finally lead to police investigations. This was required due to the local phrase "no viral, no justice", stemming from mistrust in the police and justice system.</p>
<p>In response to the allegations, Cherry Lai issued a statement to People Make Games, bizarrely stating: "To me my part of the story is not important, as long as my team are good and safe now." However, further discussion was declined.</p><p>Other employees claimed Ken Lai was Cherry's "biggest enabler" and should've done more to stop this abuse. Sydney and others however say they believe Ken is yet another victim of Cherry's abuse and his silence comes from a place of fear.</p>
<p>The report concludes by noting how the treatment of outsourced workers goes largely unnoticed and unremarked upon by the video games industry due to its discomfort discussing outsourced work, despite it being a crucial part of game development. Eurogamer has contacted Microsoft and Ubisoft for comment on their connections to Brandoville.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ex-annapurna-staff-private-division-ips<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new report claims that an as-yet unnamed company comprising former Annapurna Interactive employees is set to take over publishing duties for franchises that would have been overseen by ex-Take-Two indie label Private Division.</p>

<p>According to a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-07/ex-annapurna-video-game-staff-to-absorb-former-take-two-label-private-division" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">report</a> by Bloomberg's Jason Schreier, ex-Annapurna Interactive staffers have formed a new company following their <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/annapurna-interactive-staff-resign-after-company-spin-off-talks-fail" rel="nofollow">abrupt resignation in September</a>, which resulted from the failure of talks to spin the division off into its own entity.</p>

<p>The new company will, according to Schreier, "inherit the games and franchises of Private Division", which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/take-two-private-division-sale" rel="nofollow">sold off by former parent company Take-Two in November</a> to an unknown buyer. The report, citing "people familiar with the deal", names that buyer as the Texas-based Haveli Investments.</p>

<p>According to Schreier, "an unannounced title" by&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>developer Game Freak will also be included in the deal. That game is almost certainly the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/private-division-pokemon-developer-game-freak-reveal-new-action-adventure-ip-project" rel="nofollow">previously-revealed&nbsp;<em>Project Bloom</em></a>, which doesn't have an official name yet, so hopefully we'll get to see a new reveal for it soon.</p>

<p>Schreier's report says that some of Private Division's 20 employees "will be laid off as part of the new arrangement", although we don't yet know which employees or in what departments those layoffs will be focused.</p>

<p>The writing was arguably on the wall for Private Division as early as April last year, when Take-Two <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/take-two-interactive-layoffs" rel="nofollow">laid off 5% of its workforce</a> and scrapped a number of projects. Following that, Private Division and Bloober Team <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bloober-team-private-division-end-partnership" rel="nofollow">ended</a> a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bloober-teams-up-with-private-division-for-new-horror-game" rel="nofollow">previously-announced partnership</a> for a new horror IP in May.</p>

Stay tuned for more on this one.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Chinese publisher Tencent are the biggest video game company in the world. Their wholly owned subsidiaries including League Of Legends developers Riot Games, Path Of Exile developers Grinding Gear Games, and UK outfit Sumo Group. They own shares in everything from Epic Games through Ubisoft to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a> rebooters Bloober Team. Are you a game developer? Odds are that at least one percent of your body belongs to Tencent. Maybe one of your toes.</p>
<p>And now it turns out that Tencent are some kind of military operator, as well. Or at least, that's what the US Department of Defence would have us believe: they've just somewhat randomly added the firm to an infamous list of Chinese military companies, together with lithium-ion battery maker CATL. This potentially makes it difficult for Tencent to do business in the States, but Tencent say that it's all based on a "misunderstanding".</p><!--more-->
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-06/us-adds-tencent-to-chinese-military-blacklist-shares-decline">Bloomberg</a>, the US DoD's list of Chinese military companies dates back to an executive order given by recently re-elected president Donald Trump in 2020, which sought to prevent US companies from investing in entities with ties to the Chinese military.</p>
<p>Formally known as <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/01/07/2025-00070/notice-of-availability-of-designation-of-chinese-military-companies">Section 1260H</a>, the list is updated annually and currently runs to 134 companies, including phone manufacturer Huawei. Being on there doesn't mean the companies in question are immediately banned from doing business with the USA, but it puts pressure on the US Treasury Department to sanction them. This might scare away investors: the BBC <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c9q78wn9g8zo">reports</a> that Tencent has already seen a share price fall in Hong Kong as of today, Tuesday 7th January.</p><p>Tencent, naturally, say the whole thing is an error, and that the designation will have no material effect on their activities. "We are not a military company or supplier," Tencent spokesperson Danny Marti commented to the BBC. "Unlike sanctions or export controls, this listing has no impact on our business. We will nonetheless work with the Department of Defense to address any misunderstanding."</p>
<p>I'm no scholar of superpower geopolitics, but my understanding is that all this forms parts of US efforts to contain China both economically, and in terms of the military applications and connections of Chinese tech companies and research organisations. Here's <a href="https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/article/3180636/dod-releases-list-of-peoples-republic-of-china-prc-military-companies-in-accord/">a US Department of Defence press release from 2022</a> which spells out the thinking. An excerpt:</p>
<blockquote>"The Department is determined to highlight and counter the PRC Military-Civil Fusion strategy, which supports the modernization goals of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) by ensuring its access to advanced technologies and expertise are acquired and developed by PRC companies, universities, and research programs that appear to be civilian entities. Section 1260H directs the Department to begin identifying, among other things, Military-Civil Fusion contributors operating directly or indirectly in the United States."</blockquote>
<p>Given the sheer scale of Tencent's operations - they also work in generative AI and cloud computing and own WeChat, one of the largest social media networks - it seems probable that they have military connections somewhere. But then again, so do many large US tech companies, like Activision-Blizzard and Microsoft. Many are the links between the tech biz and the world's armed forces.</p><p>All this comes amid news that Tencent are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tencent-and-guillemot-family-considering-buyout-of-ubisoft-report-says">considering a buyout of Ubisoft with the aid of the founding Guillemot family</a>. It also follows the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/two-epic-games-directors-step-down-after-us-department-of-justice-investigate-games-companies-under-antitrust-laws">resignation of two Tencent-appointed Epic Games directors</a>, in response to a US Department of Justice investigation into potential antitrust violations.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>We're back! Slowly. Surely. Truly, there was no better way to kick off 2025 than to message Rob on a sleepy Monday morning and ask "hey, do you want to record a podcast?" Which, naturally, turned into a discussion of Sports! or HOA, which, naturally, ended with us going "why not both?" You'll hear the trials and tribulations of contract work next week. (I have since mostly built out my new office, and while I touch on that in this episode, we'll mostly unpack in the next HOA, where we'll probably do some questions, too.) I hope your holiday was restful. Mine was mostly not? The holidays fell on weird times, which means my plan in previous years to have my kids stay at cdaycare a few times blew up in my face. They were fine...mostly. The whiskey helped.</p><p>-pk, who watched the sappy Zemeckis film <em>Here</em> over the holidays, and while he would not argue it was good, he did cry many, many times</p><p>P.S.

Minisode</em> – The Bears beat the Packers for the first time in [DELETED], which prompted us to talk a bit about where our terrible team stands as the playoffs begin to unfold.

But we'll record an episode before then.</li><li><strong>STREAM:</strong> <em>Return of Infinity Nikki </em>– Look, I had more fun with this one that I'm willing to admit, and when the stream was ending, my thought was "you know, if we have a sleepy January, maybe I need to return to this one."</li><li><strong>STREAM:</strong> <em>K.L.E.P.E.K.S.T.A.L.K.E.R.</em> – I'm turning my homework from Rob into content.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/valorant-ditches-episodes-for-yearly-season-model/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Ahead of VALORANT’s fifth year anniversary, the live-service tactical FPS from Riot Games is pivoting its model away from its regular episode release calendar. Instead, VALORANT will utilize year-long seasons, each consisting of six two-month long acts.</p>



<p>VALORANT studio lead Anna Donlon recently <a href="https://x.com/VALORANT/status/1876644967466090569" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">covered this change</a> ahead of what is set to be the first season under this new model: Season 2025, or V25 for short. During this season, players are hoping to finally get some of the features they’ve been waiting years for.</p>



<hr>



<p>The switch from episodes to calendar year seasons was spurred by a need to re-adjust the VALORANT content release schedule, says Donlon. With Riot also running a yearly schedule for the VALORANT Champions Tour, the game’s growing esports ecosystem, switching to a “perfectly curated season of VALORANT” affords the team more space and flexibility to plan out both game and esports projects.</p>



<p>Many of the in-game projects that players have been waiting for might (at last) be coming sooner than later. Donlon explained that “most of the [dev team] expansion work” is behind them, meaning the developers can work on some highly anticipated features. This includes the replay system, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-sunset-map-changes-in-valorant-patch-9-08/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reworked map rotations</a>, ranked rollbacks (rating refunds), improved matchmaking, and less toxicity.</p>



<p>This first update of 2025 is setting the stage for a slew of updates to come:</p>



<ul>
<li>A dev update on upcoming gameplay changes and fixes is coming “in the next few days.”</li>



<li>An update on VALORANT mobile is coming some time in “the future.”</li>



<li>Head of VALORANT Esports, Leo Faria, will have more to share on VCT “in the next couple of days.”</li>
</ul>



<p>While Faria is expected to share more on the matter, Donlon did note that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pro-valorant-teams-made-44m-from-digital-goods-in-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fan engagement</a> has prompted Riot to “continue investing heavily into VALORANT esports.”</p>

<p>A new company is set to take over the games and franchises that once belonged to former Take-Two Interactive-owned studio Private Division. According to a new report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-07/ex-annapurna-video-game-staff-to-absorb-former-take-two-label-private-division" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>, former staff of Annapurna Interactive have formed a new company that will take over the franchises of Private Division.</p>



<p>The name of the new company is currently unknown.</p>



<p>The report states that private equity firm Haveli Investments out of Austin, Texas was the “unnamed buyer” of Private Division late last year. It continues to say that after the deal was closed, Haveli made a deal with the ex-Annapurna staff to place them in charge of the acquired franchises. Those games include Tales of the Shire, Kerbal Space Program, and the in development game from Pokemon developer Game Freak.</p>







<p>As part of this new deal, employees who were a part of Private Division when the deal was made will be laid off. It’s unclear how many of the approximately 20 employees will be let go.</p>



<p>“The current leadership of Private Division has told employees to explore their options due to the uncertainty surrounding their jobs,” the report reads.</p>



<p>What do you think of the changes happening at Private Division with this new company led by former Annapurna staff?

            <p>There’s a new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lenovo-legion-go-review">Lenovo Legion Go</a> on the way, and while it’s ditching the signature detachable controllers, it’s still got something unusual to stick on its CV. The Lenovo Legion Go S is a smaller, cheaper take on Lenovo’s portable gaming PC, and it’s on track to become the first officially licensed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/steamos">SteamOS</a> handheld outside of Valve’s own <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-steam-deck-games">Steam Deck</a> range.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>First off: <em>finally</em>. Windows 11 is the obvious choice for non-Valve manufacturers to base their dinky rigs around, but it’s proven <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/asus-rog-ally-review-a-nifty-handheld-pc-with-the-best-and-worst-of-windows">time</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/zotac-zone-review">time</a> again that its lack of natural affinity for small screens and thumbstick controls isn’t entirely made up for by its native games compatibility. SteamOS <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/respawn-have-killed-apex-legends-steam-deck-support-in-the-name-of-anti-cheat">might not be supported everywhere</a> but UX-wise, it is a far better match for handhelds, while still offering <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-to-enable-desktop-mode-on-the-steam-deck">Desktop Mode</a> for more Windows-like flexibility. Its spread across third-party machines can only be a good thing.</p>
<p>Anyway, the Legion Go S! It’s simplified and shrunk down considerably from the original Legion Go, adopting a more traditionaol fixed chassis, dropping the weight from 854g to 730g, and downsizing the display to an 8in, 1200p, 120Hz IPS panel. Fine by me – the Legion Go’s 1600p, nearly 9in screen was nice to look at but often too much for its own processor to handle. Speaking of, the Legion Go S will be powered by your choice of either the same Ryzen Z1 Extreme that the Legion Go had, or AMD's brand-new Ryzen Z2 Go. No word on how the latter will perform, though it's probably not as quick as the Z1 Extreme, as that one will send the Legion Go S's price up to $729 whereas the Ryzen 2 Go version will be just $599.</p>

 </a>

</figure>
<p>Speaking of choice, there'll also be a Windows 11 edition of the Legion Go S, perfect for those who rolled their eyes disapprovingly through that second paragraph. That will go on sale this January, several months ahead of the SteamOS version’s May release.</p><p>Either way, the Legion Go S will come with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/should-you-bother-with-hall-effect-keyboards">Hall Effect</a> joysticks, a teensy lil’ trackpad on the right (which looks more like a navigation aid than the Deck’s big, gaming-ready haptic pads), and a 55Whr battery, which is 5WHr up on the original Legion Go. Between that and the lower-specced display, hopefully that will translate into lengthier battery life, another weakness of the bigger brother.</p>
<p>Hardware is rarely improved by removing its more unique and interesting features, but in the Legion Go S’s case, I do reckon it could get away with trading away those Switch-style controllers. SteamOS will just naturally make it a more comfortable handheld to use, and in offering 1TB of storage for $599, it even manages to undercut the $649 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-deck-oled-review">Steam Deck OLED</a> on its usual price advantage. It’ll still need to make a case for itself on performance and battery life, but it’s definitely an interesting prospect. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-enjoyed-the-lenovo-legion-go-right-up-to-the-moment-i-broke-it">Hope I don’t break it</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Marvel Rivals Season 1: Eternal Night Falls will begin on January 10, 2025, and the devs, Netease, have just revealed what content we can expect from the upcoming season, including new heroes, maps, game modes, and more.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-what-to-expect-from-marvel-rivals-season-1">What to Expect from Marvel Rivals Season 1</h2>



<p>Marvel Rivals Season 1: Eternal Night Falls will see the arrival of four new playable characters, the Fantastic Four. Three new maps will also be introduced: Empire of Eternal Night: Sanctum Sanctorum, Empire of Eternal Night: Midtown, and Empire of Eternal Night: Central Park. Season 1 will include double the playable content of a regular season and will bring the total number of heroes in the roster to 37 by the end of it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The duration of Season 1 has been set at three months, and it will be divided into two halves of six to seven weeks each. The first half will see the arrival of two of the four playable characters, Mister Fantastic and Invisible Woman. Additionally, Empire of Eternal Night: Midtown will be added as a new convoy map during Marvel Rivals Season 1 Part 1, and a new game mode called Doom Match will be playable in the Sanctum Sanctorum.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-marvel-rivals-season-1-battle-pass-nbsp">Marvel Rivals Season 1 Battle Pass&nbsp;</h2>



<p>The developers will provide <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNiYrOSLYD4&amp;t=146s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">double the content </a>of Season 0 for the Marvel Rivals Season 1 battle pass. The theme will be Eternal Night Falls, and players can claim 10 new skins through the pass. Season 1 Luxury Battle Pass will be priced at 990 Lattice, and players can claim 600 Lattice and 600 Units by completing it.&nbsp;The battle pass will not expire once obtained.</p>



<h2 id="h-marvel-rivals-season-1-balancing-changes">Marvel Rivals Season 1 Balancing Changes</h2>



<p>The developers are “toning down the prowess of formidable ranged duelists like Hela and Hawkeye”, meaning players will see these characters getting nerfed soon. The developers will provide buffs to mobile-type Vanguards like Captain America and Venom and characters that “shine in specialised compositions” such as Wolverine and Storm.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Characters like Cloak and Dagger will also receive buffs to make them more “formidable in diverse team setups during Marvel Rivals Season 1. Lastly, Jeff the Land Shark’s ultimate range is also being fine-tuned to “better align with early warning signals.”</p>



<h2 id="h-pick-rates-and-win-rates">Pick Rates and Win Rates</h2>



<p>At the end of Season 0, Marvel Rivals developers will provide the pick and win rates for all characters across all available platforms. Players should know that the stats for PC and Console will be merged for quick matches as it features cross-platform battles. However, separate statistics will be available for the competitive mode. Players should expect these pick and win rates to be released every half-season.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-rank-adjustments">Rank Adjustments</h2>



<p>Lastly, the start of Marvel Rivals Season 1: Eternal Night Falls will reset competitive ranks, with each player receiving a drop of 7 divisions, depending on their end rank in Season 0. Additionally, Season 1 will see the arrival of a new major rank, Celestial, which falls between the Grandmaster and Eternity ranks. &nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-additional-settings">Additional Settings</h2>



<p>Listening to player feedback, the developer will provide additional tools at the start of Marvel Rivals Season 1. A new option that allows you to boost frame rates will be introduced. Also, devs will introduce support for mouse acceleration settings for more customisation. A streamer mode will be introduced in the first half of Season 1 for upcoming and established content creators.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Details about Marvel Rivals Season 1 Part 2 will be revealed later, where we will learn more about The Thing and Human Torch.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>Sega and Ryu Ga Gotoku have released footage of the upcoming Virtua Fighter project, which was first shown at CES 2025. However, they made it clear that the footage is not actual gameplay, and that it's just "in-game" concept footage before development began.</p><p>The quick 35-second video presents one stage that looks like a run-down city simply called The City, which is described as a "hotbed of vice, attracts both the wicked and desperate." The camera then pans out to show two characters fighting each other. Both of them are models of Akira, Virtua Fighter's mascot.</p>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a> developer Rocksteady has quietly suffered another round of layoffs, this time just before the end of 2024.
</p>
<p>
Half a dozen staff impacted by the redundancies have spoken to Eurogamer to confirm the job losses, under condition of anonymity to protect their careers. 
</p>
<p>
Roles impacted include members of Rocksteady's programming and artist teams, as well as more QA staff. 
</p>
<p>
The job losses follow an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rocksteady-hit-by-layoffs-after-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-underperforms">earlier round of redundancies at Rocksteady that Eurogamer first reported back in September</a>, when the company's QA team was nearly halved in size from 33 to 15 people. One staff member made redundant at the time said they had discovered they'd lost their job in the middle of their paternity leave.

<p>
Eurogamer has contacted Warner Bros. for comment on this latest round of layoffs, but has so far not received a response. The publisher previously did not publicly acknowledge September's layoffs, either.
</p>
<p>
2024 was a difficult year for Rocksteady, as the company continued to support Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League with the remainder of its post-launch content schedule despite low player numbers.
</p>
<p>
Warner Bros. previously said it had lost around $200m (£160m) on the game. Currently, it's unclear what Rocksteady will work on next.
</p>
<p>
In early December, the developer acknowledged <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/deathstroke-kicks-off-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-leagues-final-announced-season">it would not continue updating Suicide Squad with any new content in 2025</a>, though servers will remain online for the forseeable future.
</p>
<p>
The commercial failure of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League has seen staff lose jobs on the other side of the pond, also. December also saw <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gotham-knights-developer-warner-bros-games-montreal-slashes-99-jobs">job losses at Batman: Arkham Origins and Gotham Knights studio Warner Bros. Games Montreal,</a> where 99 jobs were reportedly eliminated. The majority of these positions are believed to have been supporting Rocksteady with additional content for Suicide Squad.

            <p>Horses - the cursed horror game from Saturnalia developer Santa Ragione and directed by Andrea Lucco Borlera - is still coming, it is just taking a little longer to get out of the gates than first anticipated.</p>
<p>Horses sees players take on the role of a summer worker at a farm. This sounds safe enough, and after all, it's only for two weeks - but there is something much darker and downright unsettling lying beneath the surface.</p>
<p>"Will you survive the summer, or will the farm claim yet another victim? In any case, we're sure your summer working experience will be truly unforgettable..." reads the official blurb.</p>

<p>Horses was initially announced back in 2023, with a suitably unsettling trailer which showed off the game's silent movie-like style and a host of naked humans with horse masks on their heads. At this time, it was slated for a release in 2024 which, obviously, has been missed.</p>
<p>Thankfully though, Horses has not been silently cancelled. Santa Ragione has confirmed to Eurogamer the upcoming game will now be released this year, and a demo is also on the cards.</p>
<p>"Unfortunately we had to delay the game to 2025," studio director Pietro Righi Riva told me. "[We're] not ready to talk about the reasons for the delay yet, but will absolutely keep you posted. By end of Q2 2025 we'll have a date for both the demo and the full release of the game."</p>
<p>So, stay tuned for more information on Horses soon.</p>

<p>Our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-weve-been-playing-indie-preview-special-edition">Chris had a go with Horses last year</a>, calling it "magnetically sinister" following time with the game.</p>
<p>"It's a simpler thing in practise than some of Santa Ragione's previous games - effectively you are waking up and slowly carrying out simple, if escalating strange tasks each day, like watering plants, feeding the dog, or, erm, burying bodies, as a story takes shape around you - but the magic here is in the atmosphere and tone," he wrote.</p>
<p>"It's also a rare attempt at using actual, suspended meaning in a game. You'll need to bring something of your own to the farmhouse table here, and meet this thing halfway."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/krafton-generative-ai-characters-pubg-inzoi<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Krafton has announced a partnership with Nvidia to introduce new companions called "Co-Playable Characters" to Krafton's games, and yes, they're powered by generative AI, because of course they are.</p>

<p>In a press release, the two companies say that Co-Playable Characters, or CPCs, are "powered by on-device Small Language Models" and that they have the potential to "interact with players in deeper ways than traditional NPCs".</p>

<p>This is because CPCs are apparently "equipped with the ability to understand and cooperate with users"; according to Krafton and Nvidia, CPCs will "understand and respond to game situations in a human-like manner", although given what I've seen of the&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>player base, I'm not sure I want that.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pubg-krafton-ai-characters-door.jpg?itok=kLSKyQC2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pubg-krafton-ai-characters-door.jpg?itok=_B5Ll4Eq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Krafton will soon introduce AI-powered companions to&nbsp;<em>PUBG</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>It's not just&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>itself that's getting these AI-powered characters, either. According to the press release, Krafton intends to introduce CPCs "across its gaming portfolio", so you can expect to see these characters in&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>spinoffs too, as well as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/inzoi-release-date-delayed" rel="nofollow">upcoming life sim&nbsp;<em>inZoi</em></a>.</p>

<p>Only&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>inZoi&nbsp;</em>are mentioned, so we don't know if Krafton is also planning to introduce CPCs to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hi-fi-rush-2-krafton-ceo" rel="nofollow">the likes of&nbsp;<em>Hi-Fi Rush 2</em></a>&nbsp;or <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/subnautica-2-early-access-2025-co-op" rel="nofollow"><em>Subnautica 2</em></a>, but I can't possibly imagine how having an AI inanely yammering away to me while I'm rhythmically smashing goons to pieces could help.</p>

<p>Krafton CEO Changhan Kim says that Nvidia's AI technology, which will power CPCs, is "poised to redefine the future of gaming", while Nvidia developer relations VP Keita Iida says Krafton's CPCs will bring "new, unique experiences" to games. Hmm.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/krafton-ai-characters-inzoi.jpg?itok=CB6fpefb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/krafton-ai-characters-inzoi.jpg?itok=pCzDb0ww 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Krafton's life sim&nbsp;<em>inZoi&nbsp;</em>will also include AI-powered "Co-Playable Characters".</figcaption></figure><p>Krafton might be wholeheartedly embracing AI - and it's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-working-hard-on-using-ai-to-make-npc-and-worlds-more-alive-reactive-and" rel="nofollow">far from the only company</a> in gaming <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-hopes-to-use-generative-ai-to-drive-more-monetization-and-make-development-30-more" rel="nofollow">to be doing so</a> - but the technology isn't impressing everyone.</p>

<p>Last month, for instance,&nbsp;<em>BioShock&nbsp;</em>creator Ken Levine <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bioshock-creator-ken-levine-generative-ai" rel="nofollow">said he wasn't "overly impressed"</a> by generative AI, suggesting that while it could certainly perform mundane tasks related to coding and other technical aspects of game development, it wasn't suitable to be used for creative purposes.</p>

<p>Similarly, gaming giant Nintendo declared last year that it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-generative-ai-no-plans" rel="nofollow">currently has no plans</a> to use generative AI to develop its games, citing issues with intellectual property rights infringement as well as a desire to deliver "value that is unique to [Nintendo]".</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338028/lenovo-legion-go-s-steam-windows<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Lenovo is trying an experiment. In May, it will officially become the very first company outside of Valve to ship a handheld gaming PC with the Steam Deck’s wonderfully pick-up-and-play SteamOS instead of Microsoft Windows. And at $499, it’ll be a true Steam Deck rival, joining it as one of the lower-priced PC handhelds you can buy.</p><p>That handheld will be the 1.6-pound Lenovo Legion Go S, a new and improved version of the company’s eight-inch handheld that ditches the Nintendo Switch-like detachable gamepads and kickstand for a lighter and more traditional design, with a sculpted grip that felt supremely comfortable in my hands. </p><div tabindex="0" aria-label="Zoom" role="button"><p>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->10</p><div><figcaption><em>Our Legion Go S gallery, including size comparisons to the Steam Deck.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Photo by Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge</cite></p></div></div><p>It’ll also be one of the few handhelds on the market to offer a 120Hz variable refresh rate screen — a highly desirable feature that lets low-power handheld gameplay feel smooth, even if it’s not generating lots of frames. That screen will be lower in resolution at 1920 x 1200, too, and feature a <em>hopefully</em> power-sipping <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337300/amd-ryzen-z2-z2-extreme-z2-go">new AMD Ryzen Z2 Go chip</a>. (It’s a Lenovo-exclusive chip, by the way.)</p><p>In other words, it might address every major complaint I had <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24088011/lenovo-legion-go-review">in my Legion Go review</a>, while additionally adding fun configurable RGB lighting around the joysticks, a slightly larger 55Wh battery, a pair of levers to reduce the throw of the triggers, and a less obtrusive touchpad, too, while retaining the dual USB 4 ports.</p><p>But Lenovo isn’t going all in on SteamOS. Not only will it hedge its bets by shipping a Windows version of the Legion Go S as well but it’ll also ship with Windows <em>this month</em> — four months ahead of the SteamOS models. The Windows model is white:</p><div tabindex="0" aria-label="Zoom" role="button"><p>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->6</p><div><figcaption><em>Our Lenovo Legion Go S Windows gallery, including this comparison shot with the original Legion Go.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Photo by Antonio G. Di Benedetto</cite></p></div></div><p>It’s not like the SteamOS model is ready now anyhow. Valve codesigners Lawrence Yang and Pierre-Loup Griffais tell me they’ve only been working with Lenovo for a couple of months, and the integration isn’t quite done. The new touchpad, gyroscope, and both RGB lighting and TDP configuration options are among the things on their to-do list. </p><p>But the Windows version shipping in January will cost $729.99, with 32GB of RAM and 1TB of storage. In May, the true experiment will begin when gamers can pick between a $499.99 SteamOS version with 16GB / 512GB, a $599.99 Windows version with 16GB / 1TB, or the Steam Deck and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23951655/steam-deck-oled-review">Steam Deck OLED</a> at $399 and $549, respectively. </p><p>And it does sound like there will be one important reason to pick the Steam Deck over the Legion Go S and vice versa, because AMD’s Z2 Go is a different chip. While the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337300/amd-ryzen-z2-z2-extreme-z2-go">Z2 Go announced yesterday sheds cores and GPU generations</a> to be slightly more akin to the Steam Deck’s semi-custom Aerith and / or Sephiroth parts, we noted that it targets higher power levels, and Legion Go product manager Alex Zhu confirms to me that the Legion Go S is aimed at 20-watt performance, 30-watt, maybe even 40-watt configurable performance, which will likely offer higher performance (and lower battery life) than the 15-watt-and-below Steam Deck’s chip. </p><p>Zhu says Lenovo is targeting between two and 2.5 hours of battery life in demanding heavy games — which lines up with the basic math of dividing a 55 watt-hour battery by 20 watts, assuming the rest of the system doesn’t eat up a lot more. Versions with AMD’s existing Z1 Extreme chip will also be available in some markets. All Legion Go S can fit full-length M.2 2280 solid state drives.</p><p>BTW, Valve isn’t keeping key Steam Deck features like precompiled shaders to itself, or anything else, for that matter. Yang and Griffais say it will be one SteamOS, and the Legion Go S and any future SteamOS devices will get the same updates as the Deck, minus hardware-specific tweaks.</p><p>Valve tells me Lenovo is currently its only partner for a SteamOS device — there are no other third-party SteamOS devices currently in the works. But Griffais hints that Valve is close to publicly releasing a new beta of its SteamOS that <em>just might possibly</em> start working on other handhelds as well. (Valve previously confirmed to us that it was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/13/24219469/valve-steamos-asus-rog-ally-steady-progress-dual-boot">building toward some level of support for the Asus ROG Ally</a> in SteamOS as well.)</p><p>And it’s vaguely possible that SteamOS beta could arrive before the SteamOS Legion Go S — Valve says it’s slated to ship sometime after March. </p><p>But the real dream is to pull a PC handheld out of a box and have it just work, the way a Nintendo Switch works, not to shoehorn an operating system on it afterward, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/30/24329005/bazzite-asus-rog-ally-x-steam-os-editorial">no matter how good the result</a>. That’s why Lenovo is working with Valve: Zhu agrees that SteamOS has the best out-of-box experience. But, he says, Windows offers a whole ecosystem of gaming and productivity that the company believes its customers still want.</p><p>Zhu agrees that SteamOS is an experiment for Lenovo and says it’ll look at the feedback and momentum before making its next move. Speaking of what’s next, Lenovo is also building a larger Legion Go 2 with detachable controllers and an 8.8-inch OLED screen, and it brought prototypes of that unit to CES:</p><div><figcaption><em>The new Legion Go 2 prototype, with a smaller kickstand and more sculpted grips.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Photo by Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge</cite></p></div><div><p><cite>Photo by Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>Zhu tells me Lenovo doesn’t have “any specific plans” to put SteamOS on the larger Legion Go, just Windows — but perhaps it depends on what customers buy in May.</p><p>Meanwhile, Valve is still looking ahead to a future version of its own Steam Deck, saying that partnering with companies like Lenovo hasn’t reduced the desire to build its own. But AMD’s Z2 isn’t <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/21/23884863/valve-steam-deck-2-refresh-upgrade-cpu-2025">the “leap” that Valve’s been waiting for</a>, Griffais tells <em>The Verge. </em>There won’t be a Z2 Steam Deck. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

To anyone who hasn’t played the games and doesn’t know who Abby is, she’s the co-protagonist of <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>, though developer Naughty Dog kept her mostly a secret until the game launched in 2020. We see Abby walking down a dark hallway with a loaded pistol in hand. We get a brief glimpse of her Firefly tags hanging around her neck as a siren blares through the halls.</p><p>If you did play <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>, you know this is Abby looking for her father in the aftermath of Joel’s escape, in the same hospital where Joel went on a killing spree at the end of season one. HBO’s marketing doesn’t seem to be playing coy with Abby’s Firefly ties like Naughty Dog did in <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>, so we’ll see if it actually tries to maintain the game’s twists and turns.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="fd45770271a13c1a46cfd1890166114b" data-recommend-id="image://fd45770271a13c1a46cfd1890166114b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Isaac looks up at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Isaac looks up at something off-screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fd45770271a13c1a46cfd1890166114b" data-recommend-id="image://fd45770271a13c1a46cfd1890166114b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Isaac looks up at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There’s not a lot of plot to glean from the action montage that follows this scene of Abby.

Because of <em>events</em>, Dina accompanies Ellie on her revenge quest to Seattle, and we see the pair running from, presumably, infected in the city. However, we also see the two slow dancing and looking lovingly into each other’s eyes. Fans will know this scene as taking place at a dance in Jackson and as one of the first moments Naughty Dog released to the public <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btmN-bWwv0A&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btmN-bWwv0A" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">way back in 2018</a></span>. Chronologically, this happens just before the bulk of <em>The Last of Us Part II</em> but isn’t shown to the player until near the end. The sequel is flashback-heavy, and this sequence is one of the last ones the player sees after Ellie returns home from Seattle where most of the game takes place, so if this scene is going to be in season two, it’s another implication that the show is tweaking the sequence of events. The first season was a pretty faithful retelling of the original game’s story (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-hbo-bill-frank-gay-nick-offerman-bartlett-1850035741&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-hbo-bill-frank-gay-nick-offerman-bartlett-1850035741">with a few exceptions</a></span>), so I expected the second season to follow suit. Across all three trailers, there haven’t been that many scenes that don’t seem lifted straight from&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us Part II</em>’s events beyond <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-season-two-hbo-max-joel-catherine-o-hara-1851612956&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-season-two-hbo-max-joel-catherine-o-hara-1851612956">Joel’s apparent therapy sessions</a></span>, but it seems like it might be playing with the structure a bit. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="0b0a58dfa97ba26aba4baee352e2437f" data-recommend-id="image://0b0a58dfa97ba26aba4baee352e2437f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ellie points a gun at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ellie points a gun at something off-screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0b0a58dfa97ba26aba4baee352e2437f" data-recommend-id="image://0b0a58dfa97ba26aba4baee352e2437f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ellie points a gun at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>A lot of this trailer is re-used footage from the last two. We again see Joel crying in therapy, Ellie screaming out on what looks like a hospital bed, and the Infected attacking Jackson. Given that I was just giving the show shit for seemingly spoiling Abby’s identity in a trailer, I can commend the restraint. As for the flashes of new footage, there’s a moment that looks like it might be the scene in which Ellie tracks Nora, one of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-hbo-max-show-manny-mel-nora-owen-abby-actors-1851300984&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-hbo-max-show-manny-mel-nora-owen-abby-actors-1851300984">Abby’s friends</a></span> played by <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/intergalactic-heretic-prophet-naughty-dog-ps5-actors-1851722128&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/intergalactic-heretic-prophet-naughty-dog-ps5-actors-1851722128"><em>Intergalactic</em></a></span><em> </em>star Tati Gabrielle in the show, into an infected nest. We don’t see the WLF medic, but the scene is distinct for its use of stark red lighting and its focus on Ellie as she approaches. We can see Ellie pointing a gun at someone on the ground in front of her with this distinct lighting and framing. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="cd221274492f95737044cc2abf1fcee8" data-recommend-id="image://cd221274492f95737044cc2abf1fcee8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A cloud of smoke rises from the ground with black text reading &quot;SEASON II APRIL&quot; in front of it." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A cloud of smoke rises from the ground with black text reading &quot;SEASON II APRIL&quot; in front of it." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="cd221274492f95737044cc2abf1fcee8" data-recommend-id="image://cd221274492f95737044cc2abf1fcee8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A cloud of smoke rises from the ground with black text reading &quot;SEASON II APRIL&quot; in front of it." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The final shot shows a flare being thrown into an otherwise dark area.

Razer claims the feature will allow for "full graphical fidelity" while streaming, and it uses Razer Sensa HD Haptics to add rumble and other tactile feedback while playing. Razer is demoing the PC Remote Play feature at its booth for CES attendees, and the beta is expected to roll out to the Razer Nexus app soon.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4423677-razerremoteplay.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4423677" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4423677-razerremoteplay.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4423677"></a><figcaption>Razer PC Remote Play on Kishi Ultra</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4423677-razerremoteplay.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">In the meantime, it's worth upgrading your mobile cloud gaming setup with the Razer Kishi Ultra controller to take advantage of the new PC streaming feature.

The device works with select Android phones, tablets, and Apple devices with a USB-C port, including the iPhone 15, iPhone 16, and iPad Mini a17 Pro.

                <p>With CES 2025 in full swing, one of the more intriguing exhibits at the trade show is a proof-of-concept entertainment experience from Sony. The PlayStation company is currently showing off what a future gaming room could look and smell like, as it's demoing what is essentially the closest thing possible to a Star Trek holodeck.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eT9kFiI14as" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/eT9kFiI14as" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>According to Sony, the Future Immersive Entertainment Concept combines Crystal LED panels, audio, haptics, scent, and atmospherics with a PlayStation game like The Last of Us to create an interactive experience. You could compare this to a 4D version of Duck Hunt but with people horribly mutated by a fictional cordyceps fungus instead of mallards, and we don't even want to know what rotting mushroom-monsters smell like in a world bereft of personal hygiene products.</p><p>Visually, it's a convincing step into that bleak world thanks to the realistic graphics. This isn't the first time that Sony has revealed conceptual gaming hardware, as back in May 2024, the company showed off a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonys-idea-for-a-future-playstation-controller-looks-like-it-came-straight-out-of-minority-report/1100-6523664/" data-ref-id="1100-6523664">high-tech PlayStation controller</a> in a promotional video, teasing a radical departure from the standard DualSense device.</p><p>In other The Last of Us news, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-season-2-gets-an-april-2025-release-window-in-new-trailer/1100-6528664/" data-ref-id="1100-6528664">a new teaser trailer for the second season</a> of the HBO live-action adaptation of the game has debuted this week, and has also confirmed a release window of April 2025 for the show. Developer Naughty Dog has also hinted at continuing the game series with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-3-sounds-more-likely-than-ever/1100-6520812/" data-ref-id="1100-6520812">The Last of Us Part 3</a> and the studio is currently working on a sci-fi adventure called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-is-the-next-very-different-naughty-dog-game/1100-6528421/" data-ref-id="1100-6528421">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a>.</p>

One analyst has now said the game is so momentous that it could "reshape the gaming industry," similar to how 2013's Grand Theft Auto 5 made a massive mark.</p><p>"While the market landscape has evolved, Rockstar's legacy of delivering groundbreaking experiences ensures that GTA 6 will leave a lasting mark," Newzoo analyst Emmanuel Rosier told <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/switch-2-finally-gta-6-to-dominate-ai-in-game-dev-again-analysts-predictions-for-2025" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GI.biz</a>. Rosier went on to say that GTA 5 benefited from launching into a mature market for PS3 and Xbox 360. GTA 6, meanwhile, is set to launch relatively earlier into the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S lifecycles.</p><p>"Rockstar's history of crafting genre-defining titles positions GTA 6 to set new industry standards. Yet, its challenge lies in navigating a gaming world increasingly dominated by live-service titles. How Rockstar adapts the Grand Theft Auto formula to this evolving landscape will not only determine GTA 6's success but may also redefine the future of open-world gaming," Rosier said.</p><div

continue to play GTA Online for older machines while GTA 6 for newer consoles is in the market.</p><p>To be clear, Rockstar Games has not officially announced what may happen to GTA Online when GTA 6 comes out. But given the massive and enduring success of GTA Online, it stands to reason that GTA 6 will feature an online mode of some kind.</p><p>Harding-Rolls went on to say that he expects GTA 6 to be the "largest entertainment release of all time" based on revenue at launch. Recently, DFC Intelligence predicted <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5-could-make-3-billion-in-first-year-alone/1100-6528605/" data-ref-id="1100-6528605">first-year sales of 40 million copies and more than $3 billion in revenue for GTA 6. </a></p><p>DFC also predicted that Rockstar will release new versions of GTA 6 for the next Xbox and PlayStation consoles, in addition to PC, which may help the game continue to sell over time. Just recently, a report emerged that said the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-xbox-rumored-to-launch-in-2026-with-new-call-of-duty/1100-6528636/" data-ref-id="1100-6528636">next Xbox is codenamed Xbox Prime and could debut in 2026</a>. Sony, meanwhile, is said to be working on the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps6-powered-by-familiar-chipmaker-report/1100-6526499/" data-ref-id="1100-6526499">PlayStation 6.</a></p><p>GTA 6 is set for release in Fall 2025. Not everyone believes the game will make it out on time, considering <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-is-scheduled-for-2025-but-rockstar-has-a-history-of-delays/1100-6519700/" data-ref-id="1100-6519700">every Rockstar release in the past 10 years has been delayed.</a></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/native-geforce-now-app-coming-to-steam-deck-later-this-year.1076106/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/geforce-now-steam-deck-app-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nvidia has announced that it's bringing a native GeForce Now app to Steam Deck devices later this year, allowing you to access the cloud gaming subscription service on your handheld device more easily.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/geforce-now-ces-2025/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a> announcing the new app, Nvidia says Steam Deck users can look forward to "up to 4K resolution and 60 frames per second with high dynamic range" when connected to an external display.</p>

<p>It's technically already possible to access GeForce Now via your Steam Deck, but you have to use what essentially amounts to a workaround; in <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/geforce-now-thursday-may-games-list/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">May last year</a>, Nvidia released a custom script that installs Google Chrome onto your Deck, then "adds all the settings needed" for GeForce Now streaming via that browser.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nvidia-geforce-now-steam-deck-app-cyberpunk.jpg?itok=Ufr9mfet 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nvidia-geforce-now-steam-deck-app-cyberpunk.jpg?itok=Lm9gnORb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The GeForce Now app for Steam Deck will let you stream games at up to 4k and 60fps.</figcaption></figure><p>As Nvidia points out, your Steam Deck will theoretically draw less power if it's streaming a game from the cloud than if it's using its own internals, although I'd imagine Steam Deck users will want to wait for the app to land so they can see that for themselves.</p>

<p>Of course, you will also need a GeForce Now subscription if you want to stream games via this new app, and given that Nvidia is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/geforce-now-monthly-playtime-limit-2025" rel="nofollow">imposing a 100-hour monthly playtime limit</a> across all of its tiers this month, that may not be a particularly enticing prospect for you.</p>

<p>Still, this seems like a pretty neat way to circumvent the Steam Deck's relatively low power, and it might even help you get past things like the&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/apex-legends-bans-linux" rel="nofollow"><em>Apex Legends&nbsp;</em>Steam Deck ban</a>&nbsp;(which is technically a Linux-wide ban), although given that the GeForce Now app will be Steam Deck-native, that seems a touch unlikely.</p>




<p>In any case, you'll be able to check out the native GeForce Now app for Steam Deck when it launches later this year. We don't have a full release date for it yet, so watch this space for more info.</p>

You’re probably familiar with DLSS, Nvidia’s upscaling technology that squeezes even better resolutions at higher framerates out of existing computing resources, but the company is now also touting RTX Neural Shaders which will use machine learning to compress textures and free up even more processing power for other stuff.</p><p>The 5080 and 5090 are both available later this month, while the 5070 and 5070 Ti will ship in February. Here are the prices:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>GeForce RTX 5070 - $550</li><li>GeForce RTX 5070 Ti - $ 750</li><li>GeForce RTX 5080 - $1,000</li><li>GeForce RTX 5090 - $2,000</li></ul></blockquote><p>The big thing to note here is that Nvidia is promising big results even from the low-end budget card. All cards are supposed to be twice as fast on average as their corresponding predecessors, and  Huang even claimed that this year’s $550 RTX 5070 would be as effective in practice as the previous $1,600 RTX 4090, seemingly due to machine learning and other optimizations. </p><p>At the high end, Nvidia showed a graph promising double the performance of the RTX 4090 from the newer (and only $400 more expensive) RTX 5090 across games like <em>Alan Wake 2</em> and <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>. The company even showed <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> running at over double the framerate with full raytracing enabled, because one can never have too many frames when navigating Night City’s treacherous underworld. </p><p>But while the 5090 is a power hog, it’s not quite the hulking big boy that it’s predecessor was. The 4090 founder’s edition was a three-slot card that weighed over five pounds. The 5090 will only be two slots, allowing it to fit into more compact PC builds at launch. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It’s tough trying to follow previous efforts, but the biggest and best games in 2025 offer hope. From stellar AAA behemoths to long-time-coming remakes and remasters, there’s a lot to be excited about. However, we start from the beginning with January 2025’s biggest releases.</p>



<p>2024 continually got better, leaving us to salivate at another jaw-dropping year at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/every-winner-the-game-awards-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards 2024</a>. Last year is in the rearview mirror, and it’s time to shine the light ahead at what’s to come. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/grand-theft-auto-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GTA 6</a> is lurking somewhere, ready to sweep up every award and penny from our pockets, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-everything-we-know/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> is camouflaged and coming for the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-remakes-and-remasters-coming-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best remake</a> crown, and there’s an FPS that could spell <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/doom-the-dark-ages-will-be-on-xbox-and-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DOOM</a> for all of us.</p>



<p>I’m already trembling with fear at how expensive this year could be. Let’s start with January 2025, and its biggest games to set the stage for the rest.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-games-coming-in-2025">Best Games Coming in 2025</h2>



<p>Release dates can change—even at the last second—but I feel confident in declaring these to be January’s biggest games. I’ve also provided their release dates for you to mark on your new 2025 calendar.</p>

<p>January 2025 is a very remaster and port-friendly month. Nevertheless, I never tire of Donkey Kong’s underrated and punishing difficulty. Nintendo is giving Donkey Kong Country Returns HD at least one more port, this time for the Nintendo Switch. With the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-joy-cons-have-seemingly-surfaced-online/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch 2 rumors</a> growing—and my belief <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/we-desperately-need-the-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we need a Nintendo Switch 2</a>—this might be the last chance to collect, swing, smash, and bash in Country Returns before it finally makes way for a new entry.</p>



<h3 id="h-dynasty-warriors-origins-january-17">Dynasty Warriors: Origins — January 17</h3>

<p>I couldn’t tell you the first thing about Dynasty Warriors: Origins—or the series. Every time I see one though, I think, “This looks fun.” Origins’ trailers and gameplay reveals boast even more obscene on-screen soldier counts and epic battles. Dynasty Warriors producer and director Tomohiko Sho told <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/dynasty-warriors-10000-soldiers-tokyo-game-show-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Gamer</a>, “The team set themselves the goal of having <strong>10,000 soldiers on screen at a given time</strong>.” Even if it doesn’t quite hit this number, it looks widely impressive nonetheless.</p>



<h3 id="h-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-january-23">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth — January 23</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-release-date-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth PC release date</a> is one to watch. Rebirth may have already been out for nearly a year, but that’s no excuse to miss this masterpiece. It may have underperformed in sales, but I believe <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/year-in-review-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-deserves-more-love/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rebirth deserved better</a>—in terms of sales and awards—and PC players are getting a superior version of the JRPG. The port features DLSS, Enhanced Textures &amp; Modeling, Improved Lighting, and VRR. Queen’s Blood has never looked so vibrant.</p>



<h3 id="h-sniper-elite-resistance-january-30">Sniper Elite: Resistance — January 30</h3>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sniper-elite-resistance-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sniper Elite: Resistance</a> is a rare, new AAA game in January 2025. Rebellion is back at it again with its sniper-gore-fused third-person shooter. I say gore because I’ve seen enough horrifying killcams from the franchise down the years to make me wince at the thought of them. More mission variety and creativity are promised as you seek to neutralize Germany’s secret Wunderwaffe&nbsp;weapon—and Sniper Elite: Resistance is a day one Game Pass launch.</p>



<h3 id="h-marvel-s-spider-man-2-january-30">Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 — January 30</h3>

<p>One final port rounds off our biggest games of January 2025 list—Marvel’s Spider-Man 2. Spidey and Miles (and Venom) are surfing the web to the realm of computers with this polished port. Like Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-marvels-spider-man-2-release-date-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Spider-Man 2 PC release</a> boasts improvements and upgrades on the original—<strong>Enhanced ray-tracing options</strong> being the news here.</p>
