<p>Another EVO 2025 announcement this weekend has been shared by the team behind <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/under_night_in-birth_ii_sysceles">UNDER NIGHT IN-BIRTH II Sys:Celes</a>.</p>
<p>It confirms the third additional character in the Season Pass, Izumi, will arrive later this month on <strong>19th August 2025</strong>. This character follows on from Ogre (who arrived earlier this year in February) and Uzuki (who joined the roster last July).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The "Initiator" of the Final Act joins the battle under the dark veil!"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you haven't played this particular entry in the series before, this is the first game to include rollback netcode. It also includes all new move and battle systems to further evolve the fight as well as HD pixel graphics.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/critical-role-announces-brennan-lee-mulligan-as-campaign-4-dm-release-date-in-october</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/critical-role-announces-brennan-lee-mulligan-as-campaign-4-gm-release-date-in-october.1260792/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>Update:</strong> In addition to the news from the official press release more was available as part of the Critical Role Direct.</p>

<p>The first piece of confirmation is that while Matthew Mercer will be stepping back from the GM chair for Critical Role Campaign 4 he will still be at the table, getting to be a full time player. While no other players were explicitly confirmed for the Campaign 4 table Matt did state that he would be playing "alongside [his] favorite familiar faces and a number of newer ones that I cannot wait to reveal to you."</p>

<p>It was also <a href="https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/critical-role-brennan-lee-mulligan-campaign-4-1236477230/" rel="nofollow">revealed via a Variety interview</a> that Brennan Lee Mulligan also just struck a new three-year development deal with Dropout so don't expect him to be leaving Dimension20 and the dome anytime soon.</p>

<p>In his interview with Variety, Mulligan teases that there is an announcement of what game system will be in use "scheduled and on route" but stayed tight-lipped on anything further.</p>


<hr><p>The Critical Role Direct has now released, and with it the confirmation of a release date for Critical Role Campaign 4, but also the confirmation about some details of who will be the GM for this game, and where it will take place‚Ä¶ or at least where it WON'T take place.</p>



<p>Fans of Critical Role will be able to tune in and watch the first episode of Critical Role Campaign 4 when it returns to Thursday nights on October 2nd, 2025. At the time of posting, we're exactly two months away from this premiere.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/cr_founders_credit_mikeschmidt.jpg?itok=95B80vCp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/cr_founders_credit_mikeschmidt.jpg?itok=D5lS-6k5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The much more unexpected news of this reveal is that <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a9a9913f-42e9-4189-bbde-08061c01a7e8" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/matthew-mercer-interview" rel="nofollow">Matthew Mercer</a>, Dungeon Master for the previous three campaigns and CCO of Critical Role Productions, will not be the Game Master for Critical Role campaign 4. Instead, <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="55a80c6c-ea7c-4151-9523-d332db6f6cd5" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/how-brennan-lee-mulligan-created-never-stop-blowing-up-love-letter-to-80s" rel="nofollow">Brennan Lee Mulligan will be taking up the role of Game Master</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been enormous fans of Brennan‚Äôs for many years now, and when it came to giving both Matthew Mercer and the world of Exandria a bit of a breather, Brennan felt like the perfect storyteller to take our community somewhere entirely new.‚Äù - Travis Willingham, CEO, co-founder, and cast member of Critical Role</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The statement from Willingham also reveals that Campaign 4 will not take place in Exandria, the world of Mercer's creation that has been the home for each main Campaign and various spin-offs like <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="4dc0a217-e28f-4919-887d-2ef0511e836a" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/taliesin-jaffe-talks-asha-of-critical-role-downfall-monk-builds-and-what-ashton" rel="nofollow">EXU: Downfall</a>. This is further backed up by Marisha Ray, Creative Director and Co-Founder of Critical Role, stating, "Everything about Campaign 4 is fresh; new world, new tone, new possibilities. We can‚Äôt wait for the fans to experience what we‚Äôve been building.‚Äù</p>

<p>Brennan Lee Mulligan is in no way a stranger to the Critical Role table, being not only a player but also the Dungeon Master in a number of spin-off settings. Mulligan had the following to say on the announcement and his taking on the GM role for Critical Role Campaign 4.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"What a gift, a privilege and an honor to be invited behind the screen of Critical Role for this next epic adventure. Every collaboration we have had together has brought nothing but sheer joy, and Campaign 4 will be no exception. I'm finally playing *almost* as much tabletop as I'd like to!"</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Will Critical Role Campaign 4 be <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> or <em>Daggerheart</em>?</h2>

<p>While this announcement answered a few questions that fans had been clamouring to find out about the future of Critical Role, it does certainly leave a number still unanswered.</p>

<p>Who will be playing in Campaign 4? Will Matt have a chance to play at the table or focus on continued world-building? Is Robbie Daymond going to be back at the table? Will Campaign 4 be as long as a standard multi-year Campaign of Critical Role?</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/critical-role-age-of-umbra.jpg?itok=gw7DfDfW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/critical-role-age-of-umbra.jpg?itok=Tu9e6n2N 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Perhaps the biggest question left unanswered is whether Critical Role Campaign 4 will use <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3579fb91-ffa9-4c99-a750-de9f92ba642f" href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> as the previous campaigns have, or if they'll move on to <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="951117a2-07e4-403b-b1c3-26041d599e45" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/daggerheart-review-narrative-forward-yes-and-ttrpg-that-is-force-to-be-reckoned" rel="nofollow"><em>Daggerheart</em></a>, Critical Role and Darrington Press' newly released TTRPG. It is curious that the press release and announcement only use generic terms such as 'Game Master' and 'TTRPGs'.</p>

<p>With the <a href="https://www.daggerheart.com/gencon2025-announcements/" rel="nofollow">announcement of a second season of Age of Umbra</a>, a <em>Daggerheart </em>campaign in a Grimdark setting that Mercer designed, it may be that Mercer is continuing to work on <em>Daggerheart </em>adventures while Mulligan spins stories in a world built for <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>.</p>

<p>TechRaptor reached out to Critical Role for any potential answers but were advised that at this time the Campaign 4 release date and that Brennan Lee Mulligan would be helming the table were all they were ready to talk about. There are two months to go until the release of Critical Role Campaign 4 so be on the lookout for announcements related to the setting, cast, and more.</p>

        <p>A BioShock 1 remake has also reportedly been cancelled.</p>

    </div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Cloud Chamber, the studio tasked with reviving the decade-dormant <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bioshock">BioShock</a> series, has reportedly failed an internal review with 2K Games execs, resulting in a leadership shakeup.</p>
<p>Anonymous sources speaking to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-01/next-bioshock-game-changes-leaders-after-development-turmoil">Bloomberg</a> said it was the game's narrative, in particular, that apparently failed to impress, and was "identified as an area in need of improvement [that] will be revamped in the coming months".</p>

<p>Following the review, studio head Kelley Gilmore was ousted, and creative director Hogarth de la Plante moved into "a publishing role". The rest of the Cloud Chamber team was told in an all-hands meeting that the company needed "to become more agile and efficient". Colleagues are now worried that cuts may follow.</p>
<p>In response to the report, a 2K spokesperson acknowledged the change at the top of the studio to Bloomberg, saying it remained "fully committed to ensuring we deliver a BioShock game that exceeds the lofty expectations of our fans".</p>
<p>"We are working hard to set BioShock up for the best possible future," 2K Games said in a statement. "Right now, we have a good game, but we are committed to delivering a great one. We are working closely with leadership at the studio to define this path."</p>
<p>Sadly, there's even more bad news for BioShock fans. Right at the end of the report, Bloomberg confirmed both the existence - and the cancellation - of a remake of the first BioShock game. It's unclear why the project was cancelled, but sources say it was shelved earlier in the year.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflixs-bioshock-adaptation-will-be-a-more-personal-film-as-opposed-to-a-grander-big-project">Netflix's BioShock adaptation was similarly "reconfigured" last year</a> to be a "more personal" film with a tighter budget. Producer Roy Lee told fans at a panel at last year's San Diego Comic-Con that changes at the top of Netflix's movie department have seen the budget streamlined, so "we're doing a much smaller version... It's going to be a more personal point of view, as opposed to a grander, big project".</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/bioshock-4-fails-to-impress-at-internal-2k-review-resulting-in-leadership-shake-up-and-revamped-narrartive]]></content:encoded>

            <p>GOG has launched an all-new project to raise awareness of censorship in gaming: <a href="https://items.gog.com/freedomtobuy/index.html">FreedomToBuy.Games</a>.</p>
<p>The digital games platform, which has long been campaigning for the better preservation of DRM-free games, said it believes that "if a game is legal and responsibly made, players should be able to enjoy it today ‚Äì and decades from now".</p>
<p>Consequently, for the next 28-ish hours or so at the time of writing, it is offering up 13 games for free ‚Äì including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/postal-2">Postal 2</a>, Agony, and House Party ‚Äì "because if a game is legal, you should be free to buy it".</p> <div>

<p>"Thanks to the dedication of developers and publishers, we are launching FreedomToBuy.games," the company said in a statement. "To raise awareness on censorship in gaming, 13 games are now available for free for 48h as a part of stand for creative freedom and preservation.</p>
<p>"We believe that if a game is legal and responsibly made, players should be able to enjoy it today ‚Äì and decades from now. It‚Äôs our statement: when games are delisted today because of discomfort, reviving them tomorrow becomes exponentially harder."</p>
<p>The campaign comes after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/itchio-deindexes-all-nsfw-games-blames-same-anti-porn-group-that-campaigned-against-steam">itch.io creators began reporting their NSFW games were no longer being displayed in search results on the platform</a> in June. Shortly thereafter, we learned itch.io had "deindexed" all NSFW content following discussions with payment processors contacted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/we-approached-payment-processors-because-steam-did-not-respond-australian-pressure-group-collective-shout-claims-responsibility-for-steam-and-itchio-nsfw-game-removal">the same Australian pressure group that recently targeted Steam</a>, which similarly <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/steam-introduces-vague-new-rules-banning-certain-kinds-of-adult-content-to-appease-credit-card-companies">"retired" unspecified NSFW titles and introduced vague new rules banning "certain kinds of adult content" from its own PC storefront</a>.</p>
<p>GOG <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gog-announces-preservation-program-aims-to-maintain-game-compatibility-with-modern-and-future-systems">announced its Preservation Program last November</a>, when 100 games were part of the line-up.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="The Adventures of Elliot: The Millennium Tales" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/79ddf65dd41c1/the-adventures-of-elliot-the-millennium-tales.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Two of my favourite games growing up were <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/legend_of_zelda_a_link_to_the_past">The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/secret_of_mana">Secret of Mana</a>. Lush green worlds, curious ‚Äî and sometimes cute ‚Äî enemies, and fluid action combat for the time; as someone who had largely only played turn-based RPGs for the first eight years of their life, the SNES era of action RPGs showed me a glimpse of what video games were capable of. These games in particular made me feel bold and adventurous, and whenever I revisit them as an adult, they fill me with a childlike sense of wonder.</p>
<p>So I am very much the target audience for the upcoming action RPG, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/adventures-of-elliot-the-millennium-tales">The Adventures of Elliot: The Millennium Tales</a>. I adore HD-2D, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/octopath_traveler_ii">Octopath Traveler II</a> is one of my favourite Switch games and RPGs of all time. But at the same time, I wanted Team Asano and Square Enix to do something a little different with this beautiful art style; <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/talking-point-is-it-time-for-hd-2d-to-take-a-break">I was a little worried about the direction it seemed to be taking</a>.</p>
<p>Still, I wasted no time downloading the demo after the July Partner Showcase, and even after spending two hours with it, and recognising a few kinks that need to be ironed out, The Adventures of Elliot feels like a shot in the arm for this aesthetic style, and I'm itching for more.</p>

<p>Like Octopath before it, The Adventures of Elliot is aiming to recapture some of that SNES magic, but in the action department rather than the turn-based. Think <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/illusion_of_gaia">Illusion of Gaia</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/terranigma">Terranigma</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/ys_iii_wanderers_from_ys">Ys III</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/megadrive/beyond_oasis">Beyond Oasis</a>; all of that ilk feed into top-down Japanese-developed action RPG history, and it's on show here. But the Zelda love is overwhelming ‚Äî after all, the eponymous hero is wearing red instead of green, he has a fairy companion, you can throw pots... it's all here, just with a few unique wrinkles.</p>
<p>The best part of the Debut Demo is the world itself. Exploring this small corner of Philabieldia (not a typo) is extremely moreish for me, and gives us a little insight into what's to come. Of course, the first thing I did was cut some grass, but while mowing the lawn, I ignored my quest marker and headed south towards a desert area, where I found cracked walls to bomb and shrubs to remove. I found a challenge tomb which gave me a health increase along the way, too. Eventually, I stumbled into a cave, which acted like a miniature dungeon.</p>
<p>There are combat rooms to clear and a few puzzle-platforming sections which forced me to consider the dungeon's layout; dropping down certain sand dunes took me to lower floors, but certain areas were only accessible by dropping down certain holes. The last dungeon of the demo does something similar with lily pads and switches. All standard stuff, but made more fun thanks to your fairy companion.</p>

<p>No, Faie isn't Navi; she might speak a little too much, but Faie is a necessary part of Elliot's adventure because she comes with the ability to fight enemies, gather items. She spends most of the time following you around, but you can also move her by using the right stick. Alternatively, you can command her to fly ahead, stop, disappear, or come back to you. Or, if you want a little Secret of Mana magic, a friend can join you for some couch co-op and take control of her.</p>
<p>Faie's best assets come from her skills, however. One of these is a dash that allows you to run at an extremely fast speed for a limited time, crucial for getting around fast or for traversing crumbling floors. The other is a warp which is extremely useful for getting across larger gaps. It makes dungeon exploration genuinely interesting, going beyond just walking through caves and corridors and fighting enemies.</p>
<p>It's a similar story with combat, which has a few little touches to make Elliot's adventure feel a bit unique. The basics are familiar ‚Äî you have standard and charged attacks, but variety comes in from weapons and upgrades you can equip and acquire. Along with a sword and shield, you start with some bombs and a bow (see the Link here?), though my noodling around the map and an optional boss led me to a brand new weapon: a chain and sickle.</p>

<p>The chain and sickle rules and was immediately more powerful than my sword. A tap of the 'X' button and the sickle would swing around me in a wide radius. Hold it down, and it spins around Elliot a short distance, effectively acting as a shield. Charge the sickle up, and you can pull enemies towards you. It's so satisfying to pull off. Except when you manage to pull a big enemy with a club towards you just as it's about to bonk you on the head.</p>
<p>There's actually a lot of risk-reward stuff going on here, which made the otherwise simple combat that little bit more engaging. Before I even left the opening town, I bought an accessory that increased my movement speed slightly, but also meant I took some extra damage from enemies. Couple that with diving into the thick of it with the sickle, and it meant I had to be a little more cautious on how I took out big groups of enemies.</p>
<p>Magicite, equippable gems that provide stat increases and weapon buffs, also come with various help-and-hinder effects. One piece of sword magicite increased my base attack power, but at the cost of slowing down my shield recovery time. Another allowed arrows to pierce through enemies, but reduced the damage they did. It meant I had to weigh up my equipment options more carefully and ‚Äî like badges in Paper Mario ‚Äî I also had a set amount I could equip.</p>

<p>I'm not much of a blocker in video games, which probably explains my rusty fighting-game skills, but in The Adventures of Elliot, blocking is pretty important. There's no dodge, which took me a minute to adjust to, but a perfectly-timed block stuns an enemy and gives you a few free hits. For an action RPG, it pays to be patient and think things through, especially in the boss fights, which are effectively like little puzzles. Just like many, many Zelda bosses, there are semi-obvious weak points that you have to exploit with all your tools and then strike away to win. The two I fought weren't challenging, but they did make me smile.</p>
<p>There are a few things that Square Enix and Claytechworks need to iron out, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/square-enix-wants-feedback-about-its-new-hd-2d-game-coming-to-switch-2">but that's what this demo is for</a>; the frame rate is a little inconsistent, out in the open world, things are a little blurry, and the quick menu isn't exactly zippy. But, as an appetizer for things to come, it's the perfect start to whet my appetite. Even with a new Octopath announcement during the Direct, The Adventures of Elliot was the standout reveal for me, and playing it has only cemented it as one of my most-anticipated games for Switch 2 in 2026.</p>

So as someone who loves board games and books from epic fantasy author, Brandon Sanderson (specifically the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/brandson-sanderson-cosmere-books-in-order">Cosmere series</a>), Mistborn: The Deckbuilding Game really hits that sweet spot. With Era 1 characters Marsh, Shan, Vin, and Kelsier, each depicted with beautiful art alongside more than 100 cards showcasing people, places, and events from the books, Mistborn is a treat for fans like myself. And thankfully, it has some solid gameplay backing it up.</p><div catalogid="03f4581e-8b45-41ac-ae43-398a90ca5d3b" id="226306"><div id="226306" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mistborn: The Deckbuilding Game</h3></p></div><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>What‚Äôs in the box:</strong></h3><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://www.brotherwisegames.com/s/MistbornRulebook_V1.pdf" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Rulebook</a></li><li>4 character cards</li><li>4 sets of 8 metal tokens</li><li>4 health dials with 4 matching colored cubes</li><li>8 mission cards</li><li>4 starter decks</li><li>82 market cards</li><li>36 Lord Ruler challenge cards</li><li>1 Lord Ruler card</li><li>1 dominance track card</li><li>16 Atium tokens</li><li>14 boxing tokens</li><li>1 target standee</li><li>Lord Ruler dial with 8 tracking cubes</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Designed by <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamedesigner/57723/john-d-clair" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John D. Clair</a> and published by <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/producer/brotherwise-games">Brotherwise Games</a>, Mistborn: The Deckbuilding Game, as its name suggests, is a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deck-building-board-games">deckbuilding board game</a> and features many of the staple mechanics of the genre. Players begin the game with a weaker small deck of cards, which they will slowly add to throughout the course of the game by purchasing new cards from a shared shop that strengthens their deck with new abilities and better resources. Just because it adopts many of the traditional systems of a deck builder doesn‚Äôt mean Mistborn doesn‚Äôt offer up anything new, though! </p><p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Mistborn: The Deckbuilding Game</h3></div></output></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pulling from the source material, the big additional element here is the idea of burning and flaring metal‚Äîthe signature trait of the <a href="https://coppermind.net/wiki/Allomancy" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Allomancers</a> from the <a href="https://coppermind.net/wiki/Scadrial" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">world of Scadriel</a>. On your turn, the cards you can play require you to burn one of eight possible metals in order to use the card. As the game progresses you become a better-trained Allomancer. You are able to burn more metals per turn, but at the start, you can only do this once, which is where flaring a metal and playing cards as a resource comes into play. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Flaring lets you use one of your metals, not counting towards your turn burn limit; however, you will not regain this metal until you take a special ‚Äúrefresh‚Äù action on a future turn, discarding a card from your hand that matches that metal. Additionally, you can spend a card from your hand as another required metal cost that matches the type as shown in a small vial at the bottom of the cards, making every card you put into your deck not only a potential action but also a resource. I am a big fan of board games that incorporate risk-versus-reward into the gameplay and the fact that played cards have multiple use cases adds that extra little dash of a strategic element to the economy that I just devoured.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Before each game starts, three missions are selected that players will be able to progress on, earning them bonuses and, once completed, permanent buffs. These can allow you to draw extra cards during your turn, provide a static attack bonus each turn, or even a one-time-use heal among other possibilities. With eight possible mission cards to pick from, this helps keep games feeling a bit fresh after multiple playthroughs, and I‚Äôve never been one to shy away from games with more replayability options.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In my experience, games that try to allow their game to be played both competitively and cooperatively tend to end up being more skewed towards one or the other, with the one option coming off feeling like an afterthought add-on and doesn‚Äôt provide the same level of depth or enjoyment in its gameplay. Thankfully Mistborn manages to avoid this by offering strong options for both audiences that want to wail on one another and those that want to team-up, in this case against the immortal <a href="https://coppermind.net/wiki/Rashek" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lord Ruler</a> himself. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Competitive play is pretty straightforward with everyone trying to be the last person standing as they beat up on each other with one small change‚Äîonly one person, the target, can be attacked at any given time. Once that person is attacked, they are able to pass on the target token to anyone of their choice or keep holding onto it if they so choose, allowing them to attack anyone they wish. I thought this was a really interesting idea, and at first thought would be incredibly unfair to the person that is targeted. But the fact that once they get attacked, are able to make someone else the target has led to some really interesting negotiations during my games where people try to wheel-and-deal so that they won‚Äôt become the target. I sort of dig it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As fun as the competitive ruleset was, I found myself enjoying the cooperative one even more. Teaming up against the Lord Ruler felt more on-brand with the books than everyone fighting one another, and it actually was pretty challenging too!  The Lord Ruler comes with his own deck of cards full of minions and edicts, special cards that have nasty effects like dishing out tons of damage, killing your allies (persistent cards that are out in front of players that trigger various effects when certain metals are burned) or fully healing the Lord Ruler. While this is my preferred way to play Mistborn, I do find that it is more engaging of an experience at lower player counts. With four players, I felt the Lord Ruler couldn‚Äôt quite provide the same challenge, so I would advise maybe opting for cooperative at lower player counts. Playing solo, the Lord Ruler is SCARY, and as someone who historically isn‚Äôt much for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-solo-board-games">solo board games</a>, I think Mistborn is a great solo game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">My issues with Mistborn have less to do with the mechanics of the game and more with the fact that I wish that the game went a bit further with what it includes. The four characters are nice, but I would have loved a couple more options so when playing four players, the roster wasn‚Äôt always the same. While Allomancy is represented well, the more I played, the more I kept wishing that there was some sort of representation of Feruchemy and Hemalurgy, and why aren‚Äôt there rules to allow someone to actually play as the Lord Ruler? The more I have played Mistborn the more my mind wandered and brainstormed how all of those things would work in the system that Brotherwise has built. I can only hope that Mistborn did well enough that we will get an expansion at some point, maybe roping in crew from Wax and Wayne‚Äôs Era 2, that will introduce some of those features, or better yet, the idea of Twinborns that can do both Allomancy AND Feruchemy. Oh man, my brain is already thinking up ideas.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Go read the books if you haven't already</h3></div><div catalogid="036c6b7e-d32a-4a1f-a53a-554acf0dece8" id="222926"><div id="222926" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mistborn Boxed Set I</h3></p></div></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Aug 2, 2025 2:34 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Mistborn: The Deckbuilding Game has left me itching for more, and is a refreshing offering among its deckbuilding peers. For fans of both Sanderson‚Äôs Mistborn series and board games, Mistborn: The Deckbuilding Game is an easy recommendation. Even if you just count yourself a Sanderson fan, Mistborn isn‚Äôt too complicated that folks that aren‚Äôt tabletop hobbyists can‚Äôt enjoy. If you are coming at this from just a hobbyist angle, this is still a great deckbuilding game that introduces some interesting mechanics that sets it apart from say a Star Realms. Just find yourself a friend who reads the books to explain why there are dudes with large spikes through their heads and you will be fine.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/mistborn-the-deckbuilding-board-game-review]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/handy-hockey</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mini-review-handy-hockey-switch-2-mouse-mode-multiplayer-that-does-exactly-what-it-says-on-the-tin.1260612/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>It's not that often that a perfectly good and functional air hockey video game drops. In fact, considering that the grotty arcade staple translates so readily to the sphere, very few air hockey games release in general. One of life's persisting mysteries, right there.</p>
<p>However, fear not Switch 2-owning air hockey fans (which I'm sure is a large demographic), as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/handy-hockey">Handy Hockey</a> is now here, it costs a fiver and, to borrow an old proverb, 'it does exactly what it says on the tin.' This re-release/remaster of 2010's Japan-only DSI title from ITL is the epitome of laser-focused game design. There is one thing to do here, and it's play air hockey. Go *insert air hockey team name*!</p>
<p>This lovely little Switch 2 version allows players to compete with a mixture of human/CPU opponents in matches that can be either singles or doubles. Simples. Now, the real juice is that you can also choose to play in a variety of ways, because Switch 2 gonna switch, too.</p>
<p>You've got normal TV play from side-on and top-to-bottom viewpoints, and you get to use mouse controls to direct your paddle. You can also choose to use a controller in regular ways if it suits you better. However, the real clincher, and the reason why this one deserves your money, is that you can play with your Switch 2 lying flat on a surface to replicate an arcade table, then sit across from each other and dig into 1v1/2v2 air hockey with zero distractions.</p>
<p>There are no other modes to mess with, no collectibles, or towers to climb, there's not even any emotional banter between a Godfather and his broken son. None of that. Get rid of it. Handy Hockey gives you air hockey. Full stop and/or period.</p>
<p>If anything didn't work well, the whole thing would collapse on its airy arse in short order and we'd have to go back to playing the grabby machine in the corner for knock-off Kirby plushies. But ‚Äî and remember this game costs less than a (nice) sandwich ‚Äî the controls with all the motion tech and mouse stuff are really well done. It just works. It's responsive, you can give the puck a gentle nudge or power blast. And when people (me) get over hitting things as hard as they can, well, it's quite strategic.</p>
<p>I've been playing four-player with my wife and kids, all using Mouse Mode, and it's the sort of thing (because of the lack of other modes or online) that's got a tabletop game purity to it. No distractions, just family fun time. My kids also played it later alone, so that's worth a mention, as it rarely happens.</p>
<p>It's advertised as a 120fps experience, and performance-wise ‚Äî as you'd expect for such a simple game ‚Äî everything is good. And it looks fine, too: clear, concise, and easy to parse. On the negative side, it would have been nice to have a bit of character added via avatars and persistent profiles for players to keep a history of their play. A few different tables would really help things from growing stale, too.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/handy-hockey]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Nintendo has warned Switch owners in Japan not to let their consoles get too hot or too cold.</p>
<p>Spurred by the high temperatures in some parts of Japan, Nintendo posted a statement to Japanese social media informing players that by playing in "high-temperature environments", the device's temperature, too, may rise, potentially causing "malfunctions".</p>

<p>"When using a Nintendo Switch or <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Nintendo Switch 2</a> in a high-temperature environment, the device's temperature may rise," the statement said, as translated by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/nintendo-warns-japanese-users-about-operating-the-switch-and-switch-2-at-too-high-or-too-low-temperatures/">Automaton</a>. "This could potentially cause malfunctions, so please use it in a location between 5‚Äì35¬∞C.</p>

<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="ja"><p>Ê∞óÊ∏©„ÅåÈ´ò„ÅÑÂ†¥ÊâÄ„ÅßNintendo Switch„ÇÑNintendo Switch 2 „Çí‰ΩøÁî®„Åô„Çã„Å®„ÄÅÊú¨‰Ωì„ÅÆÊ∏©Â∫¶„ÅåÈ´ò„Åè„Å™„Çã„Åì„Å®„Åå„ÅÇ„Çä„Åæ„Åô„ÄÇ<br>ÊïÖÈöú„ÅÆÂéüÂõ†„Å®„Å™„ÇãÂèØËÉΩÊÄß„Åå„ÅÇ„Çä„Åæ„Åô„ÅÆ„Åß„ÄÅ5ÔΩû35‚ÑÉ„ÅÆÂ†¥ÊâÄ„Åß„Åî‰ΩøÁî®„Åè„Å†„Åï„ÅÑ„ÄÇ</p><p>ÊúÄËøë„ÅØ35‚ÑÉ„ÇíË∂Ö„Åà„ÇãÊó•„ÅåÁ∂ö„ÅÑ„Å¶„ÅÑ„Åæ„Åô„ÄÇÂ±ãÂ§ñ„Åß‰ΩøÁî®„Åô„ÇãÈöõ„ÅØ„ÅîÊ≥®ÊÑè„Åè„Å†„Åï„ÅÑ„ÄÇ</p></div>‚Äî ‰ªªÂ§©Â†Ç„Çµ„Éù„Éº„Éà (@nintendo_cs) <a href="https://twitter.com/nintendo_cs/status/1951116935409860651?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 1, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

</p></div>
<p>Interestingly, the statement not only warns about ensuring the device doesn't get too warm, but also warns about low temperatures, too, suggesting playing it in environments where the temp struggles to get past 5¬∞C could also be problematic.</p>
<p>It's caused a number of players who live in colder climates to respond to Nintendo on Twitter, with one player from Hokkaido, where it regularly falls below freezing in winter, writing: "5¬∞C?! [Is Nintendo] telling me not to fight in Hokkaido?!"</p>
<p>"It's midwinter outdoors, so it's naturally below freezing lol," they later <a href="https://x.com/nomin7500love/status/1951243781929574433">added</a>. "But there are times when it's 5¬∞C indoors."</p>
<p>While Nintendo didn't explain why players should avoid playing when it's very hot or very cold, much like using any electronic device in extreme temperatures, it's thought that this can slow the charging speed and degrade the battery, ultimately shortening the console's lifespan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, we reported <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/almost-all-switch-2-users-have-bought-mario-kart-world-as-sales-of-new-console-pass-6m-worldwide">Nintendo sold 5.82m Switch 2 consoles worldwide in its first month of release and 5.63m copies of Mario Kart World</a>, meaning the launch title has an attachment rate of around 97 percent.</p>
<p>The figures came from <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/hard_soft/index.html">Nintendo's latest earnings release</a> as of 30th June, where the company added software sales for Switch 2 reached 8.67m units in that same period. That means <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> accounts for 65 percent of all software sales on the new console.</p>
<p>Nintendo added, in the seven weeks since launch, the Switch 2 has sold over 6m units worldwide. Even so, Nintendo has noted demand is exceeding supply in many countries.</p>
<p>Shortly after the console's launch, Nintendo announced the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-is-nintendos-fastest-selling-hardware-ever">Switch 2 was the company's fastest-selling hardware ever</a>, moving 3.5m units worldwide in its first four days on sale. Last week, it was reported <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-has-become-the-fastest-selling-video-game-hardware-device-in-us-history-usurping-the-ps4">Switch 2 is the fastest-selling video game hardware device in the US</a>, beating the PS4.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-warns-japanese-players-not-to-play-switch-2-in-extreme-temperatures]]></content:encoded>

<p>I don‚Äôt know if y‚Äôall noticed, but Hideo Kojima likes movies. <i>A lot</i>. I know this will come as a great shock to the maybe 12 of you who haven‚Äôt been paying that much attention over the man‚Äôs nearly 40 year career in games, but even the <i>Metal Gear </i>/ <i>Snatcher</i> era saw him taking direct inspiration from <i>The Terminator</i>, <i>Blade Runner</i>, and <i>Escape from New York</i> way before it was cool. But fast forward to now in 2025, and the man has been able to live some very specific cinephile dreams over the last decade and change, one of which involves being able to meet some of the best filmmakers in the world and then ask if he can stick their likenesses into his wackypants delivery service games about death and societal collapse.</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/hideo-kojima-metal-gear-solid-3-remake-stranding-1851787440">Kojima On Whether Or Not He‚Äôll Play <i>Metal Gear Solid 3</i> Remake: Lol, Nope</a></p> <p>Famous film talent was a big factor in the first <i>Death Stranding</i>, and it‚Äôs even more of a nerd flex in <i>Death Stranding 2</i>. Somehow, most of them wind up saying yes to being in Kojima‚Äôs project. Game literally recognize game, really. Kojima‚Äôs one of the few game devs who can legitimately lay claim to the auteur label‚Äìwhich, tangentially, we need to define as a creator whose clarity of vision guides a project, <i>not</i> that they‚Äôre doing all the work themselves; I cannot stress enough how important that distinction is‚Äìand the folks he‚Äôs invited for cameos in the whole <i>Death Stranding</i> project are all directors with a similar bent towards their work.</p>

 <p>That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs even more important, in these times when there are a shitload of games and movies created without that clarity, to recognize the filmmakers Kojima held sacred enough to nest them into his own work. TL;DR, Kojima‚Äôs got dope taste in film, and that‚Äôs clearer even than it was in the first game. Once Sam Porter-Bridges is done delivering his last package in <i>Death Stranding 2</i>, you owe it to him and yourself to fall into the big beautiful rabbit hole of cinema that Kojima wanted to show off to the world. So, here‚Äôs your starter pack of all the real-world film directors crammed into <i>Death Stranding 2</i>, and the very first thing you should check out from their filmography.</p> <h2><span id="guillermo-del-toro-(deadman)-%e2%80%93-blade-ii-%5b2002%5d"></span><b>Guillermo Del Toro (Deadman) ‚Äì </b><b><i>Blade II</i></b><b> [2002]</b><span></span></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000614425" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614425"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614425">¬© 2002 New Line Cinema</figcaption></figure> <p>Del Toro‚Äôs probably the most well-known and beloved filmmaker in either <i>Death Stranding</i> game, which is why you probably don‚Äôt need to be told that yes, you should check out the excellent flick where the mom from <i>Paddington</i> fucks a fish man that somehow won a Best Picture Oscar (2017‚Äôs <i>The Shape of Water</i>). That also goes for <i>Pan‚Äôs Labyrinth</i>, a movie whose aesthetics have now been strip-mined for parts hundreds of times over in games and film (but you should watch it again anyway).</p>

 <p>So as a late summer blockbuster treat, you should go watch <i>Blade II</i>. One: because it‚Äôs looking pretty likely we ain‚Äôt getting the Daywalker back in multiplexes anytime soon (<i>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine</i> doesn‚Äôt count, and you know it). Two: because you get a bonus <i>Death Stranding</i> connection with Norman Reedus playing Scud, Blade‚Äôs interim man-in-chair before Whistler re-enters the picture. Three: because it fucking rules. It‚Äôs a perfect, big, brutal sequel to one of the most effortlessly cool action flicks of the modern era, kicked up a notch by Del Toro adding some genuinely fucked up horror to the mix. Prior to Robert Eggers‚Äô <i>Nosferatu</i> last year, <i>Blade II</i>‚Äôs Reapers represent the last time bloodsucking vampires weren‚Äôt intriguing or tragic or sexy, just&nbsp; absolutely goddamn terrifying. Watch it 100 times and the money shot reveal of a Reaper‚Äôs mouth will still be an all-timer blood-curdling moment.</p> <h3><i>Honorable Mention: </i>The Devil‚Äôs Backbone<i> [2001]</i></h3> <p>If you still want to aim higher class, <i>The Devil‚Äôs Backbone</i> seems like it‚Äôs fading into the background of Del Toro‚Äôs filmography, and it absolutely shouldn‚Äôt. Maybe wait till it‚Äôs October and spooky season begins in earnest; but it‚Äôs a very different take on a ghost story that doesn‚Äôt have the luxury of falling back on facestabbings like <i>Crimson Peak</i>. Not that we have anything against the many, many facestabbings of <i>Crimson Peak</i>.</p>

 <h2><span id="nicolas-winding-refn-(heartman)-%e2%80%93-bronson-%5b2008%5d"></span><b>Nicolas Winding Refn (Heartman) ‚Äì </b><b><i>Bronson </i></b><b>[2008]</b><span></span></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000614426" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614426"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614426">¬© Vertigo Films</figcaption></figure> <p>The other returning filmmaker from the first <i>Death Stranding</i>, Refn‚Äôs kind of an oddball first step for learning how arthouse cinema differentiates from the multiplex. Ostensibly, the man operates in familiar genres. It‚Äôs pretty likely that if you‚Äôve seen any Refn film, it‚Äôs probably <i>Drive</i> with Ryan Gosling, and that‚Äôs a perfect example. You can sell your friends on it as a slow burn action flick/crime drama, when in reality, it‚Äôs kind of an off-kilter, neurodivergent deconstruction of the whole idea of an action hero; and you‚Äôre either on its wavelength or you‚Äôre not. Or you‚Äôre a guy who made Gosling‚Äôs jacket your entire personality and need a lot more time in therapy. Point being, the man‚Äôs films are never what you want or expect.</p> <p>Except for <i>Bronson</i>, which isn‚Äôt trying to hide a damn thing about what it is: a psychofuck trip through the life and times of one of the most ruthlessly destructive people to ever pass through British prison, Charles Bronson. The entire film feels delirious, punch-drunk, and vicious‚Äîand that‚Äôs exactly the point. This was Tom Hardy‚Äôs breakout role, and without a doubt it‚Äôs the one that got him the part as Bane in <i>Dark Knight Rises</i> on sight. It‚Äôs a perfect, unnerving portrait of an erudite psychopath.</p> <h3><i>Honorable Mentions:</i> Only God Forgives<i> [2013] </i>/ My Life Directed By Nicolas Winding Refn<i> [2014]&nbsp;</i></h3> <p>So, <i>Only God Forgives</i> is a mixed bag, and that‚Äôs being generous. It‚Äôs Refn trying to do for Asian crime epics what he did to American gangster films with <i>Drive</i>, but with less success outside the visuals and the way-too-brief action. It‚Äôs like watching <i>The Raid 2</i> on Xanax.</p>

 <p>However, it‚Äôs worth it just so you have context for the much more interesting <i>My Life Directed By Nicolas Winding Refn</i>. It‚Äôs a one-hour documentary directed by Refn‚Äôs wife, Liv Corfixen, which is less about the actual behind-the-scenes day-to-day making of the film‚Äìthough you do get to see Refn and Alejandro Jodorowsky hang out together for a bit, which is neat‚Äìthan about Corfixen‚Äôs life being upended by having to move herself and her two kids to Bangkok for six months for the sake of her manic-depressive husband and the crowd-repulsing movie he‚Äôs making. That‚Äôs a fascinating angle to take. There‚Äôs also another very good reason to check it out, which is that <i>Death Stranding 2</i> is another family affair for Refn. Corfixen plays The Hydrologist, and their daughters Lizzie and Lola play The Chronobiologist and The Metagenomicist, respectively.</p> <h2><span id="fatih-akin-(dollman)-%e2%80%93-in-the-fade-%5b2017%5d"></span><b>Fatih Akin (Dollman) ‚Äì </b><b><i>In The Fade</i></b><b> [2017]</b><span></span></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000614427" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614427"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614427">¬© Warner Bros. Pictures</figcaption></figure> <p>Even beyond Fatih Akin being a talented director with amazing control over tone‚Äìthe man does more with tense silence than some directors do with an entire orchestra‚Äìas a German-born Turk, the man‚Äôs got a cultural perspective you definitely don‚Äôt see much of in Western media. He‚Äôd be a gem for that alone, but just about every off-the-cuff interview with the guy is bursting with energy and enthusiasm for life, art, everything. To wit, as a side tangent here, I highly recommend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HnOlLQce4k">this interview</a> Kojima and Akin did at Cannes this year about their philosophies towards art and their own work. Kojima making Dollman such an integral part of Sam‚Äôs journey was a stroke of genius and the whole game is better for it (though yes, I know the Tranq Sniper Rifle doesn‚Äôt have a suppressor, sir, you can stop reminding me, I‚Äôm good, thanks)</p>

 <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Technological Constraints &amp; Freedoms ‚Äì Technology &amp; Storytelling feat. Hideo Kojima &amp; Fatih Akin" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9HnOlLQce4k?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>As for a starting point for Akin‚Äôs work, though, <i>In The Fade</i> is almost the winner by default: It‚Äôs Akin‚Äôs most easily accessible film (it‚Äôs on HBO Max at the time of this writing, in fact), and probably the most horrifyingly relevant. A reformed drug addict named Katja (Diane Kruger, who, fun trivia, happens to be married to Norman Reedus IRL) marries a similarly reformed Turkish ex-con named Nuri (Numan Acar). When Neo-Nazis set off a nail bomb outside Nuri‚Äôs workplace, killing him and the couple‚Äôs young son solely for the crime of being immigrants, Katja‚Äôs entire life spirals out of control, and Germany‚Äôs criminal justice system is, well, less than helpful, leading Katja to take matters in her own hands. It‚Äôs not the easiest watch, but it‚Äôs impossible not to once you‚Äôre engrossed in it.</p> <h3><i>Honorable Mention: </i>Head-On<i> [2004]</i></h3> <p>Once you‚Äôre done with <i>In The Fade</i>, though, and want another downward spiral to dig into, <i>Head-On</i> is a damn fine choice. A Turkish woman (<i>Game of Thrones</i>‚Äô Sibel Kekilli) meets a suicidal, aging punk named Cahit (Birol √únel) while at a mental health facility, and out of sheer desperation to escape her extremely traditional Turkish family, she asks to marry him on the spot. It goes about as well as you might think. Despite that rom-com setup‚Äìcomplete with a Greek choir of Turkish musicians, which is a wild choice‚Äîit is often just as fatalistic and grim as it is funny and hopelessly romantic.</p> <h2><span id="george-miller-(tarman)-%e2%80%93-three-thousand-years-of-longing-%5b2023%5d"></span><b>George Miller (Tarman) ‚Äì </b><b><i>Three Thousand Years of Longing </i></b><b>[2023]</b><span></span></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000614430" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614430"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614430">¬© Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures</figcaption></figure> <p>If the first time you ever heard the name George Miller was due to <i>Mad Max: Fury Road</i>, congratulations, you‚Äôre the next contestant on America‚Äôs favorite game show ‚ÄúHoly Shit, The Guy Who Made <i>Fury Road</i> Directed THAT?!‚Äù Because Miller has had a hell of a diverse career, from the <i>Mad Max</i> saga, to beloved childrens‚Äô classics such as <i>Babe</i> and <i>Happy Feet</i>, to weepy dramas like <i>Lorenzo‚Äôs Oil</i>. To wit, this could very easily have just been a recommendation to go watch <i>Furiosa</i> and call it a day, because that flick deserves way more love than it got, especially that unhinged Chris Hemsworth performance. But oh no, y‚Äôall are not getting off that easy. <i>Furiosa </i>failing to set the world on fire is nothing compared to the absolutely lovely <i>Three Thousand Years of Longing</i> basically being dumped on the side of the road by Amazon and left to starve.</p>

 <p>In fairness, I‚Äôm not sure how many millions of dollars more were really left on the table by not marketing a romantic fantasy by the <i>Mad Max</i> guy about Tilda Swinton finding a genie in a bottle, but living such a fulfilled life that she refuses to wish. Surely, a lot of people would certainly have spent the money to hear Idris Elba try to convince her to make a wish with multiple magical tales of love, lust, greed, and power gone wrong across the vast expanse of time itself, especially when those tales are as lavishly directed as these are and when they lead to a modern love story unlike any other. Seriously, it‚Äôs a $60 million movie that looks like it cost $300 million, with one of the most achingly beautiful film scores in recent years, from Junkie XL of all people. If nothing else, come to get a debilitating addiction to those pistachio cookies Tilda and Idris are eating in their hotel room the whole movie.</p> <h3><i>Honorable Mention: </i>The Witches of Eastwick <i>[1987]</i></h3> <p>If that‚Äôs a little too schmaltzy for your liking, there‚Äôs also that time The Guy Who Made <i>Fury Road</i> directed a romantic horror comedy about three witches (Susan Sarandon, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Cher) winding up in a polycule with Satan himself (Jack Nicholson). Somehow, that thing is scored by John Williams, too. I don‚Äôt know what to do for you if that premise alone can‚Äôt perk your ears up.</p> <h2><span id="mike-flanagan-(mike-northcote)-%e2%80%93-the-life-of-chuck-(2024)"></span><b>Mike Flanagan (Mike Northcote) ‚Äì </b><b><i>The Life of Chuck</i></b><b> (2024)</b><span></span></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000614431" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614431"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614431">¬© Intrepid Pictures</figcaption></figure> <p>Mike Flanagan might be the best thing to ever happen to Stephen King. Flanagan seems to be a perfect creative distillery, boiling out everything clunky and problematic in King‚Äôs post-car-accident work, while accentuating the sobering poetry and grim insight that‚Äôs still present even in his weaker efforts. That‚Äôs of course to say nothing of Flanagan‚Äôs own work on stuff like <i>Haunting of Hill House</i>, the brilliant adaptation of Edgar Allen Poe‚Äôs <i>Fall of the House of Usher</i>, and <i>Midnight Mass</i> (which is, ironically, a better <i>Salem‚Äôs Lot</i> remake than the actual, garbage <i>Salem‚Äôs Lot</i> remake from last year).</p> <p>That makes it all the more frustrating that Flanagan finally broke his confinement at Netflix to put a new King adaptation in theaters for it to release with absolutely zero impact. Not even a thud. It‚Äôs yet even more frustrating that <i>Life of Chuck</i> is easily one of the best damn films of the year, to say nothing of being one of the most affecting, heartfelt films in recent memory at a time when we desperately need it. It‚Äôs got less of a linear narrative‚Äìor even a reverse chronological narrative‚Äìthan a series of seemingly disconnected vignettes from the life of a man named Chuck (played at various ages by Cody Flanagan, Benjamin Pajak, Jacob Tremblay, and Tom Hiddleston), spiraling out from the simple, haunting moment that Chuck finds out through supernatural means exactly how and when he will die.</p>

 <p>Armed with the knowledge of a tragic, comic, and beautiful past, and an equally beautiful, but truncated future, the film is basically a literary argument for the value of life itself‚Äìa common thing in all of Flanagan‚Äôs work, really. It‚Äôs all that and it‚Äôs got one of the most wonderfully unorthodox ensemble casts you‚Äôll ever see. That, of course, includes Flanagan‚Äôs wife, Kate Siegel, who <i>also </i>pops up in <i>Death Stranding 2</i> as West Fort Knot‚Äôs Olivia Westbury (with an Irish accent, weirdly enough). It just hit digital this week. Do yourself the favor of getting your eyes on this.</p> <h3><i>Honorable Mention: </i>Doctor Sleep: Director‚Äôs Cut<i> (2019)</i></h3> <p>Oh yeah, don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever forgiven y‚Äôall for the last time this happened. Granted, the world had an excuse last time. <i>Doctor Sleep</i>: The Novel is a complete mess of ideas, and the trailers for this made it look like a cheap Kubrick legasequel cash in. Flanagan, however, finds the beating heart in all of it, again stripping out all the problematic landmines of King‚Äôs book and replacing them with a genuinely empathetic and still often-frightening look at alcoholism through the lens of <i>The Shining</i>, both King‚Äôs book and Kubrick‚Äôs film. Come for the storytelling, stay after you fall madly in lust with Rebecca Ferguson‚Äôs Rose the Hat.</p>

 <p>Yes, hunt down the Director‚Äôs Cut, the added bits make it perfect.</p> <h2><span id="danny-and-michael-philippou-(mr-impossible)-%e2%80%93-talk-to-me-%5b2022%5d"></span><b>Danny and Michael Philippou (Mr. Impossible) ‚Äì </b><b><i>Talk To Me </i></b><b>[2022]</b><span></span></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000614432" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614432"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614432">¬© A24</figcaption></figure> <p>At some point, someone‚Äôs gonna have to write a deep, academic paper on why great comedians are somehow absolutely incredible at horror. (Partial theory: Any truly great comedy played straight <i>is</i> horror) Millennials saw this play out with Peter Jackson and Edgar Wright. Gen Y and Z get to see it with Jordan Peele and, now, the RackaRacka guys, a.k.a. The Philippou Brothers. Somehow, these Aussies, known for their Suburban Violence videos and genre mashup shorts, started plying their trade on the big screen, and with all the same DIY tools that made their Youtube videos utter chaos, managed to deliver one of the most chilling tales of possession in recent memory.</p> <p>It‚Äôs a simple setup, too: Australian teenagers have somehow stumbled upon an unholy relic in the shape of a hand that allows them to communicate with the dead. Saying ‚ÄúTalk to me‚Äù while holding it lets you see a dead person. The phrase ‚ÄúI let you in‚Äù allows the dead person to possess you, which is safe only for 90 seconds. Surprisingly, teenagers, long known for how much they love to follow rules, let the possession go on too long and‚Ä¶well, bad things ensue. The film never quite escalates after an absolutely gnarly bit of self-mutilation at the halfway mark, but things are still pretty fucking far from sunshine and daisies after.</p>

 <h3><i>Honorable Mention: </i>Bring Her Back<i> [2025]</i></h3> <p><i>Bring Her Back</i> wasn‚Äôt as much of a smash hit as <i>Talk To Me</i>, but to be fair to the general public, it‚Äôs also a much, much, <i>much </i>more fucked up piece of work. It‚Äôs about two orphaned kids whose new eccentric foster mother (Sally Hawkins) loves them so much that she intends to let one of them become the new vessel for her dead daughter‚Äôs soul by performing a Satanic ritual. Fun fact: This was the movie Sally Hawkins did immediately after dropping out of <i>Paddington in Peru</i>. Good call, tbh, I don‚Äôt want her anywhere near children or that sweet, trusting bear after this.</p> <h2><span id="s-s-rajamouli-(the-adventurer)-%e2%80%93-rrr-%5b2022%5d"></span><b>S.S. Rajamouli (The Adventurer) ‚Äì </b><b><i>RRR </i></b><b>[2022]</b><span></span></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000614433" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614433"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614433">¬© ZEE5</figcaption></figure> <p>If<i> RRR</i> is somehow a new title to your ears, I‚Äôm gonna politely invite you to drop everything you‚Äôre doing right this second.Clear the rest of your day and go experience the greatest three hours you will spend this year. Like what are you even doing reading this article? It‚Äôs on Netflix, don‚Äôt argue with me on this.</p> <p>If you‚Äôre still here, sure, I guess let‚Äôs qualify that for you. For folks who might be dipping their first toe into the Wild World of Indian cinema, Indian movies tend to have a reputation for a kitchen sink approach to filmmaking, which is why you might have a concept of them that‚Äôs mostly centered around weird bespoke musical numbers. It‚Äôs actually very much by design. Especially for areas so remote that going to the movies means most of the day is spent travelling, the entire country‚Äôs various film industries‚Äìand no, not every Indian film is Bollywood‚Äìhave the unspoken mandate that they need to make the trip worth it for every single potential viewer. So action movies aren‚Äôt just action movies, musicals aren‚Äôt just musicals, romantic comedies aren‚Äôt just romantic comedies. Every film‚Äôs got to do <i>a lot</i>, and many end up feeling like tonal whiplash to Westerners as a result.</p> <p>And even by that standard, <i>RRR</i> is just an unlimited Golden Corral buffet of awesome things on every single conceivable creative level. The core plot plays out like an Indian historical fiction riff on <i>The Departed</i>, except imagine Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio are not just friends, not just best friends, but <i>the best friends that have ever lived</i>. When our heroes, Komaram Bheem (N.T. Rama Rao Jr.) and Alluri Sitarama Raju (Ram Charan) meet for the first time during an explosion on a bridge, they wordlessly decide from a half mile away to perform one of the most heroic rescues ever executed, all while swinging from a bridge waving an Indian flag. The big conflict of the film comes down to (of course) the goddamn British being assholes in the 1920s. And when some foppish fuckhead starts laying into Bheem about being an uncultured peasant, Raju steps in and the two clap back with one of the greatest dance sequences ever committed to film. It‚Äôs so undeniably great that the song they dance to become the first song from an Indian film to win Best Original Song at the Oscars. Raju is introduced as a soldier so badass he‚Äôs ordered to arrest one single dude who threw a rock during a full-scale riot, and then literally fights his way through a pissed-off crowd of <i>thousands </i>with nothing but a nightstick and his goddamn mustache. Bheem‚Äôs ultimate plan involves rescuing a kidnapped village girl with a full on assault on a British palace whereupon he unleashes a truck full of every single pissed-off forest animal he could trap onto the property. The money shot of that sequence would make Zack Snyder soil himself with <i>awe</i>. Don‚Äôt even get me started on the sequence they actually reference in <i>Death Stranding 2</i> with that hologram up above. This is a <i>fraction</i> of the various glories <i>RRR</i> delivers on, all while still making good on being a fist-pumping story of the marginalized fighting their oppressors by any means necessary. The actual title is <i>Rise, Roar, Revolt</i> for a good god damn reason. Why are you not watching it right now, fool? Get out of here!</p>

 <h3><i>Honorable Mention: </i>Baahubali: The Beginning <i>and </i>Baahubali: The Conclusion</h3> <p>Look, if <i>RRR</i> took that long to hype up, we‚Äôll be here till next weekend running down the <i>Baahubali </i>flicks‚Äô whole deal. We‚Äôll keep this one nice and short. I‚Äôll just say ‚ÄúIndian <i>Lord of the Rings</i>‚Äù and leave it to you to find out. And even the <i>LoTR</i> flicks didn‚Äôt have Aragorn doing a Van Damme split riding two flaming bulls into Helm‚Äôs Deep.</p> <p>Oh, and in case you were wondering about Rajamouli‚Äôs <i>Death Stranding 2</i> appearance, yes, that‚Äôs his actual stepson, S.S. Karthikeya, playing The Adventurer‚Äôs Son; yes, Karthikeya‚Äôs a director in his own right, he did second unit on <i>Baahubali</i>; yes, I got tired of saving The Adventurer‚Äôs ass up in the mountains too, for god‚Äôs sake, put an AirTag on that man or something.</p> <h2><span id="yusaku-matsumoto-(the-architect)-%e2%80%93-winny-%5b2023%5d"></span><b>Yusaku Matsumoto (The Architect) ‚Äì </b><b><i>Winny </i></b><b>[2023]</b><span></span></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000614434" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614434"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614434">¬©Yusaku Matsumoto</figcaption></figure> <p>Admittedly, Matsumoto was the director I knew the least about going into this article. Finding out about him wasn‚Äôt a particularly easy feat either, with <i>Winny</i> being the only one of his films available to stream in North America. Thankfully, <i>Winny</i> is a fascinating piece of work. The framework is easy to nail down as basically the story of Japan‚Äôs very own Napster/Limewire equivalent, but as opposed to going down the <i>Social Network</i> route of showing the new titans of Silicon Valley as antisocial children playing businessman, <i>Winny</i> is more about the actual trial, and a scathing indictment of the law enforcement response to the app‚Äôs success. It could use some of David Fincher‚Äôs flair for making dry procedurals feel energetic, but it‚Äôs still a riveting watch.</p> <h3><i>Honorable Mention:</i> House of the Owl <i>[2024]</i></h3> <p>One of Matsumoto‚Äôs only other directorial credits that‚Äôs readily available is actually a TV show currently on Hulu. It‚Äôs kind of a Japanese riff on <i>Succession</i>, except there‚Äôs less satire, since it‚Äôs not as much about the powerful patriarchs than it is the political schemer guiding their hands. It‚Äôs also slower and drier than <i>Succession</i>, but it‚Äôs rare to see this kind of show cross the Pacific in general, and Matsumoto‚Äôs style fits the material like a glove, so there‚Äôs still an interesting perspective to be found in here.</p>

 <h2><span id="kevin-ko-(the-ghost-hunter)-%e2%80%93-incantation-%5b2022%5d"></span><b>Kevin Ko (The Ghost Hunter) ‚Äì </b><b><i>Incantation </i></b><b>[2022]</b><span></span></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000614435" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614435"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614435">¬© Netflix</figcaption></figure> <p>For much of its runtime, <i>Incantation</i> isn‚Äôt doing&nbsp; anything folks haven‚Äôt seen out of every other found footage horror flick this side of <i>The Blair Witch Project</i>. But the very beginning snaps you to attention regardless: a woman talking about perceptual illusions, and asking us, the audience, to remember a specific chant and a specific symbol. It‚Äôs mostly a slow burn possessed-child story for most of the time after that.</p> <p>Thing is though, you might remember a little game called <i>Devotion</i> from a few years back, mostly famous for getting stomped out of existence by the Chinese government <a href="https://kotaku.com/gog-bails-on-selling-taiwanese-horror-game-devotion-1845895225">for the dumbest reason imaginable</a>. That controversy sadly obscured the fact that <i>Devotion</i> was a completely unmooring sort of horror experience that relied on very specific Taiwanese religious symbology to emphasize something extraordinarily fucked up is going on. <i>Incantation</i> does much the same, using a lot of that same symbology, but taken even further into the realm of pure horror, made even worse by the found footage factor. The ambient score plays its hand a bit too much but when <i>Incantation</i> gets down to business, it‚Äôs still terrifying. The final stretch in particular, if you know what you‚Äôre seeing, is an all-timer of a blasphemous exclamation point on the whole thing. The film begs for a bit of patience, but it certainly earns it by the end. There‚Äôs absolutely a reason Ko is cast as a post-apocalyptic ghost hunter in <i>Death Stranding 2</i>.</p> <h3><i>Honorable Mention: </i>A Choo<i> [2020]</i></h3> <p>On the complete flipside of <i>Incantation</i> is a genuinely bizarre take on a superhero film. Actually, ‚Äúsuperhero film‚Äù feels like the wrong description too. It‚Äôs a film taking place in a universe where superheroes exist, but it‚Äôs mostly a boxing movie about an orphan named EJ who falls in love with his best friend Hsien-Hsien at a young age and dedicates his life to being a good enough fighter to be able to protect her‚Äìdespite her life very much moving on without him. It‚Äôs.very weird, kinda like a cruder, loopier version of <i>Kick-Ass</i>, and it doesn‚Äôt entirely work, but, it‚Äôs kind of a running pattern in Kevin Ko‚Äôs work that the ending will always pull it all together. And even as ridiculous as <i>A Choo</i> can be, the climax, connecting the course of EJ‚Äôs history to one lucky punch against a rogue supervillain, is pretty wonderful.</p> <h2><span id="mamoru-oshii-(the-pizza-chef)-%e2%80%93-ghost-in-the-shell-%5b1995%5d-/-ghost-in-the-shell-innocence-%5b2004%5d"></span><b>Mamoru Oshii (The Pizza Chef) ‚Äì </b><b><i>Ghost In The Shell</i></b><b> [1995] / </b><b><i>Ghost In The Shell: Innocence</i></b><b> [2004]</b><span></span></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000614437" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614437"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614437">¬© Bandai Visual</figcaption></figure> <p>Being a Millennial anime fan is a weird position to find yourself. I‚Äôm not ‚Äú<i>Speed Racer </i>/ <i>Astro Boy</i> on Saturday mornings‚Äù old, but I‚Äôm not ‚Äú<i>Naruto </i>/ <i>Bleach</i> on Toonami‚Äù&nbsp; or ‚Äú<i>Demon Slayer </i>/ <i>Jujitsu Kaisen</i> on Crunchyroll‚Äù young either. I am, specifically, ‚Äú<i>Project A-Ko</i> and <i>Demon City Shinjuku</i> on the Sci-Fi Channel Annual Anime Festival‚Äù old. I am ‚ÄúPaying $50 to a dude in NYC for a bootleg VHS of <i>Street Fighter: The Animated Movie</i> recorded off a laserdisc‚Äù old. I am ‚ÄúProgramming the VCR to record the one time Showtime will ever broadcast <i>Dominion Tank Police</i> at 2 am on a school night‚Äù old. My tastes in anime skew slightly off the pulse, is the point I‚Äôm getting to here.</p>

 <p>And as such, it‚Äôs hard to say whether Mamoru Oshii‚Äôs <i>Ghost In The Shell</i> remains one of those immovable gargantuan touchstones of any otaku‚Äôs experience anymore (especially as more and weaker <i>GTS</i> adaptations keep happening, each of them taking another tiny step towards making Major Kusanagi into lolicon). The ‚Äò95 film absolutely should be considered must-watch material, mind you. It‚Äôs still a stone cold masterpiece of animation, whose influence continues to worm its way through modern sci-fi to this very day. Kojima certainly recognizes that‚Äìit certainly helps that his ride-or-die mech designer Yoji Shinkawa worked on the original manga‚Äìbut you don‚Äôt often hear about it in the same hushed tones you used to, compared to, say, <i>One Piece</i>. So, it‚Äôs also included here as a mandate and reminder that<b> this is required viewing.</b></p> <p>That said, if the original <i>Ghost In The Shell</i> film has fallen ever so gently out of the zeitgeist, its sequel still deserves to finally breach into it. Oshii had no interest in conforming to genre convention with <i>Innocence</i>, and not only does he take the iconic Major out of the equation‚Äìexcept as the metaphorical angel on the shoulder of World‚Äôs Greatest Cyborg Simp Batou‚Äìbut drags <i>GITS</i> kicking and screaming into a philosophical ponderance of what artificial life has done to the nurturing part of the human mind, all centering around a series of brutal murders by supposedly-soulless gynoids all around the city.</p> <p>There are still plenty of baser joys to recommend in there. There‚Äôs two absolute banger shootouts; there‚Äôs a Mobius Strip sequence in a ‚Äúhaunted‚Äù mansion that‚Äôs kind of a masterclass in fucking with the audience; Kenji Kawai‚Äôs score is incredible, especially the evolution of the opening credits theme; and just, sweet swaddling Jesus, the entire film is breathtakingly animated. There‚Äôs still very little in film as a medium as astonishing as the parade sequence intermission here. It‚Äôs just that it‚Äôs a film that demands more patience than folks who go in looking for flashy cyberpunk thrills have ever been ready for. But just maybe, as way too many of the technological nightmares in Oshii‚Äôs universe come to fruition, the world might want to take more notice of what he tried to say with <i>Innocence</i>.</p> <h3><i>Honorable Mention: </i>Avalon <i>(2002)</i></h3> <p>All that said, if you really want Mamoru Oshii reading the year 2025 for filth, <i>Avalon</i> predicted the entire rise of live-service gaming and its effects on human empathy and creativity. The film‚Äìshot and set in Poland, weirdly enough‚Äìposits the GaaS future as a land laid to waste because the generation best equipped to handle inequality can only really make a living‚Äìor, really, even function as human beings‚Äìin the confines of the world‚Äôs most popular MMO. This is the gamer dystopia Ernest Cline wishes <i>Ready Player One</i> was.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">It‚Äôs become the new normal, unfortunately, to wait years for a follow-up to our favorite games. While the realities of modern game development mean studios are working harder than ever to meet ever-higher standards, that hasn‚Äôt stopped projects like Rockstar‚Äôs Grand Theft Auto 6, Valve‚Äôs Half-Life 3, and especially Team Cherry‚Äôs Silksong from becoming the unwitting faces of the industry‚Äôs lengthening timelines. That last one is surprising because when it was first announced, it didn‚Äôt seem like the sequel to Hollow Knight was all that far away.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Months turned into years, and until very recently, it felt like we were no closer to Silksong than we were in 2019, back when we played a hands-on demo of the mystical sequel. In the years since, Silksong has achieved meme status, where fans don clown makeup and wigs after each new Nintendo Direct or Xbox Developer Showcase fails to bring them closer to the promised sequel. How did we get here? And just how much closer are we to the fabled Silksong release?</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Silksong Was Originally Supposed to Be DLC</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Australian-based studio Team Cherry first launched Hollow Knight on Kickstarter back in 2014, hoping to secure enough funding to turn its 2D Soulslike+Metroidvania fusion game jam prototype into a full-fledged game. After meeting its initial funding target, Team Cherry revealed additional stretch goals that promised new quests, bosses, and, eventually, <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/11662585/hollow-knight/posts/1088384" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a second playable character named Hornet</u></a>. Those funding targets were met, and so development began on expanding Hollow Knight. </p><p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/01/f4fb74677f3159ab2ab2231284a971d5-1754062986749.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Concept art for Hornet when she was first announced as a DLC character. Credit: Team Cherry</figcaption></figure></output></p><p data-cy="paragraph">As promised, Hollow Knight‚Äôs 2017 launch was followed by a series of DLC drops. The Hidden Dreams, The Grimm Troupe, and Gods and Glory added new boss fights, quest lines, fast travel mechanics, and more to the base game. But what about the second playable character? Where was Hornet?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then, on February 14, 2019, Hollow Knight: Silksong was officially announced. In a blog post and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6CRPqkpuU" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">developer diary</a>, Team Cherry explained how plans for Hornet had quickly evolved. Initially, the developers debated whether to add her as a second protagonist that players could switch to during the main campaign or to make her the star of a standalone chapter. Eventually, the ideas for Hornet grew so big that Team Cherry decided to spin the DLC off into a full sequel.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The plan was now to tell a brand new Hornet-focused story in an entirely new kingdom. She would have a very different playstyle ‚Äì much more nimble and acrobatic than The Knight, who is slower and heavier in comparison. She would need all her speed and dexterity when going up against Silksong‚Äôs over 150 new enemies and bosses. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans of Hollow Knight rejoiced, and Team Cherry capitalized on the excitement for Silksong quickly‚Ä¶</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>We Even Played It</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Even though Team Cherry never announced a release date, none of us expected Silksong‚Äôs unveiling would be the start of a six-year-plus wait to get to the sequel. The same year as the announcement, Team Cherry was all-in on promoting Silksong, revealing a cast of NPC characters via an anniversary <a href="https://www.teamcherry.com.au/blog/hk-physical-late-anniversary-celebration-silksong-mini-update" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>blog post</u></a> in March 2019, before showcasing a playable demo at E3 2019.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Not only did we at IGN see the demo ourselves at E3 that year, but our very own Tom Marks played it. In his preview, he <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/06/21/hollow-knight-silksong-feels-wildly-different-and-incredibly-familiar-e3-2019"><u>wrote</u></a>, ‚ÄúHollow Knight is one of my favorite games ever, but I think Silksong has the potential to be even better.‚Äù </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The demo was roughly 20 minutes long and took place in a new, fiery area filled with several new enemies and two boss fights. I caught up with Marks for this story to ask him if, at the time, the Silksong demo seemed like a game that would be ready in a few years, or if it felt far from finished.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">‚ÄúIt didn‚Äôt feel six years away,‚Äù Marks tells me. ‚ÄúYou [could] tell it wasn‚Äôt the final version, but based on the vertical slice I played, it felt really polished.‚Äù </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This demo would later be taken to PAX Australia 2019 and shared with attendees there as well. Generally when a game shows up with a playable build at multiple events, things are closing in on the finish line, and so we were all completely unaware of the reality that awaited. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As the publicity campaign progressed into 2020, Team Cherry marketing and publishing lead Matthew ‚ÄúLeth‚Äù Griffin began revealing new NPCs on the official Hollow Knight Discord server as a reward for fans solving a variety of riddles. And in that December, there was a <a href="https://x.com/edgeonline/status/1344588834231693313" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>full-on cover story in Edge Magazine issue #354</u></a> with new details, screenshots, and an enlightening interview with Team Cherry co-directors Ari Gibson and William Pellen that discussed deeper, more intricate levels and offered a glimpse into Hornet‚Äôs mysterious story.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Silksong Goes Into Hiding</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The frenzy of Silksong news in the immediate aftermath of the sequel‚Äôs announcement would soon give way to a long winter. Team Cherry went radio silent throughout 2021, and fans spent the year waiting for any sign of a release date.  A 2020-2021 release window was anticipated, thanks to a few accidental messaging blips that sent the rumor mill turning.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In September 2019, for instance, the official Silksong Steam page was suddenly updated with a June 12, 2020, release date. Later, Team Cherry would confirm it was just an accidental placeholder date. Just a couple of months later, on August 20, the Silksong logo appeared in an <a href="https://x.com/NintendoUK/status/1296809703230582785" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>official Nintendo UK tweet</u></a> that read, ‚ÄúTake a look at some upcoming games headed to Nintendo Switch this year and beyond.‚Äù It wasn‚Äôt immediately clear that Silksong belonged firmly in the ‚Äúbeyond‚Äù category ‚Äì we‚Äôd yet to learn that expecting it anytime soon was folly. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>‚ÄúWill there be Silksong at the new Nintendo Partner Direct?‚Äù fans dare to ask. 
‚ÄúAbsolutely not, you clown,‚Äù the universe responds.</p></div><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>"Everything Shown Today Will Be Playable in the Next 12 Months"</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">It wouldn‚Äôt be until almost another two years had passed that we would see Silksong again. On June 12, 2022, Xbox aired its annual summer Games Showcase, which premiered, among other things, a brand new, minute-long trailer for Silksong. But while it revealed new gameplay, areas, and bosses, the trailer didn‚Äôt include a release date. It did, however, announce that Silksong will be <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-trailer"><u>playable day one on Xbox Game Pass</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This might have been enough for fans if it weren‚Äôt for an unfortunate follow-up message from Xbox. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">After the showcase, the official Xbox Twitter account <a href="https://x.com/Xbox/status/1536034468460261376" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>posted</u></a>, ‚ÄúEverything you‚Äôre seeing today is playable over the next 12 months.‚Äù Given Silksong was one of the games present in the showcase, this was rightfully taken as a release window for the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">‚ÄúSo you‚Äôre telling me SIlksong is out within the next 12 months?‚Äù asked one user on Twitter. <a href="https://x.com/Xbox/status/1536035818275487746" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>‚ÄúThat‚Äôs exactly what we said,‚Äù Xbox answered</u></a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Oh boy.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">That's exactly what we said.</p>‚Äî Xbox (@Xbox) <a href="https://twitter.com/Xbox/status/1536035818275487746?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 12, 2022</a></blockquote> <h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Silksong Gets an Official Delay, Without Ever Getting a Release Date</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">To be fair, it did seem like Team Cherry‚Äôs plan was to release Silksong within 12 months of the Xbox Games Showcase. This much was <a href="https://x.com/griffinmatta/status/1656106351184199680" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>confirmed by Team Cherry‚Äôs Matthew Griffin</u></a>, who shared on Twitter in May 2023 that Silksong was planned to be released in the ‚Äú1st half of 2023.‚Äù </p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, Griffin added that unfortunately, ‚Äúdevelopment is still continuing. We‚Äôre excited by how the game is shaping up, and it‚Äôs gotten quite big, so we want to take the time to make the game as good as we can. Expect more details from us once we get closer to release.‚Äù</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, without ever announcing a release date, Silksong received an official delay from Team Cherry.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Hey gang, just a quick update about Silksong.</p><p>We had planned to release in the 1st half of 2023, but development is still continuing.

The COVID-19 pandemic meant that in-person events were temporarily paused, with some events like E3 now seemingly gone for good. In place of those traditional events, various digital showcases from the likes of Geoff Keighley, Xbox, PlayStation, and even yours truly here at IGN, as well as countless others, were created to fill the void of E3. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This meant there were now dozens of potential new showcases where Team Cherry could share more information about Silksong. Every new indie game showcase, Nintendo Direct, or any number of other shows had the potential to reveal a new Silksong trailer, preferably one with a release date. And with each new showcase that failed to deliver the goods, fans began to treat Silksong‚Äôs absence as a running joke.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Anyone who follows the games industry on social media will likely recognize the most popular Silksong meme: Anytime a company posts about an upcoming game showcase, there will be at least one picture of the Knight from Hollow Knight or Hornet from Silksong in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HollowKnight/comments/rczv0k/fellow_clowns_how_you_feeling/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>clown wig and make-up</u></a>, indicating that the poster is ready to feel like a fool when Silksong inevitably fails to appear.</p><p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/01/asasisbfdc7d1-1754062608945.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">A popular online meme where Hollow Knight waits foolishly for Silksong news.

It signifies the folly of wanting to learn more about Silksong.

April Fool‚Äôs Day</u></a>.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Light at the End of the Tunnel</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Team Cherry confirmed multiple times throughout 2024 that Silksong would not be appearing at any of that year‚Äôs biggest shows. It was not present in any of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-fans-crushed-as-summer-showcases-pass-with-no-silksong-announcement"><u>2024‚Äôs E3-replacement Summer Showcases</u></a>, and Geoff Keighley confirmed that Silksong would <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-will-not-be-at-opening-night-live-geoff-keighley-confirms"><u>not appear as part of Opening Night Live</u></a> at Gamescom 2024. Team Cherry also skipped <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-fans-are-ready-to-have-their-hearts-broken-again-by-tuesdays-nintendo-direct"><u>back-to-back Nintendo Directs</u></a> that year, both the August 2024 Indie Direct and the Third-Party Partner Direct.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, 2025 has been a different story. The year began with a fan posting on the official Hollow Knight subreddit that they ran into Silksong co-director Ari Gibson. According to the fan, Gibson joked about there not being a sequel yet, but that there would be more to share <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HollowKnight/comments/1i42wln/met_ari_gibson_a_few_days_ago/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>‚Äúsoon.‚Äù</u></a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">That was no bluff. On March 19, 2025, Xbox published a new <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/03/18/idxbox-developers-finding-success-with-xbox/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>ID@Xbox blog</u></a> highlighting its ongoing commitments to release great indie games, including Silksong. And a few weeks later, during the April 2 Nintendo Direct, Silksong re-emerged in the show‚Äôs sizzle reel with a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-makes-brief-appearance-during-nintendo-switch-2-direct-to-secure-2025-release-window"><u>2025 release window</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Silksong made another appearance during the announcement for the upcoming ROG Ally X handheld, where the game was seen briefly running on the Xbox-branded device. Team Cherry‚Äôs Matthew Griffin later confirmed in the official Hollow Knight Discord server that Silksong‚Äôs release is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-developer-responds-to-release-date-confusion-promises-launch-before-holiday-not-tied-to-xbox-handheld-arrival"><u>not tied to any particular console</u></a> and the sequel is still slated to be released ‚Äúbefore holiday [2025].‚Äù And now we know that Silksong will be <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-has-a-new-hollow-knight-silksong-demo-playable-at-gamescom"><u>playable at the Xbox booth at Gamescom</u></a>. This will be the first playable demo for the game since 2019. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Silksong was a no-show at the most recent Nintendo Partner Direct ‚Äî <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-fans-react-in-uproar-after-the-games-latest-nintendo-direct-no-show"><u>cue the clown memes</u></a> ‚Äî it does feel like we‚Äôre finally going to get the elusive Silksong, six long, painful years after it was announced that the DLC character, Hornet, will be starring in her own game.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>I didn‚Äôt expect a brief game about flies to make me emotional. But when I finished <em>Time Flies</em>, I nearly began to cry.</p><p><em>Time Flies</em> initially seems very silly. You play as a little buzzing fly that has to try and accomplish a bucket list of tasks before it, well, kicks the bucket, something that happens in a matter of seconds. The tasks are vague, with titles like ‚ÄúJust Roll with It‚Äù or ‚ÄúMeet Your Biggest Fan,‚Äù and the goal of the game is to zip around each level, generally cause mischief to complete the tasks, and finish an entire stage‚Äôs bucket list to move on to the next one. (Naturally, the last task of each list involves dying in some way.)</p><p>The task titles are usually a joke or a pun of some kind, and a lot of the fun is finding objects around the levels and messing with them to see if they fit. Unrolling an entire roll of toilet paper completes the ‚ÄúJust Roll with It‚Äù task. You ‚ÄúMeet Your Biggest Fan‚Äù by turning on a fan.</p><p>When you‚Äôre flying around from place to place, things stay zoomed out and the fly is just a tiny speck. When you approach something of some significance, though, the game will zoom in so that you can more easily hop on that roll of toilet paper or grab the fan‚Äôs chain. The tighter perspectives are also generally a clue that you‚Äôre interacting with something that‚Äôs part of your list of goals.</p><p>One quirky part of the <em>Time Flies</em>: you choose how long your life is by selecting what country you‚Äôre in. Based on World Health Organization (WHO) data, the game translates real information about life expectancy into seconds to determine the life of your little fly. Picking the US gave me a life expectancy of 76.4 seconds, but I usually said I was in Japan, which gave me a comparatively lengthy 84.5 seconds. Because the runs are so short, every second counts ‚Äî though there is a clever way to give yourself a few more seconds to explore the levels.</p><p>Once I got the hang of things, I found myself zipping through the game‚Äôs four stages to figure out the bucket list tasks and eventually string them all together, and I finished it after a couple hours. As the game went on, I felt that some of the tasks got a bit more sincere, even if the activities to accomplish them were still quite silly. Don‚Äôt we all aspire to ‚ÄúBring People Together‚Äù (push one bust toward another with a wheelchair to make them kiss), ‚ÄúSpend Time with Family‚Äù (sit on a floating pile of garbage with other flies), and ‚ÄúReflect on Your Life‚Äù (fly into an upside-down mirror world)?</p><p>Maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm a new dad and I‚Äôm just a little bit softer now. But when I showed my wife the whole game ‚Äî which, if you know what you‚Äôre doing, you can do in just a few minutes ‚Äî we were both choked up on the couch. Even a little fly can have a big life.</p><p><sup>Time Flies</sup><em><sup> is now available on Nintendo Switch, PC, and PlayStation.</sup></em></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games-review/707596/time-flies-review-pc-nintendo-switch-playstation-panic-playables]]></content:encoded>

    <p><span>Embark on the second half of the Amphorean story alongside Hysilens and Cerydra.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>The version 3.5 update for <em><a title="Games > Honkai: Star Rail [41 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/honkai-star-rail">Honkai: Star Rail</a></em>, dubbed ‚ÄúBefore Their Deaths,‚Äù will launch on August 13, developer <a title="Companies > miHoYo [201 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mihoyo">miHoYo</a> announced. <span id="more-981945"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the update, via miHoYo:</p><blockquote><p>This update officially kicks off the second half of the Amphoreus story. Trailblazers will encounter new companions, confront fresh enemies and events, and witness old friends in entirely new forms. Hysilens and Cerydra will also make their long-awaited debut as playable characters, joining players in the next leg of the Amphorean trailblazing expedition.</p><p>In the previous chapter, the Trailblazer made a promise to Phainon and took up the mantle of the Deliverer. In return, Phainon unleashed their blazing wrath upon Nanook, once again forcing Irontomb‚Äôs advance to a halt. Yet the journey is far from over, rescuing Amphoreus remains an unavoidable challenge. In the new Trailblaze Mission, the Trailblazer will accompany Cyrene into another cycle of Eternal Recurrence, traveling back a thousand years to the ancient Okhema. This was the age when Imperator Cerydra, the holder of the Law Coreflame, ruler of Okhema, Aglaea‚Äôs predecessor, still sat upon the throne of Okhema.</p><p>Version 3.5 introduces two powerful new characters to the team of Trailblazers. The first is Hysilens, commander of the holy city‚Äôs knights and a 5-star Physical-Type character following the Path of Nihility. Hysilens excels when paired with characters who specialize in DoT. Upon using her Ultimate, Hysilens creates a Zone. While the Zone is active, each instance of DoT inflicted on enemies will trigger an additional DoT from her. At the same time, all enemies will suffer reduced ATK and DEF. Moreover, her Basic ATK, Skill, and Ultimate each have a chance to apply a random type of DoT. Her Skill also increases the DMG enemies take, boosting the team‚Äôs overall DMG output.</p><p>The other 5-star Wind-Type character following the Path of Harmony, Imperator Cerydra, is the holder of the Law Coreflame and the initiator of the first Flame-Chase Journey. A master strategist raised on the principles of chess, she excels at long-term planning and command. In combat, her Skill grants an ally a special upgradable buff known as ‚ÄúMilitary Merit,‚Äù increasing the ally‚Äôs ATK and dealing additional DMG. As the battle progresses, Military Merit levels up. The affected ally will gain increased CRIT DMG and All-Type RES PEN when using Skills and can even replicate their Skill effects, boosting the team‚Äôs overall DMG output. Her Ultimate deals DMG to all enemies and obtains Charge for herself, providing sustained support for the team.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Additionally, the limited 5-star characters Stellaron Hunter Kafka and Silver Wolf will have their return in the first and second halves of the Version 3.5 warp event. Their formidable support makes them invaluable allies for our Trailblazers‚Äô future journeys.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_981947"><ul><li><span>‚ùÆ</span></li><li><span>‚ùØ</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p>Version 3.5 will also introduce a brand-new map, offering Trailblazers a fresh glimpse into Styxia, the City of Infinite Revelry. The story will reach a turning point as Trailblazers face off directly against Lygus, an enemy who constantly shifts between two distinct forms. As the battle intensifies, his true identity and hidden motives may slowly be revealed.</p><p>Version 3.5 brings not only new characters and stories, but also a variety of fun-filled events for Trailblazers to enjoy. In the ‚ÄúChrysos Maze Grand Restaurant‚Äù event, Trailblazers will work alongside the Chrysos Heirs to manage a restaurant in Aedes Elysiae. As a ‚ÄúRestaurant Manager,‚Äù you‚Äôll serve delicious food to the fairies of the Membrance Maze and renovate the run-down venue by managing it wisely to win their praise and support. Meanwhile, in the ‚ÄúOld Brews &amp; New Friends‚Äù event, Trailblazers will once again step behind the counter as a guest drinksmith at the ‚ÄúDreamjolt Hostelry,‚Äù mixing drinks and reuniting with familiar faces to share heartwarming moments.</p><p>Version 3.5 will also introduce a voice toggle feature for collaboration characters. Trailblazers will be able to switch their interaction, combat, and idle voice lines between the in-game dub and the original licensed voice actors, offering a more immersive experience. Additionally, Honkai: Star Rail will be attending this year‚Äôs gamescom. Trailblazers are invited to stop by the event booth to check in and pick up some giveaways.

<p>It was Direct week over in Nintendo Land, with a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-july-2025-every-announcement-game-reveal-trailer">Partner Showcase</a> delivering us 25 minutes of... meh. There were some big hitters that we're pleased to see (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/persona-3-reload">Persona 3 Reload</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/octopath-traveler-0">Octopath Traveler 0</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/adventures-of-elliot-the-millennium-tales">The Adventures of Elliot</a>), but we were hoping to be a <em>little</em> more excited by the whole affair.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, new card art in Pok√©mon TCG Pocket <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/pokemon-tcg-pocket-pulls-new-expansion-card-art-amid-accusations-of-plagiarism">landed TPC in hot water</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/mario_paint">Mario Paint</a> made a surprise appearance on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/nintendo-expands-switch-onlines-snes-library-with-a-mouse-game">Nintendo Switch Online</a>, and Microsoft confirmed that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> will be <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/hollow-knight-silksong-will-be-playable-at-gamescom-2025">playable at Gamescom</a> ‚Äî we're <em>totally</em> not envious of everyone getting to go hands-on with it...</p>

<p>Now then, what's team NL up to this weekend?</p>

<h2>Jim Norman, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I am feeling very much <em>BetweenGamesTM</em> at the moment after polishing off DK and all its related guides. I was hoping to have a little something drop my way in the Direct, but left feeling pretty uninspired, if I'm honest. I'll defo check out the Elliot demo this weekend, and the recent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-gets-free-switch-2-performance-patch">free Switch 2 update</a> for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dragon_quest_iii_hd-2d_remake">Dragon Quest III</a> has me keen for some more HD-2D action.</p>
<p>Have a good one, friends!</p>
<h2>Alana Hagues, Deputy Editor</h2>
<p>There aren't many changes in my gaming habits from last week, folks! I'm in the endgame of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> and, let me tell you, they've definitely saved the best until last, I'm going to 100% this big banana and nothing is going to stop me from doing so.</p>
<p>I did pick up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/no-sleep-for-kaname-date-from-ai-the-somnium-files">No Sleep For Kaname Date</a>, even though reviews seem a little lower and I was pretty disappointed in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/ai_the_somnium_files_-_nirvana_initiative">nirvanA Initiative</a> (I know that's not a common opinion; I'm sorry!). Still, I love these characters enough that I want to spend more time with them. We'll see! Have a good one!</p>

<h2>PJ O'Reilly, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>This weekend I‚Äôm gonna be digging into a few different things that I‚Äôve picked up in the sale, and I won‚Äôt feel bad about telling you that one of them is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/ea_sports_fc_25">FC 25</a>. I just really needed an on-the-go footie fix, even if it is running at 30fps on my Switch 2.</p>
<p>In much nicer news, I‚Äôll also be having a blast on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/shadow-labyrinth-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Shadow Labyrinth</a>, which I picked up despite it not scoring quite as highly as I‚Äôd hoped in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/shadow-labyrinth-nintendo-switch-2-edition">our review</a>. I‚Äôve also been making progress in The Hundred Line - Last Defence Academy and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_echoes_of_wisdom">Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a>, so both of those will get some loving too.</p>
<p>Have a good one!</p>
<h2>Gon√ßalo Lopes, Contributor</h2>
<p>It is going to be hard to hold out on picking up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/megadrive/earthion">Earthion</a> on Steam, but I really want to play this one on consoles. I did start making progress on Donkey Kong Bananza, and it is such a cathartic experience. Moving on to <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps2/tekken_5">Tekken 5</a> while still progressing my <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> World Tour save and moving upward to battle 25 on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/front_mission_3_remake">Front Mission 3: Remake</a>. The end game is still a long way off...</p>
<p>My game of the week is the incredible, shrewd move by SEGA! In an assault worthy of a true ninja, releasing the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/shinobi_art_of_vengeance">SHINOBI: Art of Vengeance</a> demo on the same day <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ninja_gaiden_ragebound">Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</a> got its own release was something out of guerrilla '90s marketing. Said entry in the Ninja Gaiden series is not only my game of the week but one of my GOTY candidates. And by the end of this month, I would write the exact same sentence about Shinobi were I not away on vacation. Truly, this is the Summer of the Ninja!</p>

<h2>Kate Gray, Contributor</h2>
<p>This weekend, I was going to do a bunch of garden stuff, but the weather is pants, so that means I'm going to stay inside instead. Now that my Tales of the Shire review is done and dusted, I can go back to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hundred_line_-_last_defense_academy">Hundred Line</a>! Yayyyy. I'm on day 80-something, and I hear I have a lot more to do, so I'm looking forward to that.</p>
<p>Otherwise, I'm trying to keep my video game slate fairly open, because <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/story_of_seasons_grand_bazaar">Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar</a> comes out in a month, so I want to make sure I have time to fit it in.</p>
<p>Oh, and I've been playing <strong>Peak</strong> with friends. Very good, although I'm certainly not very good at it. I really need to work on being a team player and not just flinging myself up at cliff faces, then getting stuck...</p>
