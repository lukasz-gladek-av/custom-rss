			<p>Developer Heart Machine's <a href="https://wccftech.com/hyper-light-breaker-preview-lo-fi-roguelite/">Hyper Light Breaker</a> launched at the top of the year in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1534840/Hyper_Light_Breaker/">Early Access</a>, and the studio has officially announced that its first major update, Buried Below, will arrive on <strong>April 29, 2025.</strong></p>
<p>Regarding what's new in the update, a new Breaker called Rondo will be added to the game, who comes with a new SyCom with two perks, a new crown called Maw, two new melee weapons, and new environments to run through, such as caves.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>The rest of the major changes are quality-of-life updates and significant changes to the run structure. In a press release, Heart Machine calls it "<em>the most significant feature overhaul yet with a complete rework of the game's run structure</em>."</p>
<p>Players will now have one life per run, losing items in their inventory and resetting the Overgrowth when they die. Heart Machine says this change will allow the team to "better adjust difficulty and make the game easier to get into<em>&nbsp;but harder to master</em>."</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Along with this change comes a few new gameplay loops, including introducing more ways for players to leave the Overgrowth, SyComs following more of a class-like system with character customization being redesigned, and streamlining vendors and player inventory.</p>
<p>The final significant aspect of the update is an improved onboarding path. Once the update is live, first-time players will be thrown into a tutorial that will take them through the game's core mechanics and explain a few key aspects they'll need to know with Hyper Light Breaker. Heart Machine hopes that this new tutorial will be useful to first-time players and even returning players who may just want a refresher on the basics.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>As part of the new update being revealed, Heart Machine is providing Wccftech 20 game keys to giveaway beginning&nbsp;<strong>Wednesday, May 7, 2025</strong>, a week after the update will have gone live. Make sure to follow Wccftech's and Heart Machine's social channels to be prepared for the giveaway so you don't miss it.</p>

It was literally <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/frostpunk-3-could-launch-as-early-as-2027-with-an-untitled-larger-scale-11-bit-game-planned-for-2029">only last week</a> that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/11-bit-studios">11 bit studios</a> announced a new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/frostpunk">Frostpunk</a> was on the way, even saying that it could have a release date "as early as 2027." Yet, here we are now, with the reveal of what it actually is. It's not Frostpunk 3, it's not a spinoff, it's Frostpunk 1886, a "reimagined" version of the original game. Yes, that basically just means that it's a remake, though it does sound like it's got a bit more going on from it than the original.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
For starters, Frostpunk 1886 is being made in Unreal Engine as opposed to 11 bit's homegrown Liquid Engine. For the most part that won't matter much to you or me, except for the fact that this version of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> game will actually have mod support. This isn't something that was possible in the original game due to "technical limitations", says 11 bit in a press release.

<p>
11 bit also notes that this won't just be a visual upgrade, as there'll be new content, mechanics, laws, and even a new Purpose path. No details on what any of that new content will actually be, but it sounds like a reasonable amount effort was put into make sure they're not just selling you a remake of a game that won't even be a decade old by the time 1886 releases (11 bit reaffirmed that it's slated for a 2027 release date, and that development has already started).
</p>
<p>
Currently 11 bit are still working on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/frostpunk-2">Frostpunk 2</a>, which had a bit of a rocky start, though seems to be in a bit better shape these days. Oh, and don't worry, the devs also said that Frostpunk 1886 and Frostpunk 2 will "evolve side by side", so it's not a complete do over.

Let’s see what he’s got to work with.</p><p>1. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;#basics&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="#basics">Basic kit</a></span><br>2. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;#overdrive&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="#overdrive">Special mechanic: Overdrive</a></span><br>3. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;#builds&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="#builds">Recommended builds/synergy</a></span><br>4. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;#skills&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="#skills">Skills to aim for</a></span></p><h2 id="h1045268"><a id="basics"></a>Basic kit</h2><p>Naturally, being our hero character, Gustave’s got the comparatively boring combo of a big-ass sword and a moderate-ass gun. Fortunately, he happens to be quite good with both. How could he not be? That mustache is just giving “will duel at ten paces at a Starbucks”.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-skills-gustave-lune-maelle-1851777515&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-skills-gustave-lune-maelle-1851777515">Grab These Skills First In <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></a></span></p><p>As for starting skills, he’s the first in your crew to have <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-skills-gustave-lune-maelle-1851777515&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-skills-gustave-lune-maelle-1851777515">the ability to Mark enemies using Marking Shot</a></span>, a lightning-based skill which sets baddies up to take more damage on the next hit. It’s a tool you gotta wield carefully to get the most out of it, but an important one. The most crucial one, for reasons you’re about to find out, is Lumiere Assault, which is a snazzy five hit combo. It doesn’t do massive damage on its own, but mostly it’s because it’s your best primer for.</p><h2 id="h1045269"><a id="overdrive"></a>Special mechanic: Overdrive</h2><p>So, this here is your main event, the thing you should be working towards with Gustave at all times. See, every time you attack, dodge, or parry an enemy, his Winter Soldier-brand prosthetic arm gains a charge, up to 10. Overdrive then allows Gustave to release the charges for a huge amount of damage, which can also break enemies if their meter’s built up at least halfway. Naturally, the more you can stock up, the better—especially in the early going, a fully charged Overdrive is basically game over for every enemy you meet. But that still means getting 10 Overdrives and having the AP in stock to unleash it. <br></p><h2 id="h1045270"><a id="builds"></a>Recommended builds/synergy</h2><p>Here, my friends, is where Lumiere Assault comes in. You come pre-equipped with a skill that gives you five charges for Overdrive right up front—as long as you hit the QTEs. It’s also extremely useful for enemies with shields, since taking down five shields at once will make the job extremely easy for the rest of your crew. However, you’re still going to want to give Overdrive as much a chance for total devastation as possible before you drop the hammer. You’ll get a skill early on called Powerful which increases damage output for the whole party, but you’ll mostly want to use Pictos/Lumina. </p><p>Focus on perks that grant extra AP after killing an enemy or dodging (e.g. Dodger, Dead Energy) so you’re not caught out there with a full charge, but no way to capitalize. Critical Burn is also a nice one to slap on after Lune’s in your party. Set enemies on fire, and then at least one of your Overdrive hits will be absolutely devastating. <br></p><h2 id="h1045271"><a id="skills"></a>Skills to aim for</h2><p>Once you’re a bit further down the road, Strike Storm and Shatter wind up becoming your best friends. Strike Storm is basically a better Lumiere Assault, which can give you eight charges if you hit it right, and Shatter can break enemies without having to drop the Overcharge just yet. Also, From Fire is extremely useful once both Lune and Maelle are with you, since it’s basically a bespoke way for Gustave to heal himself without dipping into your collection of tints, or taking the others away from the important work of burning everything alive. </p><hr><p><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> is available now on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows PCs.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

    <p><span>Introducing a new boss and major quality of life updates.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>Publisher <a title="Companies > Arc Games [101 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/arc-games">Arc Games</a> and developer <a title="Companies > Heart Machine [32 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/heart-machine">Heart Machine</a> will release the “Buried Below” update for the Early Access version of <a title="Genres > Open-World [618 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/open-world">open-world</a> <a title="Genres > Co-Op [254 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer/co-op">cooperative</a> <a title="Genres > Roguelite [240 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/roguelite">roguelite game</a> <em><a title="Games > Hyper Light Breaker [10 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/hyper-light-breaker">Hyper Light Breaker</a></em> on April 29, the companies announced. <span id="more-960765"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the update, via Arc Games:</p><blockquote><p><strong>New Content</strong></p><p>On the content front, Buried Below will bring a new Breaker, “Rondo”—a Breaker who comes from the same region as the recently-debuted Breaker, Ravona, and has a new SyCom with two SyCom perks—a new Crown, “Maw”—the biggest and most menacing Crown yet, two new melee weapons and new environments to explore, including caves. For the new Crown, Early Access players have seen glimpses of her in a couple of ways—as she’s shown as a Crown that’s possible to fight when readying up to enter the Overgrowth and players have entered her arena in the hostile crystalscape of the Jeweled Spire. The Heart Machine team’s been working hard on getting Maw ready, and they’re thrilled the time has come for players to face her in just a few days!</p><p><strong>Change in Run Structure</strong></p><p>Since Early Access launch, the Heart Machine has taken to heart all of the player feedback they’ve received across the board. Inspired by player feedback, the upcoming update will introduce the most significant feature overhaul yet with a complete rework of the game’s run structure, as players will now have one life for each run and when they die they will lose items in their inventory, and the Overgrowth will reset. This change was made to balance the game around a more traditional roguelike experience, turning each run into a more consistent and rewarding “zero to hero” adventure than before. This change also allows the Heart Machine to better adjust difficulty and make the game easier to get into, but harder to master, and addresses much of the feedback the team has received from players since Early Access launch.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>This shift in run structure will introduce a few gameplay loops and progression changes to make runs easier, better and ultimately more enjoyable for all players, including veterans and newcomers alike, than before.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_960766"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><ul><li><strong>Extraction</strong> – More Options for Players: Instead of only one way to leave the Overgrowth (via the Telepad), players will be able to extract at any Shrine in the Overgrowth and there’ll be no waves of enemies to defeat like before. This change will make it so players can extract more often, making the game easier as a result which was one of the main requests from players to change the game’s difficulty.</li><li><strong>SyComs</strong> – Follows a Class-Like System, More Loadout Potential: Character customization has been redesigned giving each Breaker one assigned SyCom with fixed stats, and players have the option to equip a perk to the SyCom that gives the Breaker a new passive ability. For instance, Rondo’s SyCom has an equippable perk called “Bladedancer” that increases Rondo’s damage and attack speed. Players can develop their SyCom stats further at Shrines in the Overgrowth with extended upgrades unlocked through meta progression. This change, inspired by player feedback, will make it so each Breaker is similar to a “class” making each Breaker feel different from one another, and make it so players can come up with distinct builds per Breaker.</li><li><strong>Inventory and Vendors</strong> – More Streamlined: The Vault system will be changed as when you die, the inventory in your Vault will no longer carry over between runs except for Golden Rations, the main meta progression currency in the game. This will allow players to focus solely on acquiring new gear during their runs instead of having to focus on managing their inventory so often like before. Additionally, vendors in the Overgrowth and Cursed Outpost will also have new roles, with Bright Blood and Materials now used for purchases and upgrades. While gear sales have been removed from hub vendors, players can still use them to enhance equipped items.</li></ul><p><strong>Improved Onboarding</strong></p><p>The second major addition in the upcoming patch is a brand-new onboarding tutorial that launches automatically the first time players start the game after the update, regardless of save status. This guided experience introduces core mechanics through a structured level that leads to the Cursed Outpost hub. From there, players will gain access to a dedicated space for learning and practicing advanced combat techniques such as dash attacks and parries. Designed to align with the game’s reworked structure and expanded mechanics, this revamped introduction provides a smooth and informative entry point for both new and returning players.</p></blockquote><p><em>Hyper Light Breaker</em> is currently in Early Access for <a title="Platforms > PC [22,979 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1534840/Hyper_Light_Breaker/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p><p>Watch a new trailer below.

                <p>Cyberpunk 2077 has seen tremendous growth since launching in 2020.

Nintendo users weren't able to play the open-world RPG on Switch, but they will be able to play it on Switch 2 on June 5, which is the same day the console launches. <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Cyberpunk+2077+Nintendo+Switch+2+Preorders+Are+Live+-+Full+Game+Is+On+The+Cart&amp;fnauthor=stevenpetite&amp;fndate=2025-04-24+09%3A11%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-04-24+09%3A11%3A23&amp;fnarticle_id=6531086&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Pre-Order+Guides&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FCyberpunk-2077-Ultimate-Edition-Nintendo-Switch-2%2F16204669929%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fcyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition-nintendo-switch-physical-game-cartridge-preorder-walmart%2F1100-6531086%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition</a> is now available to preorder for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/" data-ref-id="1100-6530531">Nintendo Switch 2</a>. </p><div title="[Various] Cyberpunk 2077 Ultimate Edition for Nintendo Switch 2" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="3427" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="[Various] Cyberpunk 2077 Ultimate Edition for Nintendo Switch 2" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/1804712/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/Cyberpunk-2077-Ultimate-Edition-Nintendo-Switch-2/16204669929&amp;subId1=subid_value" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/goto.walmart.com\/c\/1804712\/565706\/9383?veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https:\/\/www.walmart.com\/ip\/Cyberpunk-2077-Ultimate-Edition-Nintendo-Switch-2\/16204669929&amp;subId1=subid_value&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://goto.walmart.com/c/1804712/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/Cyberpunk-2077-Ultimate-Edition-Nintendo-Switch-2/16204669929&amp;subId1=subid_value">Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition for Switch 2</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/1804712/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/Cyberpunk-2077-Ultimate-Edition-Nintendo-Switch-2/16204669929&amp;subId1=subid_value" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/goto.walmart.com\/c\/1804712\/565706\/9383?veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https:\/\/www.walmart.com\/ip\/Cyberpunk-2077-Ultimate-Edition-Nintendo-Switch-2\/16204669929&amp;subId1=subid_value&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://goto.walmart.com/c/1804712/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/Cyberpunk-2077-Ultimate-Edition-Nintendo-Switch-2/16204669929&amp;subId1=subid_value">$70 | Releases June 5</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>This is the only version of the game up for preorder.

Better yet, all of this content is included on a physical 64GB game card--meaning you won’t need to download additional content to your console. At the moment, Cyberpunk 2077 is the only third-party Switch 2 with all of the game data on the cart--other third-party titles are Game Key Cards, which require additional downloads from the eShop.</p><p>Considering the size and scope of Cyberpunk 2077, it's pretty awesome that this is a true physical edition.</p></div>                      </div><p>Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition has been optimized for smooth gameplay on Switch 2. This includes the use of Nvidia’s DLSS upscaling technology, support for Gyroscope Mode and motion controls, touchscreen menu navigation, and compatibility with the Joy-Con 2's mouse controls.</p><hr><p>Looking for more Switch 2 games and gear ahead of its release?

                <p>EA Sports has announced a new paid season pass for FC 25, the first of its kind for the soccer series, and the developer anticipated fans having a lot of questions about this.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/ea-sports-fc/fc-25/news/pitch-notes-fc25-premium-pass" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>, EA Sports said the paid season pass is "purely additive," but many believe it's just the latest example of EA trying to squeeze even more money out of players beyond the microtransaction-heavy Ultimate Team mode. The FC 25 "Premium Pass," as it's called, can be purchased with FC Points or UT Coins at a cost of 1,000 FC Points ($10 USD) or 500,000 worth of in-game earnable UT Coins.</p><p><span>As for what's included, players get tradeable packs and Season Points boosters, along with more player items, evolution consumables, retro-themed cosmetics. The graphic below shows everything included with the paid expansion pack, and some of the content is exclusive to the Premium Pass.</span></p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4482027-screenshot2025-04-24at11.00.04am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4482027" data-ratio="0.56" data-width="1025" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4482027-screenshot2025-04-24at11.00.04am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4482027"></a><figcaption>The new Premium Pass includes all of this content.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4482027-screenshot2025-04-24at11.00.04am.png"></figure><h2><strong>What's In The Premium Season Pass</strong></h2><p><em>Descriptions written by EA</em></p><ul><li>Tradeable Packs  <ul><li>For the first time, we’re including Tradeable Packs as part of Seasonal Rewards through the Premium Pass.</li></ul></li><li>SP (Season Points) Boosters  <ul><li>Receive 10,000 SP at level 20 of the Premium Pass, unlocking up to 10 levels of the Premium and Standard Pass Seasonal ladder.</li></ul></li><li>Player Items  <ul><li>TOTS Flashbacks.</li><li>TOTS Honourable Mentions (based on 2024/25 performances).</li></ul></li><li>Evolution Consumables  <ul><li>Earn Evolution Consumables that provide Role++ and Playstyle+ improvements  <ul><li>In the Standard Ladder, the requirements for the Playstyle+ Evolutions will be: Max 94 OVR, Max 8 Playstyles, Max 3 Playstyle+.</li><li>In the Premium Pass, the requirements for the Playstyle+ Evolutions will be: Max 95 OVR, Max 8 Playstyles, Max 3 Playstyle+.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Retro Cosmetic Evolutions  <ul><li>Similar to the Cosmetic Evolutions introduced during FUT Birthday, we’ll be introducing more retro shell designs from Football Ultimate Team history and this time they’ll be TOTS themed.</li></ul></li></ul><p>FC 25 already has a Standard Pass, and the rewards for that track will continue "as if there was no Premium Pass," EA said.

Retailers suffered from technical issues and available supply sold out quickly, with some customers even finding their orders canceled. Over on eBay, the predictable wave of US Switch 2 preorder resales has now begun, but some listings aren't what they appear to be, and are instead <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fed-up-with-switch-2-scalpers-nintendo-fans-are-fighting-back/1100-6530806/" data-ref-id="1100-6530806">seemingly part of an anti-scammers/bot resistance</a>.</p><p>Sold listings show numerous people have now paid almost double the console's original retail price--$449, or $499 with Mario Kart World--to secure their console. However, as you scroll through the <a href="https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=nintendo+switch+2&amp;_sacat=0&amp;_from=R40&amp;_trksid=p2334524.m570.l1313&amp;_odkw=switch+2&amp;_osacat=0" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">listings</a>, you'll find more than a handful of fake Switch 2s. Going through the listings, some posts have already been taken down. It should be noted that eBay rules state that preorder listings have to be for things coming out within 40 days. June 5, however, is just out of reach at 42. So it's a possibility that maybe these will be removed outright and relisted later.</p><p>While browsing, you'll see a <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/205444784624" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Switch 2 listed a few bucks less</a> and if you go read the description, it tells you point blank this is not what you're looking for.</p><p>"PRE-ORDER SCREENSHOT ONLY PLEASE NOTE!!!!!: You are ordering a picture of the Nintendo Switch 2. This listing is to fight bots and scalpers. No refunds. You will receive a png image of a switch 2. No console. Message me with any questions or offers!"</p><p>These listings almost outnumber scalpers who are selling at marked-up prices.</p><p>The actual Switch 2 consoles all have a similar description as well, saying the console will be in hand and delivered around June 11. The cheapest I was able to find this morning <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/326548391576" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">was about $715 or best offer</a>, and that's the console and Mario Kart World bundle. For just the console, <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/335927772445" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">$650 seems to be as low as it goes</a>. Restocks are expected in the coming days and weeks, and Nintendo's own store will open preorders in May for certain eligible customers. We'll be tracking all of the availability in our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/" data-ref-id="1100-6530531">Switch 2 restock guide</a>.</p><p>Preorders were originally scheduled for earlier this month, but were delayed for the US as Nintendo had to reconfigure the dates after President Trump upped tariffs. There was also some initial concern that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/will-tariffs-increase-switch-2s-price-why-the-console-and-games-are-so-expensive/1100-6530591/" data-ref-id="1100-6530591">the price would change for the console</a>, but only <a href="https://fandom.slack.com/archives/C07QX8B2GNN/p1745508506556539?thread_ts=1745507990.523329&amp;cid=C07QX8B2GNN" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">some Switch 2 accessories'</a> prices were raised to balance the hit.</p>

Co-development allowed Hellquist and Patel to intimately see how different studios are run, offering a rare opportunity to compare and contrast different ways of making games and picking the ones that worked for their shop.

The pair said it's a product born of their loves of system-driven games to drive player agency. But peeking over their shoulder, you can see a bit of that Fortnite Creative energy still lingering on the product—because as the pair explained it, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wartorn</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> mashes together genres, systems, and themes that don't work well together at first glance.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Wartorn'"><span>Wartorn'</span>s real-time strategy and roguelike gameplay</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wartorn</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is a single-player strategy game as inspired by Bungie's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Myth: The Fallen Lords</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> as it is modern roguelikes like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Slay the Spire</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Players take on the role of two siblings building an army of fantasy creatures to lead a caravan across a war-ravaged country and reunite with their family. Hellquist says Stray Kite is releasing the game in Early Access not just for economic reasons, but because the game is a "genre blend" that needs player feedback in development to properly mix together.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We know that we don't know everything we need to know," Hellquist said, accidentally </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_are_unknown_unknowns">invoking an infamous Donald Rumsfeld quote.</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> "Having players be on that journey with us helps us understand what they need and what they want out of this kind of experience."</span></p><p>Image via Stray Kite Studios.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The pair explained that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wartorn</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> balances their desire to push "player agency." Sometimes through familiar means, like a systems-driven elemental system that lets players experiment with cause-and-effect (and react to what goes wrong). Some of it is in conventional choice-driven narrative that balances the needs of the caravan against morality, evoking the mechanics of 11 bit studios' </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>This War of Mine </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">and Stoic Studios' </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Banner Saga.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But even if the pair want players to make their own choices and tell their own stories, they want those choices to take place against the backdrop of real-world struggles. The game's story of two young heroes fleeing a region racked by war is a personal one for Patel, who described how his parents fled Tanzania under the threat of violence. His mom had to abandon the dog that protected her from thieves and his father literally buried gold near his home in the hopes of one day returning to reclaim it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He never did. "There's some gold buried in Tanzania you can go get," Patel joked. "We've got this extremism that happened here, and it's personal to me...and it's personal for so many people in the world and throughout all of human history."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wartorn</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is a case study of where developers can rely on the "familiar" to experiment with something new. While Stray Kite pushes the boundaries on the game's setting and core gameplay, it's relying on familiar fantasy conventions and the popularity of roguelike progression to help players ground themselves. It's also an ambitious choice to tap the real-time strategy genre—though Patel said he prefers to think of it as "real-time tactics" given the smaller focus. "We've started calling this a real time tactics game, because it's a little closer to that," he said. "We're trying to distance ourselves from that expectation [that there will be] base building and managing people, gathering berries and things like that."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One might wonder if blending a dormant genre with roguelike mechanics (something that's not really been done successfully, as Hellquist noted) is a wise choice for a small team trying to stay financially afloat. But the pair hope other developers can join them in making these unusual blends of games. "I'm afraid we as an industry are going to stagnate," Hellquist said. "We don't feel like we can explore in the triple-A space the way he used to. I'm not sure a game like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>BioShock</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> could be made any more."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Financial survival doesn't have to translate to taking the safest choices possible. Stray Kite Studios is trying to show the game industry that taking risks isn't just about fulfilling the creative spirit—when well-grounded, it can be what helps your team evolve and grow instead of remaining stagnant.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.

            <p>
Evercade seller Funstock has become the first notable hardware retailer to freeze orders for US customers due to the country's ongoing trade war with China.
</p>
<p>
At the start of April, sweeping international tariffs enacted by US president Trump have caused stock markets to falter and left companies struggling to react as the situation fluctuates daily.
</p>
<p>
Now, retro console and handheld seller Funstock, which handles sales of the Evercade in the UK and internationally, has said it will be taking "a cautious approach to the situation" by "temporarily stopping any new orders and pre-orders for US customers".
</p>
<p>
"Until we know more, we do not want to put our customers at risk of unexpected charges," Funstock said in a statement emailed to existing customers this afternoon, as seen by Eurogamer. 
</p>
<p>
"As soon as the situation is clearer, we'll release a statement on our shipping policies going forward. This pause in service will be effective from Monday, 28th April and means that customers in the US will not be able to make new orders on our website."
</p>
<p>
Existing US customers still awaiting pre-orders will need to sit tight for now, Funstock continued. 
</p>
<p>
"We are exploring all available options to ascertain what our customers can expect with their pre-orders and will update you on any changes by 17th June," the company concluded. "We will advise all customers with existing pre-orders what to expect by that date."
</p>
<p>
Orders to customers in Canada are unaffected, Funstock noted.

Funstock is far from the only video games company which has reacted to the US tariffs. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-delays-us-switch-2-pre-orders-due-to-tariffs">Nintendo delayed US Switch 2 pre-orders until today</a> while it reassessed the situation and ultimately <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-raising-cost-of-switch-2-accessories-in-us-due-to-tariffs-but-console-price-to-remain-same-1">raised the prices of Switch 2 accessories in response</a>. PlayStation, meanwhile, recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-raises-ps5-price-yet-again-in-uk-and-mainland-europe">raised the price of PS5 in various countries, including the UK</a>, citing "the backdrop of a challenging economic environment, including high inflation and fluctuating exchange rates".

However, shortly after 11:30AM ET, it appears some people started to be able to complete orders, including one <em>Verge</em> staffer.</p><p>Right as the clock rolled over to 11AM, many of us at <em>The Verge</em> experienced issues with the website. At first, GameStop’s website showed me a mostly-blank page – the only text on it was “Oops…Something went wrong” [sic] and a refresh button. Soon after, myself and other <em>Verge</em> staffers often saw Cloudflare notices on GameStop’s website instead, including error notices that said the “web server is down” or that the site is experiencing a “bad gateway.”</p><p>Occasionally, the online listing for the Switch 2 and <em>Mario Kart World</em> bundle has loaded for me, but the preorder button will be grayed out. One colleague also got the console-only option listing to load, but with a “not available” button in place of a preorder one.</p><p>GameStop’s mobile app has also been showing error messages for me, including one that vaguely says “activity paused,” when I try to open it.</p><p>At 11:34AM ET, deals-hunter Wario64 posted that GameStop’s Switch 2 preorders <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1915429174073774270">were actually live</a>. A few <em>Verge</em> staffers were then able to get a console in their cart, and one was actually able to make a purchase. However, as of about 12:30PM ET, they haven’t received a confirmation email, the order isn’t on their order list, and their card hasn’t been charged.</p><p>Another staffer thought they had the console in their cart, but when their cart actually loaded, GameStop said it was out of stock. Since then, none of us at <em>The Verge</em> have been able to try and check out a Switch 2 on GameStop’s website.</p><p>“We’re seeing overwhelming demand for Switch 2, which is causing some site issues. In-store preorders are open and running smoothly,” GameStop said on <a href="https://x.com/GameStopHelp/status/1915429914641350721">its support account on X</a>. “Our team is actively working to fix it. Hang in there — we’ll keep you posted.”</p><p>We’ve contacted GameStop for comment.</p><p><em>Developing…</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The standard model has a 30 degree tiled angle with contoured design for a natural resting position, rubberized side grips, an extended thumb rest, and a free-spinning tiltable scroll wheel for horizontal scrolling. The Vertical Edition goes for a more handshake-like grip with a 71.7 degree angle, big cutout to grip with your thumb, and an extended base that slightly elevates the wrist to reduce strain.</p><p>The new V2 versions replace the original <a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fmena-en%2Fproductivity%2Frazer-pro-click" rel="sponsored">Pro Click</a> that Razer designed with ergonomic office furniture company Humanscale.

            <p>Wombo Games - that is to say, the new studio from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a> co-founder and ex-<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> chief creative officer Janos Flösser - has unveiled its first title.</p>
<p>It's a "pulse pounding" top-down roguelite called Raiders of Blackveil, with a focus on "mastering champions, combining synergistic perks and acquiring powerful loot".</p>
<p>It's all set in a dystopian industrial fantasy world full of oppressed animals. Who is oppressing these poor beasts? Well, humans, of course. They have formed a mega corporation known as, you guessed it, Blackveil.</p>
<p>"You will join the animal rebellion as they aim to thwart Blackveil’s attempt at enslaving nature and enforcing a mindless consumer society," <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3352240/Raiders_of_Blackveil/">reads the game's Steam page</a>.</p>
<p>Raiders of Blackveil includes a range of MOBA-inspired champions, "each with unique abilities, playstyles, and personalities". Roles, meanwhile, include Tank, Damage Dealer, or Support.</p>
<p>Those working on Raiders of Blackveil include veteran developers whose previous works includes the likes of Tomb Raider, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/deus-ex">Deus Ex</a>, Just Cause and, of course, Hitman.</p>
<p>"Wombo Games has been developing Raiders of Blackveil for nearly two years so it's surreal to finally be able to announce it, and Wombo Games, to the world," said Flösser of the game's reveal.</p>
<p>"Raiders of Blackveil is our first title so it's very special to us. It is a blueprint of our studio because every person at Wombo has contributed directly to its development. At Wombo, we make decisions by consensus, and plan to continue that with feedback from our players once we launch in early access later this year."</p>
<p>If you are interested, you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3352240/Raiders_of_Blackveil/">add Raiders of Blackveil to your Steam wishlist now</a>.</p>

<p>As for Flösser's former studio, it is currently working on a new James Bond title. IO first announced its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hitman-developer-io-reveals-fresh-project">James Bond game back in 2021</a>. Very little has been shared on it since, although <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hitman-studio-io-opens-up-a-little-about-its-james-bond-007-game">our Bertie managed to tease a few extra 00-details out of the team back in 2023</a>.</p>
<p>More recently, IO said it hopes its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hitman-developer-says-james-bond-game-will-hopefully-be-the-start-of-a-trilogy">upcoming James Bond origin story will be the start of a trilogy</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

You can ride dragons, get inside giant mechs, and explore a medieval-infused map with your trusty shield saw. It looks like an impressive evolution of the series coming off of the mixed reaction to <em>Doom Eternal</em>. </p><p><em>Wolfenstein I</em> and <em>II</em> are also very decent. I think the first has a better overall shooter campaign but the second features much bigger, better, and more interesting cinematic moments. The bundle will be on sale through early May and proceeds go to the nonprofit humanitarian organization Direct Relief. While you can pay as little as $28 to snag everything, the recommended contribution is $33. And don’t forget, you can toggle the split to give over 80 percent of your payment directly to the charity. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

That listing was sold and shipped by Amazon, which makes it even more frustrating. Normally, Amazon adds its listing alongside the third-party offers, but this time, the Booster Bundle is quietly tucked away under a separate product page. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">You have to dig to find the ETBs sold by Amazon ($81.79), but in my opinion, if you're buying Journey Together packs right now, the <a href="https://zdcs.link/QKOLR3?object_uuid=b9cc7bee-1d27-44d0-9704-f24c20c00e6a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">booster bundle</a> is the right move.

I've gathered them all right here so trainers can cherry pick what they need.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I opened 49 packs across all our preview products for my <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-journey-together-preview">IGN Journey Together preview</a>, and pulled 18 rare cards. Compared to sets like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-prismatic-evolutions-review">Prismatic Evolutions</a>, feels downright generous. But it’s not just about quantity. The art and theme choices in Journey Together are incredible. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">You’ve got illustration rares with full-scene designs that feel like storybook pages, Secret Rares with actual competitive value, and Supporters that do more than just draw cards and pass the turn.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some of my favorites include the Spiky Energy Hyper Rare, which adds reactive damage every time your Pokémon gets hit, and Iono’s Bellibolt ex, a Lightning-type engine that fuels itself with unlimited Energy. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I also pulled N’s Reshiram and Articuno in gorgeous Illustration Rare formats — two cards that not only look great but bring real utility. Salamence ex is a heavy hitter with 300-damage potential, and Lillie’s Clefairy ex quietly punishes Dragon decks by giving them a surprise Psychic weakness. It’s not every day a booster pack feels like a mini narrative, but this set pulls it off.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.

<p>US preorders for the Nintendo Switch 2 console went live at Best Buy, Target, and Walmart at midnight Eastern time last night (though the rush of orders caused problems and delays across all three retailers' websites). The console listings came with a wave of other retail listings for games and accessories, and those listings either fill small gaps in our knowledge about Switch 2 game packaging and pricing or confirm facts that were previously implied.</p>
<p>First, $80 Switch 2 games like <em>Mario Kart World&nbsp;</em>will not cost $90 as physical releases. This is worth repeating over and over again because of <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/no-switch-2-games-arent-90-the-internet-is-just-broken-beyond-belief/">how pernicious the rumors about $90 physical releases have been</a>; as recently as this morning, typing "Switch 2 $90" into Google would show you videos, Reddit threads, news posts, and even <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/05/googles-ai-overview-can-give-false-misleading-and-dangerous-answers/">Google's own AI summaries</a> all confidently and incorrectly proclaiming that physical Switch 2 releases will cost $90 when they actually won't.</p>

<p>While physical game releases in the European Union <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nintendo/comments/1jpqsd6/the_physical_version_of_mario_kart_world_will_be/">sometimes cost more than their digital counterparts</a>, there was actually no indication that US releases of physical games would cost $90. The <em>Mario Kart World</em> website listed an $80 MSRP from the start, as did early retail listings that were published before preorders actually began, and this price didn't change when Nintendo <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/nintendo-raises-planned-switch-2-accessory-prices-amid-tariff-uncertainty/">increased accessory pricing</a> in response to import tariffs imposed by the Trump administration.</p>
<p>But now that actual order confirmation emails are going out, we can (even more) confidently say that Switch 2 physical releases cost the same amount as digital releases, just like original Switch games and most physical releases for other consoles. For example, the physical release for the upcoming <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> is $70, also the same as the digital version.</p>
<p>Third-party releases run a wider pricing gamut, from as little as $40 (Square Enix's&nbsp;<em>Bravely Default</em> remaster) to as much as $100 (a special edition release of&nbsp;<em>Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion</em>, also available at $70 for the standard release).</p>

<p>When preorders opened in Japan yesterday, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gematsu.com/post/3lniuq7ix4k25">all physical releases of third-party games</a> had Nintendo's Game-Key card disclaimer printed on them. And it looks like a whole lot of physical third-party Switch 2 game releases in the US will also be Game-Key cards, based on the box art accompanying the listings.</p>
<p>These have been controversial among physical media holdouts because they're not physical game releases in the traditional sense—they don't have any actual game data stored on them. When you insert them into a Switch 2, they allow you to download the game content from Nintendo's online store, but unlike a pure digital release, you'll still need to have the Game-Key card inserted every time you want to play the game.</p>
