            <p>
I think there might be a chance, just ever so slightly, that the development of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cities-skylines-2">Cities Skylines 2</a> has been a bit difficult. The game launched back in October of 2023 and has suffered from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cities-skylines-2-wont-get-paid-dlc-until-its-problem-issues-are-sorted-devs-say">performance issues</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cities-skylines-2-devs-apologise-for-rushed-dlc-offer-refunds-promise-conciliatory-fan-summit">rushed DLC</a>, and a delay to its first expansion Bridges and Ports. This expansion was meant to come soon after the Beach Properties DLC, but that obviously didn't happen, catching a delay to sometime in the second quarter of 2025 specifically to continue improving upon the base game. Except the expansion has been delayed once again.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Over on a <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/free-patch-and-updated-plans.1760205/">forum post</a>, developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/colossalorder">Colossal Order</a> shared an update explaining why the DLC has caught another delay. "After reviewing the content ourselves and sharing it with our early access group, we’ve received consistent feedback: the bridges are super exciting, and the port works well, but there are aspects of the expansion that are not as polished as they could be."
</p>
<p>
This, they say, left them with "a difficult choice: delay the release once again to add more depth, or release it as-is, knowing players may feel it falls short." Colossal also said they think Bridges and Ports is enjoyable as is, but to "bring it to the level you deserve, we need more time." Now, it's expected to launch sometime in the fourth quarter of this year.
</p>
<p>
Ironically, a free update is coming on June 11th that was meant to coincide with the expansion that includes a couple of new bridges, three leisure piers, and three quays. It's something! To be fair to Colossal, delaying it probably is the better decision, I could quite easily see another botched DLC sinking that city builder shaped ship. 
</p>
<p>
I think there was some famous guy who had a plumber for a son that once said something like "a delayed Bridges and Ports expansion is eventually good, but a rushed Bridges and Ports expansion is forever bad." Might be paraphrasing.

At the time, it wasn’t clear what Nintendo meant when it listed some games as having start-up issues and other titles as having in-game compatibility problems. It seemed like Nintendo was saying that a small portion of the console’s massive library wouldn’t work very well, or at all, on the new machine. Now, we have some more clarity, and some good news for people wanting to play<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/doom-eternal-the-kotaku-review-1842471145&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/doom-eternal-the-kotaku-review-1842471145"><em>Doom Eternal</em></a></span> on their Switch 2 next month. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/transfer-guide/compatible-games/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/transfer-guide/compatible-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On May 27, Nintendo posted new Switch 2 backward compatibility lists</a></span> alongside some more in-depth information about what will and won’t work on the new console. The good news: Only one first-party Nintendo game, <em>Nintendo Labo Toy-Con 04: VR Kit, </em>is completely unplayable on Switch 2. The console maker says this comes down to the fact that Switch 2 is too big and can’t be “inserted into the Toy-Con VR Goggles.”</p><p>All other first-party Switch games, including the other Labo titles, will work on Switch 2. However, some titles, like <em>1-2 Switch</em> and <em>Ring Fit Adventure,</em> will only work on Switch 2 if you connect an OG Switch Joy-Con to the new console.  It should also be noted that<em> Fitness Boxing,</em> also published by Nintendo, will need an update to work on Switch 2.</p><p>As for third-party titles, Nintendo has tested more titles and worked with publishers to create new lists. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://media.nintendo.com/switch-2/pdf-compatibility_issues_EN_05272025.pdf?_gl=1*wsyydv*_gcl_au*MTgyMDM4MDcxMy4xNzQ3MzM5Mjcz*_ga*OTY3MzU2MjczLjE3MjI0NDc4Mzg.*_ga_F6ERC4HMNZ*czE3NDgzNzMwNDEkbzQ5JGcxJHQxNzQ4MzczMDc5JGowJGwwJGg4Njg0MTY5ODc.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://media.nintendo.com/switch-2/pdf-compatibility_issues_EN_05272025.pdf?_gl=1*wsyydv*_gcl_au*MTgyMDM4MDcxMy4xNzQ3MzM5Mjcz*_ga*OTY3MzU2MjczLjE3MjI0NDc4Mzg.*_ga_F6ERC4HMNZ*czE3NDgzNzMwNDEkbzQ5JGcxJHQxNzQ4MzczMDc5JGowJGwwJGg4Njg0MTY5ODc." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">118 games are still listed as having</a></span> “start-up issues” on Switch 2. Meanwhile, 50 games  “start up on Nintendo Switch 2 but include some in-game compatibility issues,” and 54 games have in-game problems, but a patch is planned to fix these issues at launch or soon after. In April, the list of games with “start-up issues” was 130. Looking at the lists, over 20 of these games are now set to be updated and should work better on Switch 2, including <em>Doom Eternal </em>and <em>Pizza Tower. </em></p><p>Interestingly, some software like Hulu and Crunchyroll won’t be compatible on Switch 2 at all.

            <p>

A month after EA announced it was ending its partnership with the World Rally Championship, and "pausing development" on all future rally games, publisher Nacon has revealed it'll be the new home of official WRC titles starting 2027, in an agreement initially spanning six years.
</p>
<p>
EA <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/codemasters-has-secured-the-official-wrc-licence">inherited the World Rally Championship license</a> as part of its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-to-release-new-racing-game-every-year-after-codemasters-acquisition">acquisition of UK racing game specialist Codemasters</a> in 2021, and its first WRC title - EA Sports WRC - released two years later in 2023. Last month, however, the publisher <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-says-its-pausing-development-on-future-rally-games-as-wrc-partnership-ends">revealed it had "reached the end of the road working on WRC"</a>, leaving the future of rally gaming somewhat uncertain given it also confirmed it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-confirms-it-is-reducing-roles-at-codemasters-and-redeploying-as-many-as-possible">laying off staff</a> and "pausing development plans on future rally titles".
</p>
<p>
But less than a month later, a fresh World Rally Championship deal has been struck with a new company, Nacon - the publisher behind the likes of RoboCop: Rogue City and last year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown-review-tech-issues-mar-the-return-of-the-original-name-in-open-world-racers">disappointing Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown</a>. It's perhaps not a huge surprise, given Nacon (formerly Bigben Interactive) previously held the WRC license between 2013 and 2022, and released nine titles in that time, culminating in WRC Generations.

<p>
As detailed in <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/05/26/3088220/0/en/PRESS-RELEASE-NACON-ANNOUNCES-AGREEMENT-WITH-WRC-PROMOTER-FOR-THE-PUBLISHING-OF-THE-OFFICIAL-GAMES-OF-THE-FIA-WORLD-RALLY-CHAMPIONSHIP-FROM-2027-TO-2032.html">today's announcement</a>, Nacon's new agreement "covers the development and publishing of the official WRC games and eSports competitions, granting [the company] exclusive rights for PC and consoles for six seasons, from 2027 through 2032."
</p>
<p>
Nacon adds it's now set to begin development of an "all-new WRC game series, aiming to deliver an immersive experience that faithfully reflects the reality of the championship and meets the expectations of both rally enthusiasts and new players". These titles will mark a "complete reboot of the franchise", and will include the likes of official rallies, vehicles, teams, drivers, and sponsors.
</p>
<p>
"After a comprehensive evaluation, we are delighted to have reached an agreement with Nacon," World Rally Championship chief marketing officer Arne Dirks said in a statement accompanying today's new. "[Its] vision for the franchise stands out, and their expertise in delivering great rally games is unquestioned. We look forward to breaking new ground together in this collaboration, to truly turn the WRC games into epic adventures and offer gaming experiences beyond rally as we know it today."
</p>
<p>
The most recent game to release under the WRC license was the Codemasters-developed EA Sports WRC, which launched in 2023. Eurogamer called it a "joyous and rugged display of rally racing, with exquisite handling, lightly flecked by technical issues", in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-sports-wrc-review-a-bracing-and-richly-textured-celebration-of-rally">our four star review</a>.

			<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 officially <a href="https://wccftech.com/33-days-after-launch-clair-obscur-expedition-33-reaches-3-3-million-copies-sold/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reached</a> another important sales milestone today, having surpassed 3.3 million units sold 33 days after launch. The turn-based JRPG created by Sandfall Interactive and published by Kepler Interactive is one of the biggest surprise hits of 2025 so far. It has received unanimous acclaim from critics (getting a <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">9.5 score</a> from us) and fans, too.</p>
<p>Today, GamesIndustry.biz <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-big-clair-obscur-expedition-33-interview-sandfall-and-kepler-on-team-size-the-return-of-aa-games-and-whats-next" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> an interview with Kepler Interactive portfolio director Matthew Handrahan and Sandfall Interactive COO and producer François Meurisse. Among various things, the two credited the game with not dragging on for too long and challenged the view that longer games are better.</p>
<p><em><strong>Matthew</strong> <strong>Handrahan:</strong> One of the things that's great about Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is it really respects the player's time. It gives them plenty to do, and it gives them plenty of satisfaction, but it isn't arbitrarily 500 hours of gameplay. It's impactful because it's scoped correctly. […] It doesn't have any sense of bloat or extraneous things that are put there just to make it larger and larger and larger.</em></p>
<p><em>Brevity should be more of a virtue in gaming. Something can be better by being shorter – something that's being discussed in film at the moment. Every film seems to be two and a half hours long, and I think most people are like, 'Can they all be a bit shorter, please? Because we have other things to do with our lives'.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>François</strong> <strong>Meurisse:</strong> From the beginning, we wanted to do an intense and short experience. The first length estimates of the game were closer to 20 hours for the main quest. I think we ended up closer to 30, even 40 hours if you take a bit of time. As a player, there are so many great games out there that I want to experience, and what's important to me is the level of excitement and fun I get from a game, rather than how long it is.</em></p>
<p><em>The value that players get from games does not align systematically with the length of the game. For example, one of my favourite games of all time is Inside, which lasts about two hours, but it's one of the most polished and intense experiences – and even life changing for some people.</em></p>
<p>Do you agree that games could (and perhaps should) be shorter? Vote in the poll below and let us know your detailed opinion in the comments!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dungeons-dragons-2024-psion-class-introduced-in-new-unearthed-arcana<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wizards of the Coast has released playtest material for <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> 2024. The new Unearthed Arcana is notable since it contains another attempt at creating a new character class: the Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2024 Psion.</p>



<p>In an <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/ua/the-psion" rel="nofollow">official post</a> on D&amp;D Beyond, Wizards of the Coast released the <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> 2024 Psion Unearthed Arcana. The post was accompanied with a video of Todd Kenrick interviewing the design team on the playtest material. Notably, this is the first video not featuring the (now departed) design leads of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/christopher-perkins-retires-from-wizards-of-coast-after-28-years-working-on-dungeons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Chris Perkins</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/jeremy-crawford-game-director-of-dungeons-dragons-is-leaving-wizards-of-ghost" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Jeremy Crawford</a>.</p>

The Psion is effectively a psychic take on the Wizard. They both have no armor training and only a d6 hit die. The unique resource the Psion has the Psionic Energy Die, which can be rolled and added to certain ability checks and attack rolls.</p>

<p>Keeping in line with utility, the four <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> 2024 Psion subclasses are geared towards different forms of play. The Metamorph allows you to psychically alter your body and the body of others. The Psi Warper lets you bend space between objects. The Psykinetic focuses on powerful bursts of energy and defensive shields. The Telepath enables you to delve into the minds of your enemies.</p>

<p>Lastly, the Unearthed Arcana's Wild Talent feats allow other character classes to dip into the new psionic power. They are similar to the Magic Initiate feat. Take this feat and your Fighter or Barbarian has limited access to some of the Psion's abilities like pyrokinesis or disguising your appearance with psychic power.</p>

<p>The Psion is the first attempt by Wizards of the Coast to create a new character class in eight years. Their last attempt was a similar psychic-themed class, the Mystic, in 2015. That class was ultimately abandoned, generally because it was considered too powerful due to versatility through psi points.</p>

<p>The new Psion class by comparison, is more closely inspired by other psychic-themed subclasses like the Psi Knight Fighter or the Soulknife Rogue. As for whether or not this class will be refined and released in a future book, that will depend on community feedback.</p>

The boosts give players who didn't play the previous expansion a chance (for a price) to jump straight into the new content. This time, however, Blizzard is giving players a way to earn a boost for free, but it will require some legwork.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYGvtbrDiiw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/uYGvtbrDiiw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">One free level 85 character boost will be given to players who defeat the Dreadlord Balnazzar, the first boss of the new Scarlet Enclave raid added in April to WoW Classic's more <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-classic-season-of-discovery-looks-to-make-a-20-year-old-game-surprising-again/1100-6519561/" data-ref-id="1100-6519561">experimental Season of Discovery servers</a>, before June 30. Those who have already defeated Balnazzar prior to the announcement of the promotion will be retroactively awarded a boost.</p><p dir="ltr">The boost can be used to instantly bring a character to level 85 on the game's Cataclysm servers, which will soon transform into Mists of Pandaria servers come the arrival of the expansion pre-patch on July 1. Players will need an active WoW subscription to take advantage of the boost, as it's required to play WoW Classic.</p><p dir="ltr">It's a nice way for Blizzard to attempt to convert some Season of Discovery players to jump into Mists of Pandaria Classic, but given the amount of time and effort required to gear up to take on the Scarlet Enclave raid, the number of players who will be able to take advantage of the free boost seems like it will be fairly small. Perhaps an additional reward will be enough for some players to push through, but for those who can't be bothered, Blizzard is also offering a $80 bundle that includes a paid level 85 character boost, game time, and additional cosmetics. Mists of Pandaria Classic itself doesn't have a box price, but does require a subscription or active game time to play.</p><p dir="ltr">WoW Classic: Mists of Pandaria comes roughly a year after Blizzard brought back the Chinese-themed expansion in the modern version of WoW for a limited time as part of its first <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-might-make-leveling-a-new-character-fun-again-with-mists-of-pandaria-remix-event/1100-6522559/" data-ref-id="1100-6522559">WoW Remix event</a>.

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cities-skylines-2">Cities: Skylines 2</a> players are facing yet another delay for the beleaguered city builder's first major DLC expansion, with publisher Paradox Interactive having announced a new release window of "Q4" this year - closing in on two years after it was originally due to launch.
</p>
<p>
Cities: Skylines 2's troubles are well documented; the city builder sequel got off a disastrous start in 2023, forcing developer Colossal Order to reprioritise its development efforts amid <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cities-skylines-2-fans-complain-of-performance-woes-after-developer-admits-it-missed-target">significant criticism of the game's performance</a>. Initially, the studio had planned to release its first DLC - the Beach Properties Asset Pack - shortly after launch, but it was delayed into the following year, while all other announced DLC (the Urban Promenades and Modern Architecture Creator Packs, and the Bridges &amp; Ports expansion) shifted from Q1 2024 to Q2.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, the Beach Properties' eventual arrival did little to improve the community's goodwill; it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cities-skylines-2-publisher-refunds-dlc-and-admits-we-let-you-down">slammed by players for its high price and lacklustre content</a>, leading Colossal Order to announced an 'indefinite' delay for all future paid DLC. Bridges &amp; Ports was moved into 2025 as a result, but a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cities-skylines-2-dlc-gets-further-delays-as-developer-priorities-assets-editor-for-mods">further delay was announced last September</a>, while Colossal Order focused its efforts on completing what it called the "crucial" assets editor.
</p>
<p>
In the months since, Colossal Order has continued to make improvements to the base game and <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/cities-skylines-ii/modding/cities-skylines-ii-region-packs">launched some free "region" DLC</a>. But that "crucial" assets editor remains unreleased, and now the studio has opted to delay Bridges &amp; Ports yet again, moving it out of Q2 this year into Q4. "We've spent the last five months working hard on the Bridges &amp; Ports DLC, and towards our upcoming expected release," the studio <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/free-patch-and-updated-plans.1760205/">wrote in a message shared on the Paradox forum</a>. "After reviewing the content ourselves and sharing it with our early access group, we've received consistent feedback: the bridges are super exciting, and the port works well, but there are aspects of the expansion that are not as polished as they could be."
</p>
<p>
"That left us with a difficult choice," it continued, "delay the release once again to add more depth, or release it as-is, knowing players may feel it falls short. We believe the current content is enjoyable, but we're not blind to what's missing, and to bring it to the level you deserve, we need more time... We're assessing feedback from our early access group and mapping out what we want to improve when the expansion launches - which we are now expecting in Q4 of this year. This is still a beautiful expansion, and we're excited about what it will add to your city. We just want to ensure it adds enough to meet your deservedly high expectations."
</p>
<p>
Cities: Skylines 2 players won't, however, be left waiting for new content until the end of this year. Colossal Order has elected to release the free update it was originally intending to ship alongside Bridges &amp; Ports on 11th June, offering "a bit of content that gives a slight sneak peek of what is to come in the expansion". It'll include two new bridges, three leisure piers, and three quays, with <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/free-patch-and-updated-plans.1760205/">more details available in today's forum post</a>.
</p>
<p>
As for Cities: Skylines 2's much-delayed console port, there's still no hint as to when that might arrive. It was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cities-skylines-2-console-release-gets-delayed">originally due to launch alongside the PC version</a> back in October 2023, but has remained in limbo since then, with Colossal Order admitting it has struggled to overcome "hardware limitations" impacting performance on Xbox Series X/S and PS5. Back in March, it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cities-skylines-2s-troubled-console-release-sounds-like-its-still-some-way-off">warned</a>, "We will not have a release before summer", but there's been no update since then.

			<p>Developer Redemption Road Games has <a href="https://x.com/Kingmakers_Game/status/1927416166772801659">announced</a> that Kingmakers, its third-person shooting strategy game that sends you back in time to the medieval era with an assault rifle, will arrive on PC in early access on October 8, 2025.</p>
<p>When Kingmakers was first revealed in <a href="https://x.com/Kingmakers_Game/status/1759943842466582568">February 2024</a>, it had a small viral moment with its admittedly hilarious announcement trailer, where you watch a pickup truck smash through legions of armored knights that can't do anything but ragdoll against modern horsepower. Cut to watching a soldier firing shotgun shells into enemies chasing after him with swords, and Kingmakers immediately appeared to be a fun, chaotic time.</p>
<p><iframe title="Kingmakers - Early Access Release Date Trailer | tinyBuild Connect 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/52u8LIuzA-Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>That moment helped Kingmakers reach more than a <a href="https://x.com/Kingmakers_Game/status/1868768562388910113">million wishlists on Steam</a>, with excitement continuing to build since. It'll be interesting to see how players react when they're able to play it themselves at launch this coming October.</p>
<p>It'll be launching as an early access game, of course, so we should expect that it won't be perfect. But the core concept of being able to run through armies of knights with a gun or a tank looks like it'll be a roaring good time, and hopefully, Kingmakers is able to make that key draw to the gameplay feel as good as it looks.</p>

It’s a great way to get quick healing without having to chug some potions in the middle of a hunt.</p><p>As a restorative mantle, Mending will work for whatever setup you have. Heavy-hitting weapons that apply armor benefit nicely, since you’ll soon replenish any lost health. That same reasoning applies to any weapon that you can guard with.

It applies an armor effect that negates damage reactions, reduces how much damage you take, and boosts resistances against roars, tremors, and wind pressure. Taking damage will decrease the amount of time you have left.</p><p><strong>Rocksteady is the mantle to choose if you want to feel like a tank</strong>. Equipping it means you can just keep attacking no matter what gets thrown your way.

Depending on what weapon you’re using, you might receive unique follow-up attacks as well.</p><p>Try to get those last moment dodges in as much as possible to keep refreshing the attack boost. Weapons that have special dodge mechanics, such as the Bow or Dual Blades, are a perfect fit. You’ll likely trigger the Evasion Mantle’s effects more often with these.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/parrying-bad<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Long before parrying became the topic of the day thanks to <em>Clair Obscur</em>, I was a firm believer in a truth many of you are just now discovering: parrying is bad, and video games should stop having it.</p><p>And look: I get that I’m known on this site for <a href="https://aftermath.site/i-hate-double-jump" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unpopular opinions</a> about <a href="https://aftermath.site/indiana-jones-great-circle-camera" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">beloved mechanics</a>, but with anti-parry sentiment at an all-time high, you might be feeling more open to my point of view. Many haters of <em>Clair Obscur</em>’s parry system are coming from the pro-parry camp, taking umbrage with the timing or animations compared to other games. But rather than filling your head with <em>more</em> parry thoughts, rather than ranking games with some unnecessary rubric, rather than playing armchair developer to Sandfall and getting into arguments on Steam forums, you could join a righteous cause (mine) and free yourself from this problem altogether.</p><p>Parrying in video games sucks. It features in <a href="https://gamerant.com/soulslike-games-best-parry-mechanics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">many games</a> with hand-to-hand combat, giving you the opportunity to deflect an enemy’s attack and, unlike a dodge that just keeps you from taking damage, knock an enemy off-balance or do some damage of your own. I can see why the promise of the parry is appealing, but think about the reality: It is precise and finicky, relying on an audio cue or narrow timing window to perform successfully. If you’re in a hectic combat situation, you already have enough to pay attention to.</p><p>I won’t hide the fact that my stance is informed by the fact that I am terrible at parrying. But I would argue this is not my fault. In real life, I briefly took a fencing class in college, so I understand the <em>concept</em> of what it is to parry, and it is an action I have pulled off with variable success in the physical world. But, whatever the boosters might say, I don’t think this action translates well to video games. In third-person games like <em>Clair Obscur</em>, it can be hard to understand when precisely you should parry; these kinds of games have to give you wind-ups and clues to help you know when to enter into their simulation of objects moving through space. Parrying is inherently a first-person activity; if you are seeing it in third-person it means you’re not part of the parrying situation, and as such have no need to know when someone should parry. Mind your own business!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In first-person games, like my <a href="https://aftermath.site/stealth-game-no-detection" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">beloved</a> <em>Dishonored</em> and its betrayal via parry inclusion, the sort of calculations you’d do in the physical world are functionally impossible when ported to the virtual. In real life, you inherently sort of <em>know </em>how to work with the length of a sword, how fast it’s moving, how long your own sword is, and how far away you are. The oft-overlooked miracle that is moving your body through space is just <em>what bodies do in space</em>; when you remove the bodies and the space, the whole concept basically falls apart. Video games have to turn parrying into an animation that must be entered into correctly; they have to introduce all those clues you’re required to parse, turning the whole thing into some kind of cruel rhythm game, because there is no way to recreate actual parrying. You lose the spontaneity, the freedom, the responsiveness imparted to you as a bonus gift for having a human body. And you then use that human body to fumble through some cruel shadow of “parrying” with your fingers, cheapening not just the idea of the parry, but the full potential of your human form.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>When discussing my stance with my Aftermath colleagues, the conversation quickly devolved into points about iframes and hit boxes; i.e., shit for sickos. Do you want to be a sicko? Do you want to have to not just learn about but <em>care about</em> ticky-tacky coder stuff when you are just a person trying to play a video game? Any mechanic that requires a fine appreciation of code is not a mechanic for the people; it is an exercise in exclusion and elitism. Are those your values? Is that the side of history you want to stand on?</p><p>You don’t need any of this shit. Even if you aren’t like me, a man who doesn’t care for the finer points of video game combat and just wants to look at cool monsters while mashing buttons, surely you must recognize that video game combat is sufficient without the addition of the hateful parry. Consider the <a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/compare/MAT.6.28-33#:~:text=Matthew%206%3A28%2D33%20New,arrayed%20like%20one%20of%20these." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lilies of the field</a> and be satisfied with what you have. Acknowledge the abundance already before you. Simplify your life. Reject the parry.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/parrying-good"><h3>Parrying Is The Best Thing In Video Games</h3></a><p>Everybody’s gangsta until somebody parries your bullshit</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/doom-bathroom-renovation-something-awful-for-sale"><h3>Please Know That The House With The Doom Bathroom Is For Sale</h3></a><p>Calling it a 'uniquely remodeled home' seems like an understatement</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/hockey-stickhandling-video-game-dangleverse"><h3>This Video Game Is Also a Hockey Training Tool</h3></a><p>Dangleverse, which I've been using to practice hockey off the rink, is in beta right now</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/parrying-good<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Gaming, much like life, offers a range of responses to sticky situations, especially in action games. Whether it’s an boss slowly walking toward you or a fighting game rival ready to signal the choir to “<a href="https://youtu.be/GqM_-p_wK_U" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">somebody’s getting fucked</a>,” players typically face three choices: freeze — staying locked in place eating shit until their foe drops a combo; flight — playing footsies, creating distance, and reassessing a smarter angle of attack; or fight, meeting the challenge head-on, pressing buttons, and praying you get a couple good hits in edgewise. But there’s a hidden fourth response — fawning, the art of appeasing stress to sidestep conflict, where you play the role of the immovable object to an unstoppable force. You don’t flinch, you don’t dodge, you don’t flee. You stand firm, nullifying attacks with pure precision, proving that you can see through your adversaries' nonsense and that countering it is light work for you. In my twisted mind, this response is the quintessential instinct behind parrying, the ultimate flex in video games.</p><p>Parrying is one, if not the, most satisfying mechanics in video games. Unlike its more reserved cousin, the block, parrying is the golden child of combat-oriented games—the one who earns a spot at the adults’ table at family get-togethers, gets their cheek lovingly pinched by grandma as she dotes on her favorite little pookie bear whenever it recounts moments where it took a high-risk gamble that paid off thanks to its uncanny ability to turn defence into dominance.&nbsp;</p><p>Parrying is my favorite thing in gaming. Although it may not be the safest option in battle, it yields the greatest reward by willingly putting yourself in harm's way and coming out the other end unscathed. The only thing dashed against the rocks in the wake of a well-timed parry is your opponent’s pride.&nbsp;</p><p>As the parry-er, the mechanic is one of the most empowering elements you can earn in gaming. It’s an art that proves your ability to get the proverbial camel through the eye of a needle, shutting down an enemy’s offense before it starts. In the most Pavlovian sense, games like <a href="https://youtu.be/8NqX3Kj6qec" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Elden Ring</em></a> reinforce a successful parry with a sharp, satisfying clang. This soundbite, like the high-pitch ding of a headshot in a shooter, is like the game patting you on the head for being the smartest (and most disrespectful) player in the room. Congrats, you just effortlessly batted that attack away like it’s nothing. Your dick is huge.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="RULES OF NATURE" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WM33Hr94SKw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Games hold up their end of the deal by rewarding this mastery of fisticuffs. A well-timed parry can leave an opponent wide open for an all-out assault, like <a href="https://youtu.be/QkWa-hxv3A4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Tekken 8</em>’s universal low parry</a>. It can also signal fun times ahead, serving as a flashy preamble to bombastic games like <a href="https://youtu.be/q2MHp6_SSMs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance</em></a>, a great equalizer in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/review/563522/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review-ps5-pc-xbox#comments" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></a>, a <a href="https://youtu.be/R2Lboca6KUQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">damage multiplier in<em> Sea of Stars</em></a>, or even the only path to victory in games like <a href="https://youtu.be/R2Lboca6KUQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Battle Fantasia</em></a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Parries are so quintessential to an action game’s depth that they’ve become a staple across the genre. While not all parries are made the same, many have narrow timing windows, with high scrutiny for what counts as a parry. Some games introduce the elusive perfect parry, which completely dismantles an enemy with a devastating stun effect by countering at the very last second. Games like <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em> act as an ideal introduction to the killer mechanic, weaving parrying into its rhythmic gameplay to help players intuitively grasp the timing. This instinct naturally develops over time. Parrying is almost like using The Force, but instead of blindly firing into the Death Star, you’re tapping into the rhythm of an enemy’s attacks, finding the perfect beat to cut in, and executing a devastating counter, turning defence into a dominant dance of health-bar draining syncopation.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="ICONIC Esports Moments: EVO Moment 37 - &quot;The Daigo Parry&quot; (Street Fighter)" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/klaWV-szmnY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Witnessing a parry is just as hype as executing one. Case in point: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzS96auqau0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Evo moment #37</a>—the legendary fighting game showdown where Daigo pulled off an almost impossible comeback against Justin Wong in <em>Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike</em>. Instead of holding back and blocking, which would have led to inevitable chip damage and defeat, Daigo <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzS96auqau0&amp;pp=ygUNZXZvIG1vbWVudCAzNw%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">parried every hit from Chun-Li’s super</a>, Houyoku-Sen, with surgical precision. Fifteen strikes on the ground and mid-air nullified in the FGC’s most remarkable display of a player hard reading their opponent in the clutch, creating the perfect opening to punish and steal victory from the jaws of defeat.</p><p>One of my absolute favorite parries in games is <a href="https://youtu.be/NnkDgq_E1qQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kiryu Kazuma’s Tiger Drop</a> in the <em>Yakuza</em>/<em>Like a Dragon</em> series. Tiger Drop is so absurdly powerful that the subsequent titles use it as the carrot on the stick as one of the final items in its skill tree, with flavor text that casually reminds players that it negates all damage. A fact made even funnier when you remember Kiryu patented it in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mc_hQr-2sk&amp;pp=ygUOa2lyeXUgdnMgdGlnZXI%3D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fight against two tigers</a>.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Dante VS Vergil DMD SSS motivation" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/p79oSkNMhIY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>And then there’s Dante’s <a href="https://devilmaycry.fandom.com/wiki/Royalguard_Style#Devil_May_Cry_3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">royalguard</a>, a technique that teeters between being a block and a parry (but we’ll count it). The <em>Devil May Cry</em> wahoo pizza man builds up negated damage with a calm, kung fu stance before detonating it straight back onto his enemies. In the manga, Dante himself admits to hating the move, saying its busted style robs him of the joy of testing out his flashy rolodex of weapons and fighting styles in his arsenal. But in battle, it’s the ultimate “nuh uh,” capable of <a href="https://youtu.be/ShFPq_eDS7U" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ending a boss fight before it even begins</a>.</p><p>Parrying is the ultimate risk-reward gamble, a mechanic that adds an irresistible layer of challenge to action games. It’s the moment where the player stops being the hunted, flips the script, standing ten toes down against the storm and seizing control. With perfect timing, the player orchestrates the flow of combat, shifting momentum in their favor like a benevolent hand tipping the scales of battle. Parrying is challenging to master, but then again, nothing as euphorically gratifying ever comes easy.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/doom-bathroom-renovation-something-awful-for-sale"><h3>Please Know That The House With The Doom Bathroom Is For Sale</h3></a><p>Calling it a 'uniquely remodeled home' seems like an understatement</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/hockey-stickhandling-video-game-dangleverse"><h3>This Video Game Is Also a Hockey Training Tool</h3></a><p>Dangleverse, which I've been using to practice hockey off the rink, is in beta right now</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>It's a big day for Ubisoft's The Division 2, as the game has joined the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-xbox-game-pass-games/2900-4001/" data-ref-id="2900-4001">Xbox Game Pass</a> library alongside the debut of its new expansion, Battle for Brooklyn.</p><p>The Division 2 is available via Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass, and Game Pass Standard. People who subscribe to Game Pass Ultimate get a perk in the form of the free EMS outfit, which itself includes five EMS-themed items.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S65EIG8H3Z4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/S65EIG8H3Z4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The Division 2 comes to Game Pass just as the game's seventh year of live service begins with the Year 7 Crossroads update. This season is all about nostalgia, with new modifiers and gear that are callbacks to the original The Division, Ubisoft said. Year 7 also includes a range of quality-of-life improvements, including better onboarding for new players.</p><p>The Division 2 is also included in the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-plus-essential-free-games-for-june-2025/1100-6531805/" data-ref-id="1100-6531805">PlayStation Plus Extra catalog</a>, while Ubisoft+ subscribers can get it through their membership as well.</p><p>Additionally, the Battle for Brooklyn expansion is out now, taking players to Brooklyn as part of a "brand-new linear campaign." The campaign can be completed solo or in co-op, and the story involves learning how the Cleaners have cooked up their dangerous Purple Flame weapon.</p><p>Everyone who buys the $15 Battle for Brooklyn expansion gets an automatic level-40 boost, along with the DLC-exclusive Catalyst Exotic mask that provides special in-game bonuses. Battle for Brooklyn is also included in The Division 2's Gold and Ultimate editions.</p><p>As for what's next for this franchise, Ubisoft confirmed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/tom-clancys-the-division-3/" data-ref-id="5000-604111">Tom Clancy's The Division 3</a> was in the works in 2023 but canceled a spin-off called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-cancels-the-division-heartland-but-the-division-3-is-still-coming/1100-6523480/" data-ref-id="1100-6523480">Tom Clancy's The Division Heartland</a> that same year.</p>

However, both games will feature new story elements.</p><p>Outside of the HD-2D graphical facelift, the battle system has been refined, and the games include quality-of-life updates. Square Enix also teases new content for both titles and plans to provide specific details later.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V5_-SwBuzZE"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V5_-SwBuzZE" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>If you want all three Dragon Quest remakes in one package, Square is launching a digital-only bundle called Dragon Quest HD-2D Erdrick Trilogy Collection on the same day for $99.99.

    <div id="main-content">
  

        <p>I've convinced myself the whole thing is an elaborate prank</p>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mindseye">MindsEye</a> isn't a real game, right? I mean, I'm sure it is a real game, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-gta-producers-next-game-mindseye-has-a-release-date-though-im-not-sure-if-youll-find-it-everywhere">it's meant to be coming out June 10th</a>, that's only two weeks away now, and GTA 3 to 5 producer Leslie Benzies is helming it. It just doesn't feel like a real game. Take for instance the fact that the game's latest trailer, which was released today, is its first proper gameplay trailer. There's been a few teasers over the past few weeks, but absolutely zero extended looks at the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a>. That's weird for a game due out in two weeks!
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Plus there's just the game's whole vibe. The UI isn't awful, it just feels like the kind of thing you'd see in maybe the game's first trailer, but then you watch a video titled "All Of The Differences Between MindsEye's First And Second Trailer" and see how it's improved. The gameplay itself looks like something you'd see in a TV show that made a fake video game to have a character play for an episode, there's a CPR rhythm-mini-game for heaven's sake, what's going on here? Are we back in 2009?

<p>
Everything about the narration of the dialogue is generic, wishy-washy nonsense too. They just feel like words to fill a space. Sure, there's some explanations for what you can do in the game, I just don't feel like I've been given a single reason to care. The whole thing just feels like a way to spend a lot of money.
</p>
<p>
There's also user generated content that can be built off of MindsEye, the trailer boldly saying that the game is the "home of infinite entertainment", a very bold claim considering it still needs people to make stuff in it first.
</p>
<p>
MindsEye just has the vibe of someone asking a 12 year old what their perfect game would be despite not knowing a lick of what makes anything good or interesting in the first place.
</p>
<p>
The trailer did also provide a roadmap for future updates, which include a couple of "special" collaborations, more missions, multiplayer, that kind of thing. Nothing that makes me think MindsEye will become a real game, but hey, maybe this thing's the next Fortnite. Probably not.

Normally $700, the PS5 Pro is currently $50 off during <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://blog.playstation.com/2025/05/27/celebrate-days-of-play-2025-starting-on-may-28/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/05/27/celebrate-days-of-play-2025-starting-on-may-28/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sony’s Days of Play sale</a></span> while the comparable Xbox Series X Galaxy Edition, which launched at $600, is currently $730 to buy new. Both have the same 2TB SSD storage but the PS5 Pro can run updated games at 60fps with 4K upscaling while the Xbox Series X can’t. </p><p>The discrepancy comes after Microsoft decided to raise the prices of its gaming hardware <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/microsoft-xbox-series-x-s-price-increase-may-2025-1851778615?_gl=1*1g1s7v5*_ga*MTg4NjY0MzM1NS4xNzM5NDU1MDcz*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDgzNjQ4OTYkbzIzMSRnMSR0MTc0ODM2NzYzMyRqMjEkbDAkaDAkZHFpSlZIVkNHbGlNOXdDQkllVlhpeUZFYWpXaTVLeEFqLWc.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-xbox-series-x-s-price-increase-may-2025-1851778615?_gl=1*1g1s7v5*_ga*MTg4NjY0MzM1NS4xNzM5NDU1MDcz*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDgzNjQ4OTYkbzIzMSRnMSR0MTc0ODM2NzYzMyRqMjEkbDAkaDAkZHFpSlZIVkNHbGlNOXdDQkllVlhpeUZFYWpXaTVLeEFqLWc.">across the board in the U.S. due to recent tariffs</a></span>, including the previously very affordable Xbox Series S which is now $380, just $20 less than an all-digital PS5 bundle that comes with <em>Astro Bot</em>. Industry analysts have been waiting for Sony to follow suit even as the tariff situation continues to shift every other week. </p><p>But so far the company has held its ground. It told investors earlier this month that it had a few months of runway thanks to PS5 inventory that had already been shipped into the U.S. It looks like it’s going to at least get through the Days of Play sale that ends on June 11 before making any larger changes to its PS5 pricing policy. Those might not happen until and unless a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/ZhugeEX/status/1927421344087523353&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/ZhugeEX/status/1927421344087523353" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">90-day pause on certain tariffs expires in August</a></span>. </p><p>While competition from Xbox continues to dwindle as Microsoft first-party exclusives go multiplatform, the Switch 2 could steal some of the PS5's thunder this year. With no <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> coming in 2025 anymore, more focus will be on <em>Mario Kart World</em> and whatever else Nintendo has lined up for the fall, especially if Trump’s trade war with China continues and the price of a PS5 or PS5 Pro goes up by $100 or more.</p><p>In the meantime, anyone thinking of picking up a PS5 Pro probably won’t find a better opportunity, especially as big games continue to push the existing console hardware past its limits the deeper we go into this generation. A PS6 is already rumored to be in the works for as early as late 2027. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
