            <p>
Let's get something real clear here right off the bat: I couldn't possibly tell you if Team Cherry are planning to make any more <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a> games. That isn't to say there isn't more Hollow Knight on the way, as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Silksong</a> will be getting… <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/silksong-will-get-dlc-for-years-some-of-the-plans-for-that-stuff-are-kind-of-ambitious-as-well">something</a>, at some point, in the future. However! Studio heads William Pellen and Ari Gibson have at least floated a hypothetical idea around how the world of Hollow Knight might get bigger.
</p>
<p>
Remember when ACMI (the Australian Centre for the Moving Image) put on a little exhibition <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/silksong-may-release-before-september-given-that-itll-be-publicly-playable-by-then">where there was a playable demo for Silksong</a> earlier this year? Well, as shared by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/platformer/team-cherry-hopes-if-there-were-ever-new-hollow-knight-games-after-silksong-they-could-just-exist-alongside-one-another-so-the-order-you-play-them-doesnt-matter/">GamesRadar</a>, that same exhibition came with a <a href="https://shop.acmi.net.au/collections/frontpage/products/acmi-guide-hollow-knight-silk-song-softcover">little guidebook</a> filled with concept art, maps, as well as an interview with Team Cherry.
</p>
<p>
Pellen and Gibson were asked by co-curator of the exhibition Jini Maxwell how they might define success for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-walkthrough">Silksong</a>, both noting that "releasing it with no major bugs" would be a good start. "The 'goal' is already kind of done, I think," Pellen explained. "We had an idea for a game that we wanted to make, and we wanted to make the best version of that game, a version of the game that satisfies the theme, the best version we can make."
</p>
<p>
Gibson added on to that saying that said goal was to make Silksong a "game that can stand alongside Hollow Knight," one that "kind of branches off in a nice way; I think they really complement each other." Here's where the interesting bit comes in from Gibson: "I don't think you'd feel like you lost anything, traveling back to the original game after playing Silksong. And if there were ever others, we would hope that they all follow that same pattern - that the series is all games that just exist alongside one another."
</p><p>
Ahah! There it is! The quote that will convince the masses that more Hollow Knight games are in the works. Of course, again, there's no way of knowing this. Still, this comment reassures me. I'm glad that Silksong is mostly a self-contained experience separate from the original Hollow Knight, and if this world has to be explored again, it should once more do its own thing. Wouldn't mind it if Sherma showed up elsewhere, though.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>One of my favorite things to do on my Xbox Series S is occasionally trawl the digital storefront archives for <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-12-best-games-on-xbox-360-5878837">my favorite Xbox 360 games</a>. Often they aren’t available or are ridiculously expensive compared to their bargain bin physical versions. But very occasionally they’re available through Microsoft’s backwards compatibility program and only cost less than $10. Today is one of those days.</p> <p>Microsoft’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/tag/black-friday-2025">Black Friday 2025 sale</a> this year happens to coincide with <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-360-favorite-memories-mw2-bastion-halo-2000646286">the 20th anniversary of the Xbox 360</a>. As a result, you can pick up some of the retro console’s best games for just the cost of a cup of coffee or Big Mac:</p> <ul> <li><em><strong>Deus Ex: Human Revolution</strong></em> – $2.25 (normally $15)</li> <li><strong><em>Blue Dragon</em></strong> – $5 (normally $20)</li> <li><strong><em>Lost Odyssey</em></strong> – $8.25 (normally $25)</li> <li><strong><em>Alan Wake</em></strong> – $6 (normally $20)</li> <li><strong><em>Fable II</em></strong> – $6.60 (normally $20)</li> <li><strong><em>Gears of War 2</em></strong> – $8.80 (normally $12)</li> <li><strong><em>Gears of War 3</em></strong> – $8.80 (normally $12)</li> <li><strong><em>Grand Theft Auto IV</em></strong> – $7 (normally $20)</li> <li><strong><em>Fallout 3</em></strong> – $2.50 (normally $10)</li> <li><em><strong>Street Fighter IV</strong></em> – $4 (normally $20)</li> </ul> <p>If you played <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> this year and loved it, do yourself a favor and pick up <em>Lost Odyssey</em>. The cult-classic turn-based RPG was developed by <em>Final Fantasy</em> veterans including Hironobu Sakaguchi and Nobuo Uematsu and has an emotional bombshell for a narrative arc.</p>

 <p>“For me, Lost Odyssey was the last grand turn-based RPG adventure with realistic graphics,” <em>Clair Obscur</em> director Guillaume Broche <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-the-last-game-that-made-me-cry-clair-obscur-expedition-33-director-on-the-iconic-xbox-360-rpg-lost-odyssey-and-its-unexpected-legacy">told <em>Eurogamer</em></a> earlier this year. “Its themes were very heavy and very well handled. It’s the last game that made me cry.”</p>

 <p><em>Deus Ex: Human Revolution</em>, meanwhile, is a great sci-fi immersive sim with incredible art direction that never got ported. <em>Street Fighter IV</em> might be the best entry in the series ever. And if you don’t want to wait for that rumored <em>Fallout 3</em> remaster to appear, you can revisit the Washington D.C. wasteland today for steal.</p> <p>And if you recent played through the original Gears story by way of <a href="https://kotaku.com/a-review-of-gears-of-war-reloaded-and-the-state-of-the-franchise-2000620106">this summer’s<em> Reloaded Edition</em></a>, you can find a local co-op buddy and complete the journey this Thanksgiving break. Rip to some real ones.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">One of my favorite family holiday traditions is gathering around a good jigsaw puzzle. It's one of the few activities that draws in people of all ages to work on the same activity. Every year we break out a new puzzle and just slowly work on it throughout the day together. It's relaxing, fun, and you end up with a feeling of accomplishment when you finally place that last piece. It's my turn to bring a puzzle to the family gathering this year, and luckily, Amazon is discounting a ton of puzzles from Ravensburger right now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ravensburger is one of the best jigsaw puzzle brands available and one of the few I always look to buy when there's a sale. The collection of Christmas-themed puzzles I've highlighted below are especially good for the holidays, but you can check out the full sale for more options.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Ravensburger Jigsaw Puzzle Sale at Amazon Today</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Almost all of the puzzles in this sale are considered Amazon Lightning deals. That means there is a limit to how much stock is available at the discount listed for each item. So the more popular a puzzle is, the more likely it is to have the discount fully claimed before time runs out on the sale. After covering these sales a few times, however, I've found that the "limit" on the discount is only ever reached on the most popular puzzles. And since these discounts are all part of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-black-friday-sale-2025-early-deals">Amazon's official Black Friday sale</a>, it's likely that the deals will last beyond the limit if people are buying enough of them.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Tips for Buying Jigsaw Puzzles</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Buying any size puzzle is a commitment. It's one that you can easily just put on a shelf and forget about, but actually starting and finishing it takes time. Unless you are a world champion puzzler, it's going to take you more than one day to put one together unless it's less than 100 pieces or you have many people helping you out.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Make sure you have enough space</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The first thing you should consider before buying a puzzle is whether or not you have a place to put it together. Given that many popular puzzles are 500-1,000 pieces, it can be hard to keep track of all of them at any given time. You'll need ample space to both sort through and organize pieces and be able to leave or store it and come back to it later. If you don't already have a table that is ideal for puzzling, there are quite a few <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-puzzle-tables">puzzle boards and tables</a> you can buy to remedy that. There are also jigsaw puzzle mats to roll up your puzzle and put it away without undoing all of your progress. All of these make for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-puzzle-gifts">great puzzle gifts</a> and I'd highly recommend them to any puzzle fanatic.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Make sure you actually like the puzzle's image</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps the more obvious tip for buying any sort of puzzle is to make sure you actually like the image you're putting together before you make a purchase. A lot of puzzles feature a ton of tiny intricate details to keep you interested as you put it together, but some feature large swaths of single colors that could get tedious to put together. If you're already investing a bunch of your time into a puzzle, pick something that you'll be happy to see when finished, even for just a moment in time.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Invest in some puzzle glue</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">While most people put together puzzles just for the enjoyment of it all, it can also be fun to display the finished product once you're done. This is especially true if the puzzle is depicting a work of art, rather than just a photograph. It is, after all, a cardboard poster that you've put together yourself. If you plan on displaying your puzzle after you finish, you'll want to get yourself some puzzle glue to ensure the finished product actually stays together when you frame it.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-is-slashing-prices-on-ravensburger-christmas-jigsaw-puzzles-for-black-friday-2025]]></content:encoded>

		<p>I certainly wasn’t expecting to have been raining in Las Vegas when I belatedly got up and turned on the replay of the Formula 1 qualifying.

			<p>Valve might have <a href="https://wccftech.com/valve-unveils-steam-frame-steam-machine-steam-controller-launch-early-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> the new Steam Frame for early 2026, but if you want a new Virtual Reality headset this Holiday season, the PlayStation VR2 is still a great choice. It's already discounted ahead of Black Friday 2025, too: <a href="https://amzn.to/48wab8Y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Amazon offers it at $299, 25% off the regular price of $399</a>.</p>



<p>This is the bundle that also includes <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-call-of-the-mountain-coming-to-psvr2-with-new-main-character/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Horizon Call of the Mountain</a>, the flagship launch title developed specifically for PlayStation VR2 by Guerrilla Games and Firesprite. The game is a spin-off of the popular open world action/adventure series Horizon, though it differs from the main installments in that the protagonist is Ryas, a former Shadow Carja rebel, in perspective, which is first-person only to accommodate the needs of a Virtual Reality game, and in being a lot more linear.</p>



<p>As mentioned in the headline, the PlayStation VR2 is no longer limited to the PlayStation 5 console and can also be used with a PC, provided you're willing to purchase the PC adapter, <a href="https://fave.co/3KjBPg7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">priced at $59.99 from the official PlayStation Direct store</a>. A DisplayPort 1.4 cable is also required; however, if you are an existing VR user, you likely already have one. You will then download the PlayStation VR2 app <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2580190/PlayStationVR2_App/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Steam</a>, unlocking compatibility with thousands of PC games for the headset.</p>



<p>If you instead choose to stick with PS5 VR-compatible games, here's a list of some of the best games:</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/4pqX12M" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil Village - $23.94</a></li>



<li><a href="https://amzn.to/3Mhe7Sg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil 4 - $17.93</a></li>



<li><a href="https://amzn.to/3LU5yNc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gran Turismo 7 - $29.99</a></li>



<li><a href="https://amzn.to/4rnSQqn" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">No Man's Sky - $22.48</a></li>



<li><a href="https://amzn.to/48iMUWT" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Behemoth - $27.78</a></li>



<li><a href="https://amzn.to/4a8Ie8o" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Crossfire: Sierra Squad - $29.90</a></li>



<li><a href="https://amzn.to/4pwcjn4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MADiSON VR - $28.99</a></li>



<li><a href="https://amzn.to/48ADh6b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vertigo 2 - $44.95</a></li>



<li><a href="https://amzn.to/4pxzzkB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Star Wars: Tales from the Galaxy's Edge Enhanced Edition - $50.87</a></li>



<li><a href="https://amzn.to/488jbje" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Five Nights at Freddy's Help Wanted 2 - $18.78</a></li>
</ul>



<p>If you're still on the fence about buying the PlayStation VR2 or not, check out <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/playstation-vr2-headset-one-cord-to-rule-them-all/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our review of the product</a> by Kai Tatsumoto:</p>



<p><em>Sony’s PlayStation VR2 headset had a lot to prove to justify a cost higher than that of the base PlayStation 5 console needed to operate it. The hands-on test confirms that this is how next-gen should look and play in virtual reality with an experience unlike anything else in the HMD space. Every aspect of the first PlayStation VR has been improved (aside from Cinematic Mode largely remaining as is) with no expense spared for comfort and design. This is the sort of revolution in virtual reality that can showcase not just the experiences that are fun to play but also those that can take advantage of the next-generation console’s power.</em></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Stellar Blade 2 Going Multiplatform]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/stellar-blade-2-going-multiplatform/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/stellar-blade-2-going-multiplatform.1361851/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>According to a new recruitment post, Shift Up is planning to make Stellar Blade 2 multiplatform. Furthermore, it may hint at Stellar Blade coming to Xbox and Nintendo.</p>







<p>If you haven’t played Stellar Blade, you’ve definitely heard of it. Releasing in 2024, the Korean-made title by Shift Up made headlines for its insane graphics and action gameplay. Despite controversy regarding its protagonist, Eve, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stellar-blade-not-censored/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stirred in all stages</a> of development, the game was a huge success, critically and fan-wise. It was nominated for several awards, including some Game Awards, especially for its soundtrack. Due to huge positivity, the company was quick to say more is on the way, even going so far as to say <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stellar-blade-sequel-in-development-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">before 2027</a>. Now, a new development has been revealed, and it’s one that bodes well for the sequel’s future.</p>



<h2 id="h-stellar-blade-2-coming-to-various-platforms-says-shift-up">Stellar Blade 2 Coming to ‘Various Platforms’, Says Shift Up</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>The news comes from <a href="https://shiftup.co.kr/news/news.php?ptype=view&amp;idx=318&amp;page=1&amp;code=news" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a recruitment post</a> on Shift Up’s official Korean website. In it, the studio states that it is looking to build out its team for Stellar Blade 2. The title, said to be currently in development, plans to bring the epic action fans loved from the original for next-gen. On that note, Shift Up is aiming to have Stellar Blade 2 launch be multiplatform, expanding to other consoles and PC. </p>



<p>Interestingly enough, the original Stellar Blade was a PlayStation 5 exclusive, only seeing a PC release earlier this year. As of now, no port of the title has been announced for Xbox Series X|S or Nintendo Switch 2. One has been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stellar-blade-could-come-to-xbox-and-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumored for a bit</a>, though nothing concrete has been said yet. With Stellar Blade 2 now multiplatform, perhaps this means we could see Stellar Blade break exclusivity and go to Xbox and Nintendo soon.</p>







<p>What do you think of Stellar Blade 2 going multiplatform? When do you think Stellar Blade will go to other consoles? Think it’ll release on Nintendo Switch 2?

While it’s a shame that the decades-old console’s marketplace is gone, it doesn’t take away from the <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-360-tribute-retrospective-halo-3-red-ring-e3-1851609358">Xbox 360’s legacy as a popular, innovative, and weird machine</a> that paved the way for the current era of gaming.</p> <p>For better and for worse, when Microsoft’s Xbox 360 launched in 2005 it changed video games forever.

		<p>Bethesda has revealed the details for the Fallout 4 November patch, which adds a brand new Varmint Rifle and fixes for various issues causing crashes. However, the November patch will not bring the mod storage expansion for consoles as planned. But, console players need to be aware that when this update is released in December it will reset the mod load order, so action needs to be taken.</p>

<p>If you are playing Fallout 4 on consoles and using mods, these are the steps to take to make sure your load order is not impacted.</p>
<ol>

<li><em>At the bottom of the Load Order Menu screen, select “Load Order Archive.”</em></li>
<li><em>Select “Save Load Order to Bethesda.net.”</em></li>
<li><em>Select “Yes” to confirm.</em></li>
<li><em>You should receive a message confirming the current load order has been saved to Bethesda.net</em></li>
<li><em>Exit the menu and allow the game to reload your data files. The game will confirm your load order has changed, indicating the process is complete!</em></li>
</ol>
<p>And here are the Fallout 4 November patch notes:</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet Reportedly Releasing in 2026]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-2026-release-report/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-reportedly-releasing-in-2026.1361821/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new report claims that Naughty Dog’s Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet is releasing sometime in 2026. Even more so, information may be revealed at this year’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2025-all-award-nominees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Game Awards</a> in December.</p>







<p>When it comes to storytelling, no studio does it better than Naughty Dog. From the adventurous Uncharted series to the excellent The Last of Us titles, it has yet to really miss. At The Game Awards 2024, the studio unveiled its next title, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a>. Sporting an all-star cast led by Uncharted’s Tati Gabrielle, the title looks to go outside the studio’s grounded work and go out of this world, literally. While not much is known outside of a CGI trailer, it seems we won’t have to wait long to know more, if the report from a YouTuber is correct.</p>



<h2 id="h-intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-is-content-complete-states-insider">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet is ‘Content Complete’, States Insider</h2>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Colin Moriarty talks Intergalatic, Naughty Dog, PS6, Trophies, GTA 6, Sacred Symbols &amp; Last Stand" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oKkiw9KpgKA?start=4187&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>In a podcast with Dan Allen Gaming, former gaming journalist Colin Moriarty spoke on a matter of topics. One game in particular that came into focus was Naughty Dog’s Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet. The clip in question comes around the <a href="https://youtu.be/oKkiw9KpgKA?si=YsxaBuDLpL-oqeWx&amp;t=4187" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">1:09:47</a> mark. Speaking on the game, Colin states,</p>



<p>“<strong>I believe we’ll see it at The Game Awards, I think next year it’ll be good to go</strong>,” states Moriarty. “<strong>Maybe they [Naughty Dog] will delay it, but based on the way they’re hiring and also things I’m hearing about people interacting with the game, and they’re also hiring for localization now, they’re getting into the end, and it’s a sign that everything is kinda locked down and content complete. I won’t be surprised if it was out this time next year.”</strong></p>



<p>Sony or Naughty Dog have not confirmed when Intergalactic will release, so take the news with a grain of salt. That said, Naughty Dog has been working on The Heretic Prophet since 2020, so it won’t be surprising to see more before the year’s end. It would be coming out in a packed year, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delay-november-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvels-wolverine-gta6-fall-2026-insomniac/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel’s Wolverine</a> releasing, but the studio can hold it’s own. Funnily enough, the original Last of Us came out when Grand Theft Auto 5 was released, so it would be a neat coincidence for the two to battle it out for Game of the Year.</p>







<p>What do you think of the Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet 2026 release report? Think it’ll come out next year? 2027?

            <p>
I think miHoYo might just have a bit too much money. Somehow, they have yet another game on the way called Varsapura, yet another anime-looking, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open-world</a> action game, this time by way of psychic mishappenings. As many have pointed out, there's a vague Control-like quality to it, at least in its newly shown off, lengthy gameplay demo.
</p>
<p>
The atmosphere and vibes are admittedly quite strong, miHoYo has always been fairly good at that. Within the gameplay demo, a fancy, government-esque building twists and reshapes itself into something surreal and abstract, enemies that look like office workers turned into shadowy monsters.
</p>

<p>
Narratively, this is all explained thusly: the titular Varsapura is a strange space that can be entered, with the protagonist's appearance shifting "to match each viewer’s preferences. The origin of this parapsychological effect remains unknown." There's an organisation called SEAL, or Shadow Emergency Alliance, with the player character showing up at their main office (the aforementioned government building), in a particularly Control-like intro.
</p><p>
Then there's the combat, which honestly, once you've played one miHoYo game you've played them all. It's all flashily animated combos that let you switch between different characters with what appears to be not much substance. Don't get me wrong, fun to look at, there's just a similar aura to those videos of singing bits of fruit and vegetables that are rotting babies' brains. Also I wish they'd let the psychic cop women wear pants, it doesn't seem like the kind of work they're doing really calls for a miniskirt.
</p>
<p>
Overall there's still not much known about Varsapura, outside of the fact it's releasing on PC. You'll just have to keep an eye out on a release date in the meantime.

            <p>Remedy has delayed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fbc-firebreak">FBC: Firebreak</a>'s Rogue Protocol update to January 2026, reporting it "still needs a bit more time".</p>
<p>While the long-requested feature, cross-platform voice chat, has rolled out as planned this week, Remedy's larger Rogue Protocol update has slipped to an unspecified date in January, taking the new mode Endless Shift with it.</p>

<p>The team <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2272540/view/621061415005848720?l=english">said</a> the extra time "will help us make sure everything feels right: polished, balanced, and worthy of your time", and to ease the pain of the delay, it has shared some more details about the new wave-based survival mode.</p><p>"Each Endless Shift drops you and your team into a sealed arena where waves of enemies grow tougher with every round," the update explains. "You always start with only the bare essentials to fight with. After each wave, you’ll collect Corruption, a strange residue left behind by defeated enemies. This energy can be spent between rounds to unlock powerful upgrades, weapons, and enhancements, letting you shape a completely new build every run."</p>
<p>When it does arrive, Rogue Protocol will be Firebreak's second big content drop since September's Breakpoint update, wherein Remedy admitted it had "taken a lot of feedback to heart" and had worked over the summer to bring "significant improvements and new systems, as well as content, into the game".</p>
<p>Last month we learned that FBC: Firebreak, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fbc-firebreaks-weak-sales-persist-despite-improved-player-and-sales-metrics-says-remedy-ceo">has still not reached the studio's internal targets</a> "despite improved player and sales metrics after the update". Remedy issued a profit warning to investors as it lowered projected operating profits "due to weak sales of FBC: Firebreak", claiming the missed target had "a substantial impact" on the studio's finances and revising its forecast downwards. It now expects operating profit to be "negative and below the previous year".</p>
<p>Ten days after that financial report,<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/big-change-at-alan-wake-studio-remedy-as-ceo-steps-down-following-failure-of-control-spin-off-fbc-firebreak"> Remedy Entertainment CEO Tero Virtala stepped down from his position at the Alan Wake studio with immediate effect</a>.</p>

              <p>You have an Xbox 360 controller waiting for you in your living room and a console hungry to entertain you. It’s an older console, sure. But it still has a ton of great games.</p> <p><em>This list was published on April 21, 2016. We’re re-posting it today in honor of the Xbox 360’s 20th anniversary.</em></p> <p>As of April 2016, <a href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-ends-xbox-360-production-1772042864">Microsoft has ceased production of the Xbox 360 console</a>. It had a great run—red rings and Kinect 1.0 notwithstanding—and it got a ton of great games. These dozen games have occupied our Bests list for a long while, and at this point there’ll probably never be another update. (Never say never, though!)</p>

 <p>Here are our recommendations for the 12 best games on Xbox 360. Enjoy.</p> <h2 data-textannotation-id="9201ab5b178b5c0b91005e103f75f309"><em>Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000646524" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000646524"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000646524">Ubisoft</figcaption></figure> <p>After years of changes both minor and major, the <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> series had begun to feel in a rut. (For example: We’d had <em>Assassin’s Creed II</em> on this list since its inception.) Finally this year, with the pirate-themed <em>Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag</em>, the series has taken a major and unequivocal step forward. It doesn’t lose <em>all</em> of the series’ bad habits—hello follow missions—but it improves many longstanding problems with better stealth, easier-to-navigate cities, and sidequests that actually feel like they help make your character more powerful. Best of all, it adds naval combat and a vast Caribbean overworld that make the game feel like, in the words of Luke Plunkett, “<em>Wind Waker</em> for grown-ups.”</p>

 <p><strong>A Good Match For: </strong>Pirate fans, history buffs, anyone who’s ever wanted to pull up alongside a British frigate, grab a rope and swing from one deck to the other before fighting your way up the deck to take on the captain. So basically, anyone who’s ever wanted to be a pirate.</p>

 <p><strong>Not a Good Match For: </strong>Those who demand precision controls. The on-foot controls in <em>Black Flag</em> are probably the best of the series, but they’re still a far cry from where a third-person stealth/platformer should be. It’s time for a crouch button, Ubisoft.</p>

 <p><a href="http://bit.ly/17WsnAu" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Read</strong></a><strong> our review.</strong></p> <h2><em>Borderlands 2</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000646525" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000646525"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000646525">Gearbox Entertainment</figcaption></figure> <p>With an even bigger, wackier, lootier <em>Borderlands</em>, Gearbox has proved that their hybrid RPG/shooter franchise isn’t just a one-hit wonder. Three years after the first release, Gearbox put out a <em>Borderlands 2</em> that doesn’t just have thousands more guns. It’s more complex. It’s even got <em>heart</em>. And yet <em>Borderlands 2</em> still manages to strike a balance between being more soulful while retaining the slapstick, make-no-excuses-for-itself humor for which the series is known. The characters you meet are often borderline (if not full-blown) psychotic, but in the most endearing of ways. Enemies are just as raunchy as they are diverse. It’s colorful, it’s tough, it’s meaty, and it’s a joy to play with up to 3 friends in co-op. It’s also got TONS of extra, downloadable content to keep you busy once you finish the main game.</p>

 <p><strong>A Good Match For:</strong> Gamers who want a fun co-op experience to play through with friends. There are plenty of quests, plenty of guns, and plenty of laughs to be had.</p> <p><strong>Not A Good Match For</strong>: People who want to burn through a game easily. <em>Borderlands 2</em> can be pretty tough, especially without backup. And if you aren’t willing to spend some time churning out sidequests, you just might catch yourself at the tail-end of the game without the chops or stats to finish without getting burnt out.</p>

 <p><a href="http://bit.ly/18xf2Cr" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Read</strong></a><strong> our review.</strong></p> <h2><em>Burnout: Paradise</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000646526" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000646526"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000646526">Criterion Games</figcaption></figure> <p>Automotive destruction’s never looked as sexy as it does in Criterion’s hi-speed racing game <em>Burnout: Paradise</em>. You’re tasked with driving against traffic, scraping against civilian cars and shoving competitors into signature crashes called Takedowns. But, <em>Paradise</em> also deserves praise for a seamless integration of multiplayer where dropping into a showdown can be quick as tapping a button.</p> <p><strong>A Good Match For:</strong> Street racing fans. If you’ve ever pulled up to a stoplight and imagined what it’d be like to burn rubber on a wide-open stretch of asphalt—and survive any ensuing mishaps—this is your game.</p> <p><strong>Not a Good Match For:</strong> To tune the specs of their rides. It may be <em>Paradise</em> but these aren’t real-world cars. You can’t do much more than swap out paint jobs, so those wanting to make changes to brakes, shock or engines will need to get their grease-monkey fix elsewhere.</p>

 <p><b><a href="https://kotaku.com/burnout-paradise-didnt-need-a-remaster-but-its-nice-1823840738">Read</a> our review.</b></p> <h2><em>Grand Theft Auto V</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000646527" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000646527"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000646527">Rockstar Games</figcaption></figure> <p><em>Grand Theft Auto V</em> is an impressive crime game. Not perfect, but impressive. The game gives players one of the richest, most beautiful open worlds we’ve ever been able to play in. In this case, the landscape is a fictionalized version of Los Angeles and the California desert. Go anywhere in this vast game. Grab a car, plane, truck, bicycle, boat or tank. Head off in any direction. You’re bound to see extraordinary sights and stumble into some sort of good and probably violent time. The game looks amazing even on the old Xbox 360 hardware. It also plays better than any <em>GTA</em> before it. <em>GTA V</em>’s innovative, swappable three-protagonist system creates the feel of a true ensemble adventure, though crazy man Trevor steals the show.</p> <p><strong>A Good Match For:</strong> Players who like to go into a game to break the rules. GTA is still at its best when it’s a playground for virtual misbehavior.</p>

 <p><strong>Not a Good Match For:</strong> Anyone who can’t stomach the game’s mockery of, well, pretty much everyone.</p> <p><a href="http://bit.ly/1aLDtf9" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Read</strong></a><strong> our review.</strong></p> <h2><em>Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000646528" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000646528"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000646528">Starbreeze Studios</figcaption></figure> <p><em>Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons</em> came out of nowhere this year, surprising everyone with its strange control scheme, smart (if simple) puzzles and devastating ending. Can game mechanics be emotionally affecting? Turns out yup, they can be. It’s a nice, short game with almost no fat—and despite the fact that the two main characters don’t communicate in a language anyone could understand, they still manage to communicate a great deal of context and backstory. You’ll never think of your thumbs and your controller triggers the same way.</p> <p><strong>A Good Match For: </strong>People looking for something different, those who like weird controls schemes, fans of old-school fairy tales.</p>

 <p><strong>Not a Good Match For: </strong>Those hoping for a long game—it’s a few hours long and offers no real replayability—people who like their characters to speak actual languages.</p> <p><a href="http://bit.ly/18xsbsi" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Read</strong></a><strong> our thoughts</strong><strong>.</strong></p> <h2><em>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000646529" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000646529"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000646529">Bethesda</figcaption></figure> <p>Bethesda Softworks’ hit role-playing game does nothing so much as deliver a giant, Tolkien-styled possibility space to its players. The high-altitude climes of Tamriel feel alive with wonder and threat. The ability to customize your warrior outcast with a singular mix of mystical skills and melee mastery feels as broad as <em>Skyrim</em>’s horizon.</p> <p><strong>A Good Match For:</strong> Dungeon &amp; Dragon players. Adventuring in <em>Skyrim</em> feels like spinning your own epic yarn, as songs of your feats spread digitally from town to town in a game world that reacts to your actions. You can spend weeks meandering in its fascinating sidequests, leaving the main story.</p> <p><strong>Not a Good Match For:</strong> Those who play with urgency. The drive to wander and discover overpowers the drive to complete in <em>Skyrim</em>. If you’re the kind of player who wants those two vectors to meet in a meaningful way, you’ll find <em>The Elder Scrolls V</em> a bit frustrating.</p>

Epic Games’ scifi shooter threequel represents hardcore shooter nirvana: a tightly-polished campaign that plays great solo or coop and some of the best multiplayer found anywhere. Moreover, the game’s been robustly supported with both campaign and multiplayer DLC designed to deepen an already hearty release, particularly with the addition of many of the best maps from <em>Gears of War 2</em></p> <p><strong>A Good Match For:</strong> Dedicated online shooter fanatics who play every day. The more you play, the more <em>Gears 3</em> rewards you.</p>

 <p><strong>Not a Good Match For:</strong> Those who want deep character development or intriguing story structure. Gears games have always been meat-and-potatoes in terms of plot</p> <p><a href="http://bit.ly/194lQIl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Read</strong></a><strong> our review.</strong></p> <h2><em>Halo: Reach</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000646531" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000646531"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000646531">Bungie</figcaption></figure> <p>Bungie created the best goodbye possible with a “final” <em>Halo</em> title that both looks forward and backward in the blockbuster FPS franchise’s history. Pairing up a health system similar to that of the first <em>Halo</em> game with all-new abilities like jetpacks and holographic decoys makes the decade-old series feel simultaneously familiar and fresh.</p>

 <p><strong>A Good Match For:</strong> Sci-fi fans. To play a <em>Halo</em> game is to be introduced to an expansive fictional universe. <em>Reach</em> places you inside one of the <em>Halo</em>-verse’s pivotal battles and imbues its lead characters and environments with more personality than in previous games.</p> <p><strong>Not a Good Match For:</strong> Anyone who wants Master Chief. The Spartan you control in <em>Halo: Reach</em> isn’t as invulnerable or powerful as the Xbox mascot and the feel of certain weapons gets tweaked when compared to previous games.</p> <p><a href="http://bit.ly/194m1Dv" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Read</strong></a><strong> our review.</strong></p> <h2><em>Mass Effect 2</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000646533" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000646533"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000646533">BioWare</figcaption></figure>  <p><em>Mass Effect 2</em> was the one that made you believe. Its predecessor drew players in with expansive world-building and a tense storyline, but it was also a clunky, rough-hewn slab of a game. BioWare’s 2010 follow-up polished the combat, introduced characters who’d become fan favorites and streamlined the overall experience to a fine focus. The first game made you want to experience all the sci-fi action and drama, but the second game made it a lot easier to do so. Pack in a huge number of varied and often terrific downloadable content packs and you’ve got one beefy, galaxy-spanning chunk of video game to play.</p> <p><strong>A Good Match For:</strong> Fans of the <em>Star Wars</em> Expanded Universe. Like George Lucas’ signature creation, <em>Mass Effect</em>’s fictional cosmos has multitudes of tales to tell. The extremely good post-campaign DLC chapters expose players to side stories centered on both new and familiar characters, just like Timothy Zahn’s Thrawn Trilogy and the other <em>Star Wars</em> extensions. <em>Overlord</em>, <em>Lair of the Shadow Broker</em> and the other add-ons really made it feel like millions of little lives were at stake in Shepard’s fight against the Reapers.</p>

 <p><strong>Not a Good Match For:</strong> People who need closure. <em>Mass Effect 2</em> tells plenty of small stories, but the main narrative arc is still essentially a set-up for the 2012 follow-up.</p> <p><a href="http://www.bit.ly/1bSg7rz" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Read</strong></a><strong> our review.</strong></p> <h2><em>Red Dead Redemption</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000646534" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000646534"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000646534">Rockstar Games</figcaption></figure> <p><em>Red Dead Redemption</em>, the most assured work by the makers of the <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> games finds its success by shedding the trappings of the modern-day world and giving players a vast virtual Southwest to roam in search of revenge. When your lonely ambles suddenly get shattered by an ambush or the plea to stop an unjust hanging, it’s a bittersweet adrenaline rush unlike anything else in modern video games. Silence, then gunfire, then more fleeting silence again.</p> <p><strong>A Good Match For:</strong> Admirers of killer endings. The denouement for the turn-of-the-century saga stands as an emotionally powerful finish that can stand amongst the cowboy cinema that inspired it.</p> <p><strong>Not a Good Match For:</strong> Fans of brevity. Redemption’s plot takes a long amount of playtime to resolve and you’ll often feel like you’re doing busy work in the nooks and crannies of its spaghetti Western game world.</p>

Valve’s follow-up to a classic improves on the humor, characterization and puzzle-solving of its predecessor to deliver a tight, focused experience full of poignancy and humor.</p> <p><strong>A Good Match for:</strong> Comedy lovers. The voicework alone—performed in stellar fashion by Stephen Merchant and Ellen McLain—will make you laugh out loud but the brain-teasing puzzles and embedded gags keep the chuckles coming even when everything else in the game goes quiet.</p> <p><strong>Not a Good Match For:</strong> Mediocrity fans. People who argue with <em>Portal 2</em>‘s greatness are like folks complaining that diamonds came from dirt.

The re-imagined <em>XCOM</em> delivers graphical upgrades and interface refinements like you might expect but what really makes it sing is the added attachment that you feel to the battles and the soldiers who fight them. If you’re considering picking up the game now, get <em>Enemy Within</em> instead, as it contains the original game as well as the terrific 2013 expansion. It’s sold as a standalone for consoles, so be sure to buy the new version.</p>

 <p><strong>A Good Match For:</strong> Efficiency lovers. This version of human-vs-aliens warfare streamlines gameplay when compared to its predecessor. And the importance of cover in combat and clever deployment of perks makes you consider every decision intensely.</p> <p><strong>Not a Good Match For:</strong> Those who want skirmishes. The combat in 2012 <em>XCOM</em> can stretch on way longer than is necessary. Because the battles require active engagement, you can feel chained to a session.</p> <p><a href="http://bit.ly/ISUJq0" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Read</strong></a><strong> our review and our review of </strong><a href="http://bit.ly/ISUN9d" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>the latest expansion.</strong></a></p> <p><em><strong>How has this list changed?

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hytale">Hytale</a> has had a bit of a rough go of it, given how it's been in the works for a decade, still isn't finished, and was unceremoniously cancelled. Not to worry though, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/in-a-rare-bit-of-good-news-hytale-lives-on-with-its-original-devs-buying-the-rights-off-of-riot">as it's back</a>! And it's in the hands of its developer's original co-founders. With the announcement that Hytale will live on, it was also noted that the game's pricing would be revealed soon, and soon it was as it's already been confirmed.
</p>
<p>
As shared on Hytale's own Sitter account, the game will be a simple $20, with the option to pay a bit more if you fancy helping out the devs that little bit extra. There's two higher tiers, the first being Supporter at $35, and the Cursebreaker Founders Pack at $70, both of which will include cosmetics like "capes, hats, and more." Now, admittedly you might be thinking that $20 sounds quite low, something Hypixel co-founder Simon Collins-Laflamme agrees with.
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">If you wish to support the team and Hytale’s development, we will be offering a Supporter and Founders pack that offers cosmetics like capes, hats, and more. <a href="https://t.co/K5q909tixp">pic.twitter.com/K5q909tixp</a></p>— Hytale (@Hytale) <a href="https://twitter.com/Hytale/status/1991884608770855233?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 21, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>
"I’m pricing Hytale as aggressively low as possible," Collins-Laflamme <a href="https://x.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/1991889170189496781">wrote on his own Witter account</a>. "I’m taking on a considerable personal risk after repurchasing the game and getting it ready for early access for a growing team of now 50 talented individuals. I said I was all in, and I am delivering on that promise."
</p>
<p>
He went on to note that because the game is currently unfinished and is running on a build that's four years old, pricing it any higher wouldn't have felt right. He even went as far as saying that he doesn't "think the game is good yet." In a <a href="https://x.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/1992193367417971115">follow-up post</a> he doubled down on this saying he "genuinely" means it.
</p><p>
He explained that he's "confident it's going to be 'ok' for release," but a mixture of bug issues, a lack of progression mechanics configured, and generally missing features means it won't be as good as it could be. But he did end on a positive note, at least: "I will do my best to empower my team to make a great game, however long it takes."
</p>
<p>
If you fancy taking a look at how the game is shaping up pretty much right this very second, you can check out some gameplay <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytales-original-co-founder-wastes-no-time-showing-off-the-game-as-it-is-after-buying-the-rights-from-riot">right here</a>.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/wd-20tb-external-hard-drive-goes-for-mere-pennies-now-cheaper-than-a-sandisk-4tb-ssd-2000646515</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/wd-20tb-external-hard-drive-goes-for-mere-pennies-now-cheaper-than-a-sandisk-4tb-ssd.1361764/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>External hard drives solve the eternal problem of running out of storage space on computers that never seem to have enough room for everything you accumulate. Photos, videos, games, backups, and work files consume gigabytes faster than anyone anticipates, and cloud storage subscriptions add up to serious money over time. The WD <em>Elements</em>&nbsp;drive offers a massive 20TB capacity that can handle years of storage needs in a single reliable device. After<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5832/"> launching at $599 before dropping down to the standard price of $349, Amazon just crushed it to $269 for Black Friday</a>. This <strong>record-low pricing is the deepest discount</strong> this popular drive has ever seen.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5832/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>20TB Capacity Eliminates Storage Anxiety Forever</h2>
<p>Twenty terabytes are ample to the extent that <strong>storage management can be forgotten</strong>. You store around 400,000 high-resolution photos, 5,000 hours of HD video, or even complete media libraries that would fill up in decades. The capacity manages full system backups for several computers and still leaves room for ongoing file build-up. This much space turns your relation to digital files from decisions about what to delete to simply hoarding without consequences.</p>
<p>The USB 3.0 interface provides transfer speeds good enough to move big files in fairly reasonable times, considering the mechanical drive inside. You connect to any computer with standard USB ports without requiring special cables, adapters, or driver installations. The plug-and-play functionality means the drive works immediately on Windows and Mac systems out of the box.</p>



<p>The desktop form factor prioritizes capacity and reliability over portability. The drive would sit on your desk, connected to power and USB, serving as a permanent storage expansion rather than as a travel companion. This allows for larger platters and better cooling than portable drives crammed into smaller enclosures.</p>
<p>WD has developed its brand over decades of manufacturing hard drives, and most people associate the company with reliable data storage. The Elements line represents their value-oriented offering, where there is core functionality provided without any premium features that inflate pricing. You get proven WD reliability without paying for software bundles, hardware encryption, or other extras that many users don’t need. The <strong>4.6-star rating across over 332,000 reviews</strong> confirms this reliability extends to real-world usage over years of service.</p>



<p>At this price, the cost per gigabyte beats cloud storage subscriptions within months of ownership. The <strong>cloud plan for 2TB is around $10-15 a month</strong>&nbsp;while equivalent cloud storage would cost hundreds of dollars annually. This drive quickly pays for itself compared to cloud alternatives, and you own the hardware with no recurring fees. Local storage also provides faster access speeds than the internet-dependent cloud services.</p>
<p>Setup involves the<strong> connection of two cables and waiting for your operating system to recognize the new drive</strong>. Windows and Mac both automatically mount the drive without the installation of software or configuration. Drag files to the new drive immediately, and you’re using capacity within minutes of opening the box. The simplicity makes this accessible to anyone regardless of technical expertise.</p>
<p>At $269, you’ll get 20TB of reliable WD storage for more than 50% off its original $599 launch price and 23% off its current list price. The per-terabyte price reaches levels where massive local storage becomes truly affordable. This Black Friday pricing makes the decision to get rid of storage limitations an easy investment that pays dividends for years through avoided cloud subscriptions and permanent file access.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BORRBce5TGw">Moore’s Law is Dead</a> (via <a href="https://thegamepost.com/leaker-xbox-series-prices-increase-ram-shortages-microsoft-soon/">TGP</a>), Microsoft has warned its partners that ongoing RAM shortages and soaring costs could lead to higher prices for its customers, with AI data centres snapping up memory in huge numbers and leaving little left for consumer electronics.</p><p>"[Microsoft] didn't plan ahead at all, apparently," Moore's Law is Dead said. "If you still want an Xbox for some reason at their current pricing, those prices could go up soon, or supply could just entirely dry up because multiple sources of mine have apparently been warned by sales reps at Microsoft that this is going to affect the Xbox Series consoles very, very soon. Sooner rather than later."</p>
<p>Interestingly, Moore's Law Is Dead doesn't believe this is necessarily an industry-wide issue.</p>
<p>“From what I've heard, Sony planned ahead, bought up gobs of RAM near the bottom of the pricing, and thus they should be fine for months," Moore's Law added.</p>
<p>"They have plenty of GDDR6, at least that’s what I'm told. Prices could go up eventually; I could see that happening next year… but there is a reason Sony is cutting PlayStation 5 pricing for Black Friday.</p>
<p>"They aren't just doing this as some extreme move or because sales are bad. They can afford to do it; apparently, they are not worried about the RAM shortage, at least in the short- to mid-term."</p>
<p>This, of course, is further compounded by the recent increase in<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-increases-price-of-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-despite-record-subscription-profits-last-year"> the price of Microsoft's Xbox Game Pass subscriptions</a> and tiers shake-up. Game Pass Ultimate will now cost $29.99 / £22.99 per month. It includes access to over 75 day-one releases a year, as well as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> Crew and Ubisoft+ Classics. Cloud gaming is also set to receive a boost in quality, and there's a new Rewards programme, too.</p>

              <p>A 57-inch Dual 4K display with 240Hz refresh rate, 1ms response time, and Quantum Mini-LED backlighting. If those specs made your pulse quicken, you already understand what the <strong>Samsung Odyssey Neo G9</strong> represents. This is the monitor that replaces a dual-screen setup with one massive curved panel delivering 7,680 x 2,160 resolution. DisplayPort 2.1 and AMD Freesync Premium Pro complete a spec sheet that reads like a wish list. And the good news, Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5831/">has slashed the price to $1,499 for Black Friday, down from $2,299</a>. That’s a 35% discount and the lowest this flagship gaming monitor has ever been.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5831/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Best 57-Inch Monitor</h2>
<p>The <strong>57-inch panel gives you two 32-inch 4K monitors fused into one</strong> seamless ultrawide display. No bezels interrupting your view, no alignment issues between screens, and no messing with software to manage multiple inputs. The <strong>dual UHD resolution</strong> means you get the exact same pixel density and clarity across the whole surface. Spreadsheets, video editing timelines, and game worlds all enjoy that ridiculous amount of horizontal space.</p>



<p>The <strong>1000R curvature</strong> wraps the screen around your field of view in a way flat monitors simply cannot replicate. This aggressive curve matches the natural shape of human vision to reduce eye strain during marathon sessions. The edges of the screen stay equidistant from your eyes, which keeps everything in focus without constant head position adjustments. Immersion in racing games and flight simulators goes to a new level.</p>
<p>The backlighting is powered by <strong>Quantum Mini-LED technology that features 2,392 individual local dimming zones</strong>. These zones independently govern their brightness to provide deep blacks alongside brilliant highlights, with no blooming or halo effects. The Quantum Matrix processing drives these zones at 12-bit precision, yielding more than 4,000 levels of brightness gradation. Dark scenes in horror games are rendered with inky shadows, while bright elements pop without washing out the surrounding areas. Traditional edge-lit monitors seem flat and lifeless compared to this.</p>
<p>The DisplayHDR 1000 certification<strong> guarantees 1,000 nits of peak brightness</strong> and a 1,000,000:1 contrast ratio. These numbers equate to visible detail in both the darkest corners and brightest explosions of any game that you play. Enemies that were hiding in the shadows now become visible without cranking gamma settings that wash out everything else. HDR content finally looks the way it was intended by creators when you have hardware capable of showing the full dynamic range. Movies and streaming content also benefit massively from this level of contrast performance.</p>



<p>The<strong> 240Hz refresh rate, combined with a 1ms response time</strong>, means competitive-grade responsiveness on this massive panel. Fast-paced shooters and racing games show fluid motion with no ghosting or blur trails behind moving objects. DisplayPort 2.1 provides the bandwidth necessary to push Dual 4K resolution at these refresh rates with support for variable refresh rates.</p>
<p>Connectivity options cover every scenario you might encounter: <strong>DisplayPort 2.1</strong> handles the heavy lifting for maximum performance gaming, while <strong>HDMI 2.1 ports</strong> connect current-gen consoles at their highest output capabilities. The integrated USB hub reduces cable clutter by letting you plug peripherals directly into the monitor. If you need to monitor different sources, picture-by-picture mode can display two separate inputs simultaneously.</p>
<p>The Samsung Odyssey Neo G9 is an incredible value at $1,499 for such cutting-edge display tech. This Black Friday price knocks off a whopping $800 compared to retail and brings a flagship monitor into reach for serious gamers.</p>

It's been 10 years since Fatshark's Warhammer Tide years kicked off, starting with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-end-times-vermintide">Warhammer: End times - Vermintide</a>, and to celebrate that anniversary the developer has been offering up various in-game events and updates in both Vermintide 2 and Darktide. Earlier this week <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-vermintide-2">Vermintide 2</a> received a free new level, a point we'll come back to, but the big thing you should know first is that you can pick up the co-op dark fantasy game for free on Steam right now, and keep it forever.
</p>
<p>
Literally all you need to do is head over to the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/552500/Warhammer_Vermintide_2/">Steam page</a>, and add it to your library. Easy as pie, cheap as chips! Or cheaper than chips, I suppose. As a word of warning, don't dilly dally on picking it up if you are interested in checking out the game. The offer is only running until November 24th, in a couple of days time, according to this <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/552500/view/600795607306601669?l=english">Steam blog post</a>, so best get on it right away.

<p>
Anyway, that new level! It's called Return to the Reik, and it's already available to pick up, again completely for free. This one should be familiar to those that have played the first Vermintide, as it originally featured in that game. In the Vermintide 2, River Reik now apparently has "expanded, boat‑focused gameplay." As you can see in the above trailer, that does involve some boat on boat shenanigans, complete with the game's usual combat. Looks pretty neat!
</p>
<p>
There were a few fixes, tweaks, and features added in with this new level too, which you can read about in this other <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/552500/view/546748595947175982">Steam blog post</a>. Happy vermintiding!

            <link>https://kotaku.com/philips-hue-is-offloading-its-10ft-smart-lightstrips-at-40-off-now-cheaper-than-no-name-alternatives-2000646503</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/philips-hue-is-offloading-its-10ft-smart-lightstrips-at-40-off-now-cheaper-than-no-name-alternatives.1361725/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Smart lighting turns any room from ordinary to extraordinary with a tap of your phone. Philips Hue lightstrips tuck behind TVs, under cabinets, along staircases or around ceiling edges to create ambient glow that sets the perfect mood. The trick is buying several to really tie a space together and Black Friday finally makes that affordable: Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5828/">has dropped the 10-foot <em>Solo</em> light strip to $46, down from $76 (40% off)</a>. This is the lowest price ever recorded and you won’t find Philips Hue discounts anywhere else during this sale period.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5828/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Premium Quality</h2>
<p>Cheap LED strips are flooding the market but Philips Hue earns its reputation through <strong>superior color accuracy and build quality</strong>. That sets this strip apart from basic RGB alternatives that inevitably have issues delivering clean white light. Most budget strips attempt to achieve white tones by blending red, green, and blue LEDs together which is what causes that weird purple or green tint you’ve probably seen. Philips includes dedicated warm and cool white LEDs solely to deliver pure, natural whites alongside the full color spectrum.</p>



<p>Brightness counts when you’re lighting up larger spaces, and the <strong>Philips light strip delivers 1700 lumens of output</strong>. That’s enough to serve as functional accent lighting rather than just decorative glow. You can use it as under-cabinet task lighting in the kitchen or soft ambient illumination behind a media center. The premium silicone sleeve with a milky white finish diffuses the light for even dispersion, eliminating those harsh LED hotspots that make cheaper strips look cheap.</p>
<p>Installation takes minutes with the adhesive backing built into the strip: Just peel off the protective layer, stick it where you want it, and plug it in. You can cut this strip to size for your particular space, but you won’t be able to reconnect the pieces once they’re cut. Do your planning in advance to save a headache. The 10-foot length works perfectly for TV backlighting, bed frames, desk setups, or shorter ceiling runs around a room.</p>
<p>The Philips Hue app unlocks your lightstrip’s full potential once you’re all set up. You can <strong>choose from 16 million colors and adjust brightness levels</strong> to your liking with real precision. Once you start creating scenes that match your activities, it gets addictive: Be it movie nights with a warm orange glow, morning routines with energizing daylight tones or late-night gaming with deep purple ambiance-all in one strip.</p>



<p>Voice control integration through A<strong>lexa, Google Assistant, and Apple Homekit works seamlessly</strong>. Telling your speaker to dim the lights or change colors feels genuinely futuristic the first few times you do it. Hands-free control proves especially useful when you’re cooking, lounging on the couch, or turning in for bed. The lightstrip responds quickly to commands with no noticeable lag. You can also group it with other smart devices for coordinated whole-home automation.</p>
<p>Adding a Philips Hue Bridge extends the functionality of your lightstrip even further: The Bridge enables various forms of automation such as having the lights sync with sunrise and sunset times, or having specific scenes turn on when you arrive home. It offers you much more stable connectivity and allows for control from anywhere through the cloud. Compatible with Matter, your Hue system will work seamlessly with other smart home ecosystems.</p>
<p>At $46, this Philips Hue Solo light strip is a great value in premium smart lighting. You’re getting true RGBWW color accuracy, impressive 1700-lumen brightness, seamless smart home integration, and the reliability of an established brand.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/xbox-360-favorite-memories-mw2-bastion-halo-2000646286</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Mountain Dew green colors. The loud marketing campaigns. The Xbox 360 felt like Microsoft trying to <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-360-mtv-special-20-years-elijah-wood-future-gaming-1851780248">but its way</a> into the console gaming big leagues. Through the unexpected collision of developer-friendly tech, consumer affordability, and digital-first initiatives, the <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-360-console-update-more-ads-20-years-old-series-x-1851785111">Xbox 360</a> organically bootstrapped its way into being one of the best consoles ever.</p> <p>It didn’t just capture the late 2000s gaming imagination, it defined the zeitgeist and forged experiences that feel as formative as the early days of the NES or PlayStation 1. To mark the console’s 20th anniversary and lasting impact, here are the Xbox 360 memories that still stick with us:</p>

 <hr> <p><span><strong>1.</strong> The first time I earned an in-game achievement, something clicked in my brain. I believe it was for completing the training level in </span><i><span>Call of Duty 2</span></i><span>. I remember how nice it felt to get a little pop-up reward from the game. I then spent the next many, many years collecting achievements on Xbox 360, subjecting myself to games like </span><i><span>Full Auto</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Perfect Dark Zero</span></i><span> in the hunt for more points. And while I think achievements aren’t that exciting anymore, I do still love the idea of having this record of things I’ve played and done across now three generations of Xbox consoles. I’m happy every other platform stole this idea, too. (Zack Zwiezen)</span></p>

 <hr> <p><span><strong>2.</strong> When the incredible </span><i><span>Pac-Man Championship Edition </span></i><span>came out, I became embroiled in a fierce high score battle with a few acquaintances. Every night I’d get home from work to see that one of them had just barely slipped past me, and so I’d lose myself for hours in the neon vibes and clubby beats of its arcade action, relying on pure instinct, trying again and again and again until I finally secured my victory over them on the leaderboards. It was pure arcade bliss. (Carolyn Petit)</span></p>

 <hr> <p><span><strong>3.</strong> The first and last time I ever ordered a pizza on a video game console happened in 2013. Pizza Hut launched an app on the Xbox 360 and offered a promotion that let you get a pizza for 15 percent off. I ordered a pepperoni pie, stuffed-crust of course, and consumed it while playing B</span><i><span>lack Ops 2.</span></i><span> Little did I know life would rarely be this good again. (Zack Zwiezen)</span></p>

 <hr> <p><span><strong>4.</strong> My first 360 memory was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/r-tdu-x360">Tom Bramwell</a> bringing his pre-release machine over to my flat before it was out, and we played <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/r-condemned-pc"><em>Criminal Oranges</em></a> and <em>Kameo</em> and worried for the machine’s chances. </span><span>But then after that, all <em>Geometry Wars</em>, all the time. (John Walker)</span></p>

 <hr> <p><strong>5.</strong> My girlfriend’s roommate’s boyfriend moved into their apartment during the last year of college. He had an Xbox 360 with <em>Modern Warfare 2</em>. I slept over often staying up with him until one or two in the morning fighting Juggernauts in Special Ops missions and running Model 1887 Akimbo through Terminal while drinking a case of Lion’s Head. <span>(Ethan Gach)</span></p>

 <hr> <p><span><strong>6.</strong> It might sound silly now, but </span><i><span>Gears of War 3 </span></i><span>is burned into my brain because of one character’s death. Late in the game, spoilers for those who haven’t played it, Dom sacrifices himself to save Marcus and the others from doom. My brother and I had played through the first two games multiple times and had developed a connection with this world and the characters. He was always Dom. I was always Marcus. And there was something oddly compelling and sad about watching my digital brother sacrifice himself to save me. (Zack Zwiezen)</span></p> <hr> <p><strong>7.</strong> I’m still chasing the high of that first <em>Dungeon Defenders</em>. It came to XBLA in late 2011 when I was living in my first apartment after college. My best friend and I were hooked on the tower defense RPG loop, hoovering up crystals and maxing every character. I’ve never played anything as intensely since. <span>(Ethan Gach)</span></p> <hr> <p><span><strong>8.</strong> The foundational memory I have of the Xbox 360 was that, when the box launched in 2005, I wasn’t allowed to play it. My twin brother and I got one the following January because they were on back order, so I spent a couple months staring wistfully at the games we’d bought ahead of time. But I had recently failed my seventh-grade math class with a 64, and rather than investing in tutoring or anything to support me in a subject I clearly struggled with, my mother decided to punish me by not allowing me to play the shiny new console. </span></p>

 <p><span>I still did, obviously. I just waited until my mother went to sleep. I beat </span><i><span>Kameo: Elements of Power </span></i><span>in the dead of night and honed my skills in </span><i><span>Dead or Alive 4</span></i><span> when no one was awake to notice. My mother eventually found out because my local youth minister was a narc and was listening in on every conversation my friends and I were having. But I beat 360 games months earlier than I was supposed to. In retrospect, that was a lot of drama for something so insignificant as a middle school math class. But hey, those late-night play sessions were worth it. (Kenneth Shepard)</span></p> <hr> <p><strong>9.</strong> I borrowed <em>Catherine</em> from a friend and played it at the exact time my girlfriend and I were on a break over my own commitment issues. That precise combination of puzzle platforming panic, existential dread, and demonic nightmares will never leave me. I can still hear the music as Vincent sits in the bar bathroom watching his low-stakes life unravel over text message. <span>(Ethan Gach)</span></p>

 <hr> <p><span><strong>10.</strong><i> Halo 3</i></span>. I don’t think there’s ever going to be a multiplayer experience quite like that one again. I have many good memories of killer matches and chill hang out sessions. But I’ll always remember when folks started spotting players wearing the “Recon” helmet and were obsessed over trying to figure out how to unlock it long before the armor piece became available to the public. Me, being the kind of person I was at the time (and maybe still am?) would often hop onto social, unranked matches to try and convince people I knew how to get the armor. No, I didn’t scam them. I just wasted their time, taking them to various corners of the game’s maps and asking them spin around in circles, empty all their ammo in the corner, stand on top of each other to build a ladder to where I promised them the Recon armor was hiding, or recite strange cryptic sounding sentences I made up on the spot. I’m sorry if you were one of those people whose time I wasted. But it was really, really funny to me. Thanks for the memories. (Claire Jackson)</p> <hr> <p><strong>11.</strong> Waiting for <em>Bastion</em> to come to XBLA’s Summer of Arcade felt like being back in the ’90s. Digital downloads still felt novel. They were giving birth to an entirely new generation of retro-inspired indie giants. I played it my SD TV left over from college up in my parent’s attic during July with no air conditioning. I was still sweating even in the middle of the night as Logan Cunningham raspy voice unfurled a broken world hope, despair, and beautiful colors. It felt like I was looking at the past and the future simultaneously. <span>(Ethan Gach)</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/bose-goes-nuclear-quietcomfort-noise-cancelling-headphones-now-cheaper-than-budget-alternatives-2000646499</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The noise-cancelling headphones market has become incredibly crowded with Sony, Bose, Apple, Sonos and others fighting for your attention. Each brand also offers multiple models at many different price points and if I’m being honest, the differences between them have gotten increasingly tough to justify.</p>
<p>At a certain point, when premium ANC headphones are all performing fantastically, the smartest move is finding the best deal and pulling the trigger. And the great news is <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4702/">that the Bose QuietComfort headphones have dropped to $199 for Black Friday, down from $349</a>. That’s 43% off a legendary pair of cans, and the lowest price Amazon has ever offered on these.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4702/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>The Name That Defined Noise Cancellation Still Delivers</h2>
<p><strong>Bose invented the category of consumer noise-cancelling headphones</strong> and has refined the QuietComfort line over decades. That heritage shows in how effortlessly these headphones eliminate ambient noise: the hum of airplane engines, office chatter, city traffic, and noisy coffee shops-all just fade into silence when you put them on. At the same time, the ANC technology automatically changes intensity with your surroundings, increasing or decreasing as needed.</p>



<p>Sound quality lives up to the Bose <strong>reputation for rich, balanced audio</strong>. Deep bass hits with authority without overwhelming mids and highs, which keeps music sounding natural across genres. Acoustic tracks feel intimate while electronic and hip-hop deliver the punch you’d expect. Bose tuned these headphones to sound great out of the box<strong> without requiring EQ adjustments</strong>, though the app lets you tweak things if you want.</p>
<p><strong>With 24 hours of battery life</strong>, you can make it through an entire week of commutes and work sessions on a single charge. When you’re in a rush, a quick 15-minute top-up adds roughly 2.5 hours of playtime. USB-C charging keeps things suitably simple and compatible with the cables you already own. Should you somehow manage to drain the battery completely during a long-haul flight, the headphones also work in wired mode.</p>
<p>Comfort is a huge factor when you’re having to wear headphones for long periods of time, and Bose really nailed the ergonomics here. The<strong> plush ear cushions create a seal without excessive clamping pressure</strong> against your head. The headband distributes weight evenly around your head, so you won’t feel soreness building up after a few hours. It feels premium in terms of build without being heavy, treading a nice line between durability and wearability.</p>



<p>The <strong>on-board microphone handles calls clearly</strong> enough for professional conversations. Colleagues and family members will hear you sans that muffled, distant quality that plagues many Bluetooth headphones. Wind noise reduction helps when you’re taking calls outdoors or in less-than-ideal conditions. It won’t replace a dedicated desktop setup for podcasting, but the mic performs quite well for everyday voice communication.</p>
<p>Bluetooth connectivity has been rock solid in real-world use: <strong>the headphones pair quickly</strong> and connections have remained stable even in busy wireless environments. Multipoint pairing lets you stay connected to two devices at once, perfect for toggling between your laptop and your phone. The Bose app offers further customizations, including adjustable EQ, ANC levels, and shortcut button assignments.</p>
<p>At $199, the Bose QuietComfort headphones are outstanding value in the premium ANC category. You’re getting legendary noise cancellation, refined sound quality, all-day battery life, and exceptional comfort from a brand that pioneered this entire product segment.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Logitech POWERPLAY 2 Review—It Does Exactly What You Want]]></title>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/logitech-powerplay-2-review%E2%80%94it-does-exactly-what-you-want.1361716/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Logitech POWERPLAY 2 is such a practical device and perfectly does what it says on the tin that there’s not a hell of a lot to comment on. It’s marketed as a wireless charging system that allows you to constantly power certain wireless gaming mice on a surface that’s synonymous with Logitech’s premium mouse pads. </p>



<p>And guess what? That’s exactly what it <strong>is </strong>and what it <strong>does</strong>. Read on to scope out this full POWERPLAY 2 review to see if it’s the kind of thing you need.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-the-logitech-powerplay-2-worth-119">Is the Logitech POWERPLAY 2 Worth $119?</h2>



<p>As I wrote this review, the POWERPLAY 2 was retailing for $119.99, which might seem steep when you can buy a G240 ‘cloth gaming mouse pad’ from the company for just $7.99.</p>



<p>So, why is the POWERPLAY 2 more than 12 times the price of a regular mouse pad?</p>



<p>The POWERPLAY 2 has integrated charging systems woven into the mat, which means that when the mouse pad is <strong>powered</strong>, it effortlessly charges your wireless gaming mouse. It achieves this by fusing the regular mouse pad surface with an unbroken charging layer that invisibly powers the device in your hand and keeps it topped up.</p>



<p>At 34.4cm by 34cm, it’s a fairly sizeable square thing that takes up a decent amount of space on your desk, and at the top of the mouse pad sits the POWERPLAY 2 power unit, which has a handy heads-up light letting you know when your mouse is being actively charged.</p>



<p>You simply pop the POWERPLAY 2 down on your desk, connect it to a powered USB port (at least 2.0), and that’s about it. To use a compatible mouse, you’ll use the POWERPLAY 2 COIN that’s included in the box.</p>



<p>Fortunately, that range of compatible gaming mice is <strong>diverse</strong>, but it’s limited exclusively to Logitech devices:</p>



<ul>
<li>G309</li>



<li>G502 X Plus (my mouse)</li>



<li>G502 X LIGHTSPEED</li>



<li>G502</li>



<li>G703</li>



<li>G903</li>



<li>PRO X SUPERLIGHT 2</li>



<li>PRO X SUPERLIGHT 2 DEX</li>



<li>PRO X SUPERLIGHT</li>



<li>PRO 2 LIGHTSPEED</li>



<li>PRO Wireless</li>
</ul>



<p>It’s a brilliant piece of technology, especially for someone who regularly forgets to charge their devices. I’ll never have that happen again, thanks to the Logitech POWERPLAY 2. That’s why I think it’s more than worth the money, but I can understand how it’ll be a deal-breaker for some, that it’s so expensive.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[EcoFlow Goes Full Chaos Mode on the Delta 2 Power Station, 1800W of Portable Power for Pocket Change]]></title>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ecoflow-goes-full-chaos-mode-on-the-delta-2-power-station-1800w-of-portable-power-for-pocket-change.1361698/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The portable power station market gets fiercely competitive during Black Friday, with brands like <em>Jackery</em> and <em>Anker</em> dropping prices to the $350-400 range. Here’s the thing though: most of those deals cap out at 1,500W output. Ecoflow just <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5693/">changed the equation by slashing the Delta 2 to $349, down from $699</a> and you’re getting here <strong>1,800W of continuous power</strong> for less than competitors charge for their smaller units. This<strong> 50% discount marks the all-time lowest price</strong> for a power station in this performance class, and it probably won’t last long.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5693/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Raw Power That Competitors Can’t Match at This Price</h2>
<p>The 1,800W output puts the Delta 2 in a different league than most portable power stations in this price range. That extra 300W compared to 1,500W competitors might sound modest on paper but it opens up a whole new category of appliances you can run. Power-hungry devices like microwaves, coffee makers, and small space heaters suddenly become viable options. The <strong>2,700W surge capacity</strong> handles startup spikes from compressors and motors without breaking a sweat. You’re essentially getting mid-tier performance at entry-level pricing.</p>



<p>The 1,024Wh capacity provides enough juice to keep your essentials running during extended outages or off-grid adventures. A full charge can power a mini fridge for about a day or keep your phones and laptops topped up for a week. Ecoflow designed the Delta 2 to be expandable too, so you can add extra batteries down the line if your needs grow.</p>
<p>LiFePO4 battery chemistry gives the Delta 2 a serious longevity advantage over traditional lithium-ion power stations: This type of battery maintains over <strong>80% capacity after 3,000 charge cycles which translates to roughly a decade of regular use</strong>. The chemistry is also inherently safer with better thermal stability and reduced fire risk. You can store it in your garage or RV without worrying about temperature extremes causing problems.</p>



<p>Charging speed is where EcoFlow really flexes its engineering muscle: The <strong>Delta 2 goes from empty to 80% in just 50 minutes</strong> using a standard wall outlet, with no bulky external brick required. Solar charging maxes out at 500W input, so a couple of panels can fully recharge the unit in a few hours on a sunny day. You can even combine AC and solar charging simultaneously for maximum speed. That rapid turnaround keeps you powered up and ready to go when time matters.</p>
<p>The port selection covers pretty much every charging scenario you might encounter. <strong>Six AC outlets handle your larger appliances and power tools, while the 100W USB-C port delivers laptop-level charging speeds</strong>. Four additional USB-A ports and a 12V car outlet round out the options. Everything can run simultaneously without juggling or prioritizing devices. The built-in display shows real-time input and output wattage along with remaining capacity.</p>
<p>At $349, the EcoFlow Delta 2 delivers unmatched value in the portable power station category. You’re getting 1,800W output, LiFePO4 durability, ultra-fast charging, and expandable capacity for less than competitors charge for inferior specs. This Black Friday deal essentially gives you a $700 power station at half price.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Logitech LITRA BEAM LX Review—Minor Stream Item, Major Impact]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/logitech-litra-beam-lx-review/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/logitech-litra-beam-lx-review%E2%80%94minor-stream-item-major-impact.1361695/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>I was looking for a new lighting solution for my stream, as my old Logitech Litra had seen better days after being in continuous use for many years. Little did I realize, Logitech had since released an overhauled version – the <strong>LITRA BEAM LX</strong>. It’s an evolution in every way, offering a sweeping bar with intense RGB on one side and an extremely capable key light on the other.</p>



<p>For a while, I’ve had the LITRA BEAM LX sitting front and centre in my setup, and not only does it look fantastic, but it’s also the most effective key light I’ve ever used. It’s not the <strong>cheapest </strong>solution, and it requires a mains connection as well as USB-C hook-up, but if you can accommodate it, it’s one of the best additions you’ll ever make to your stream or video setup.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-the-litra-beam-lx-worth-129">Is the LITRA BEAM LX Worth $129?</h2>



<p>The LITRA BEAM LX is a handy, practical, and attractive key light that has transformed my setup. The original LITRA was a single ‘panel’ light that offered a few basic customization points, but the LITRA BEAM LX takes things to the next level and <strong>beyond</strong>.</p>



<p>It’s a dual-sided key light that comes equipped with Logitech’s clean ‘LIGHTSYNC’ RGB technology, fully customizable through the G Hub application, and a damn nice splash of color wherever you decide to put it.</p>



<p>As a versatile thing, the LITRA BEAM LX can be positioned either horizontally or vertically, like a light column. The base of the light is pretty hefty and takes up a bit of desk space, but it’s not too oppressive. It’s also a hefty thing that weighs around 1.5 KG, so bear that in mind and don’t put it anywhere it could get knocked over.</p>



<figure><figcaption>The LITRA BEAM LX does a perfect job of illuminating your face with a soft glow that doesn’t cast too many shadows</figcaption></figure>







<p>Admittedly, there’s not a huge amount you can say about a <strong>light</strong>, but if you’re in the market for a multi-functional and super-effective key light that offers remote customization, an easy install process, and genuinely satisfying effects, you’ll want to check out the LITRA BEAM LX.</p>



<p>It’s my daily driver, and at the time of writing, I had the RGB bar set up to mimic ARC Raiders colorways, while the key light perfectly brightens my streams of that same game. I think the only thing better than the LITRA BEAM LX would be TWO of these lights, to have them columned on either side of the monitor to eliminate any chance of shadows across the face.</p>



<p>Perfection.</p>
