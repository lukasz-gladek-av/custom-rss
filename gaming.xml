            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>The Metroidvania revival (did it ever really go away?) keeps rolling, and here comes another stylised combat-platformer where a strange little hero gets lost in a dark, labyrinthine fantasy world.</p>
<p>This time, our protagonist is John, who stumbles into a bizarre realm full of somnambulist weirdos and giant babies. Studio Cima has crafted a disturbing, stylised trip that deftly builds on themes of psychological trauma and fear. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/perfect_pencil">The Perfect Pencil</a> can be pretty impenetrable at times, but it stays compelling throughout.</p>
<p>John’s actual goal is never fully clear, which only adds to the fever-dream vibe of the world he wanders through. Initially headless, he acquires an old projector for a <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/bonce">bonce</a> and ventures out armed with nothing but a giant pencil.</p>
<p>Bedtime iconography is everywhere: NPCs speak in riddles, and you’re never totally sure who’s trying to help you and who’s planning to stab you in the back. Both enemies and allies are equally creepy. John meets dead‑eyed sleepwalkers wrapped in random junk, or oddball creatures offering to teach him martial arts.</p>
<p>The Camera Obscura atop John’s neck lets him scan the environment, which helps with navigating the (sometimes pretty convoluted) map and uncovering secrets tied to the main quest.</p>
<p>While a lot of recent Metroidvanias lean heavily on tough combat and tricky platforming chains, The Perfect Pencil is more focussed on exploration. You’ll poke around its surreal dreamscape, run side‑tasks for NPCs, and upgrade John’s projector with ability‑boosting filaments.</p>
<p>There’s still a solid amount of combat as you battle with those sleepy enemies scattered across the games diverse biomes. They’re not especially tough, but their placement can lead to some annoying deaths and long runbacks. Boss fights are fun setpieces with bigger enemies that are literal manifestations of the game’s themes. Like their smaller counterparts, they also love flattening John and sending him back to distant save points.</p>
<p>John fights these Tim Burton‑esque foes with a simple melee offence. His most useful skill is a heal strike that converts the energy from consecutive attacks into a health‑restoring hit. It’s a neat ability that stays handy throughout the game. His attacks can be upgraded by spending a resources scattered throughout the levels and by defeating enemies.</p>
<p>Combat and traversal across this uniquely designed world feels smooth in both handheld and docked modes, with zero performance issues. This has none of the razors-edge twitchiness of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Silksong</a> or the recently released <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mio-memories-in-orbit">Mio</a>, but it's nice to see the painstaking art style in clear detail during John's tribulations. The Switch continues to be a comfortable home for artistically-driven Metroidvanias.</p>
<p>Despite being another in an ever increasing genre stable, The Perfect Pencil brings a uniquely twisted world to the genre. Its mysteries can be a bit dense, but the eerie atmosphere, complex themes, and strange landscapes make it worth exploring.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/the-perfect-pencil]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-is-clearing-out-samsungs-nintendo-switch-2-friendly-microsd-card-at-its-lowest-price-2000665521</link>
            <guid>1425085</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It’s pretty unlikely that the “wee but mighty” metaphor that goes all the way back to Shakespeare was created with the very wee, very mighty Samsung P9 Express microSD card in mind. In fact, if you were caught with such a device back in the Bard’s day, you probably would have been burned for witchcraft. But considering that the P9 Express is 0.59 x 0.43 inches in size and less than 1 one-hundredth of an ounce in weight, yet able to boost the storage on literally dozens of different devices by over half a terabyte, its wee-but-mighty status is undeniable.</p>
<p>Also wee? <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5799/">The P9 Express microSD card’s price, which is just $80 right now at Amazon</a>. But if you’re looking to score big, reliable, fast-moving storage to your Nintendo Switch 2, drone, camera, laptop, tablet, or most anything else, you should get to Amazon mighty fast, because the shelves are emptying and emptying fast.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5799/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Switch 2 Superstar</h2>
<p>Samsung is leaning hard into selling the P9 Express microSD card to Nintendo Switch 2 owners, which is smart thinking when you consider just how big a smash hit that handheld gaming console has been. The selling point for Switch 2 games isn’t just the great sale price or the 512GB of storage the P9 Express adds to the console. It’s the speed, which as any gamer will you, is absolutely essential.</p>
<p>The P9 Express moves data at speeds of up to 800 MB/s, which is four times faster than even Samsung’s standard microSD cards. When you’re booting up a game from a parallel storage unit rather than the Switch 2’s built-in storage, a standard microSD card might lag, but the P9 Express will have your game up and running in a snap, and more importantly, it will run smoothly and lag-free.</p>
<p>As a game and downloadable content repository, the P9 Express will get a serious workout inside a Switch 2. But Samsung’s Dynamic Thermal Guard technology keeps things cool within the tiny P9 Express to ward off overheating-related slowdowns or bricking.</p>



<h2>Universal Storage</h2>
<p>Even if the Samsung P9 Express only worked with the Switch 2, there would be a pretty solid case to hit this Amazon deal and snag one for just $80. But the list of tech items the P9 Express brings seamless, fast, reliable storage to is long indeed. Basically, any device with a microSD slot, since the P9 Express is also reverse-compatible with UHS-I devices. That covers a lot of ground — everything from smartphones and tablets to digital cameras and drones. It also comes with a 3-year warranty, and chances are you’ll never need to file a claim since the P9 Express is built to withstand x-rays, magnets, drops, water, high and low temperatures, and the wear and tear that comes with being inserted into and removed from devices.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5799/">With Amazon’s 33% off deal in place, the $80 price for the 512GB Samsung P9 Express microSD card</a> is a small one indeed for a tiny chip that&nbsp;<em>triples</em> the storage of a Nintendo Switch 2, and also works across such a vast array of tech devices. But Amazon’s hung out that big red “Deal Selling Fast” tag on this one, so move fast before you miss out.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[NetEase Has Told Their Studios Not To Use AI “At All”]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/netease-has-told-their-studios-not-to-use-ai-at-all/</link>
            <guid>1425082</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The co-founder of Grasshopper Manufacture has stated that NetEase doesn’t allow any of their studios to use AI. </p>



<p>Due to the rapid growth of artificial intelligence (AI), the gaming industry has become increasingly concerned about its application in games. Opinions on this matter vary: some support AI for its ability to expedite mundane tasks, while others argue that it should not be utilized in any artistic capacity. Additionally, some have outright rejected the use of AI altogether. Recently, Take-Two <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/take-two-ceo-says-genai-has-zero-part-in-gta-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discussed</a> generative AI in relation to GTA 6, and now we also know NetEase’s stance on the issue. </p>







<h2 id="h-netease-shuts-down-ai-usage-across-all-internal-game-studios">NetEase Shuts Down AI Usage Across All Internal Game Studios</h2>



<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/romeo-is-a-dead-man-suda-51-generative-ai" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>, the co-founder of Grasshopper Manufacture (NetEase acquired it in 2021) and the director of Romeo is a Dead Man, Goichi “Suda 51” Suda, elaborated on his perspective on AI use in games. Talking about his game first, Suda 51 stated that Romeo would be “fake”, “hard to relate to”, and “kind of creepy” if he were made with AI. The director also stated that the work and passion devs put into creating can be felt by players, whereas AI won’t invoke the same feeling. </p>



<p>Suda 51 then spoke about NetEase banning AI use, stating that they “originally had a section researching and developing AI-related stuff.” However, they decided not to work on that section anymore, shutting it down and telling “their studios to not use AI in games, to not use it at all.”</p>



<p>When asked why, Suda 51 said he doesn’t know the exact reason but speculates there could be two. First, a vast majority of players “don’t like AI and having it in their games,” and second, “issues with copyright infringement” also come into play. Insider Gaming has reached out to NetEase Games for clarification and will update this story once a response is received.</p>

Divinity devs have stated that they will “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/divinity-devs-will-refrain-from-using-genai-tools-for-concept-art/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">refrain from using GenAI tools</a>” for concept art.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-acknowledges-switch-2-sales-have-been-slightly-weaker-than-expected-outside-japan</link>
            <guid>1425079</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo has discussed the fact that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tech/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a> hardware sales were lower than expected outside Japan towards the end of 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking to shareholders this week, Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa acknowledged that "overseas sales were slightly weaker than our expectations," something that had <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/did-the-nintendo-switch-2-really-have-a-bad-holiday-we-asked-analysts">previously been reported and discussed with IGN by analysts</a>, though not stated out loud by the company itself. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, in an investor meeting following the release of this week's latest financial earnings, Nintendo shareholders repeatedly questioned the company on its western sales shortfall, even as the Switch 2 overperforms within its homeland of Japan. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"While our forecasted global hardware and software sales volume remains unchanged, the breakdown by region and product is based on different assumptions from the revised forecast announced at the time of our second-quarter financial results announcement," Furukawa <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2026/260204.pdf" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a>, via machine translation. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Furthermore, as you understand, domestic hardware sales volume exceeded our expectations, while overseas sales were slightly weaker than our expectations," he continued.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sales figures collated by The Game Business last month showed that U.S. Switch 2 sales over the holiday period were down around 35% versus the Switch 1's first holiday sales performance back in 2017. In the UK, a similar comparison saw Switch 2 lagging Switch 1 by 16%. Even in Nintendo's homeland of Japan, Switch 2 holiday sales couldn't match Switch 1, and were down by 5.5% over the year's final nine weeks.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In France, 2025's final tally of Switch 2 sales was down by "over 30%" versus the amount Switch 1 notched up back in 2017, meanwhile. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While these numbers may take some of the shine off of a successful first year for Switch 2 overall, it's not all doom and gloom. Switch 2's lifetime sales in Japan are still above what Switch 1 managed in its first year, with less time on sale. And in the UK, Switch 1 continued to sell well enough that it made up Switch 2's holiday sales deficit.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Kirby Air Riders: Official Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Asked for more detail on why hardware sales in Japan were doing better than expected, Furukawa has now highlighted the release of two games in particular that had resonated with the country's audience: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-legends-z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> and the Switch 2 exclusive <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We believe that the reason for the stronger-than-expected hardware sales in Japan is that, amid the continued momentum of the initial launch of the Switch 2 hardware, new titles such as Pokémon Legends: Z-A Nintendo Switch 2 Edition and Kirby Air Riders, released during the holiday shopping season, [leading] to a relatively high trend of existing Switch owners switching to the Switch 2 compared to overseas."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the Pokémon franchise is hugely popular globally, it enjoys a particular level of devotion within Japan. Kirby games also sell especially well in the country, with mixed success historically overseas. Essentially, then, Furukawa is suggesting that the Switch 2's level of success in Japan has been fuelled by two titles that have resonated particularly well with Japanese audiences. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's a statement that gels well with what a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-source-blames-switch-2-holiday-sales-slowdown-on-the-economic-landscape-and-the-absence-of-a-major-western-game-despite-the-release-of-metroid-prime-4-beyond">recent, unnamed western Nintendo source reportedly said of the company's softer Switch 2 sales overseas</a>, which were blamed on the lack of a key first-party game for the holidays. The remark raised eyebrows at the time due to the fact it appeared to overlook <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/metroid-prime-4-beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> (as Metroid Prime has traditionally been seen as a sub-franchise with a stronger western following than in Japan). However, as we learned this week, Metroid Prime 4 has indeed gotten off to a slow start sales-wise, something Nintendo appeared to have anticipated to some degree.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There was next to no mention of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/metroid-prime-4-beyond">Metroid Prime 4 in Nintendo's financial results this week, and no sign of its Switch or Switch 2 versions </a>on the company's lists of million copy-selling games. Switch 2 exclusive Kirby Air Riders was recorded as having sold 1.76 million units since its arrival on November 20, but there was no mention of how well Metroid Prime 4 had fared following its arrival on December 4.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Following the launch of Metroid Prime 4, Nintendo admitted that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/backtracking-development-again-was-out-of-the-question-nintendo-says-metroid-prime-4s-open-world-hub-was-a-victim-of-the-games-lengthy-development">it knew the game's open-world concept risked feeling outdated</a>. Last month, Metroid Prime producer and Nintendo veteran <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metroid-prime-producer-reportedly-leaving-nintendo-after-40-years-unsure-if-there-will-be-another-game-to-wrap-up-syluxs-story">Kensuke Tanabe abruptly announced that the game would be his last project for the company</a> after four decades of service. When contacted for more detail by IGN, Nintendo did not comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Overall, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-raises-hardware-forecast-as-switch-2-sales-hit-1036-million-continuing-streak-as-the-biggest-console-launch-of-all-time">Switch 2 remains Nintendo's fastest-selling console at launch ever</a>, with an explosive arrival propelled by the recent success of the original Switch (something it, in turn, didn't have as it followed Wii U). But all eyes will be on Nintendo now to shore up its line-up of Switch 2 games for the rest of 2026 — when fans hope they'll finally get a new 3D Mario platformer in time for Christmas.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Upcoming first-party Switch 2 games include Mario Tennis Fever (February 12), Pokémon Pokopia (March 5), Super Mario Bros. Wonder Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Meetup in Bellabel Park (March 26), Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream (April 16), and Yoshi and the Mysterious Book, which has a vague "spring" launch window. Simply listed for 2026 are Fire Emblem: Fortune's Weave, Rhythm Heaven Groove and Pokémon Champions, while Splatoon Raiders has a "TBA" launch date.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

Pre-orders were cancelled, though Gearbox framed the move as a delay, not a full scrapping of the project. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Indeed, the developer said it hoped to "align" its Switch 2 release with the addition of cross saves to the game — something which now seems to no longer be on the cards.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking to <a href="https://variety.com/2026/gaming/news/borderlands-4-switch-release-paused-take-two-ceo-gta-online-1236651227/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a> this week, a Take-Two spokesperson has said that work on Borderlands 4's Switch 2 edition was no longer ongoing, as Gearbox prioritized continued "improvements" to the game on its existing platforms.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's a curious situation, not least because the game's Switch 2 version got so close to release, and had been played publicly in demo form at various events last year, such as at Gamescom 2025 in Cologne. Opinion on the game's Switch 2 demo was mixed, though <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tech-experts-say-borderlands-4-on-pc-runs-worse-than-usual-for-an-unreal-engine-5-game-advise-against-badass-setting">Borderlands 4 has also suffered from technical issues even on the more powerful PlayStation 5 Pro and Xbox Series X</a>. The game's Steam review rating has also suffered from negative comments regarding its PC performance, too.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Borderlands 4 Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"We made the difficult decision to pause development on that SKU," Take-Two spokesperson Alan Lewis told Variety this week. "Our focus continues to be delivering quality post-launch content for players on the ongoing improvements to optimize the game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We're continuing to collaborate closely with our friends at Nintendo. We have PGA Tour 2K25 coming out and WWE 2K26 [for Switch 2], and we're incredibly excited about bringing more of our titles to that platform in the future."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That last sentence is intriguing, too — the suggestion that Take-Two may now be focusing its Switch 2 plans elsewhere. Could Nintendo's console become home to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">GTA 6</a>, which <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-marketing-will-kick-off-this-summer-as-take-two-confidently-reaffirms-november-release-date">looks increasingly likely to make its late 2026 launch date</a>?

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-sun-and-moon-review">Pokémon Sun and Moon</a> turn 10 this year. Feel old yet? It doesn't matter, as we're only just now learning new fun tidbits about their development and what the hell was up with the very divisive Ultra Beast designs.</p>
<p>Renowned illustrator Yusuke Omura, former character designer at main Pokémon developer Game Freak and lead designer on Sun and Moon, took to X/Twitter to comment on several fan theories that popped up over the years about the mysterious extradimensional beings which shook things up when they were revealed:</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="ja">ウルトラビーストは、僕がそれまで杉森さんにNGを出されてきたデザインを思い出して、その理由を逆に利用しながらディレクションをした<br>なので僕の怨念の集合体みたいな側面もありましてこわいですね<br>杉森さんを憎んでいるということでは全然ないです</p>— 大村祐介 (@yusuke_omura) <a href="https://twitter.com/yusuke_omura/status/2018851331562500430?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 4, 2026</a></blockquote></div>

</p></div>
<p>Via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/pokemons-ultra-beasts-were-based-on-past-pokemon-designs-rejected-by-game-freak-art-director-ken-sugimori-artist-reveals-thats-why-they-look-so-creepy/">Automaton</a>, we got a translation of his post, where he explained the Ultra Beasts were essentially based on designs for Pokémon that "were rejected by Mr. Sugimori." He talks about Ken Sugimori, who's been the primary character designer and art director on the iconic franchise for a long time. "I decided to deliberately use the very reasons for why they were rejected and base the artistic direction of the designs on them. So in some way, they’re like a manifestation of my own resentment– pretty scary," Omura added.</p>
<p>So there you have it: We were right to be put off by most of those designs. The news straight from the designer should also quell <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/qnmhbo/ultra_beasts_arent_just_from_a_different/">fan theories on the matter</a> which have been around since the games came out in 2016. It turns out most of them were right on the money.</p><p>Personally, I'm not much of a fan of the designs even if they were meant to represent totally different beings from another dimension, but at the same time, I appreciate Pokémon getting weird from time to time. Most of the valid recent criticisms of the franchise are about its fear of breaking new ground, and if you ask around now, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/1h0ub6a/why_did_people_hate_sun_and_moon_and_usum_when/">players are far more positive on Sun and Moon</a> than they were a decade ago. Maybe the fact they were actually polished products also has something to do with it, ey?</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/hades-voice-actors-reunite-in-the-bafta-nominated-visual-novel-vampire-therapist</link>
            <guid>1425052</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>Back in 2024, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hades">Hades</a> voice actor Cyrus Nemati (Ares, Dionysus, Theseus) brought the therapy visual novel Vampire Therapist to PC. It reunited Nemati with a bunch of his Supergiant co-stars, picked up a BAFTA nomination, and landed a fair few '<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2481020/Vampire_Therapist/#app_reviews_hash">Overwhelmingly Positive</a>' <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2481020/Vampire_Therapist/">Steam</a> reviews in the process. The crème de la crème is that later this month, we'll all get to check it out on Switch.</p>
<p>Little Bat Games (founded by Nemati, no less) has today announced that Vampire Therapist will arrive on the Switch eShop on <strong>17th February</strong> — hey, that's right around the corner!</p>
<p>This one sees you step into the immortal shoes of a reformed vampire from the Wild West, who's given up his gunslinging to instead guide his fellow neck-biters through the wonderful world of therapy. It was written with a real therapist on hand, so all of the advice, listening, and conversations are rooted in real cognitive behavioural therapy concepts. Don't worry, it also stars a bunch of wacky vampires, so there's no shortage of laughs amongst the deep stuff, too.</p>
<p>Alongside Nemati himself, the voice cast also includes Hades / <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hades_ii">Hades II</a> alumni Francesca Meaux (Eurydice) and Sarah Grayson (Selene), and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@criticalrole">Critical Role</a>'s Matt Mercer — damn, when does this guy sleep?</p>
<p>Here's a rundown of the game's key features and a handful of screenshots:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Real Therapy Concepts:</strong> You’ll learn and apply real cognitive behavioral therapy concepts vetted by licensed therapists. By challenging client statements that contain “cognitive distortions”, you’ll help vampires see where their thoughts don’t match reality.<br>
<strong>A Comedic Look Through History:</strong> Meet emotionally damaged vampires from ancient Greece, Renaissance Italy, revolutionary France, Tudor England, and Iron Age Ireland.<br>
<strong>An All-Star Voice Cast:</strong> Featuring Matthew Mercer (Critical Role, Baldur's Gate 3), Francesca Meaux (Hades), Sarah Grayson (Gone Home, Hades II), Kylie Clark, and the game's creator, Cyrus Nemati (Hades, Pyre).<br>
<strong>Unique Setting:</strong> Vampire Therapist merges cozy self-introspection with a dark European goth vibe. In fact, the whole thing takes place above a goth club in Germany filled with willing necks to bite.<br>
<strong>Minigames:</strong> Learn mindfulness meditation, safely and consensually bite sexy necks!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Switch version includes the base game with all of its free content updates, <em>and</em> bundles the 'Couples Therapy' DLC in there too. Little Bat has confirmed that the game has also been "revamped" with improved controller support, so there shouldn't be any worries there either.</p>
<p>All in all, it looks like it could be a rather interesting one for those after something in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/coffee_talk">Coffee Talk</a> vein. We'll have to wait and see how it stacks up on Switch in a couple of weeks.</p>
<p><em>What do you make of this one? Will you be checking it out on Switch later this month? Let us know in the comments.</em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/hades-voice-actors-reunite-in-the-bafta-nominated-visual-novel-vampire-therapist]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Running out of storage, especially when you’re in the middle of something important, can be frustrating. It’s more common than you think but thankfully, there are quite a few external solutions that can help prevent the issue. The most convenient out of these are portable SSDs, which not just offer the storage capacity you need, but also powerful speeds in a lightweight, compact build.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7023/">Those shopping for one can consider picking up the 4TB Crucial X10 Pro SSD, which is now going for $420 at Amazon</a>. That’s after the retailer knocked its usual $525 price by 20%. This offer applies to the black color option, and it’s open to both Prime and non-Prime members.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7023/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Portable But Powerful</h2>
<p>The SSD features a 65 x 50 mm design with an anodized aluminum body, plus a rubber base and lanyard hold for added portability. It’s drop-resistant up to 7.5 feet/2 meters, and carries an IP55 water and dust resistance for exceptional durability. Basically, it’s specifically made for on-the-go usage and can survive everyday bumps and hits well, while protecting your important data.</p>
<p>Despite the easy-to-carry, compact build, the drive is quite spacious. This version offers 4TB of storage capacity, which is more than enough to house all your current and future essential files comfortably. Think thousands of high-resolution photos, a ton of videos, heavy work documents, large software, and even a few gaming titles. Whether you’re a creative with an ever-growing media library or a gamer looking to manage their favorite titles better, this drive does the job well.</p>



<p>Speeds are just as impressive. With the Crucial X10 Pro, you’re looking at around 2,100MB/s read and 2,000MB/s write speeds for a seamless workflow. These ensure quicker file access, and fast transfer times, meaning you can get stuff done without waiting around for long. As for compatibility, the drive plays nicely with a wide range of devices, including Windows, Mac, iPad Pro, Chromebooks, Android, Linux, PS4, PS5, and Xbox via USB-C and USB-A. What’s even better is that you will be able to safeguard your data with SSD password protection for enhanced security. This feature can especially come in handy if you’re often on the move and prefer taking your tech accessories along.</p>
<p>Your purchase will also come with a three-month free trial of Mylio Photos Plus and Acronis True Image, both of which make it easy to manage, sort, and protect your digital data. In short, if you’ve been looking for an easy way to manage storage better, this 4TB Crucial X10 Pro SSD can help. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7023/">You can now pick it up for $420, after Amazon slashed its retail price by 20%. If 4TB is more capacity than you need, there’s a 1TB and 2TB version of the same drive available, as well.</a></p>

            <p>Nintendo Switch Online members can now get their hands on two more classic Game Boy games.</p>
<p>The first of these games is puzzler Yoshi, developed by Game Freak of Pokémon fame, which sees players trying to help Mario liberate his dino-buddy from inside an egg he has been trapped inside. "Now it's raining Goombas, Bloopers, and Boo Buddies, and you have to help Mario stop the airborne invasion," reads the official blurb for Yoshi.</p>

<p>"As the critters fall, catch them on trays. Stack two of a kind and they both disappear, or capture the whole bunch in between eggshells. When the eggshells match, out hatches Yoshi and up goes your score! The action heats up as the characters fall faster and faster. To save the day, switch and shuffle, and don't let your piles get too high!"</p>
<p>The second game is Balloon Kid, which casts players as Alice, a young girl who needs to rescue her brother Jim after he gets swept away by strong winds. "In the little town of Pencilvania, there lived a brother and sister who loved to play with balloons. Alice and her younger brother Jim would spend countless days filling the skies with their balloons. One day, Jim filled all of his balloons and tied them together to make a beautiful balloon rainbow across the sky. But suddenly, a strong wind came and carried Jim away," the game description teases.</p>
<p>As Alice, players will be able to float delightfully through eight stages, following Jim's balloon trail. Collecting balloons will earn player's bonus points.</p>

            <p>
Epic have discussed their latest plans for growing the Epic Games Store's audience and stealing more eyeballs from industry overlords Steam. One side of it is launching a proper unified multiplatform store and shared libraries across PC and mobile, alongside better performance and features such as voice chat. The other side of it is channelling the brand clout of Fortnite to increase sales of third party releases, with a new official program of Fortnite cosmetics and Epic Store avatars for people who buy games from participating developers. They're going to do upwards of 100 hats (or equivalent) a year, apparently. 100 hats! Where did I leave that trusty Smithers gif. Ah, <a href="https://tenor.com/view/but-she%27s-got-a-new-hat-smithers-simpsons-the-simpsons-los-simpsons-gif-1510588160414484005">here you go</a>.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Epic's latest <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/epic-games-store-2025-year-in-review">year-in-review</a> brandishes some bountiful numbers - a record 78 million monthly active users in 2025, and a 6% year-on-year rise in expenditure on the Store to $1.16 billion. The review emphasises gains for third-party developers - player spending on third-party games grew 57% to $400 million, while hours spent in third-party games is up 4%. Epic also say that their regular free game rollouts are having "a measurable halo effect across the broader PC ecosystem", claiming that games given away under the program have seen a 40% lift in Steam concurrent users during the offer period.
</p>
<p>
Epic continue to fight an uphill battle persuading third-parties to favour their store, given Steam's dominance, with executives often touting Epic's more generous developer revenue share on social media. "Though Epic processes only around 7% as many third-party payments as Steam, that vastly underreports economic activity as devs on Epic Games Games store are free to process their own payments and keep 100%, and many major games like GTA do so," <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/2013717881431769340">wrote</a> company head Tim Sweeney last month.
</p>
<p>
Sweeney got some flak for that comment, with Larian's Michael Douse <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/2013965062730326230">arguing</a> that certain Epic exclusivity deals have backfired for developers. "I understand Epic entirely funded <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</a> but this altruistic pro-developer talk doesn't sit well when Remedy seemingly went into financial crisis because they couldn't tap Steam for AW2 sales suffering potentially hundreds of millions in lost revenue," he wrote. (Remedy subsequently <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/alan-wake-2-developer-defends-deal-with-excellent-partner-epic-games-despite-the-fact-its-still-missing-from-rival-storefront-steam">pushed back against Douse</a>, arguing that "the publishing deal with Epic was very fair to Remedy", without addressing the point about missing out on Steam revenue.)
</p><p>
In the same Xitter thread, Douse added that "[u]ltimately the viability of the store sits on their ability to convert hundreds of millions of Fortnite players into mid-hardcore premium gamers, and i don't see the Fortnite brand attempting to do that." Which brings us back to Epic's latest effort to "leverage the marketing power of Fortnite". 
</p>
<p>
According to the Epic's 2025 review post, the first of the new Fortnite cosmetic tie-ins "will be available in the first half of the year", with confirmed partners including Capcom, miHoYo, Pearl Abyss, S-Game, MintRocket, and Kakao Games. You can expect a Resident Evil Requiem cosmetic, to start with.
</p>
<p>
Epic Store boss Steve Allison went into a little more detail about the program in <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/take-two-ceo-googles-project-genie">a new chat with The Game Business</a>, following the latest round of EGS figures. "We've had this very powerful anchor [in Fortnite], and we've not tapped into the marketing power that it provides," Allison told newsletter owner Chris Dring. "Maybe four times in seven years. When I was at Telltale, we did this with Valve and Team Fortress hats, and that would have this profound impact. This year we will probably do 40 of them starting with Resident Evil. Our plan is to scale that up to 100 a year in the next 18 to 24 months."
</p>
<p>
Once more with feeling: 100 hats (or hat equivalents) a year! Yeah, that ought to do it. I'm not being entirely scornful. I have no idea how you make a PC gaming store more successful than Steam. I guess they could also try sinking Gabe Newell's yacht while he's having his diamond teeth put in?
</p><p>
"We have ambitions to get to at least 25% to 35% market share on PC where third-party stores are involved," Allison explained elsewhere in the newsletter. "Depending on the data, we are somewhere between 9% and 12%, although in some cases if you think Steam is bigger than it is, you might even say we're 6% or 5%. The focus is continued growth. We need to MAU over 100 million on average. The next four or five years is about making progress on that."
</p>
<p>
He suggests that some of Epic's growth won't be directly at Steam's expense, partly because the console business is in the doldrums, but also because "PC gaming has got much larger, I believe, because of this competitive thing we've got going on here." I can't really speak to the numbers, there, but the last observation does make me think of a cornered drifter anxiously assuring Clint Eastwood that actually, this town <em>is</em> big enough for the two of us.
</p>
<p>
In general, I'm sort of interested in how Epic might convert Fortnite players into people who play games beside Fortnite, given that Fortnite has been pitched for many years as a platform for all other games, intellectual properties, and labours of the human imagination, from Disney to Eminem. Probably the surest way for third parties to make money from EGS is still to make things directly for Fortnite.

<p data-start="0" data-end="507">Apple’s AirPods have become one of the most recognizable accessories in modern consumer tech, and the AirPods 4 continue that legacy. Released a little more than a year ago, this generation builds on what already worked while smoothing out some long-standing pain points. With current discounts bringing the price well below its original launch cost, the AirPods 4 now sit in a much more attractive position, especially for users already invested in Apple’s ecosystem.</p>
<p data-start="509" data-end="1189">The base model of the AirPods 4 debuted at $129, placing it firmly in the mid-range category for wireless earbuds. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6035/">A limited time deal at Amazon has lowered that figure by $29 at just $100.</a> For listeners who want more advanced features, Apple also offers a version with active noise cancellation. That model typically sells for $179, but current deals reduce the cost to $140, making the upgrade more approachable.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6035/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p data-start="1191" data-end="1822">From a design perspective, the AirPods 4 feel familiar at first glance, but closer inspection reveals several thoughtful changes. Apple refined the contour of the earbuds and shortened the stem, giving them a sleeker look and improving how they sit in the ear. The updated shape helps distribute weight more evenly, which contributes to better long-term comfort. Quick-press controls along the stem allow users to play, pause, or skip tracks with simple, reliable inputs.</p>
<h2 data-start="1191" data-end="1822">Improved Sound, In and Out</h2>
<p data-start="1824" data-end="2402">Under the hood, the AirPods 4 benefit from Apple’s H2 chip, which plays a major role in improving both call quality and audio performance. During phone calls or video chats, the chip enables advanced voice isolation that filters out background noise. This makes voices sound clearer and more natural, even in crowded or noisy environments. On the listening side, the H2 chip supports a new acoustic architecture that enhances overall sound quality. High frequencies come through with greater clarity, while bass feels deeper and more controlled compared to previous generations.</p>


<p data-start="2404" data-end="2697">The AirPods 4 also introduce new ways to interact with Siri. In addition to voice commands, users can now respond to certain prompts using simple head gestures, such as nodding or shaking their head. It’s a subtle feature, but it adds a layer of convenience when speaking out loud isn’t ideal.</p>
<p data-start="2699" data-end="3029">One of the most practical upgrades appears in the charging case. Apple has moved away from its proprietary Lightning connector in favor of USB-C. This change simplifies charging by allowing the same cable to be used across a wider range of devices, reducing clutter and making the AirPods easier to integrate into existing setups.</p>
<p data-start="2699" data-end="3029">With improved comfort, clearer calls, better sound, and a more convenient charging standard, the AirPods 4 offer a well-rounded experience. And now at as little as $100, they are hard to pass up.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Speedball Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/04/speedball-review/</link>
            <guid>1425013</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>There was a time, in a bygone era full of hope and positivity known as the early ‘90s, when Speedball 2: Brutal Deluxe was unprecedented champion of all sport video games. Sure, that title reign only lasted until 1992 when Sensible Soccer became the darling of the school playground, but it was long enough for Speedball 2 to become a classic of its fledging genre. Now, some 35 years later, Rebellion are attempting to put this aged champ on top with a series reboot, snappily titled <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/speedball">Speedball</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Speedball - Console Launch Trailer | Xbox X/S, PlayStation 5 &amp; PC" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ExuLkHNFNlg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>From the start, let me just say that Speedball plays a darn good game of Speedball. Don’t let the snazzy 3D visuals fool you, Rebellion’s version is as fast and furious as you remember the original games being, maybe even more so. Speedball is a 6 v 6 ultraviolet conglomeration of American Football, Rugby and the 1975 cult classic film, Rollerball. Played from a top-down perspective, each enclosed arena is filled with traps to navigate – flamethrower turrets, spike pillars, explosives and more. It can get pretty hectic with players flinging the metal ball from teammate to teammate before beating the opposing goalie and lobbing the blood-soaked orb into the goal. Rules are minimal, players can tackle each other as much as they like. Heck, you even get points for injuring the opposing team, meaning you don’t even need to win with goals, just violence.</p>


<p>The players themselves are delightfully athletic, each capable of wall-running in that Assassin’s Creed style, flipping over obstacles, and leaping high above enemy tackles. Controls are incredibly responsive, so after just a short time you’ll be flipping over traps, before running along a wall, leaping from its surface, rolling back to your feet and finally launching into an offensive tackle with the best of them. In fact, Speedball goes out of its way to make you look good whilst playing it, even if you’re a new player that’s not entirely sure what’s actually going on. Thanks to a rather good tutorial though, you won’t be confused for long, as each element of the game is explored, from the opening whistle to the gore-splatted finale.</p>


<p>I say gore-splattered, because this sports game can get very nasty, particularly when you take into account Rebellion’s genius addition to the traditional Speedball formula, jet packs. Each player essentially has a rocket fuelled missile strapped to their back, allowing them to blast across the arena like a distinctly non-child friendly version of Buzz Lightyear who’s decided to flatten you. These super tackles add a satisfying element of risk and reward to the gameplay, you can dash across the entire arena to take out another player, but you can just as easily send yourself splatting headfirst into a wall. The crowd will love it either way, and so will you.</p>
<p>In terms of team selection, this is a who’s who of beloved players from the original games. Though this time every single team has a distinctive look and unique abilities. The highlight for me? As a devoted 2000AD fan the option of fielding a team of Mega-City One Judges was totally zarjaz. Also, does this mean that Speedball is definitively part of the Dreddverse? I certainly hope so!</p>

<p>Accessible and enjoyable with very little practice, Speedball is ideally suited for local play, with newbies soon able to provide a threat to even experienced Speedballers. With games over in a dinky five minutes, this is perfect pick up and play fodder. Outside of local play however, Speedball isn’t nearly as sure footed. The singe player league mode lacks in depth. Sure, you can hire new players, and ongoing injuries need to be accounted for, but otherwise this is just playing eighteen matches in a row by any other name. It’s basic, formulaic, and is lacking in imagination, failing to keep things fresh and surprising for the player</p>

<p>The same is true of the online mode. Online games play smoothly enough, though a lot of the fun is lost due to lacking the comradery of a couch session. You can set up a league between friends, but it’s all rather basic. An online global league mode, with brackets and winners each season and unique in-game prizes would certainly be a welcome addition, but that relies on having a large enough playerbase. Otherwise this is just a series of exhibition matches and little else.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> delivered more of what its passionate fans wanted, and for the most part, its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4-2026-roadmap-revealed">substantial 2026 roadmap</a> looks promising, but what about that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> port that was <a href="https://www.techradar.com/gaming/uh-oh-borderlands-4-is-delayed-indefinitely-on-switch-2-just-a-week-and-a-half-away-from-its-october-3-release">pushed aside at the last minute</a>?</p>
<p>Well, considering the performance issues plaguing the game (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/take-two-blames-borderlands-4s-softer-than-expected-sales-on-troublesome-pc-release-gearbox-boss-randy-pitchford-insisted-was-pretty-damn-optimal">especially the PC version</a>) at launch and how heavy to run it continues to be, we weren't super optimistic about it coming out and <em>also </em>being stable enough. Mind you, the Switch 2 has been running <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-is-still-excellent-on-xbox-and-switch-2-even-if-its-beginning-to-show-its-age">some genuinely impressive third-party ports</a> so far, but Borderlands 4 always felt like a tricky one to pull off.</p>
<p>Via <a href="https://variety.com/2026/gaming/news/borderlands-4-switch-release-paused-take-two-ceo-gta-online-1236651227/">Variety</a>, we're now learning Take-Two and Gearbox have "made the difficult decision to pause development" on the troubled port. Note how the exact word used here is "paused" and not "cancelled" (publishers aren't afraid of throwing the latter one around), but if you ask us, we're thinking it may never come out. In any case, a final decision hasn't been made. It appears that, right now, the focus is on "delivering quality post-launch content for players" and fixing what's broken on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S.</p>
<p>Maybe that ongoing effort will reveal the answers needed to find a viable path forward for the Switch 2 port, but as it stands, Nintendo players are better off playing through <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/the-first-20-minutes-of-borderlands-2-gameplay-on-nintendo-switch">that excellent collection of the first few games for Switch 1</a> and the surprisingly decent <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/borderlands-3">Borderlands 3</a> port, which also runs steadier on Switch 2.</p><p>Take-Two spokesperson Alan Lewis also told Variety that, regardless of what happens with Borderlands 4, the plan is to continue to collaborate with Nintendo. Up next, the company is looking to release <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pga-tour-2k25-review">PGA Tour 2K25</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/wwe-2k26">WWE 2K26</a> on Switch 2.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Yesterday, <strong>Epic</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-store-saw-record-setting-third-party-sales-growth-in-2025-reaches-317m-pc-users/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published the <strong>Epic Games Store</strong> year-in-review post</a>, revealing new records for sales of third-party games (<strong>+57% over last year</strong>), total PC users (<strong>over 317 million</strong>), and monthly active users (MAUs; <strong>78 million in December 2025</strong>, when <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-free-add-your-epic-games-store-library-through-december-18/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the giveaway of Hogwarts Legacy</a> added around six million users). That said, while playtime spent with third-party games <strong>increased by 4%</strong>, total engagement across all Epic Games Store titles <strong>dropped by 14%</strong>, signaling a decrease in first-party engagement of games like <strong>Fortnite</strong> and <strong>Rocket League</strong>.</p>



<p>Website GamesIndustry.biz <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/were-not-going-to-topple-steam-epic-games-store-head-steve-allison-heralds-the-path-of-co-existence" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was able to interview Epic Games Store General Manager Steve Allison</a>, who admitted that the goal is not (and perhaps never was) to topple <strong>Valve's Steam</strong> platform, which remains the market leader on PC:</p>



<p><em>Steam is a huge part of the PC ecosystem. It's not going away. We're not going to topple Steam.</em></p>



<p>During the interview, Allison <strong>acknowledged the criticism the store regularly gets from PC gamers when compared to Steam itself</strong>. He also revealed that Epic decided to completely remake the Epic Games Launcher in October 2025; the new version, which should finally let users see their libraries load almost instantly, is expected to be released in May or June.</p>



<p><em>We get so much criticism. I hate reading it, but I also appreciate it. It's not untrue. We were building incredibly rapidly on top of a foundation that was originally designed just to support Fortnite and Paragon, and we've continued to build on a house of cards. [The Launcher] is really slow. It's built on this old framework… and we've poked at it and optimized it, and I think we've done the best that we could with that. So we decided in October last year to rip the whole foundation down and rebuild it.</em></p>



<p>When it comes to the future growth of the Epic Games Store, Allison points <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-store-launches-on-mobile-fortnite-once-again-available-on-ios-in-europe-after-1-billion-fight/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to the mobile versions that launched in August 2024</a>, but also reckons there's a lot of room for improvement on PC:</p>



<p><em>Mobile will be a big vector of growth, but like I said, I think we have room to get to a hundred million MAU on PC over the next four years, and I think we have a lot of room to get to 20–30% spend share. So you'll see us being pretty aggressive on our spend share on PC.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Amazon Fallout TV countdown <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/locked-fallout-tv-show-countdown-timer-coincides-with-season-2-finale-but-fans-are-hoping-it-also-signals-a-fallout-3-or-new-vegas-remaster-shadowdrop">that some had hoped would announce a Fallout 3 or Fallout: New Vegas remaster</a> turned out to be nothing more than another behind-the-scenes look at the show.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this month, a countdown appeared on the official Amazon <a href="https://fallout-s2.amazonstudios.com/#main" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>website</u></a> designed to look like a Fallout map. On it are locations in the Fallout map style which, when accessed, lead you to behind-the-scenes information on the show. For example, The Vault 33 outer door, from which Lucy first steps foot into the wasteland, is on the south of the map. The Caswennan, the airship that serves as a soaring fortress for the Brotherhood of Steel, is to the east. And, ahead of the debut of the Fallout Season 2 finale, in the top right was a locked point of interest alongside a timer pointing to February 4.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/04/fallout-main-1767786059781-1770198248593.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Amazon's website had a locked node with a countdown pointing to the end of Season 2. Image credit: Amazon Prime Video.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That got some fans’ hopes up that the countdown was leading to the reveal of the heavily rumored Fallout 3 Remastered, or the equally heavily rumored Fallout: New Vegas Remastered. It turned out to be neither. Instead, it’s yet another interactive node, this time for ‘The Penthouse’ at the top of the Lucky 38 casino, the lair of antagonist Mr. House.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/04/screenshot-2026-02-04-093255-1770197610415.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Amazon's interactive Fallout website is updated to unlock the countdown. Image credit: Amazon Prime Video.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Once the private domain of Mr. House, it overlooks the Strip with a commanding view of New Vegas, equal parts luxury suite and control center,” reads the official description. “Step back in time to this intersection of decadence and authority!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Clicking through leads you to a 3D interactive representation of the Penthouse, which includes a short video interview with Mr. House actor Justin Theroux about the genuinely impressive set, photos of the Strip, and even a creature gallery. This is all great if you’re after some extra Fallout information, but not the best if you’d hoped for a new Fallout game. In truth, some had suspected this would be the case. At best, some had said, it would contain a tease for Season 3 of the show.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/04/screenshot-2026-02-04-092438-1770197530256.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Sorry, no Fallout remaster announcement today.

The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fallout-3-remaster"><u>Fallout 3 remaster</u></a> that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/oblivion-remaster-fallout-3-remaster-and-more-leaked-from-microsoft-document"><u>leaked back in 2023</u></a> is still in the works, and is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-3-remaster-still-on-the-way-report-claims">expected to be a similar effort to last year’s The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a>. Then there’s Fallout: New Vegas Remastered, which is also reportedly still on the way, although we don’t have any indication when either game will release.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesda-chief-todd-howard-says-fallout-is-the-franchise-that-were-doing-the-most-in-right-now-coy-on-potential-return-to-new-vegas-or-a-fallout-3-remaster-while-fans-wait-for-fallout-5">a recent interview with IGN</a>, we asked Bethesda development chief Todd Howard if the success of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered, which has seen over 4 million players since it shadowdropped last year, was a repeatable trick for a Fallout 3 Remastered. Howard kept his cards close to his chest, and reiterated a point he’s been making a lot in interviews lately.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I will just say that the Oblivion Remaster, we're really, really pleased with how well it did, it was a very long project too, and not just in how it was received, the ability to shadowdrop it, and the response to doing that,” he said. “I like to do that with games as much as possible. I love the moment that you find out about a game.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The last mainline single-player Fallout game was Fallout 4, which came out in 2015 and recently saw the release of its Anniversary Edition. The multiplayer focused Fallout 76 followed in 2018, and while fans slowly flocked to the West Virginia-set open-world RPG, it wasn’t until the premiere of Prime Video’s Fallout TV show that the Bethesda series leveled up in terms of attention.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As well as remasters, we know Bethesda wants to eventually get to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fallout-5"><u>Fallout 5</u></a>, albeit after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-vi"><u>The Elder Scrolls 6</u></a>.

"In short, yes," Howard told <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cvgr488vlmmo" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BBC Newsbeat</a>. "Fallout 5 will be existing in a world where the stories and events of the show happened or are happening.

But if you're not keen on splashing out on the <strong>$66.99 / $99.99</strong> replica or its cheaper cardboard equivalent, then you <em>might</em> be in luck.</p>
<p>If you happen to have a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/nintendo_labo_toy-con_04_vr_kit">Labo VR</a> kit lying around gathering dust, then you'll want to dig it out in the coming days. According to <a href="https://gamesbeat.com/nintendos-virtual-boy-classics-will-be-playable-on-labo-vr-headsets/">GamesBeat</a>, a Nintendo Treehouse staff member has confirmed that the cardboard peripheral will be compatible with Virtual Boy on NSO.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067tzvpoy&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>Now just to be absolutely sure, we've reached out directly to Nintendo and will update this article once we get confirmation. But honestly, it kind of makes sense that Labo VR would be compatible, and hopefully this will make the prospect of playing Virtual Boy a little easier for current owners.</p>
<p>Released in 2019, the VR headset could be used with big-hitters like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_smash_bros_ultimate">Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a>. Nintendo has not opted to utilise it in recent years, but the cardboard variant of the Virtual Boy headset has definitely taken some inspiration. It will launch alongside the full-fat replica for a more affordable <strong>£16.99 / $24.99</strong>.</p>
<p>Obviously, if you plan on using your Labo VR kit, then you'll need to consider that the Switch 2 simply won't fit inside the peripheral. So you'll need to stick with the OG Switch, but Virtual Boy will thankfully be compatible with both systems.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Generative AI has played "zero part" in Rockstar Games' creation of GTA 6, Take-Two CEOman Strauss Zelnick has said at the company's latest financial numbers get-together, where he also indicated the game's still on to initially release this November. Well, on consoles at least. Though, back in the AI front, the Z bloke also revealed that Take-Two have "hundreds of pilots and implementations" on the go involving the tech.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"On the topic of AI, I've been enthusiastic since the very beginning," Zelnick told RPS' ironed dress shirt-wearing corporate acquaintances at <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/strauss-zelnick-generative-ai-has-zero-part-in-what-rockstar-games-is-building-with-gta-6">GamesIndustry.biz</a> in a chat around Take-Two's latest earnings call. "This company's products have always been built with machine learning and artificial intelligence. We've actually always been a leader in the space, and right now we have hundreds of pilots and implementations across our company, including within our studios. And we're already seeing instances where generative AI tools are driving costs and time efficiencies."</p>
<p>That said, the exec did make sure to stick to his established line on the controversial tech, emphasising that he sees it as a tool rather than some infernal magic box from which fully-formed creative projects can spew. "Do I think tools by themselves create great entertainment properties? No, there's no evidence that that's the case and it won't be the case in the future," he continued. "Specifically with regards to GTA 6, Generative AI has zero part in what Rockstar Games is building. Their worlds are handcrafted. That's what differentiates them."</p>
<p>This latest round of questions being pointed at Zelnick about AI follow Google's deployment of Project Genie, an AI prototype that lets people generate "interactive worlds" which work like playable games. Well, if by playable games you mean utterly shite clones and/or two minute glorified GIFs of a character walking around. Project Genie's rollout led the <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/numerous-video-game-company-share-prices-dropped-following-googles-project-genie-ai-rollout/">share prices of a number of game companies</a> - including Take-Two and Witcher developers CD Projekt - to drop, one would assume because plenty of shareholders and other money men are brainless fools who don't know what goes into making games.</p><p>Hence Zelnick and many of his exec kinspeople adopting positions which hedge their bets when it comes to adopting this sort of tech as a magic bean with the word' efficiency booster' written on it in crayon, if not a magic bean that does the whole job. At least GTA 6 appears to be packing none ahead of its initial arrival on November 19th.</p>
<p>Not that the game's without bubbling controversy. Legal proceedings between <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockstar-fired-unionising-gta-6-devs-following-discord-chat-about-new-company-slack-policy-claims-report">Rockstar and the developers they fired last year</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fired-gta-6-devs-suffer-setback-in-legal-fight-against-rockstar-as-uk-court-denies-request-for-interim-relief">rumble on</a>. The company have accused the fired staff of leaking info about the game, while the staff and their allies at the Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain union have accused Rockstar of union-busting.</p>

            <p>Here is a question for the septuagenarians and older in the RPS readership, assuming any of you are that venerable: if some chortling time traveller had told you back in the 50s or 60s that the perpetually sizzling terror of nuclear apocalypse would one day become a nostalgic playground for videogames with two-headed cows and dogs named Dogmeat and swaggering cowboy zombies, what kind of period-appropriate blunt implement would you have clobbered that time traveller with?
</p>
<p>While you grizzled boomers get your gums into that vexing proposition, here's the trailer for AtomTeam's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/atom-rpg-2">Atom RPG 2</a>, the floridly titled sequel to 2018's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/atom-rpg">Atom RPG</a>. It's another turn-based, top-down affair in the spirit of the original Interplay-published Fallouts, and appears rich in bunkers, action points and raging, possibly mutant bears. It's also the work of a team based across Cyprus, Ukraine and Latvia, who probably have very different ideas about the nature and duration of the Cold War than the people behind Fallout.

<p>"ATOM RPG 2 is a story-heavy tactical CRPG set in a world where the Cold War turned hot," comments <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3429280/ATOM_RPG_2/">the Steam page</a>. "Explore a living open world with vertical level design, tactical battles, and an interactive world map. Take part in numerous side activities: such as fishing, building, racing, and more, while expanding your influence and control over the land. Remember: your choices not only shape a resurrecting civilisation, but may also prevent a new apocalypse looming on the horizon... "
</p>
<p>For context, maybe read Sin's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/atom-rpg-trudograd-is-about-a-third-of-a-game-but-a-great-third">write-up of the original Atom RPG's standalone city expansion Trudograd</a>. She quite liked it, despite being unimpressed by the combat. She was more keen on the quest design and writing. An excerpt:
</p>
<blockquote>I've talked a writer into walking into a minefield. I gained a level after listening to some old women ramble on a bench. I've sucker-shot a top hatted millionaire with a crossbow, then taken a pastry of his corpse and eaten it. At one point during an interesting, text-based side mission that reminded me of the weird text adventure bits of Space Rangers 2, I failed to bluff a common guard, alerting a whole base to my presence, but subsequently bluffed his boss into surrendering the entire base without a fight.</blockquote>
<p>Developers AtomTeam are also the people behind <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2108180/Swordhaven_Iron_Conspiracy/">Swordhaven: Iron Conspiracy</a>, which as you may guess, is more <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate">Baldur's Gate</a> than Fallout, and emphasises lizards over bears.</p>
<p>Ho, rickety veterans of the Duck and Cover era! Have you decided what you're going to hit my hypothetical Tardis pilot with yet?</p>

            <p>That <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-two-prime-videos-sixth-biggest-season-of-all-time">Fallout Season 2</a> finale was quite good even if some subplots barely moved during the second set of eight episodes, I'd say. It also made many of us eager to see what comes next (especially the teased new setting). Diehard Fallout fans, however, maybe were paying more attention to the mystery countdown <a href="https://fallout-s2.amazonstudios.com/#main">on the show's interactive map site</a>.</p>
<p>Alas, we got no news on those <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-3-and-new-vegas-crossover-mod-not-getting-remastered">long-rumoured Fallout 3 and New Vegas remasters</a>, which are reportedly a ways off at the time of writing, but Amazon and Bethesda's parting gift is cool nonetheless. It may even be a cheeky unofficial tease of things to come if you're very high on copium, like me.</p>
<p>The final icon on the top right part of the map was revealed to be <a href="https://fallout-s2.amazonstudios.com/#/penthouse">Mr. House's penthouse</a> at the top of New Vegas' iconic tower. Unless we're missing something, no Easter eggs related to the potential remasters are to be found, though we're sure the most dedicated fans are on the case as I type this.</p>
<p>Instead, it's more of a cool interactive extra for fans of both the show and the 2010 RPG; a 3D model of the well-known location as seen in the show (it's packing some upgrades and new secrets). Those who are familiar with the game will instantly notice this 3D render feels shinier and more detailed (and not live-action at all). I wouldn't go as far as to say this is an in-progress chunk from the rumoured remaster (remake?) for obvious reasons, but it could give us a solid idea of how a touched-up New Vegas may feel like.</p>

<p>In any case, it's fun to see a big show's marketing returning to the early Internet days, where new movies and TV series were constantly promoted with neat interactive sites (and even flash games) on top of the more traditional promotional materials. If you find something else in this room, ping us, but we're just enjoying the vistas as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-2-future-of-the-games">we think about the show and game series' future</a>.</p>
<p>For now, it's been confirmed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-three-filming-starts-sooner-than-expected">Season 3 starts shooting soon-ish</a>, plus <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> owners can look forward to a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesda-announces-fallout-4-anniversary-edition-confirms-nintendo-switch-2-version-for-2026">port of Fallout 4</a> that should arrive in the near future.</p>

            <p>Rockstar's highly-anticipated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> will not feature any Generative AI.</p>
<p>That's coming from Take-Two head Strauss Zelnick, who assured the GTA community that the controversial tech has "zero part in what Rockstar is building".</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>Zelnick was talking with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/strauss-zelnick-generative-ai-has-zero-part-in-what-rockstar-games-is-building-with-gta-6">Eurogamer's sister site gamesindustry.biz</a> ahead of Take-Two's Q3 financial results, when the topic of AI came up. The company head said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/artificial-intelligence-is-an-oxymoron-theres-no-such-thing-says-take-two-boss">he has "been enthusiastic" about AI from the beginning</a>, and Take-Two's "products have always been built with machine learning and artificial intelligence".</p>
<p>Zelnick called Take-Two a "leader in the space", with the company currently having "hundreds of pilots and implementations" across the board, and that includes "within our studios". He added the company has seen instances where generative AI tools are "driving costs and time efficiencies", though he does not believe these tools in isolation can "create great entertainment properties". </p>
<p>This is when the conversation turned to Rockstar and GTA 6, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-fans-in-disarray-as-release-date-clock-reset-following-gta6-release-day-delay">which is expected to debut on 19th November</a> (a date Zelnick remains confident about).</p>
<p>"Specifically with regards to GTA 6, Generative AI has zero part in what <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/rockstar-games">Rockstar Games</a> is building," Zelnick said, adding the studio's "worlds are handcrafted" and that is what sets it apart from other studios.</p>
<p>"They're built from the ground up, building by building, street by street, neighbourhood by neighbourhood. They're not procedurally generated, they shouldn't be," Zelnick stated. "That's what makes great entertainment."</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>Zelnick's words come soon after Take-Two saw its stock price plunge to an 11-month-low after Google rolled out Project Genie 3, an AI tool which allows users to generate virtual worlds in 60-second bursts from text prompts.</p>
<p>As Vikki reported at the weekend, several companies in addition to Take-Two - including CD Projekt, Unity and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/roblox">Roblox</a> - saw between 8-20 percent wiped off the value of their companies as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/game-companies-see-share-prices-plummet-following-the-launch-of-googles-very-limited-virtual-world-generator-project-genie">spooked investors seemingly went into the weekend thinking tech like this could replace the game development process</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://variety.com/2026/gaming/news/borderlands-4-switch-release-paused-take-two-ceo-gta-online-1236651227/">In a recent interview with Variety</a>, Zelnick was asked to comment on previous reporting from <a href="https://www.ppe.pl/news/397290/gta-6-a-wersja-pudelkowa-sprzedawcy-zwiastuja-smutna-wiadomosc-dla-fanow-fizycznych-wydan.html">PPE</a> which stated that, according to a source, the highly-anticipated release would come out without physical copies in an attempt to curb spoilers from folks obtaining these copies early.</p>
<p>Zelnick responded to Variety: "That's not the plan" - a brief but sharp rebuttal of the prior reporting. So if you're keen on getting your actual hands on a copy of GTA6 day one, you should be in luck.</p>

            <guid>1424947</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong> version of <strong>Borderlands 4</strong> has been officially <strong>canceled</strong>. The news was shared yesterday, when <strong>Take-Two Interactive</strong> deleted the game from its updated list of upcoming releases found in its latest quarterly report. <strong>Alan Lewis</strong>, a spokesperson for Take-Two, shared the following statement <a href="https://variety.com/2026/gaming/news/borderlands-4-switch-release-paused-take-two-ceo-gta-online-1236651227/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with Variety</a>:</p>



<p><em>We made the difficult decision to pause development on that SKU. Our focus continues to be delivering quality post-launch content for players on the ongoing improvements to optimize the game. We’re continuing to collaborate closely with our friends at Nintendo. We have ‘PGA Tour 2K25’ and ‘WWE 2K26’ coming out for Nintendo Switch 2, and we’re incredibly excited about bringing more of our titles to that platform in the future.</em></p>



<p>The game <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-nintendo-switch-2-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was supposed to launch in October for Nintendo's new console</a>, just around a month after the PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X launches, but <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-nintendo-switch-2-delayed-pre-orders-cancelled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it was delayed in late September</a> with no further date in sight.</p>



<p>However, in May, <strong>Gearbox</strong> founder <strong>Randy Pitchford</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-is-very-powerful-is-perfect-for-borderlands-4-says-randy-pitchford/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">waxed praise on the Nintendo Switch 2</a>, <strong>calling it a perfect fit for Borderlands 4</strong>:</p>



<p><em>To have Nintendo Switch 2 in hand while we're making Borderlands 4 for Nintendo Switch 2 is really exciting. Usually, we'll have to port a game to a platform, but in this case, we're making Borderlands 4 for the Nintendo Switch 2. And I think that when you play Borderlands 4 on Nintendo Switch 2, you'll realize that with the cooperative experience and how we can use the Nintendo Switch 2 platform to connect with friends, share our game with friends, it's pretty astonishing how perfect this platform is for Borderlands 4.</em></p>



<p><em>The Switch 2 has been a joy to work with. It's very powerful. It's an incredible machine in a very tight form factor, and we love being on the bleeding edge with our graphics and the experience that we're creating. And the Nintendo Switch 2 makes all that possible. We don't feel like we're fighting the system.

		<p>AMD, the makers of the System-on-a-Chip (SoC) technology that powers the current Xbox and PlayStation consoles, have rather casually revealed that the next Xbox could be released as early as next year.</p>
<p>The information was revealed during the company’s Q4 2025 earnings call when AMD CEO Dr. Lisa Su said “Development of&nbsp;Microsoft’s next-gen Xbox featuring an AMD semi-custom SoC is progressing well to support a launch in 2027.”</p>


<p>It is important to note that the good Doctor only said they could support <em>“a”</em> launch rather than <em>“the”</em> launch, but other leaks have suggested that Microsoft are aiming for next year,&nbsp; one would assume sometime near Christmas as usual.</p>
<p>What form the next Xbox will take is the subject of intense speculation. While they are clearly talking to AMD about some powerful hardware, documents revealed during the FTC trial when Microsoft purchased Activision revealed that they were aiming for a “hybrid console”.&nbsp; This could suggest a move towards streaming games that run off powerful server farms rather than having a top-range console at home.&nbsp; There are also concerns over the huge price increases in RAM and GPUs, a high-powered next Xbox could be very expensive, whereas a streaming machine would require less under the hood and would boost sales of Xbox Games Pass.</p>
<p>The idea of Microsoft even making a new console could raise a few eyebrows, it is fair to say they have been absolutely thrashed by PlayStation and Nintendo this generation. Console sales, meagre as they are, have had a 32% decline year-on-year. While never specifically stated, the low sales of Xbox consoles are clearly a contributing factor to Microsoft’s decision to start releasing its exclusive franchises, such as <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/22/forza-horizon-6-launch-confirmed-for-may-coming-first-to-xbox-and-pc-and-later-to-ps5/">Forza</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/22/fable-is-coming-to-xbox-series-xs-ps5-and-pc-this-autumn-and-its-looking-great/">Fable,</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/24/halo-campaign-evolved-announced-for-pc-xbox-series-xs-and-ps5/">Halo,</a> on PlayStation.</p>

<p>Xbox, and indeed PlayStation,&nbsp; also have the same issue as other tech manufacturers, such as Apple, in that it is much harder for customers to perceive any major changes between generations. It seems obvious that the next-gen consoles will run at 4K with decent frame rates, but apart from looking a bit prettier, there’s not much they can add. We already have SDD drives for fast loading, haptic feedback, and Dolby 3D Audio, and it’s not like the console manufacturers can do something snazzy like making the console fold in half like a phone.</p>
<p>Which brings us back to the idea of a hybrid console. Could the next Xbox be a portable device with a dock for playing at home? Microsoft have certainly <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/rog-xbox-ally-x/">been exploring that area</a> and it would keep costs down, boost sales of Game Pass, and give them a much-needed selling point to attract customers.</p>
