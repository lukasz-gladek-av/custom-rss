            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/everything-announced-at-adepticon-2025-preview-event<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Games Workshop recently held its AdeptiCon 2025 Preview event. During this event, the UK-based tabletop studio announced new products coming <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-40000" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Warhammer 40,000</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-age-of-sigmar" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Warhammer Age of Sigmar</em></a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/warhammer-old-world-core-boxes-announced" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Warhammer The Old World</em></a>. Here is everything they announced.</p>

<h2>The AdeptiCon 2025 Preview Event Announcements</h2>

<p>In an official <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/or72z0uw/every-reveal-from-the-warhammer-preview-show-at-adepticon-2025/" rel="nofollow">Warhammer-Community post</a>, Games Workshop assembled everything announced during the AdeptiCon 2025 preview event. Those announcements covered both major tentpole franchises and various spin-offs.</p>

Yes, the Space Wolves are getting new miniatures, a dedicated army box, and their own codex. These new miniatures include new Wolf Guard units and the Blood Claws.</p>

<p>For those that have rejected Imperium dogma, the preview included a new look at several Chaos Space Marine chapters. Like the Emperor's Children, the World Eaters, Death Guard, and Thousand Sons are getting their own dedicated codices. More blood for the Blood God.</p>

<p>On the gameplay side of things, the AdeptiCon 2025 Preview event highlighted a new Chapter Approved Mission Deck. This deck will change Matched Play by introducing three new ways to play: Incursion (1000 points), Strike Force (2,000 points) and the new Asymmetrical War mode. As the name implies, Asymmetrical War features uneven deployment zones and differing primary objectives.</p>

The Typhon box ramps up the battle on Volkus, where the Adeptus Mechanicus must fend off a swarm of Tyranids. Yes, playable Tyranids are coming to Kill Team. The box even includes Tyranid-themed terrain.</p>

<p>In the land of the Mortal Realms, the AdeptiCon 2025 Preview event confirmed a new <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/warhammer-age-of-sigmar-spearhead-mode-introduced" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Warhammer Age of Sigmar Spearhead</a> set. The set, Spearhead: Sand and Bone, brings the smaller, more streamlined Spearhead rules to the dark lands of Dolorum and the chilling deserts of Ossia. The set includes new twists, Battle Tactics, Objectives, rules for four new Spearhead armies, and terrain fitting a Realm of Death.</p>

<p>Those new Spearhead armies are the Cities of Sigmar's Fusil-Platoon, the Serephon Sunblood Prowlers, the Ossiarch Bonereapers Mortisan Elite, and the Ogor Mawtribes Scrapglutt.</p>

First is the introduction of the Grand Cathay army for the forces of Order. This East Asia-coded army will be getting an arcane journal and battalion box with 50 miniatures. Those miniatures will include 30 Jade Warriors, 10 Jade Lancers, two different artillery units, and the battalion's leader: A Shugengan Lord astride their Great Spirit Longma mount.</p>

<p>The preview extends into the forests of the old world. On the side of chaos are the forest-dwelling, corruption-spreading Beastmen Brayherds. They will be receiving an arcane journal and battlion box of their own. Their units include ferocious shamans, chieftains, Tuskgor Chariots. Challenging them on the side of Order are the Wood Elf Realms wit their own battalion box respectively.</p>

<p>This preview is but a glimpse of announcements and developments coming to Games Workshop's franchises in the future. Release dates and price points for these announced products are all pending.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-is-paving-the-way-for-the-switch-2.1147014/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/637597/nintendo-virtual-game-cards-switch-2<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><div><p>The biggest news at <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/636750/nintendo-switch-march-2025-direct">Nintendo’s March Direct showcase</a> was a software update. Mixed in amongst <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/630255/metroid-prime-4-nintendo-switch-trailer">a trailer for <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/637319/nintendo-today-news-app">the surprise reveal of a mobile news app</a>, the company also announced what it calls “<a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/637307/nintendo-switch-virtual-game-card-lending-system">virtual game cards</a>.” They’re billed as a lending system that makes it relatively straightforward to share digital games between devices. But really, they’re a tool that could make the transition to the Switch 2 later this year much easier.</p></div><p>As Nintendo explains it, these virtual cards work a lot like physical cartridges. You can “eject” a game from one device and then load it onto another, so long as the second Switch is tied to your account or a member of your family plan. Digital games “can also be lent to a Nintendo Account family group member’s system via local wireless connection,” and they’ll be able to play the game for two weeks before it’s automatically returned to you.</p><p>It’s an extremely Nintendo feature, in that it’s a playful attempt at bringing traditional physical game features into the digital realm, and that it also has some caveats, like the limited two week period, which is nowhere near enough time to make a dent in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23718926/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Tears of the Kingdom</em></a>. Still, it seems to be a step up from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/wiki/gamesharing/">the way sharing currently works</a>, where a secondary Switch can only play games if it’s connected to the internet to verify things, rendering it largely useless while traveling. <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fgaming-systems%2Fvirtual-game-cards%2F" rel="sponsored">Nintendo specifies in the fine print</a> that “once a virtual game card is loaded to a system, not only can you play it without an internet connection, but other user accounts on the system can play, too.”</p><p>More interesting than the feature itself is the timing. It’ll be available as part of a system update for the Switch at some point in April. Also happening in April? <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/606504/nintendo-switch-2-direct-new-time">The big Nintendo Direct where the company will reveal actual details of the Switch 2</a>, presumably including the price, release date, and line-up of launch games. Expectations are it won’t be much longer after that before the Switch 2 finally launches.</p><div><p>Sorting out the sharing features is good news for current Switch owners. But because it’s happening at the end of that console’s lifecycle, it’s pretty clear Nintendo means for this to be a hopefully painless way of moving to the Switch 2. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24343666/nintendo-switch-2-cartridge-backwards-compatibility">The next console will be backward compatible with original Switch games</a>, and that library is incredibly important. Not only is it huge, but it’s filled with some of Nintendo’s most successful games ever, like <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/2/14787082/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review">Breath of the Wild</a></em>, <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/19/22339896/animal-crossing-new-horizons-review-one-year-nintendo-switch">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a></em>, <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/21/15382628/mario-kart-8-deluxe-nintendo-switch-best-features">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a></em>, and <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/26/16552118/super-mario-odyssey-review-nintendo-switch">Super Mario Odyssey</a></em>.</p></div><p>And it’s a library that keeps growing: there are still major Switch 1 games in the works for this year, like <em>Metroid</em> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/637256/pokemon-legends-z-a-trailer-day-night-cycle"><em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em></a>, while the just-announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/637362/to"><em>Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</em></a> doesn’t even launch until 2026. In the press release announcing the virtual game cards, Nintendo made sure to note that they “will also work with Nintendo Switch 2 systems at launch.”</p><p>Nintendo has always had a complicated relationship with the internet and user accounts (see: Friend Codes). But the new virtual card system at least makes it clear that the company sees the importance of creating a more unified system for users to play things across devices. Because whenever the Switch 2 does launch later this year, there’s going to be a whole lot more people with multiple consoles in their homes.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[Ubisoft Employees Worried About Layoffs After Tencent Deal]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-employees-worried-about-layoffs-after-tencent-deal/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ubisoft-employees-worried-about-layoffs-after-tencent-deal.1147008/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-employees-worried-about-layoffs-after-tencent-deal/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>On Thursday afternoon, Ubisoft announced that it was forming a new subsidiary company with Tencent that will include the company’s three biggest franchises along with a number of studios. This has led to a number of employees within Ubisoft to become worried about mass layoffs happening in the coming months either before or after the deal with Tencent is completed.</p>



<p>Not long after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-is-forming-a-new-subsidiary-with-tencent-valued-at-4-3-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the deal was announced</a>, multiple current Ubisoft employees reached out to express feelings of uneasiness and concern about the future of the company. Specifically, those not working on Assassin’s Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six.</p>



<p>In an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-tencent-internal-memo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">internal email acquired</a> by Insider Gaming, Ubisoft’s Marie-Sophie de Waubert said that she understands that there is uncertainty and questions surrounding what’s going to happen. She also tried to calm any worries about those not working on the three franchises.</p>



<p>“I also want to be clear: if you’re not currently working on these brands, it doesn’t mean your work matters any less,” she said. “This agreement will benefit all of Ubisoft, giving us the means to spark more innovation and creativity across the board. This marks the beginning of a new chapter, and you play a vital role in shaping it.”</p>



<p>Despite the messaging, however, some aren’t buying it.</p>



<p>“We feel [expletive] if we’re not on the big three,” one current Ubisoft employee said under the condition of anonymity. “They can say these things in an email, but when it comes down to it, we feel like we know where priorities are.”</p>



<p>Said another employee currently working on an unannounced project, “I want to think our team is okay right now, but we don’t know. You’d think they’d have at least some sort of clarity for us before publicly announcing the deal.”</p>



<p>The other messages received all relayed similar sentiments. There is some excitement and hope that a turnaround is coming for the company, but until questions about their status are answered, those in various areas of the company don’t want to get happy.</p>



<p>“We just want to know what’s going on,” one source said. “They promised transparency and regular communication with us, but we’ll see if that actually happens.”</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Ubisoft regarding what the deal with Tencent means for its employees and the possibility of layoffs. Should a response be received, it will be added to the article.</p>



<p>Ubisoft anticipates the full deal to be completed before the end of 2025.</p>



<p>What do you think the future holds for employees at Ubisoft? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/1775/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

<p>The product has evolved into something akin to Slack, but for personal use. It's used by artist communities, game developers, open source projects, influencers, and more to manage communities and coordinate work. In some cases, people simply use it as an extremely robust group messaging tool for groups of friends without any games or projects involved.</p>
<h2>Limited ads to tackle limited revenue</h2>
<p>For years, Discord proudly touted a "no ads" policy, but that dam has broken in some small ways in recent months. Discord began offering game publishers opportunities to create special "quests" that appear in the Discord interface, wherein players can earn in-game rewards for doing specific tasks, like streaming a game to friends. A new format, called video quests, is planned for this summer, too.</p>
<p>The new ad products are meant to drum up Discord's revenue potential in the lead-up to an IPO; the platform already offered premium subscriptions for access to more advanced features and a marketplace for cosmetics to jazz up profiles.</p>
<p>So far, the ad products are, by and large, much less intrusive than ads in many other social networks and seem to be oriented around providing some user value. However, an IPO could lead to shareholders demanding more from the company in pursuit of revenue.</p>

Now, with the show set to adapt that story when The Last of Us Season 2 premieres on HBO in a few weeks, there's a risk a whole new audience will have their experience altered by the prevalence of spoilers online. But for showrunners Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann, the latter of whom is now living through this predicament for a second time, spoilers aren't a huge concern.</p><p dir="ltr">"I feel like the best way I could respect the audience is by not thinking about them too much when I'm working on whatever I'm writing. That way I could just make the best decision with as little outside influence as possible, and make the best internal decisions for the characters, for the story, for the medium," Druckmann told GameSpot. "And you know, when it comes to like, what are we going to spoil or not spoil? You know, I fought tooth-and-nail when we made the game, and that all blew up in my face at the end, when we had those leaks that happened like months before the game came out. So I've learned to not put so much stock in that. But also, now I have a creative partner, HBO. I kind of follow their lead here as far as spoilers and what we should show and not show and just, you know, again, approach it as if we're doing it for the first time, assuming the audience doesn't know anything. They're not Googling what happened in the game or not."</p><p dir="ltr">Even with spoilers floating around for those who can't resist looking for them, the second season, like the first season, changes some details in order to ensure the team is "making the best choices for this moment in time," as a TV audience has different needs than a video game player.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4466722-bella-ramsey.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4466722" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1584" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4466722-bella-ramsey.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4466722"></a><figcaption>The Last of Us Season 2 premieres on April 13 on HBO and Max.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4466722-bella-ramsey.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"But also, again, my approach with the show is, I assume you know nothing," he continued. "I assume you haven't played the game. I guess there's some assumption you've watched the first season, but even that, we're not 100% sure, so HBO created this beautiful recap of Season 1."</p><p dir="ltr">I asked the pair if the production team created any content meant as spoiler disinformation, like when creators for Lost or Game of Thrones would film scenes they had no plans to use just to fill the spoiler forums with disorienting noise--a practice that horrifies Mazin.</p><p dir="ltr">"The thing is, it's really hard to make the show. We use every second of every day to make the stuff we want to make," he said. "The thought of spending time shooting stuff we don't want to make is sort of a horrifying prospect to me. And I think Neil's right. The thing about spoiler stuff is it's kind of overrated; the impact that it has is overrated. And you can look at that just empirically with The Last of Us Part II, which had the leaks. There was all this spoiler outrage, and then the games sold gazillions of copies and won every award you can win, and it was beautiful. It didn't matter the spoiler. Like, I always use the example of Titanic, although, honestly, I could use Chernobyl, too. 'Hey, here's a spoiler. It blew up, right?' [The] Titanic sinks, and we all still went to the theater to watch it because we don't care about that. We care about the relationships."</p><p dir="ltr">The Last of Us Season 2 premieres on HBO and Max beginning on April 13 and will run for seven episodes on a weekly release schedule. The season won't cover all of The Last of Us Part II's story, and a third season is planned, though not yet officially announced.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The capitalization of "Edition" in that phrase is what's interesting--while Nintendo has mentioned that the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-nintendo-switch-2-games/2900-6128/" data-ref-id="2900-6128">Switch 2</a> will be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/is-the-nintendo-switch-2-backwards-compatible/1100-6527615/" data-ref-id="1100-6527615">backward-compatible</a> with select Switch 1 games, the company hasn't elaborated further on how that will work. This new phrase, and the way it's presented on this official Nintendo website, implies that it is an official term to distinguish between Switch 2-only games and Switch 2 versions of other games. Switch 2 Edition games could refer to enhanced versions of Switch games, though whether such a thing will exist or if there will be any upgrade cost remains unknown.</p><p dir="ltr">There have been multiple rumors of games that have previously launched on the current Nintendo Switch receiving some sort of enhancement on the upcoming successor. The Legend Of Zelda: Breath of the Wild has been mentioned among the likely candidates, while the recent Xenoblade Chronicles X remaster was found to be hiding a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-editions-hidden-mode-could-hint-at-switch-2-feature/1100-6530249/">secret 60 frames-per-second mode</a> within its code.</p><p dir="ltr">Virtual Game Cards were one of many announcements during the most recent Nintendo Direct, which also included the debut announcements of new games in Nintendo's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-new-rhythm-heaven-is-coming-to-switch-but-not-until-2026/1100-6530421/">Rhythm Heaven</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tomodachi-life-living-the-dream-coming-to-nintendo-switch-in-2026/1100-6530426/">Tomodachi Life</a> franchises. The Direct also provided updates on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-gets-gameplay-deep-dive-slick-new-suit/1100-6530408/">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>, Dragon Quest 1 &amp; 2 HD-2D Remake, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-pokemon-legends-z-a-trailer-reveals-its-big-twist-on-gameplay/1100-6530425/">Pokemon Legends Z-A</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Nintendo has not directly mentioned "Nintendo Switch 2 Edition" games as of this writing, but that may change during the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/">Nintendo Switch 2</a> Direct livestream slated for April 2 at 6 AM PT / 9 AM ET.</p>

While </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pentiment</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> didn't have the massive scope of the dev's other titles like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fallout: New Vegas</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> or the most recent </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Avowed</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the game's director did have one particular vision for the game's storytelling that required a significant amount of convincing to get the team on board—and that was with how the fonts would look in-game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">During GDC 2025, game director Joshua Sawyer (previously helming </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fallout: New Vegas</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pillars of Eternity</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">) spoke about his work conceptualizing and building </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pentiment</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s approach to text-based storytelling and how the game's fonts needed more than static characters in speech bubbles to authentically depict an evolving game world with different cultures via a "typographic voice."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Rats, horse testicles, and fonts—OR: How to go the extra mile with your game">Rats, horse testicles, and fonts—OR: How to go the extra mile with your game</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">At Sawyer's panel, titled "Justifying Absurd Expenditures on Fonts and Other Silly Features," he broke down some common struggles developers tend to fall into when trying to deliver a product. In many cases, developers tend to provide a game that is seen as a "minimum viable product," especially at first. which is a game with baseline features and nothing particularly noteworthy. Another approach is to elevate the concept go for the "maximum viable product."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/why-your-next-game-needs-a-babygirl" target="_self" data-discover="true">Why your next game needs a babygirl</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Some examples he included were </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>A Plague Tale</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s dynamic, fully animated rat swarms, which appear like a living mass to players. In another example, Sawyer brought up </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Red Dead Redemption 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s infamous horse testicles, which shrink when riding in cold climates. As Sawyer put it, adding these features—which aren't always vital for a game—do a lot to elevate the experience into something more.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"What about the maximum viable product? It's way more than what's needed, you got every bell and whistle—you're inventing bells and whistles, and you're trying to elevate the experience through a type of unique maximalism that hasn't been seen [in a game]," said Sawyer.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Following the above, Sawyer explained his vision for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pentiment</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, a 16th-century European detective game where players must read and analyze intent and meaning from character interactions to make critical choices. Inspired by games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>80 Days</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Night in the Woods</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pentiment</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s unique approach to storytelling highlights its dynamic text presentation, featuring animated medieval-era typography that's unique for each interaction and NPC.

As the game director described it, being passionate about a feature is the first step of getting your concept off the ground, but the following steps include getting your team on board with the idea and then bringing it to life in a compelling way—which present unique challenges all their own.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"One of many problems is that there were [letter] character set issues, so these might have supported the languages they originally came from," said Sawyer. "For example, many of the [characters] came from German or Swiss sources; while they might have been clear, they didn't have the characters that might be needed in Polish or Spanish or French or anything else. So that was tricky. Also, if they looked authentic [to the era], they were often quite difficult to read. Yes, we wanted them to look authentic, but the difficult-to-read part is not good for a game full of text."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="What's in a font?">What's in a font?</h2><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/achieving-creative-sobriety-in-game-design" target="_self" data-discover="true">Achieving 'creative sobriety' in game design</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Sawyer described </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pentiment</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> as "not a small game, but not an 'indie' game"—given that it had support from Microsoft Game Studios. With over three years in development and a team of 13 by the end of production, it was a modestly sized game, but Sawyer's ideas for using dynamic typography for its storytelling presented a wrinkle that took time to work out.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">What sets </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pentiment</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> apart from other reading-dense RPGs like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Disco Elysium</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> or </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pillars of the Earth</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is how it makes the act of reading—and viewing the text—a part of the experience. You essentially become a medieval-era detective. This was a part of the core vision of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pentiment</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, in that 16th century Bavaria was a melting pot of different cultures and social classes, and protagonist Andreas must be able to navigate a diverse society with unique characters who have different philosophies and worldviews, all reflected in the font-style.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To build out the whole suite of custom typography, the developers contacted Lettermatic founder Riley Cran. Working with Cran's company, they designed the game's six custom fonts—Peasant, Cursive, Humanist, Printed, Textura, and Thread Puller. Creating each font—aiming for authenticity rather than total accuracy— allowed the developers greater control over the text, at the cost of being time-consuming. Sawyer recommended that devs try to create their fonts to own it, but only if they have the resources and means to do so.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The control you have with the fonts is unparalleled, it's fantastic," he said. "You can get exactly what you need; you can get support for any localization you want, and it's your font. You don't have to worry about ongoing licensing issues and all that sort of nonsense. We eventually released our fonts for basically free to the public, and they use it for making shit posts and memes, which is the highest point of it."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Another vital resource that Obsidian Entertainment relied on was the accessibility teams at Microsoft, who helped hone the visual presentation of the text for readers of all kinds and text related to specific cultures. Sawyer cited some instances where the game touched on specific topics, and Microsoft sensitivity readers offered feedback to help refine it further.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One method that Sawyer suggested to elevate the look of the text and give it a dynamic feel was the stroke-by-stroke illustration of letters in real-time, which he noted wasn't exactly met with enthusiasm from the team. "So when I brought up stroke-by-stroke rendering to the team, it wasn't that people hated the idea, but there was skepticism about it," said Sawyer. Eventually, the engineering team—opting out of his initial pitch of using different alpha channels to similar motion—used his concept and built it with Adobe Illustrator, applying gradients and animation to recreate real-time illustrative pen strokes on parchment.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Sell your vision">Sell your vision</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Sawyer concluded the talk by giving attendees tips on how to best present their concepts to their teams. For </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pentiment</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the dynamic text and fonts showcased a level of authenticity for the game's setting and concept of playing within a living book—something that Sawyer admitted took effort to get right.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It is not enough for you alone to believe in this mission—the team does have to believe in this vision as well," said Sawyer. "The vision also has to include a plan, which will make people feel somewhat more confident in the idea that you are giving them. If you succeed with the core features, people will be more confident and happier about the idea of doing other things related to it."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The decision to go the extra mile was worth it as </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pentiment</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is widely regarded as one of Obsidian Entertainment's best games.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-has-surpassed-3-million-players/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Ubisoft <a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/1905268079958904991" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> via social media channels that Assassin's Creed Shadows has now surpassed three million players. They also shared the following milestones:</p>
<ul>
<li>✅2nd highest Day 1 sales revenue in Assassin's Creed franchise history</li>
<li>✅Biggest Ubisoft Day 1 ever on PlayStation Digital Store</li>
<li>✅Best community ever, with over 40 Million hours already played</li>
</ul>
<p>This follows the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-one-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">becoming a million seller on launch day</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-has-reached-2-million-players-besting-origins-and-odyssey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reaching two million units on March 22</a>. Since then, we also learned that Assassin's Creed Shadows was the <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-biggest-physical-game-of-the-year-in-uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">best retail launch of 2025 in the United Kingdom</a>.</p>
<p>The game has undoubtedly been well-received. On Steam, the average review verdict is 'Very Positive' (82%). Critics were also quite positive; the game was rated 8.7 out of 10 here on Wccftech in the review <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-shadows-a-gorgeous-dive-into-feudal-chaos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">written by Francesco De Meo</a>:</p>
<p><em>Everything considered, Assassin's Creed Shadows is undoubtedly a solid open-world role-playing game and one of the best entries in the series in a long time. It brings back the stealth gameplay that made the series what it is and seamlessly combines it with the combat-focused experience seen in Valhalla. While the content bloat is still as annoying as ever, the solid narrative, engaging gameplay, and one of the most beautiful renditions of Feudal Japan ever released make it a game worth experiencing for the vast majority of players.</em></p>
<p>The game's success came at an absolutely critical time for Ubisoft. Earlier today, the publisher <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-forms-new-subsidiary-based-on-the-assassins-creed-far-cry-and-rainbow-six-and-franchises/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> the rumored decision to form a new subsidiary that will take control of Ubisoft's most successful franchises: Far Cry, Rainbow Six, and Assassin's Creed itself. The strong performance of Assassin's Creed Shadows undoubtedly allowed Ubisoft to be stronger in the negotiations. Just like the rumors had <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-is-seeking-investors-for-new-entity-that-will-hold-the-publishers-biggest-properties/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suggested</a>, Tencent has a 25% minority stake in the new subsidiary following a cash investment of €1.16 billion.</p>

The new entity doesn’t have a name yet but will have its own board of supervisors and include Ubisoft studios Montreal, Quebec, Sherbrooke, Saguenay, Barcelona, and Sofia. Those teams will be in charge of the <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>, <em>Far Cry</em>, and <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em> franchises moving forward, as well as their back catalogs. But all of it will still report up to Ubisoft proper and its current CEO, Yves Guillemot.<br></p><p> “With the creation of a dedicated subsidiary that will spearhead development for three of our largest franchises and the onboarding of Tencent as a minority investor, we are crystalizing the value of our assets, strengthening our balance sheet, and creating the best conditions for these franchises’ long-term growth and success,” Guillemot said in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/1uPFqvuRRej3UoemTIgVLH/18f1d055777e1b39a3f79a951452b9e1/2025.03.27_-_Press_Release_vfinal.pdf&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/1uPFqvuRRej3UoemTIgVLH/18f1d055777e1b39a3f79a951452b9e1/2025.03.27_-_Press_Release_vfinal.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a press release</a></span> on Thursday. “With its dedicated and autonomous leadership team, it will focus on transforming these three brands into unique ecosystems.” </p><p>On a call with investors following the announcement, however, the company’s leadership clarified that Ubisoft 2, or whatever it ends up being called, will still report up to Guillemot. “There will be a dedicated management under the supervision of a board that will be controlled by Ubisoft,” CFO Frederick Duguet told investors. “So Ubisoft will continue controlling and consolidating this entity.”</p><p>The major deal comes after months of speculation about a possible sale of the French publisher following a year of poor sales for some of its biggest recent blockbusters, including <em>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</em> and <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>, as well as delays and cancellations of other big releases, including free-to-play shooter&nbsp;<em>The Division Heartland</em>. Those rumors included a shareholder report that Ubisoft <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-shareholder-claims-company-failed-to-disclose-meetings-with-ea-and-microsoft-about-ip-acquisition/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-shareholder-claims-company-failed-to-disclose-meetings-with-ea-and-microsoft-about-ip-acquisition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">was even exploring a sale</a></span> of some of its franchises to Microsoft and others. Under the new structure, series like <em>The Division</em>, <em>Ghost Recon</em>, <em>The Crew</em>, <em>Prince of Persia</em>, and <em>Rayman</em> will remain under the broader Ubisoft umbrella. <br></p><p>Ubisoft is a sprawling organization with studios and employees spread out all over the world. The complex web facilitates a co-development process that the company uses to ship massive games in shorter time periods. But that also means that there’s no clean delineation between who works on what. While The Montreal and Quebec studios lead development on the <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> franchise, many employees within those offices still work on other franchises as needed. </p><p>Asked by investors how many of Ubisoft’s over 17,000 employees would be moving to the new group, the company said it was still too early to tell. That sentiment was echoed in an email sent to staff today from Ubisoft head of studios Marie-Sophie de Waubert. This brings some uncertainty and questions,” she wrote in an email obtained by<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-tencent-internal-memo/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-tencent-internal-memo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Insider Gaming</em></a></span>. “Right now, we may not have all the detailed answers, but we are committed to communicating with you transparently and regularly.”</p><p>Two key provisions of the new agreement are that Tencent cannot sell its 25 percent equity stake for at least five years and Ubisoft “may not cease to hold a majority of New subsidiary voting rights and share capital for a 2-year period.” In the near term at least, the $1.25 billion deal sounds more like a financial instrument than anything else, and one that provides Ubisoft’s current ownership with more time to try to improve the company’s financial outlook. Prior to <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadow</em>’s launch, many asked if it would be enough to save the company from being broken up and sold for parts. For now at least, it seems like it won’t need to. </p><p><em>Update 3/27/2025 2:35 p.m. ET: Added more context from the investor call and internal emails. </em></p><p><em>.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/r0-z3-skin-call-of-duty-controversial-paywall/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Move over, Terminator – an old familiar face is back in town and standing ready to take the spot of the most overpowered, controversial Call of Duty skin. When Season 03 arrives in Black Ops 6 on April 2, players will be able to unlock R0-Z3, a modern-day recreation of one of the sweatiest Operators in Call of Duty history.</p>



<p>Back in the day, ‘Roze’ was the firm favourite for players looking for an (unfair) edge over the competition. Her skin was darker than dark and made her a shadow in dimly-lit areas, and even a redesign to lighten her up didn’t do much to stem the sales.</p>



<p>There’s a really sneaky catch, though. You can only get the R0-Z3 skin if you own the BlackCell Battle Pass – the most expensive Battle Pass variant in Call of Duty. Surprise, surprise.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-signature-sweat">Signature Sweat</h2>



<p>The R0-Z3 skin, which is an all-new take on the classic Roze Operator, will be available exclusively through the BlackCell Battle Pass, which just so happens to be one of the most expensive single purchases you can make in Call of Duty. It’ll set you back $30 to obtain Season 03’s BlackCell Battle Pass, which is more than the average skin pack by far.</p>



<p>Here’s the spiel for R0-Z3, published in <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/03/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-warzone-zombies-season-three-critical-launch-announcement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a recent Call of Duty blog</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The new BlackCell Operator R0-Z3 arrives in an animated mantle and her signature mask along with her faithful hound, leading an awesome array of Season 03 BlackCell content. She is joined by a roster of teched out Operator Skins, sleek Weapon Blueprints, and sci-fi themed unlocks earned exclusively through BlackCell.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>She looks as familiar as ever, but she has some golden splashes that make her fit with the BlackCell brand:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Roze first appeared in Warzone in July 2020, mere months after the game hit the market. She became a staple of the battle royale landscape, with everyone grinding the battle pass to Tier 100 to acquire the legendary Operator skin.</p>



<p>If you’ve got $30 to spare, you’ll be happy enough picking up BlackCell, and admittedly, it comes with heaps of bonus features for the avid Call of Duty fan. There are BlackCell-exclusive weapon blueprints for a range of firearms, including the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-the-amax-in-warzone-and-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AMAX</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-the-hdr-in-warzone-and-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HDR</a>, which are returning for the reappearance of Verdansk in Warzone.</p>



<p>You’ll also get 1,100 COD Points, a 10% XP boost, and several exclusive skins for an array of Operators. They’re not as popular as R0-Z3 will be, but you never know.</p>



<p>Do you plan on getting the R0-Z3 skin as soon as possible, ready for Verdansk’s return? Let me know in the comments.</p>

It’s a move that finally allows two hidden-gem PlayStation games from the mid-2000s to stomp onto non-PlayStation platforms for the first time while updating them for PS5 players, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Having lived in the desolate frontier for years, the Patapon tribe was driven from their home by the Zigoton army,” an official description from new publisher Bandai Namco said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This drove them to become fierce warrior spirits that can only be commanded by the beat of the war drum, played by the Mighty One (the player).

Bandai Namco specifically lists upgraded graphics as one of the more noticeable additions, though returning Almighty will also notice added Easy, Normal, and Hard difficulty modes, as well as timing adjustment and constant command display options. While Patapon 1+2 Replay aims to bring the classic <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/patapon">2007</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/patapon-2">2008</a> titles to players better than ever, there’s no sign of the PSP’s 2011 title, Patapon 3.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Patapon may not be one of PlayStation’s more recognizable franchises, but it’s still a name that has been associated with the brand for nearly 20 years. It’s unclear why or how it’s leaping other platforms now or if the series will continue to blossom with any new entries in the future. There’s also been no mention of a potential Xbox version, so it’s best to expect Patapon 1+2 Replay on PC, Switch, and PS5 to be where things end for now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more on today’s news, you can catch up with everything else revealed during the March 2025 Nintendo Direct <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-direct-march-2025-everything-announced">here</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance contributor with IGN.

While called Everybody's Golf in many regions, the series was Hot Shots Golf in North America for a while, until 2017's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/everybodys-golf">Everybody's Golf</a> reunited the franchise name. This latest entry, Everybody's Golf Hot Shots, looks to mark as much by combining the two names into one unified, new entry.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's an interesting twist in the details, though. Digimon Survive studio HYDE is making this, under the Bandai Namco umbrella, in a partnership with Sony Interactive Entertainment. Traditionally, this has been a Sony-published series, and developer Clap Hanz was working on the series. Clap Haz released its own self-titled game, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/after-20-years-making-playstation-golf-games-clap-hanz-wants-a-new-challenge">Clap Hanz Golf</a>, back in 2021.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, it looks like you can expect the usual blend of classic golf and some of the wackier options. Characters have their expressive celebrations, and several game modes offer strange, surprising mix-ups to your usual round of golf.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There will also be local couch co-op and online multiplayer, which is good news for those who, like me, grew up passing a controller around playing Hot Shots Golf. The announcement debuted during today's Nintendo Switch Direct, and I could see Everybody's Golf Hot Shots working pretty well as a couch co-op Switch game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">No date's been set yet, but Everybody's Golf Hot Shots will be heading to PS5, Switch, and PC sometime this year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the meantime, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-direct-march-2025-everything-announced">head over to our recap of today's Nintendo Direct for March 2025</a> if you're looking for other announcements.

It takes the genre at an unusual angle and offers something unexpected at every turn.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>You arrive at the Archipelago on a strange mission: to kill the Deity, a mystical creature that everyone talks about, but no one has seen. To find the Deity, you will have to delve deep into the many secrets these islands keep. You will discover a place marked by tragedy, and filled with eccentric characters and remarkable contrasts.</p><p>Upgrade your cane with new parts and unlock new abilities, to explore the hidden corners of the Archipelago and face incredible creatures.</p><p><strong>Hand Crafted to the Smallest Detail</strong></p><p><em>The Eternal Life of Goldman</em> is the result of years of work by people who love and appreciate the same cartoons, comics and games that you do. We wanted to make an uncompromising 2D game of amazing beauty, so we went back to the genre’s roots and took the most difficult path possible – meticulously drawn, colored and animated by hand using classic frame-by-frame techniques. We didn’t cut any corners, and the results are worth it. In <em>The Eternal Life of Goldman</em>, no two rooms or landscapes are alike. Every place, every object, every character, every visual effect — everything is carefully planned and executed to the finest detail.</p><p>Remember how, when you were a child, you first saw your first 16-bit platformer and couldn’t believe your eyes? We want you to experience those feelings again—or maybe for the first time.</p><p><strong>Tapping the Best of the Genre</strong></p><p>Far from mindlessly relying on cliché and formula, <em>The Eternal Life of Goldman</em> turns the genre on its head. The game carefully includes everything we all love most about side-scrollers, across the various styles, trends and eras. And it leaves out all the frustrating stuff that doesn’t make sense and wastes time.</p><p>It’s a challenging platformer that demands precision, but it never devolves into a grueling exercise where you have to memorize and methodically execute an exact sequence of <a title="Genres > Action [2,603 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>s. The key to success is improvisation and ingenuity.</p><p>It’s a game that encourages exploration and will give you a sense of discovery—but it won’t have you backtracking in confusion after you gain each new ability or artifact. It’s impossible to spend much time wandering around in <em>The Eternal Life of Goldman</em> without doing anything interesting.</p><p>Finally, it’s a game with complex scenes, robust characters and a multi-layered story—but it never gets bogged down in thoughtful poses and feigned pretension. All the elements work to create an adventure that takes your breath away and breaks your heart.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Extended Gameplay Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="The Eternal Life of Goldman | Extended Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ebAKFMH1CHE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

When there's as big a brand as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/the-walt-disney-company">Disney</a>, that has enough money to just kind of throw whatever at the wall and see what sticks, eventually you wind up with something that might make you scratch your head a bit. Today, that thing is Disney Villains Cursed Café, a visual novel where you serve a bevy of potions to various Disney baddies, announced earlier today as part of the final Nintendo Direct for the OG Switch (but yes, it is on PC too - in fact it's already out on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2439220/Disney_Villains_Cursed_Caf/">Steam</a>).
</p>

<p>
The concept is pretty simple: you are a Potionista, someone that, uh, brews potions, and you run a café frequented by Disney villains from a range of its films. That includes folks like Jafar from Aladdin, Ursula from The Little Mermaid, Gaston from Beauty and the Beast, all of them wearing not exactly casual outfits, but clothing you could see them wearing on the weekend at the very least.

<p>
For the most part gameplay looks simple. Brew a potion, serve them to the villain, listen to their stories. As mentioned it's a visual novel, and the emphasis more seems to be about chatting with Disney villains than anything particularly more complex (not to say that visual novel can't be complex, it's just this one doesn't seem to be).
</p>
<p>
There's just one thing I find a bit icky about it, as has been pointed out by several other people across social media, that being that it kind of seems to be ripping off <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/coffee-talk">Coffee Talk</a>. I don't exactly love a giant like the House of Mouse trying to corporate-wash a beloved indie game like that in all honesty. Anyway, Maleficent getting an iPhone is kind of funny I guess.

This new system will go live in late April and will be compatible with Switch 2 at launch. And on a new website Nintendo created explaining Virtual Game Cards, there’s some fine print hinting at enhanced Switch 2 ports of past games. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/wario64.bsky.social/post/3lles54qmv527&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/wario64.bsky.social/post/3lles54qmv527" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As spotted by video game deals and news sharer Wario64</a></span>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/virtual-game-cards/#:~:text=*Available%20on%20Nintendo,title%20is%20ejected.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/virtual-game-cards/#:~:text=*Available%20on%20Nintendo,title%20is%20ejected." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">some fine print at the bottom of this webpage</a></span> mentions something we’ve not heard about before: “Switch 2 Edition” games. These will only be playable on Switch 2 and will likely be enhanced native ports of older titles. </p><p>Here’s the full text with the important bits bolded: </p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Compatible systems must be linked to a Nintendo Account to use virtual game cards. Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive games and<strong> Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games</strong> can only be loaded on a Nintendo Switch 2 system. To move virtual game cards between two systems, you must pair the systems via local wireless and an internet connection, but only when pairing the systems for the first time. Up to two systems total can be linked per Nintendo Account.</p></blockquote><p>Interesting! While we’ve known for a while now that Switch games will be mostly backward compatible with Switch 2, this is the first official mention of the possibility that some older games might get native ports to Switch 2. This will likely work similarly to PS4 games on PS5: most of them play just fine (or even better) on the more powerful hardware, but there are some titles that have received separate, native PS5 ports. For example, <em>Death Stranding</em> on PS4 plays great on PS5.<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/234585/#:~:text=If%20you%20already,the%20discounted%20price.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/234585/#:~:text=If%20you%20already,the%20discounted%20price." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> But you can spend $10 to upgrade to the PS5 version which unlocks new visual features and options</a></span>.</p><p><em>Kotaku </em>has contacted Nintendo about this fine print and what it means. </p><p>For now, we can only speculate as to what “Switch 2 Edition” means. One possibility is that some of these Switch 2 Edition games will run at a higher framerate. Recently, dataminers discovered unused 60FPS code in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/544485/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-60-fps-switch-2&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/544485/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-60-fps-switch-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition</em></a></span>. Many are theorizing that the game will run at a higher FPS on Switch 2. And that might be true, but perhaps only while playing a theoretical Switch 2 Edition of it. </p><p>Will you have to pay for these native ports? Maybe. Will they support cross-save and crossplay with older versions? Possibly. We don’t know yet, but hopefully we’ll learn more on April 2 during the announced Switch 2-focused Direct. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-tencent-internal-memo/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Earlier today, Ubisoft and Tencent announced a new subsidiary valued at approximately €4 billion ($4.3 billion). Insider Gaming has received Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot’s internal memo on the announcement.</p>



<div><p>It reads,</p><p>“Hello everyone,</p><p>I’m pleased to share an important announcement that will mark a milestone in Ubisoft’s history.</p><p>Following a process to review different strategic options for Ubisoft’s future, we have just signed an exceptional agreement with one of our trusted shareholders, Tencent, with whom we have a solid relationship.</p><p>Their €1.16 billion investment will benefit all of Ubisoft. We will be able to firmly take back control of our future and renew with the serenity needed to create the best games.</p><p>The terms of this partnership are straightforward: we will establish a dedicated subsidiary within Ubisoft that will bring together our three most powerful franchises: Assassin’s Creed, Rainbow Six and Far Cry. This subsidiary will gather the teams working on these brands, primarily in the studios of Montreal, Quebec City, Sherbrooke, Saguenay, Barcelona, and Sofia. Tencent will be a 25% shareholder of this new subsidiary, with the aim of boosting these franchises so they become undisputed global icons.</p><p>This historic agreement is above all a recognition of the extraordinary work you have been doing for years: the value of these three brands directly reflects your individual and collective talent and efforts, which have allowed us to create these beloved franchises.</p><p>This investment will also give us the means to accelerate the changes we’ve been discussing for several months across the group – changes that many of you have been longing for, as revealed by the Ubisoft XP survey. These changes are in line with the initiatives that Marie-Sophie has been sharing recently, which aim to put the creation of unique games and player satisfaction back at the heart of our daily work. This is what will enable us to return to a higher level of profitability.</p><p>This announcement comes at a pivotal time, after the very positive reception of Assassin’s Creed Shadows and the excitement sparked by the announcement of Rainbow 6 Siege X, of which we can be very proud.</p><p>I want to express my deepest gratitude for your resilience, tenacity, courage, and creativity – all the qualities that make Ubisoft a truly unique company and that helped us overcome a challenging period over the last few years.</p></div>



<div><p>The coming months will be dedicated to shaping our next chapter. Of course, this new step in our transformation will raise many questions, including on an individual level. We are committed to keeping you regularly informed, answering your questions, and providing visibility on the next steps.</p><p>I hope you can join the global livestream that will be held tomorrow at 3:30 p.m. CET during which I will share a few words with you. You’ll receive an invitation shortly.</p><p>See you tomorrow, and thank you again,</p><p>Yves”</p></div>



<hr>



<div><p>Understandably, employee’s are now nervous. In a follow-up email, Marie-Sophie de Waubert (Chief Studios &amp; Portfolio Officer) said,</p><p>“Hello everyone,</p><p>I wanted to follow up immediately with all of you in Montreal, Quebec City, Sherbrooke, Saguenay, Barcelona, and Sofia after Yves’ email regarding the new Business Unit that is being created.</p><p>First and foremost, I want to emphasize that the agreement we announced is a powerful enabler and an exciting opportunity for Ubisoft. It will help us accelerate our evolution and improve how we make games with greater focus and agility.</p><p>Tencent’s investment is a strong testament to their trust in our ability to grow Assassin’s Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six. This is a direct result of the incredible work you’ve done in making these franchises iconic, as a lead or major codev studio.</p><p>I also want to be clear: if you’re not currently working on these brands, it doesn’t mean your work matters any less. This agreement will benefit all of Ubisoft, giving us the means to spark more innovation and creativity across the board. This marks the beginning of a new chapter, and you play a vital role in shaping it.</p><p>In the coming weeks and months, we will work hard to build the best organization possible – for Ubisoft, for our teams, and for our players.</p><p>Of course, this brings some uncertainty and questions. Right now, we may not have all the detailed answers, but we are committed to communicating with you transparently and regularly. Supporting you through this transition is the top priority for your local and your global leadership teams. Don’t hesitate to reach out to them and stay tuned locally; usual or dedicated “studio times” will be also good forums to keep you updated and answer your questions.”</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-is-forming-a-new-subsidiary-with-tencent-valued-at-4-3-billion/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Ubisoft has announced that it will be forming a new subsidiary with Tencent valued at approximately 4 billion euros ($4.3 billion).</p>



<p>Tencent will be investing €1.16 billion for a 25% stake, with the new subsidiary set to including IPs including Assassin’s Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six. It will also include Ubisoft’s studios located in Montréal, Quebec, Sherbrooke, Saguenay, Barcelona, and Sofia.</p>



<p>In an internal email to staff that has been acquired by Insider Gaming, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot said that the move will “mark a milestone in Ubisoft’s history”.</p>



<p>“This historic agreement is above all a recognition of the extraordinary work you have been doing for years: the value of these three brands directly reflects your individual and collective talent and efforts, which have allowed us to create these beloved franchises,” Guillemot said.</p>



<p>Guillemot also added that the investment from Tencent gives the company the “means to accelerate the changes we’ve been discussing for several months across the group—changes that many of you have been longing for, as revealed by the Ubisoft XP survey.”</p>



<p>Ubisoft senior vice president Marie-Sophie de Waubert commented that the company believes that Tencent’s investment into Ubisoft is a “strong testament to their trust” in the company’s ability to grow Assassin’s Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six.</p>



<p>“This is a direct result of the incredible work you’ve done in making these franchises iconic,” she said.</p>



<p>De Waubert did admit that the news will bring “some uncertainty and questions” for many within Ubisoft. Despite not having all of the answers “right now”, she said in the email that management is “committed to communicating with [employees] transparently and regularly.”</p>

Tencent is investing €1.16 billion ($1.25 billion USD) to take a minority stake (about 25%) in this new subsidiary.</p><p>Ubisoft said the parts of its business that are not included in this new entity, including The Division and Ghost Recon, along with development of certain new IP, will continue in parallel. However, it's unknown to what extent these changes could result in potential layoffs or studio closures.</p><p>"This new subsidiary will focus on building game ecosystems designed to become truly evergreen and multi-platform. Backed by greater investment and boosted creative capacities, it will drive further increases in quality of narrative solo experiences, expand multiplayer offerings with increased frequency of content release, introduce free-to-play touchpoints, and integrate more social features," Ubisoft said.</p><p>Tencent emerged as the winner following a "competitive process" under which Ubisoft considered different "strategic options." It was previously reported that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-is-horribly-managed-investor-says-report-claims-ea-and-microsoft-might-buy-franchises/1100-6530071/" data-ref-id="1100-6530071">Microsoft and EA were in the mix in some capacity.</a></p><p>Alongside the announcement of this new business entity, Ubisoft said it will "focus on nurturing" some of its other franchises, including Ghost Recon and The Division, while also continuing to make new IP and building out its game engine technologies and online services. Ubisoft said it will share more information "at a later stage."</p><p>Ubisoft co-founder and CEO Yves Guillemot said this marks a "new chapter" in Ubisoft's history, calling this a "foundational step in changing Ubisoft's operating model."</p><p>"With the creation of a dedicated subsidiary that will spearhead development for three of our largest franchises and the onboarding of Tencent as a minority investor, we are crystalizing the value of our assets, strengthening our balance sheet, and creating the best conditions for these franchises' long-term growth and success," Guillemot said.</p><p>Tencent president Martin Lau said, "We see the immense potential for these franchises to evolve into long-term evergreen game platforms and create engaging new experiences for gamers."</p><p>In terms of further specifics, the new subsidiary includes the development teams working on Rainbow Six, Assassin's Creed, and Far Cry in Montreal, Quebec, Sherbrooke, Saguenay, Barcelona, and Sofia. Ubisoft said it also includes any new games in those places under development currently or that are made in the future, along with back catalog titles from those teams. This new subsidiary is getting rights to the Rainbow Six, Assassin's Creed, and Far Cry franchises in exchange for an unspecified royalty payment.</p><p>It's been a tumultuous past year for Ubisoft even prior to this, as the company's cost-cutting efforts have included <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-closes-studio-eliminating-185-jobs-in-latest-round-of-cuts/1100-6529036/" data-ref-id="1100-6529036">mass layoffs and studio closures</a>, as well as the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xdefiant-shuts-down-in-june-2025-ubisoft-closes-two-offices/1100-6528210/" data-ref-id="1100-6528210">shutdown of XDefiant.</a></p><p>Ubisoft's latest big release was Assassin's Creed Shadows, which debuted on March 20, quickly reaching 3 million players and collecting strong reviews from critics.</p>

Naughty Dog's Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet won't launch before 2027, according to one of gaming's more credible distributors of gossip and speculation. That's fine, because they haven't announced the sci-fi action-adventure for PC yet. Here's the reveal trailer again, in case you missed it.

<p>
The aforesaid "credible distributor of gossip and speculation" is Jason Schreier, author of whole entire books of insider journalism - he's been <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-studios-ot45-game-of-the-year-edition.1093518/page-284#post-137487981">spilling the beans on Resetera</a>. I have recently become aware of this "book" phenomenon. My understanding is that a "book" is a jailbroken iPad consisting of pounded cobwebs that must be physically gripped and "turned" using Wiimote-style gyroscopic finger inputs.</p>
<p>Journalism contained by books tends to undergo more stringent fact-checking and, as such, enjoys a higher status than the traditional video game information vehicle of a salacious username on Reddit that was accidentally right about one of 12 "leaks" three years ago, and has been duly promoted to internet Cassandra. What I am laboriously saying is that I trust Schreier the Bookman rather more than user TurboJackoff69 who once correctly predicted the coming of rightward-sloping laptop vents. Oh yeah, and Schreier also writes for Bloomberg. They're pretty credible too.
</p>
<p>
Intergalactic is set thousands of years in the future, and casts you as a bounty hunter stranded on a forgotten planet full of ancient religion and blade-o-bots. It's been in development since 2020, and apparently takes inspiration from Akira and Cowboy Bebop, which are a bit "chalk and cheese" as anime influences go. I mean, Bebop has darker moments, but it's not quite doing experiments on psychic children, is it.  
</p>
<p>
Anyway, a key goal of Intergalactic is making the player feel lost and alone, which is great news for those of us who feared that Naughty Dog might pivot back to Drakish quipfire after all the sexy heartache of The Last Of Us.</p>
<p>"I really want you to be lost in a place that you're really confused about what happened here, [about] who are the people here, what was their history," Neil Druckmann <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJUab499PVA">told</a> 28 Days Later director Alex Garland earlier this month (via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-the-hate-directed-at-the-last-of-us-part-2-naughty-dog-boss-says-next-game-about-the-entirely-uncontroversial-topics-of-faith-and-religion">Eurogamer</a>). Player character Jordan A. Mun doesn't even have any friends to banter with, though I personally wouldn't rule out Naughty Dog introducing a robot pal. Perhaps you'll talk to it about matters of faith. In my experience, it's harder to do top bantz when there's religion involved. 
</p>
<p>
It has taken Naughty Dog five long years to bring The Last Of Us: Part 2 to PC - look out for it on 3rd April. It seems likely that Intergalactic will be a key PS6 launch game - as such, I wouldn't be surprised if it takes even longer to escape consoledom. Still, Sony launched <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> on PC and PS5 simultaneously and that made a heck of a lot of money. Perhaps when 2027 swings around they'll be more open to the idea of a same-day release.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

If you’re an anime enthusiast as well, you may have had your eye on <em>AI Limit</em>, which costs only $35. This may leave you wondering how long of a journey the game offers and whether it’s worth investing in.

Yes, this is partially because it poses a hell of a challenge (meaning you’ll die a lot), but it’s also packed with just as many locations and bosses as many far more expensive games in the soulslike genre. </p><p>Because of the difficulty, especially in regards to the many bosses you’ll encounter, how long it takes you to finish the game will be somewhat skill-dependent. However, <strong>an average playthrough is likely to take around 20 hours</strong>. This includes reaching the final boss without completing every side-quest or searching every nook and cranny.</p><p>But completionists can certainly get more from the game, especially those looking to score every achievement it has to offer.

By doing this, you’ll be able to go back through and grab any missed weapons, spells, NPC quests, and so on. More importantly, you’ll be able to set yourself up for different endings. <strong>Doing all of this can easily net you upwards of 40 hours worth of gameplay in <em>AI Limit</em></strong>. </p><p>Again, how much time you ultimately get out of <em>AI Limit</em> will depend at least partially on your skill level and whether you reference any guides for helping you find any particularly well-hidden secrets.
