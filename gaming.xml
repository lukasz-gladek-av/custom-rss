			<p>What a crazy crossover event Ball X Pit is! Who could have foreseen the rotund, spherical ball franchise matching up so well with a great big hole IP? Well, golfers, I suppose. In all seriousness, Ball X Pit is a melding of so many genres and games that the titular ball and the pit feel like the nominal components here, with solo developer Kenny Sun having crafted one of the best arcade roguelite crossovers we’ve ever seen.</p>
<p><iframe title="BALL X PIT – Release Date Trailer – Nintendo Switch &amp; Nintendo Switch 2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/npSBksOTz8c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>You’re a treasure hunter, out to delve into the depths of The Pit, bracing yourself to fight off hordes of monsters on your way towards a huge boss. What does that mean in terms of gameplay? Your character fires a steady stream of balls to cause damage, projectiles bouncing around the arena like a riff on Breakout or Arkanoid, and you’re left thinking about angles, avoiding arrows and ice spears, while collecting experience gems from the fallen.</p>


<p>Here’s where it gets interesting. You can carry up to four special ball types. These range from balls that cause bleeding or inflict poison, to slow and ultra-powerful types, or ones that cause lightning to arc between enemies. As you progress, you’ll find Fusion drops alongside the experience gems, and these can do various things to your special loadout. Fission will upgrade them, by up to two levels, increasing damage or area of effect, while Fusion can happen between two, fully levelled special balls, amping them up and combining their effects into one ball.</p>
<p>Evolution is what you’re really looking for. Certain ball types can be combined through evolution into hybrids, gaining additional effects, and making your chances of success even higher. The thing is, you really have to plan ahead, and Ball X Pit isn’t necessarily the kind of game to allow you to do that.</p>


<p>There is a frantic pace to Ball X Pit, though you do have some control over that, with a speed control that’s been nabbed from an RTS. The oncoming hordes that move down the screen are insatiable, and the start of each foray into the Pit is generally balanced on a knife-edge, and it’s that which makes planning ahead difficult. You have three choices each time you level up, but you are still at the mercy of a random drop, so having specific builds in mind is all well and good, but you might have to abandon them in the heat of the moment, and hope that something good comes your way next.</p>
<p>Ball X Pit is a roguelite. Each run into the Pit earns your character experience, permanently levelling their stats, and gaining various other boons along the way, making it more likely that you can tackle the increasingly difficult levels as you descend further.</p>
<p>Ball X Pit throws a swift curveball into this mix, with the way it deals with your ongoing growth. Outside of the Pit, you work on building a settlement on the surface. This hub plays host to the housing for each of your characters, buildings that offer permanent upgrades that carry across all of your team, and then forests, fields and boulders that you use to accrue the resources to build and expand further.</p>

<p>This in itself is a unique addition to the formula, but then Ball X Pit messes with it some more by making it an offshoot of the ball-bouncing gameplay itself. In order to collect resources, or finish buildings, you have to bounce your characters around the town area like pinballs, hopefully completing the jobs you want, or nabbing enough of the particular resource you need.</p>
<p>There’s a really in-depth spot of tactical town planning needed here, and you can rearrange the buildings and fields to your heart’s content. So, you can make a narrow corridor of buildings that need finishing if you want, or a slew of forests at the front of the town to ensure you get plenty of wood. Equally, you can shift other buildings out of the way if they don’t have anything useful to offer at that moment, and it gives you a real shift in atmosphere and thought compared to the main game.</p>
<p>It can introduce some early frustration, though. I initially wasn’t thinking it through fully, and through repeated harvests, I didn’t manage to grab the things I needed. There’s a balance between predictability and chaos that feels quite slim, but there are ways to make things more certain by changing the layout, which I really started to appreciate as I got deeper into the game.</p>

<p>Crucially, it all fits together incredibly well. The central gameplay is exciting, and immediately rewarding, feeling like a vertical shooter as much as a Breakout-style ball bouncer. It is arcade-y and, by its nature, repetitive, but if you find that feeling of zen from a million things pinging around the screen, there are few games that can come close to Ball X Pit’s immersion.</p>
<p>The town building adds to that, with your downtime bringing you a host of things to consider, and upgrades and resources to focus on. It’s slightly retro-esque looks complete the experience well, and they’re topped off by the constant gothic rave of the soundtrack. I have to say, Ball X Pit feels like more or less a perfect game to me, building on several classic genres and ideas, while infusing them with unique and rewarding new ideas.</p>

<figure><a title="BALL x PIT Review - Screenshot 1 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159604/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>Here comes a ball – a great big wrecking ball, ready to smash down the headquarters of productivity that might otherwise control your life. Kenny Sun Studios’ <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ball_x_pit">Ball x Pit</a> is a mercilessly addictive mix of, well, a lot of stuff.</p>
<p>First, take a big dollop of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/vampire_survivors">Vampire Survivors</a> and a healthy scoop of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/breakout_recharged">Breakout</a> – then just mix in little pinches of almost whatever you feel like: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/neogeo/puzzle_bobble">Puzzle Bobble</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/balatro">Balatro</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/space_invaders">Space Invaders</a>… and maybe even a tiny sprinkle of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/stardew_valley">Stardew Valley</a> for good measure.</p>
<p>But if this roguelite concoction sounds like a pure distillation of all the addictive gameplay ideas from history — and if that puts you off — just hang around a little longer. Ball x Pit definitely brings enough structure and variety, and demands enough creative thinking, to be well worth the time it will inevitably eat up.</p>
<p>You start as a knight at the bottom of a vertical channel. Up top, a small horde of skeletons drops in and starts clomping slowly downwards. They need smashing, and for that, you have a collection of balls. Here’s where the Breakout-ness comes in: bounce the balls to gradually smash the skeletons. Unlike Breakout, you don’t need to stop the balls from falling off the bottom of the screen (although you can catch them if dexterous enough): they’ll just bounce back into your hands, ready for another throw.</p>
<figure><a title="BALL x PIT Review - Screenshot 2 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159609/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The super-satisfying strat in Breakout is to get the ball on top of the blocks, so that it ricochets about, wreaking havoc without you having to do anything. That’s a killer move in Ball x Pit, too, but there’s a catch. If you’ve got your balls bouncing about up above the enemies, then the enemies on the front line are marching in untouched.</p>
<p>You need to balance the high damage-per-second latticework of rapid bounces with route-one attacks on the clear and present danger edging towards screen bottom. Any beastie that gets there will make a final lunge and bite off a chunk of your health meter. That’s where you’ll frequently meet your demise – drowned in swathes of enemies, pinned to the bottom edge.</p>
<p>Now, where do the Survivors ideas come in? Well, you start with a handful of “baby balls” that deal minimal damage, plus one special ball that delivers greater damage of different kinds depending on the ball. These include burn, poison, freeze, various area-of-effect attacks, and more. Pressing 'X' toggles auto-fire. I pressed it exactly once, turning it on, then concentrated only on moving in two dimensions with the left stick while aiming with the right.</p>
<figure><a title="BALL x PIT Review - Screenshot 3 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159602/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>As enemies are dispatched, they drop crystals, which can be collected to get new special balls, help items, or buffs. You can hold up to four special balls at once, but once you reach capacity, rainbow collectibles allow you to fuse or evolve balls to combine two into one, presenting you with a spare slot to pick another. Each special ball can also be levelled up twice, enhancing its power.</p>
<p>The result of all this is total chaos. Enemies are launching projectiles, you’re launching projectiles, your projectiles are launching projectiles, and even little golems or turrets you can pick are launching projectiles. In summary, there are a lot of projectiles.</p>
<p>Reading the action is confusing at first, but soon becomes clear as you learn what you need to dodge and what you can collect. Consistently fluid performance helps no end in enabling this flow state that is the powerful hook of the game.</p>
<p>To assist in finding that flow, the soundtrack offers a haunting, trancelike electronic beat, with enough drive to pump the adrenaline as bosses arrive and enough dreaminess to drift off into ball heaven when a rare safe patch arrives. The sounds are wonderfully moreish rattles and bounces, clicks, pops, growls, and grunts: rhythmical and tight, firing happy feelings in the brain.</p>
<figure><a title="BALL x PIT Review - Screenshot 4 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159610/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>So far, so compelling. But how does this formula avoid getting samey? If we zoom out a bit, there is actually a narrative setting for the game. The city of Ballbylon (yes) has been destroyed, leaving behind a vast pit. Descending into the pit via an enormous lift is what takes you to ever deeper levels, each new one unlocked by completing an earlier one with two different characters and gaining special cogs. This overworld provides a space to gain those new characters and to buff them, and it’s managed, remarkably enough, through a base-building mechanic.</p>
<p>You gather gold while playing the main game, then can use it to purchase a wheat field. Harvesting wheat lets you buy a forest and harvest wood, and so on. Harvesting is done by firing your characters across the base like balls themselves. They ricochet off things and collect resources from the tiles they touch.</p>
<p>Among all this, you can build. Blueprints collected in the pit enable construction of homes for new characters (more play variety and more harvesters) and other buildings that increase stats or improve the rate at which characters develop.</p>
<figure><a title="BALL x PIT Review - Screenshot 5 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159601/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The base building is a different flavour of addictive; it keeps you wanting more, but gives you a break at the same time. A round of building and harvesting clears the mind and sets up the next run in the pit. Jumping back in is satisfying, but it’s also a good time to turn off, knowing your next go is ready to take you even further than before. A built-in reality check is a welcome addition to such a compulsive genre.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Ball x Pit is a tremendous brew of so many ideas it ought to collapse under the confusion. However, it operates in such perfect balance that it appeals both to the one-more-go instinct and to more cerebral planning and creativity. Kenny Sun Studios set itself a heck of a challenge but, fortunately, hasn’t dropped the ball.</p></section>

			<p>Earlier today, when we covered <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-2-remake-until-dawn-ps-plus-extra-october-2025/">Billbil-kun's report on Dealabs</a> that leaked a few of the games coming to the PS Plus Extra Games Catalogue, we wrote that the official announcement probably wasn't too far behind, and that if it didn't appear today, it would surely appear before the end of the week. Well, we were right the first time, as a new <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/10/15/playstation-plus-game-catalog-for-october-silent-hill-2-until-dawn-v-rising-yakuza-like-a-dragon-and-more/">PlayStation Blog post</a> confirmed most of the Dealabs report, with some additional announcements not in the report.</p>

Everything will also arrive, as predicted, next week, on October 21, 2025.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Magical Life Sim Witchbrook Delayed Into Next Year]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/witchbrook-delayed-2026</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/magical-life-sim-witchbrook-delayed-into-next-year.1325581/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Chucklefish and Robotality have announced that magical life sim&nbsp;<em>Witchbrook&nbsp;</em>won't be coming out in 2025 as originally planned.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1846700/view/501712599669276725" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a> on Steam, the two studios say that while they had originally planned to release the game in winter, you won't be able to play&nbsp;<em>Witchbrook&nbsp;</em>until 2026. This, they say, will give them the "time needed to ensure the world feels rich, immersive, and alive".</p>

<p>Despite this setback, Chucklefish and Robotality say that&nbsp;<em>Witchbrook&nbsp;</em>is "taking shape exactly as [they] hoped", and that the game will be "full of charm, depth, and detail" when you do finally get to check it out next year.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/witchbrook-delayed-school.jpg?itok=z3OFYLZK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/witchbrook-delayed-school.jpg?itok=Txx9GEYJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Witchbrook&nbsp;</em>won't be coming out in 2025, sadly.</figcaption></figure><p>To cushion the blow of the delay somewhat, Chucklefish and Robotality have released an interactive map that shows just how large&nbsp;<em>Witchbrook</em>'s playable area will be. You can check that map (which is interactive!) out <a href="https://www.witchbrook.com/map-of-mossport/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">right here</a>.</p>

<p>Incidentally, this isn't the magical life sim that was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hollow-knight-silksong-indie-delays" rel="nofollow">delayed as a result of&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>'s release</a>; that was&nbsp;<em>Little Witch in the Woods</em>, which went on to release on September 15th. I guess this is kind of like indie game convergent evolution.</p>

<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Witchbrook&nbsp;</em>is, it's a life sim in which you'll play "the newest resident witch in the bustling seaside city of Mossport". There, you'll find new people to befriend, spells to cast, and recipes to craft, as well as plenty of customization options for both you and your abode.</p>

<p>Naturally, you'll have plenty to do outside of the titular college as well. You'll be able to explore Mossport during your off-hours, playing games at the arcade or simply taking artful snapshots of the city with your camera.</p>




<p><em>Witchbrook&nbsp;</em>launches sometime in 2026 for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1846700/Witchbrook/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/witchbrook/9P54Q8W3TF4W" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and both Nintendo Switch consoles. Stay tuned for more on this one.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher Paradox and developer The Chinese Room have announced the PC specs you're going to need if you want to run&nbsp;<em>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2&nbsp;</em>when it launches next week.</p>

<p>As you can probably imagine, running the game at Ultra settings in 4K is going to take a pretty beefy rig, but if you're happy to make a few compromises, then a less powerful machine will probably do the trick.</p>

<p>Handily, the two studios provide seven different presets depending on what kind of level you want to run the game at, so you should be able to find something that works for you.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-pc-specs-combat.jpg?itok=v27gKSSS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-pc-specs-combat.jpg?itok=yVO5R_qK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</em>'s PC specs are finally here.</figcaption></figure><p>Here's all the PC spec info you're going to need if you want to run&nbsp;<em>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</em>. Bear in mind that all of these presets require 30GB of free storage, and you'll also need Windows 11 for all but the lowest preset, as well as 16GB RAM (8GB will suffice for Minimum).</p>

<h3>Minimum - 1080p at 30fps, Low preset</h3>

<ul><li>GPU: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 6GB,&nbsp;AMD Radeon RX 480 8GB, or Intel Arc A580 8GB</li>
	<li>CPU: Intel Core i3-8350K or AMD Ryzen 3 3300X</li>
</ul><h3>Recommended - 1080p at 60fps, High preset</h3>

</ul><h3>Ultra 2K DLSS - 1440p at 60fps, Ultra preset, DLSS enabled</h3>

<ul><li>GPU: Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 Ti 8GB or RTX 5060 8GB</li>
	<li>CPU: Intel Core i5-12600K or AMD Ryzen 5 5600X</li>
</ul><h3>Ultra 4K DLSS + FG 2X - 2160p at 60fps, Ultra preset, DLSS (Quality) and Frame Gen enabled</h3>

<ul><li>GPU: Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 12GB or RTX 5060 Ti 16GB</li>
	<li>CPU: Intel Core i7-13700K or AMD Ryzen 7 5800X3D</li>

	<li>CPU: Intel Core i7-13700K or AMD Ryzen 7 5800X3D</li>
</ul><p>Whew! That's a lot of presets. As you can see, later presets only list DLSS, which is why you won't see AMD cards as part of those listings; it hasn't yet been confirmed whether the game will support AMD's FSR technology or not.</p>

              <p>Microsoft first unveiled Windows 11 and its Pro version in 2021, and since then, the OS has become the go-to option for students, work professionals, creatives, gamers, and even casual users.</p>
<p>If you’ve been meaning to upgrade but don’t want to spend close to $200 on a license, we’ve found an affordable (and legitimate) route. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4452/">Stacksocial is currently offering a lifetime license for Microsoft Windows 11 Pro for just $15.</a> That’s a straightforward $184 discount on a one-and-done purchase.

<h2>A Wide Range of Built-In Productivity Features</h2>
<p>For $15, you’re getting full access to one of the most user-friendly operating systems out there. It comes with a bunch of productive features, such as snap layouts, better voice typing, virtual desktops, and built-in AI with Copilot.

Even better, there’s DirectX 12 Ultimate support to ensure a more immersive, high-performance gaming experience on compatible hardware.</p>
<p>However, there are some hardware and system requirements you need to meet before making the jump. Your device will need at least 4GB of RAM, 64GB of storage, a UEFI-based system with Secure Boot, and TPM 2.0 support. It also needs to be running Windows 10 or higher to complete the upgrade process. The display should be at least 9 inches diagonally with 720p resolution and 8 bits per color channel. Also, make sure you have a stable internet connection during the activation process to prevent any slowdowns.</p>

This deal takes $184 off the usual $199 price, letting you upgrade for just $15. That’s a massive 92% discount, but it might not last long.

            <title><![CDATA[From Hades to Dead Cells: The 7 Best Roguelites of All Time]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/best-roguelites-all-time/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/from-hades-to-dead-cells-the-7-best-roguelites-of-all-time.1325554/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>As a gamer, finding enough time to sit and enjoy a game can be tough. That’s especially true when you have responsibilities like a full-time job or being a parent. Luckily, there’s a specific genre of game that exists for this exact reason: roguelites. These games offer quick, pick-up-and-play action without much setup. But what games are the best roguelites of all time?</p>



<p>Overall, there are hundreds of these games to choose from over the years, but some stand out more than others. These are seven of the best roguelite games that you can pick up and play right now.</p>



<h2>What’s The Difference Between Roguelikes and Roguelites?</h2>



<p>You’ve probably heard people toss around “roguelike” and “roguelite” as though they mean the same thing. And while they do share many similarities, there are enough differences to make each game feel different. </p>



<p>Roguelikes are games that often stick to the formula of permadeath and procedurally-generated levels. Every run is a fresh start, so it’s all about your skill, learning tendencies, and getting a bit lucky.</p>



<p>Roguelites, on the other hand, add on to that formula. While they also follow the single-run strategy, they give players some sort of progression system. As you play, you’ll unlock abilities, new levels, characters, upgrades, and more to keep you coming back. </p>



<p>TL;DR: Roguelikes start you from zero every time, while roguelites let you grow a little with each run, making them easier for players to jump into and keep playing.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-best-rogulites-of-all-time">The Best Rogulites Of All Time</h2>



<h3>Dead Cells</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>A metroidvania-inspired Roguelite, Dead Cells is one of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dead-cells-gets-final-update-from-evil-empire/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the toughest games</a> you’ll find on this list. The game has you exploring an ever-changing castle, where the more you play, the easier it <em>should </em>get. As you play, you’ll unlock new levels, mutations, weapons, and abilities to help you out. Weapons like the War Spear and Panchuku&nbsp;will have you mowing through your enemies like a hot knife through butter. </p>



<p>There aren’t any checkpoints, meaning that once you die, it’s back to the beginning in a new corpse. It’ll be frustrating at times, but it’s the type of frustration that has you thinking you finally figured out how to make it to the end. </p>

<h3>Risk of Rain 2</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Risk of Rain 2 is a thrilling roguelite game that puts you in the shoes of a survivor who crash-lands on a hostile alien planet. The game is full of action and exploration, as you fight your way through randomly generated levels and collect powerful items and abilities. The game has a co-op mode that lets you play with up to three friends online. Each run in the game lasts about an hour, making it perfect for quick sessions.</p>



<hr>



<h3>Slay the Spire</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Slay the Spire is a unique roguelite game that combines card games and dungeon crawling. The game challenges you to build your own deck of cards and use them to fight your way through procedurally generated levels full of enemies and bosses. The game has four different characters to choose from, each with their own cards and abilities. The game also has a daily challenge mode that offers new twists and rewards every day. The best part? Each run in the game takes about an hour or less.</p>



<hr>



<h3>Hades</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Hades is a critically acclaimed roguelite game that tells the story of Zagreus, the son of Hades, who tries to escape from the underworld. The game features stunning graphics and voice acting, as well as an engaging combat system that lets you wield different weapons and powers from the gods. The game also has a rich narrative that unfolds as you interact with various characters and learn more about their stories. Each run in the game takes about 30 minutes to an hour, depending on your skill level.</p>



<p>If you wrap up your time in Hades, you can then jump into the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hades-2-highest-rated-game-of-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">equally impressive sequel</a>, Hades 2.</p>



<hr>



<h3>Enter the Gungeon</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Enter the Gungeon is a hilarious roguelite game that parodies various pop culture references and tropes. The game is set in a dungeon full of guns and bullets, where you play as one of four adventurers who seek to find a legendary gun that can kill their past. The game has over 300 different guns and items to discover and use, as well as dozens of secrets and hidden rooms to explore. The game also has a co-op mode that lets you play with one friend locally. Each run in the game takes about an hour or less.</p>



<hr>



<h3>Absolum</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>The newest game on this list, Absolum, is one of the<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/absolum-review-a-must-play-roguelite/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> best games in the genre’s history</a> without doing anything to reinvent the wheel. The game follows four heroes working to save the world from Sun King Azra, who has used the world’s fear of magic to take over and enslave wizards. Each character offers unique abilities and skill sets that differ enough to make you want to try each out. Each run features route branching along with upgrade changes and enemy spawns to keep the game feeling fresh, no matter how many hours you put in. Add in the multiplayer aspect, and you have a game worthy of your time.</p>



<hr>



<h3>The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is one of the most popular roguelite games ever made. The game follows Isaac, a young boy who escapes from his abusive mother into his basement full of horrors. The game is dark and twisted, but also funny and creative, as it features hundreds of items and enemies inspired by biblical references and other sources. The game also has multiple endings and unlockable characters that add replay value. Each run in the game takes about 30 minutes or less. </p>



<p>If you want more Binding of Isaac content, you can pick up the recent Repentance DLC that adds enough content to make it an entirely new game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a> team at EA and Battlefield Studios is shrinking ticket sizes for their large-scale Conquest multiplayer game mode, but players aren’t sold that these changes will improve the pace of matches.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">An update to the structure of Conquest matches arrived in <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1978462075488817479" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an official post</a> from the Battlefield Comms X/Twitter account. It details blanket changes across every Conquest map in Battlefield 6, as the developers aim to ensure matches “finish at a more natural pace.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">To achieve this, BF Studios says it has reduced ticket sizes – which essentially represent each team's available reinforcements – from 1000 tickets to a unique ticket goal for each map. These range from 900 tickets on maps like Siege of Cairo and Empire State to 700 tickets on maps like Mirak Valley and Operation Firestorm. You can see the full breakdown below.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">New Conquest Ticket Sizes in Battlefield 6</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li>Siege of Cairo from 1000 to 900</li><li>Empire State from 1000 to 900</li><li>Iberian Offensive from 1000 to 900</li><li>Liberation Peak From 1000 to 800</li><li>Manhattan Bridge From 1000 to 800</li><li>Operation Firestorm From 1000 to 700</li><li>New Sobek City from 1000 to 900</li><li>Mirak Valley from 1000 to 700</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">"Previously, many rounds were hitting the time limit instead of ending when one team ran out of tickets," the post explains. "We'll keep monitoring feedback and data to make sure the flow of each match feels right."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">BF Studios says its goal is to keep matches moving at a more natural pace, but players aren’t convinced that reduced ticket requirements are what Battlefield 6 needs. In fact, many now say they're happy to play out 1000-ticket matches and enjoy the stress of last-minute comebacks. What's really hampering the pace for many isn't large ticket requirement that result in the timer running out – it's the timer itself.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">why have a time limit? what’s wrong with longer games? i swear back in the day a conquest game used to run for 30-40 minutes</p>— reece (@reece_us) <a href="https://twitter.com/reece_us/status/1978462255608914183?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 15, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">"The easier solution would just be to remove the time limits," content creator <a href="https://x.com/MoiDawg/status/1978464857952284858" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@MoiDawg replied</a>. "Close games are incredible and this artifical time limit ruins comebacks. Just let us play Conquest. I'm not joining a Conquest game thinking it'll be over in 20 minutes. Huge L."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other Battlefield 6 fans agree, with many already taking to the replies of the post to recommend simply increasing the timer or removing it altogether. Some are surprised to see any changes at all, explaining that they have yet to see a match reach the time limit even after dozens of hours of Conquest play time. There are some who report experiencing matches that run through the time limit, but even they believe slightly longer matches could remedy the problem altogether.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Couldn’t just add 10 minutes to the timer?" one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1o7c0aw/comment/njmhpb6/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit user suggests</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"God forbid a conquest match lasts more than 15 minutes," another <a href="https://x.com/son_excla/status/1978462798876168497" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">X reply adds</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, BF Studios added in <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1978473627235561693" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a separate post</u></a> that the Out of Bounds timer for vehicles on Battlefield 6’s Manhattan Bridge map in Conquest and Escalation have been increased from five to 10 seconds. While the community already appears to be accepting this change with open arms, the announcement post itself has already been met with more calls to revert the new Conquest ticket changes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players who load into a Battlefield 6 Conquest match are currently told to expect the average match to last 20 minutes, though games have been known to last anywhere from 15 to 30 minutes. Today's hotfix is already in effect, so it's unclear if BF Studios and EA have any plans to walk back the changes quite yet.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield 6 launched for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X | S October 10.

That's certainly the case in new clip posted by Rebs Gaming.</p><p>In the sequence, the Battlefield 6 player XxOsiris187xX ejects from a jet high above the battlefield and just as they go to open their parachute, another jet appears below them. The player lands on this jet, walks to the front, dome-shots the pilot, and then gets into the hijacked jet to make a getaway. It's seriously impressive stuff that you need to see to believe--take a look for yourself in the clip below.</p><p>There have been numerous astonishing Battlefield 6 clips that have emerged following the game's big launch on October 10. In another clip, the professional player FaZe Scope uses a drone to vault himself into the sky, then whips out a sniper rifle and takes out a helicopter. Take a look:</p><p>Battlefield 6 reportedly <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-has-almost-cod-like-launch-with-6-5-million-copies-sold-in-first-days-report/1100-6535428/" data-ref-id="1100-6535428">sold 7 million copies over its first five days</a>, which one analyst says is close to Call of Duty-like levels. It remains to be seen if Battlefield Studios can keep the momentum and engagement going, but the company has seemingly laid a strong foundation to build on. </p><p>Next up for Battlefield 6 is the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-season-1-release-date-and-free-content-revealed/1100-6535112/" data-ref-id="1100-6535112">launch of Season 1 on October 28</a>, and that's also the day that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-battle-royale-release-date-trailer-details/1100-6533631/" data-ref-id="1100-6533631">the game's battle royale mode is rumored to launch. </a></p><p>As for the competitive landscape, EA veteran Patrick Soderlund's Embark Studios is launching its new multiplayer shooter Arc Raiders on October 30, while <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-everything-we-know-about-rumored-black-ops-2-sequel/1100-6529073/" data-ref-id="1100-6529073">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 comes out on November 14.</a></p>

"This isn't just a plush. This is a lifestyle choice. A statement piece. A co-pilot for every late-night quest and awkward snack run. It's satire you can hug--and proof that The Outer Worlds 2 lives beyond the game."</p><p>The Moon Man Couch-Panion is three feet tall and includes a popcorn bucket holder in its head, weird stress-ball squishy hands, and straps designed to hold a TV remote and an Xbox Wireless Controller. It's also got a creepy face that only a nightmare could love. And while these Couch-Panions aren't going to heading to stores, fans will get their chance to win one.</p><p>Starting today and going through November 16, Microsoft is running a contest that will let ten fans receive a Moon Man Couch-Panion of their own.

                <p>Bleach fans can look forward to a second video game based on the popular manga and anime series, as Crunchyroll has announced Bleach: Soul Resonance. This new dive into the franchise is an action-RPG that features the Bleach cast as playable characters and combat where you directly control their blades. It'll be launching later this year for iOS and Android mobile devices.</p><p>Developer Nuverse says that the game will feature "innovative" swordplay, as players can wield their blades against enemies by moving their fingers across the screen. Wherever your finger goes, the blade follows, and the developer says that each Zanpakuto sword has a unique feel to its design, just like the weapons seen in the anime. Switching between characters will also allow players to pull off powerful combos, and creating a versatile lineup to make the most of character synergies is another key gameplay element.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E19pF5EFbWw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/E19pF5EFbWw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>So far, it looks like the roster will include all the characters you'd expect from a Bleach game--from protagonist Ichigo Kurosaki to Soul Society captains like Byakuya Kuchiki and Kenpachi Zaraki--and pre-registration is now open for Bleach: Soul Resonance. If you'd prefer to play a game set in that universe of Soul Reapers and Hollows, you can grab <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0DP3MVFJC,B0DP3NQZZP&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bleach: Rebirth of Souls</a> on Xbox Series X|S and PS5 right now. The fighting game released earlier this year, and unlike your typical 3D arena-fighter anime game, this one features a layered and complex gameplay system that's built around momentum and last-minute comebacks.</p><p>Bleach made a grand return in 2022, and after an extended hiatus, the anime adaptation picked up right where it left off. So far, three seasons of Bleach's final storyline--The Thousand-Year Blood War--have aired, and a fourth season is currently in production.</p>

			<p>One of the best narratives in gaming to come out of 2024, and one of the best games from 2024 that initially launched on PC and Nintendo Switch, is finally arriving on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S later this year. 1000xResist from the new Canadian indie studio Sunset Visitor will arrive on the rest of the current-gen consoles next month, on November 4, 2025.</p>



<p>Also, for any Xbox players <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-subscription-cancel-page-overwhelmed-after-game-pass-price-hike/">who didn't rush to cancel their Xbox Game Pass subscriptions</a>, you'll be able to check out 1000xResist when it arrives on Xbox consoles through Game Pass.</p>

<iframe title="1000xRESIST - Coming to Xbox Game Pass, Xbox Series X|S, and PlayStation 5 - November 4th" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/odxmZdBFIDM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>1000xResist is set 1,000 years into the future, and sees you step into a clone named Iris when humanity is on the verge of its end. Iris is one of six sisters, and throughout the game's narrative, you peel back the mystery behind ALLMOTHER, the new ruler over the last remaining members of humanity, and unweave her web of lies.</p>



<p>At its heart, amidst all the sci-fi dressings, 1000xResist is a deep narrative about familial relationships and shared trauma, and was easily one of the best games to come out of 2024. It was nominated for several awards, though arguably was criminally overlooked compared to other indie titles that got a little more recognition last year.</p>

              <p>Shooters rely on a pretty fundamental thing: You aim your gun at something, you shoot, virtual bullets hit a target. Unfortunately for those diving into <i>Battlefield 6</i>, that’s not always working out according to plan. Bullets, it would seem, are sometimes just passing through targets. A hotfix was issued to deal with the problem for now, but what was going on?</p>      <p>In a pair of posts to X (<a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6-dev-confirms-the-ghost-bullet-problem-is-very-real-amid-bloom-debates-it-is-commonly-observed-with-the-target-being-visibly-hit-but-no-damage-is-confirmed/">h/t <i>GamesRadar</i></a>), <i>Battlefield 6</i>’s principal game designer Florian (<a href="https://x.com/DRUNKKZ3">Drunkkz3</a>) stated that the issue seemed to involve the target being “visibly hit (blood splatters) but no damage is confirmed in the HUD.” The Battlefield Comms X account confirmed that it wasn’t a persistent issue, and it’s not a problem across all of the guns in the game’s arsenal. Only certain combos of attachments and weapons seem to trigger it. The devs issued a hotfix to deal with it.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">We're aware of reports of rare cases where bullets may not register damage correctly when hitting enemies.</p> <p>Following our investigation, we found this was related to certain weapon attachment combinations. A hotfix has been deployed to address known instances.</p> <p>We'll continue to…</p> <p>— Battlefield Comms (@BattlefieldComm) <a href="https://twitter.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1978400189476896968?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 15, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <h2>Ghost bullets don’t have to do with bloom or network issues</h2> <p>It’s a hotly debated and discussed topic: How virtual guns behave, how they recoil, how bullets get distributed in a given area. The recent <i>Battlefield</i> ghost bullet issue has kicked up some discourse around this, but <a href="https://x.com/DRUNKKZ3/status/1978415319002603851">according to Florian</a>, this present issue has nothing to do with bloom (where a recoil pattern grows in size the longer you’re shooting to simulate the struggle to keep a gun steady the longer you fire).</p> <p>Furthermore, networking bugs (or just a slow internet connection) can also result in some unwanted aiming mishaps. <a href="https://x.com/DRUNKKZ3/status/1978415667914096645">Florian also responded</a> to a comment wondering if the ghost bullets were the result of something as simple as someone having a crappy internet connection. “Some hit reg issues <i>can</i> happen as a result of bad internet or the game server performance being problematic,” he said, “but you will get performance icons at the top left when that happens.” The videos showing off the ghost bullets, notably, don’t show any such icons. So while we may not know exactly what <i>was </i>causing the ghost bullets, at least we know a few things that weren’t.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It appears that Battlefield 6’s future naval warfare content is already in development, according to datamined files found by Insider Gaming.</p>



<p>According to some strings of code obtained by Insider Gaming, it appears that several different vehicles are currently in development for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-bloom-in-battlefield-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a>, including Jet Skis and RHIBs (Rigid-Hulled Inflatable Boats).</p>



<p>Both strings of code were attached to the multiplayer files, suggesting that work on naval combat is already well underway in some capacity. The lines read:</p>



<p>Game/GlacierMP/Kits/Vehicle_Neutral_Boat_JetSki<br>Game/GlacierMP/Kits/Vehicle_Neutral_Boat_RHIB</p>



<p>For those out of the loop, “Glacier” is the codename for Battlefield 6, whereas “MP” is the abbreviation for multiplayer.</p>



<p>However, we’ve also heard from the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-teases-naval-warfare-is-coming-to-battlefield-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6 developers themselves</a> that naval combat requests, which have been highly requested by the community, “have not gone unnoticed.” </p>



<p>As for when naval combat will be introduced in Battlefield 6, it is unclear. However, judging by the Season 1 content, which appears to lack maps with vast amounts of water, we might be waiting for a while. That said, a fully dedicated season to naval warfare is something that Battlefield has done before and could easily do again with Battlefield 6.</p>



<p>You can read Insider Gaming’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-review-multiplayer-campaig" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">review of Battlefield 6</a>, for which we gave it a 4/5 due to the game’s somewhat lackluster campaign. </p>



<p>What do you think of Battlefield 6 adding naval warfare? Let us know through the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>&nbsp;discussion.</p>

Players can expect to build lasting friendships, explore mystical environments, discover forgotten secrets, and even find love, all while learning to harness magic.</p><p>"We wanted to create a living, breathing world for you to explore," Chucklefish continued, and how it wanted a game full of "spellbinding stories, captivating quests, and enchanting systems."</p><p>To showcase the scale of the experience, the team also revealed the first look at the Map of Mossport, highlighting just how expansive the game world is. Every colored area on the map is fully playable--from the trails of Shadhollow Forest to the shores of Parasol Sands. The bustling Mossport High Street offers festivals and markets, while the Student Village hums with youthful energy.</p><p>The team promises more updates soon, including a deep dive into character customization and a new issue of The Witchbrook Oracle. Until then, Chucklefish and its co-developers at Robotality invite fans to get ready for the magic: "We can't wait to share more. Welcome to Mossport!"</p><p>Looking ahead, the extra development time has opened doors to exciting new opportunities, including support for additional platforms and languages. Witchbrook is now planned for release on PC, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and Nintendo Switch 2, with more platforms to be confirmed.</p>

<p>The update packs in all the stuff you'd expect to find in a Switch 2 patch, promising improved frame rate and resolution, <em>and</em> upgrades to the shadow quality and anti-aliasing.</p>
<p>We don't have any specifics on what any of the above look like in their improved state (here's hoping for 60fps), but we'll always welcome news of things moving in the right direction.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067ogxinl&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>836k</span></a></p>

<p>In its initial form, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/ark_survival_evolved">Ark: Survival Evolved</a> was a bit of a mess on the Switch. The port was marred by technical issues, making the whole thing feel a little <em>too</em> ambitious for Nintendo's humble console. By all accounts, things started to turn around in the later 'Ultimate Survivor Edition' (it popped up in one of our earlier <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/community-22-switch-games-we-missed-as-recommended-by-you">Games We Missed</a> community features), so here's hoping that today's Switch 2 update keeps things on the up and up.</p>
