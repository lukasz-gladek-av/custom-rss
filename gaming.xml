            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>After some teasing last week, Stern Pinball has officially unveiled its pricey <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-day-firered-leafgreen-switch-2-port-eshop-online-2000668213"><em>Pokémon</em></a>-themed tables with a snazzy trailer. The question now is: Are you willing to pay $7,000 to fling steel balls at Meowth’s face?</p> <p>On February 13, Stern Pinball released a new trailer showing off its $7,000 <em>Pokémon</em> table, which features a large HD screen that plays clips from the anime series as well as a highly interactive playfield that includes a moving Pikachu and a Meowth balloon. Here’s the video:</p>  <p>Stern says players will be able to capture Pokémon while playing this pinball machine. And if you have a Stern account and log in via the app while playing, you’ll be able to collect Pokémon and check them out later on the app. As you’d expect from a modern pinball machine, the playfield is jam-packed with spinners, ramps, and targets to hit, all of which will cause Pikachu to react to how you’re playing.</p>

 <p>“Today we’re proud to finally deliver the long-awaited&nbsp;<em>Pokémon</em> by Stern Pinball machine,” <a href="https://sternpinball.com/game/pokemon/">said Stern Pinball president</a> and CEO Seth Davis in a press release. “This game is a true celebration of nostalgia, craftsmanship, and the enduring adventure of Pokémon – brought to life in a whole new way through immersive pinball gameplay, thrilling battles, and the timeless excitement of catching <em>Pokémon</em>.”</p> <p>This all sounds cool, and if you find one at your local arcade or bar, it will likely be a lot of fun. However, if you want to buy one of these machines to stick in your basement or gaming room, you’ll need to drop at least $7,000 on the base model. There’s also a premium model that features different artwork, enhanced audio and visuals, and a fancier backglass, among other bonuses. Those don’t come cheap. This upgraded version will cost $9,700. Meanwhile, a limited-edition version of the table will set you back $13,000!</p>

 <p>If you can afford to grab this <em>Pokémon</em> table, first off, congrats on doing well in life. <a href="https://sternpinball.com/game/pokemon/">And also, Stern is taking orders for its newly revealed <em>Pokémon</em> pinball machine right now on its website.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Highguard </strong>is the latest free-to-play first-person shooter to hit the market, and if things keep going the way they are now, it'll also be the latest free-to-play first-person shooter that was shut down after being unable to break through as a massive hit right at launch. After its trailer at <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/highguard-the-game-awards-announced-titanfall-apex-legends/">The Game Awards</a></strong> failed to land with players, and the weeks of silence that followed did nothing to help, when it arrived, before players even made it through the tutorial, <a href="https://wccftech.com/highguard-ripped-apart-steam-user-reviews/">they were leaving negative reviews</a> on Steam.</p>



<p>Even though it had over <a href="https://wccftech.com/highguard-launch-live-wildlight-entertainment/"><strong>97K</strong> concurrent players</a> on Steam when it launched, those numbers quickly dwindled, and now, barely two weeks after it launched, developer <strong>Wildlight Entertainment</strong> confirmed that it had laid off several members of its staff, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/two-weeks-after-launch-highguard-developer-wildlight-has-already-had-layoffs-reportedly-cutting-most-of-the-team/">those impacted confirming that "<em>most</em>" of the studio had been cut.</a></p>



<p>One of those impacted developers, <strong>Josh Sobel</strong>, a technical artist who worked on Highguard, took to X (formerly Twitter) to write an extended reflection on how the game's launch went, what happened, and how he and several of his former colleagues are now out of a job and back looking for work in this volatile market.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>After starting by discussing just how much everyone at the studio believed in the game, and how high its praise was from internal feedback, Sobel began digging into when things turned sour.</p>



<p>"<em>But then the trailer came out, and it was all downhill from there</em>," Sobel begins. "<em>Content creators love to point out the bias in folks who give positive previews after being flown out for an event, but ignore the fact that when their negative-leaning content gets 10x the engagement of the positive, they’ve got just as much incentive to lean into a disingenuous direction, whether consciously or not.</em>"</p>



<p>Sobel went on to discuss how he and some of his colleagues were directly targeted after making celebratory posts about the game's reveal and its subsequent launch, with a slew of hate and vitriol sent towards them. </p>



<p>"<em>They laughed at me for being proud of the game, told me to get out the McDonald’s applications, and mocked me for listing having autism in my bio, which they seemed to think was evidence the game would be 'woke trash.'"</em></p>



<p>On the topic of the game's poor marketing in its lead-up to launch, Sobel didn't directly comment because he felt it was not his place. He also made the point that we can never know if Highguard would have been received the same way, or more positively, if it hadn't gone ahead with its Game Awards trailer, or even if it had submitted a different trailer to the show. </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Highguard | Official Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/y_6tjMvckZ0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>It should be noted that not long after user reviews on Steam began piling in, Wildlight's chief executive officer, <strong>Dusty Welch</strong>, apologized for the game's marketing up to that point and took responsibility for its "<em>poor</em>" trailer at The Game Awards.</p>



<p>"<em>Look, I wish Highguard had been received better. I wish the feedback had been better. Part of that's on us, right? We didn't put our heads in the sand. We, as a team, saw the feedback. We're gamers ourselves. We're online ourselves reading the feedback</em>," Welch said in an interview. "<em>I think, ultimately, we could have made a different trailer—a better trailer that wasn't about entertaining, which is what we think The Game Awards was about. We could have made something that did a better job of highlighting the unique loop of the game. So that's on us. We take that, but the team is resilient.</em>"</p>



<p>Sobel continued, digging into how the public's response to Highguard was to judge it before they had even touched it. "<em><strong>We were turned into a joke from minute one</strong>, largely due to false assumptions about a million-dollar ad placement, which even prominent journalists soon began to state as fact</em>."</p>



<p>"<em><strong>Within minutes, it was decided: this game was dead on arrival,</strong> and creators now had free ragebait content for a month. Every one of our videos on social media got downvoted to hell. Comments sections were flooded with copy/paste meme phrases such as 'Concord 2' and 'Titanfall 3 died for this.' </em><strong><em>At launch, we received over 14k review bombs from users with less than an hour of playtime. Many didn't even finish the required tutorial.</em>"</strong></p>



<p>Sobel does add that Highguard's current state is not fully the fault of the players who decided the game sucked before giving it a shot, or the subsection of the content creator economy that has been built off of negative content. But he does say that it played a role.</p>



<p>"<em>I’m not saying our failure is purely the fault of gamer culture and that the game would have thrived without the negative discourse, but it absolutely played a role. <strong>All products are at the whims of the consumers, and the consumers put absurd amounts of effort into slandering Highguard. And it worked</strong></em>."</p>



<p>Sobel concluded by remarking that if we keep seeing new multiplayer games get beaten out of the space by pre-conceived notions based on a bad trailer, we'll stop seeing new multiplayer projects like Highguard even get their chance. Developers will stop taking the chance on a new upstart studio looking to try something new in the triple-A space, because it's too much of a risk to put their livelihoods on the line. "<em><strong>Innovation is on life support</strong>.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>Even if Highguard had a rocky launch, our independent, self-published, dev-led studio full of passionate people just trying to make a fun game, with zero AI, and zero corporate oversight…deserved better than this. <strong>We deserved the bare minimum of not having our downfall be gleefully manifested</strong>.</em>"</p>



<p>Nothing is going to stop players from making snap decisions based on a trailer. If a game doesn't resonate with them in an instant, many are quick to categorize their feelings for that game as negative and move on, sticking with what they already know. Especially when it comes to free-to-play games, where it's understood that these games don't just want your money for cosmetics, they want to consume as much of your gaming time as possible.</p>



<p>It's up to developers to catch your eye and convince you that their game is worth investing that kind of time in. But it's also fair to say that leaving a negative review before you've finished the tutorial should not be a weight placed on any game. You might have made up your mind about the game in seconds, but that doesn't mean you can speak on its quality with any real authority. No one would pay someone any attention if they tried calling themselves a 'critic' or 'reviewer' after only playing five minutes of a game.</p>



<p>But even if Highguard didn't get lambasted with negative reviews right off the jump, it's difficult to say that it would have found success. For as big as free-to-play live service shooters are, there's a great deal of fatigue players are feeling around these games, and ones trying to enter the genre are facing the brunt of that fatigue.</p>



<p>We'll never be able to pin down one single reason Highguard's launch has gone this way, but Sobel's comments do provide insight into how developers see these launches play out from their end, and how hurtful it is to see people decide they've failed before they even started.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Maestro Media has announced an official card game based on James Cameron's<em> Avatar</em>. The new game, <em>Avatar: Pandora's Power</em>, pits players in a fast-paced battle for control of the alien world of Pandora.</p><h2>The <em>Avatar: Pandora's Power</em> Card Game Announcement</h2><p>According to a report <a href="https://icv2.com/articles/news/view/61628/maestro-media-licenses-avatar-new-tabletop-game" rel="nofollow">by ICV2</a>, <em>Avatar: Pandora's Power</em> is an asymmetric card game designed for two players. Players take on the role of either the RDA or a faction of Na'Vi as they battle across various locations on Pandora. The core gameplay isn't a deckbuilding experience but lane-battling, similar to a MOBA. The first person to reach 30 points is declared the winner.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/avatar-fire-and-ash-film-photo.jpg?itok=SDT80Sh3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="750" height="421">

  </picture><p>Maestro Media's CEO Javon Frazier explained the more asymmetric elements of the card game.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>"The RDA and the Na’vi do not play the same game, and they should not. One side is focused, aggressive, and extractive. The other is adaptive, interconnected, and rooted in the land. The asymmetry is the experience. Every match becomes a tense, strategic story about control, resistance, and what it means to fight for a world worth protecting.”</p></blockquote><p><em>Avatar: Pandora's Power</em> is the latest Maestro Media project adapting popular and beloved media properties. Their past work includes the Kickstarter campaign for the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/disney-afternoon-rewind-kickstarter-campaign-blows-up-with-millennial-nostalgia" rel="nofollow"><em>Disney Afternoon Rewind Collection</em></a>, a board game adaptation of the mobile title, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/maestro-media-announces-clash-of-clans-epic-raid-board-game-based-on-hit-mobile-game" rel="nofollow"><em>Clash of Clans</em></a>, a tabletop adaptation of the Stanley Kubrick film, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/2001-space-odyssey-board-game-tasks-you-with-outsmarting-hal-9000" rel="nofollow"><em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em></a>, and a board game based on <em>The Smurfs</em>.</p><p>Curiously, <em>Avatar: Pandora's Power</em> is one of few board game adaptations of James Cameron's blockbuster films. Despite spanning three feature films dating back to 2009, Avatar has very little multimedia presence outside of a few tie-in comics. The last board game release was <em>Avatar: The Board Game</em> released by Mega Games in 2010, which currently sits at 4.8/10 on Board Game Geek.</p><p>At the time of writing, there is no release date or MSRP for <em>Avatar: Pandora's Power</em>.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/mewgenics-edmund-mcmillen-roguelike-impressions-2000666865"><i><span>Mewgenics</span></i></a><span>, the new tactical RPG roguelike about cat breeding, has come under a bit of fire during its launch week for its long list of voice cameos. Among </span><a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/252481/mewgenics/credits/windows/"><span>the eclectic group</span></a><span> of people who do the various “meow”s in the game are a fair number of content creators, including husband-and-wife podcast hosts Ethan and Hila Klein, both of whom have expressed </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qidsNawR9TE"><span>pro-Israel views in regards to its ongoing conflict with Palestine</span></a><span>. Hila was born in Israel and was required by law to </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytOl5hbTrCY"><span>serve in the Israel Defense Forces at 18,</span></a><span> albeit not in a combat role. After some criticism of their presence in the game on social media, the developers have responded.</span></p> <p><span>In an interview with </span><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/edmund-mcmillen-on-assembling-mewgenics-meow-cameo-list-the-inclusion-of-people-with-clashing-ideologies-felt-appropriate"><i><span>Rock Paper Shotgun</span></i></a><span>, developer Edmund McMillen explained that the giant list of meowers was accumulated over several years, with Ethan Klein’s contribution coming together four years before the game launched.</span></p> <p><span>“I wanted the game to feature a huge array of iconic voices I’ve been hearing echoing across the internet for most of my time making games,” McMillen told </span><i><span>RPS</span></i><span>. “As some probably noticed I was [pretty] all over the place when it came to cameos and did my best to include and keep ones that clashed or kinda counterbalanced each other.”</span></p>

 <p><span>This counterbalancing, as McMillen calls it, means recruiting people with different views, such as iDubbbz and Anisa Jombha, who have </span><a href="https://x.com/overzealots_/status/2018074085964575102"><span>publicly supported Palestine</span></a><span>, to balance out people like Klein. iDubbbz and Klein have been </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NyB85pVw-v4"><span>publicly feuding</span></a><span> after the former released a video criticizing the latter’s stance on Israel. McMillen says he contacted both parties before </span><i><span>Mewgenics</span></i><span>’ launch to make sure they knew the other would be in the game.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Now that </span><i><span>Mewgenics </span></i><span>has </span><a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/mewgenics-has-some-problematic-meows-ethan-klein-hila-klein.1431916/"><span>gotten pushback for including Klein</span></a><span>, he says it’s “sad” that some might be “</span><span>so put off by the idea of an inclusion of someone they don’t like so much that they will never play the game,”</span><span> though he doesn’t engage with the fact that at the heart of this disagreement is a literal genocide.</span></p>

 <p><span>“I understand we live in a time where a meow from someone who has different beliefs as you is scary and frustrating, confusing and controversial…” McMillen said, “but it felt interesting so I decided to explore it. Also, I should probably point out that I don’t share the same opinions as, well, probably any of the people we included. If I only included people who share the same exact opinions as me, I’d be the only one meowing in the game.”</span></p>

 <p><span>McMillen says that someone who was bothered by a “problematic meow” would probably not enjoy </span><i><span>Mewgenics </span></i><span>anyway, though he says that if you do still play the game, you can simply throw any offending cat in the trash and go about your way. </span></p>

            <link>https://gameinformer.com/2026/02/13/konami-promises-numerous-new-castlevania-products-for-40th-anniversary</link>
            <guid>1435717</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>An unexpected publisher stepped into the spotlight during <a href="https://gameinformer.com/state-of-play/2026/02/12/everything-announced-at-the-february-playstation-state-of-play" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="2341a4a8-a8a9-4b6a-b81a-622fd5e9d7be" data-entity-substitution="canonical">yesterday's PlayStation State of Play presentation</a>. That publisher was Konami, a once-prominent developer and publisher of video games that, in recent years, has come under fire from gamers for largely neglecting its multiple iconic franchises. Yesterday's State of Play served as a reemergence party of sorts for the publisher, as the company announced multiple projects, including the <a href="https://gameinformer.com/state-of-play/2026/02/12/metal-gear-solid-master-collection-vol-2-finally-frees-guns-of-the" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3bdf4820-12c3-42a2-b7b0-cd57df1ba12d" data-entity-substitution="canonical">Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 2</a> and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/state-of-play/2026/02/12/castlevania-belmonts-curse-made-by-konami-and-the-dead-cells-devs-launches" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="f6ac4864-5c64-4c84-94d3-3d3870af84fe" data-entity-substitution="canonical">Castlevania: Belmont's Curse</a>. Fans expressed excitement after learning these iconic franchises still have pulses, and today, it would seem Castlevania may not only have a pulse, but potentially a new lease on life.</p><p>Following its block on the State of Play, Konami updated its <a href="https://www.konami.com/games/castlevania/eu/en/#games">Castlevania Portal Site</a> with the following message regarding Castlevania's 40th anniversary:</p><div><p>The doors of Castlevania open once more.</p><p>This year marks the 40th anniversary since the original ‘Akumajō Dracula’ first saw the light of day. In this commemorative year, “Castlevania” will be revived.</p><p>First up is this title: ‘Castlevania: Belmont's Curse’.</p><p>We couldn’t think in other studios to work together rather than Evil Empire and Motion Twin, studios brimming with talent and passion, to deliver a new exploration-based 2D action game that captures the essence of Castlevania while bringing fresh innovation.</p><p>This is the beginning of numerous new products around Castlevania.</p><p>Look forward to the return of the magnificent “nightmare” lurking in the darkness.</p><p>- Castlevania series Production Team</p></div><p>In addition to this message, Konami also released a YouTube video featuring the official Castlevania 40th anniversary logo, which plays off the key art from the original Castlevania. It also features a ton of Castlevania imagery, which could potentially hint at what's next for the franchise. You can view that video below:</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lsIye_bWY_8"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lsIye_bWY_8" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>The last true Castlevania release arrived in 2014, with Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2. Since then, Castlevania has crossed over with Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, Vampire Survivors, and Dead Cells, but the series has been largely dormant outside of retro collections, re-releases, and cameos in other games. That will change later this year when Castlevania: Belmont's Curse arrives on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2026/02/13/konami-promises-numerous-new-castlevania-products-for-40th-anniversary]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://aftermath.site/diablo-iv-blood-pc-contest-interview/</link>
            <guid>1435711</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>Back in 2023, a (slightly) more innocent time before Microsoft <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-activision-blizzard-layoffs-survival-report/"><u>ravaged its games studios</u></a> <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-lays-off-1900-people-at-activision-blizzard-xbox/"><u>with layoffs</u></a> and made itself into <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-bds-games-journalism/"><u>a BDS priority target</u></a>, Blizzard held <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/a-gaming-pc-infused-with-real-human-blood-crowns-diablo-4s-most-unhinged-pr-stunt-yet-a-666-quart-blood-drive/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>a competition</u></a>: To promote <em>Diablo IV</em>’s second season, it raffled off a PC "infused with real human blood in its liquid cooling" as part of a blood drive seeking 666 quarts of the red goop that keeps us all alive. I was desperate to know more. How much blood? Whose blood? Can blood reliably and sustainably cool a PC? And, again, <em>whose blood</em>?</p><p>At the time, answers proved elusive. Blizzard PR failed to reply to my requests for additional details, and a person I reached out to at Corsair – an expert, albeit not with regard to this particular PC – did not seem interested in discussing the infernal blood engine’s more theoretical aspects. So, dejected, I called off the hunt. But then, last week, via the replies to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jaymcastello.bsky.social/post/3mcxhgglmb22a?ref=aftermath.site"><u>a Bluesky post</u></a> by freelance writer (and <a href="https://aftermath.site/author/jay/"><u>occasional Aftermath contributor</u></a>) Jay Castello, I learned that the winner of the competition had semi-recently surfaced on Reddit. Once again, the game was afoot.&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote>
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/diablo4/comments/1krp8jo/i_won_the_blood_pc_yes_the_one_from_season_2_ama/?ref=aftermath.site">I Won The Blood PC (Yes, The One From Season 2) AMA!</a><br> by
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Storms888/?ref=aftermath.site">u/Storms888</a> in
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/diablo4/?ref=aftermath.site">diablo4</a>
</blockquote>
</figure><p>Turns out, Blizzard’s diabolical blood PC went to <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/storms888?ref=aftermath.site"><u>a streamer who goes by the handle Storms888</u></a>. He received it at the tail end of November 2023, and – despite or perhaps because of the blood – it’s still going strong.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“The PC is virtually perfect,” Storms888 told Aftermath. “I haven't seen any drops in performance since the day I got it. … It’s incredible for streaming/recording. Right now I've been streaming<em> Battlefield 6 </em>at ultra settings with easily over 200+ [frames per second].”</p><p>Unsurprisingly, given that pure, thick, coagulation-prone blood seems like it’d be an awful coolant, there’s probably some smoke and mirrors happening here.</p><p>“It appears that the coolant is mostly regular standard coolant and that they had added red blood cells inside of it,” said Storms888. “They did not specify what the ratio was, but it's dark red.”</p><figure><figcaption><span>Storms888</span></figcaption></figure><p>Whose blood, though? Sadly, that, much like blood, is unclear.&nbsp;</p><p>"There is not [information about who exactly the blood came from]," Storms888 said. "There was a donor slip that specifically said it was a confirmed blood sample/donation, but that was all."</p><p>But OK, say something goes wrong, or the blood-tinged coolant loses its luster, as all things do with time? Don’t worry: Blizzard thought of that.</p><p>“[Blizzard] did not specify any need to replace it,” said Storms888, “although they did give me a replacement vial/bottle of blood. ... This did leak a ton though. I had to put the bottle in a separate bag.”</p><p>For reasons that probably should be obvious by now, upgrading the blood PC is out of the question.</p><p>“I have not upgraded it,” said Storms888, “and yes, the custom nature of it does play a role. I don't want to change any aspect of it for the novelty factor – would love to give this to my future kids some day – as well as the technical limitations, since the CPU and GPU have custom water blocks mounted on them, and I'm not experienced with messing with those.”</p><p>But Storms888 also doesn’t think he’ll need to start thinking about buying a boring, bloodless PC any time soon.</p><p>“I will keep using it until a [Nvidia] 4090 [graphics card] and [Intel] 14900k [processor] are no longer serviceable for modern games. So I assume at least for the next 7-10 years,” he joked. “Overall I am still shocked to this day that I won it. The majority of my life I've had absolutely terrible computers. … This genuinely has been a life-changing experience, and it's opened up so many doors for me professionally with streaming.”</p><h2 id="recommended">Recommended</h2><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/diablo-union-activision-blizzard-microsoft-cwa-layoffs/"><div><p>Diablo Devs Unionize Following Layoffs And Dissatisfaction With AI, Pay - Aftermath</p><p>Workers on Diablo are the latest arm of Blizzard to unionize, joining the teams behind Overwatch and World of Warcraft before them.</p><p><span>Nathan Grayson</span></p></div></a></figure>

<p>Head back to the spooky Nitemare Island and check out the Friday the 13th-themed skins that have returned to Fortnite for the weekend.</p>



<p>Fortnite announced on social media that Nitemare Island would return to Reload, the Battle Royale-themed mode that launched in 2024. Along with that, Jason Voorhees and Michael Myers are back in the game, in skins for the time being.</p>



<p>Nitemare Island originally debuted in October 2025 and was the fifth Reload map. Epic says that you have until 9:00 a.m. ET on Monday, February 16, to jump back into the Halloween-themed map. What a great weekend for Valentine’s Day.</p>



<figure></figure>







<h2 id="h-news-on-future-fortnite-collabs">News on Future Fortnite Collabs</h2>



<p>Just like Jason Voorhees and Michael Myers, Fortnite has collaborated with numerous IPs to create a truly unique, if not outright bizarre, gaming experience. Right next to Jason Voorhees and Michael Myers, you can also purchase SpongeBob SquarePants. Looking for a Jam track? There are plenty of choices from Chapell Roan and Sabrina Carpenter, but you can also choose Feel Good Inc. by The Gorillaz.</p>







<p>Recently, it was announced that Overwatch, which is undergoing a resurgence, would be part of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-x-overwatch-crossover-brings-genji-tracer-d-va/" id="175954">a future Fortnite collaboration</a>. Kingdom Hearts is also planned for release on the popular free-to-play game. Learn more about that at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-has-a-kingdom-hearts-collab-in-development-its-claimed/" id="176158">this link.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Girls Frontline 2: Exilium recently revealed the new content that’s coming in its next patch on February 19, and there’s a lot. The headliners are two new T-Dolls, Alva and Voymastina, the latter of which is the strongest Doll in the game. Alva will arrive on February 19, and Voymastina will arrive on March 12. On top of that, there’s new story content, limited-time outfits and events, and lots of free rewards.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>New T-Dolls Join the Fray</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Alva, the dependable leader of Task Force DEFY, is the first new Doll to join the roster. Though reserved in demeanor, she is fiercely protective of her squad. She’s a Support-class Doll and excels at providing powerful shields and enhancing team survivability, making her a natural fit for shield-focused teams. With her signature weapon, 6P33, she increases the critical damage of Freeze-based allies and further amplifies the damage of shielded units, turning defense into offense. She synergizes particularly well with Robella, creating a 1+1&gt;2 effect, and her arrival marks the full realization of shield-centric Freeze teams.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/12/alva-kv-update-1770923971757.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The new story content, called Corposant, will be released in three parts on February 19, February 26, and March 12. It features CG animations and delivers an experience comparable to a visual novel, with more than 100,000 English words. When the final chapter launches on March 12, it will also introduce the highly anticipated new Doll Voymastina, who is officially recognized as the strongest second-generation Doll in the game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Codenamed “White Mastiff,” Voymastina is a physical-team core damage dealer who specializes in defense-ignoring capabilities, delivering massive physical damage through both active and support attacks. Her exclusive effect, Predator’s Principle, boosts burst damage, while Eye of the White Mastiff enables sustained offensive pressure. Debuting alongside her is the Elite assault rifle 6P71 (Medium Ammo), Voymastina’s imprinted signature weapon, designed to complete her combat profile and reinforce her role as a top-tier damage dealer.
</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/12/voymastina-kv-available-on-12-march-1770924024983.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Free Goodies on the Way</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The patch will add lots of new free rewards, led by the ability to earn 55+ pulls, 11,000+ Collapse Pieces, an Elite Doll (Balthilde), and a Commander outfit during the themed Corposant event that launches February 19.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Plus, there are multiple upcoming log-in events that can score you additional goodies. Starting February 19, you can log in to receive 10 Targeted Access Permissions (which are used to pull for characters) and sign in to receive another 10. And another event starts March 12, where you can get an additional 10. Also starting February 19, you can get one reward mail every week, each containing one Access Permission, 100 Collapse Pieces (which can be used to get more Targeted Access Permissions), and 100 Next-Gen Memory Sticks (which can be used to increase your affinity with individual Dolls).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">From February 19 to April 1, the limited-time Splash Bash event introduces a PK-style gameplay mode featuring interactive matchups between Dolls and players. There’s streamlined gameplay guidance and stage-clearing tips, making the mode a light but competitive change of pace. And you can unlock the exclusive Commander outfit Leisurely Heat by participating.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/12/splash-bash-gameplay-1770924061482.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">On top of all this, the upcoming patch will also add limited-time discounts on three new outfits: Alva - Antje, Lenna - Flying Phantom, and Nikketa - Night on the Silver Bay. And there will be a new permanent gameplay mode called Ashen Tales in Artifact Recovery.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As always, Girls Frontline 2: Exilium will continue to release more new content in the future. In the next six months, you can expect extensive story updates, new gameplay modes, new Dolls and outfits, and collaborations with other major IPs.

While Pokémon has appeared in pinball form on the Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance in the past, this is the first attempt at an arcade-ready machine. But this isn’t a throwback; Pokémon Pinball by Stern has tons of crazy high-tech bells and whistles, like the ability to collect Pokémon while playing the machine and save your progress on a Pokédex on your phone, several interactive toys like an animatronic Pikachu, and an HD screen with tons of anime footage. While Stern has only just announced Pokémon, it’s out really soon (in the coming months). We travelled to Stern’s factory to check it out. And after playing a bunch of games we can confirm: It’s awesome. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Pokémon by Stern Pinball</h3></div></span></output><h2 data-cy="title2">In Good Company </h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The Pokémon Company worked with Stern extremely closely on making sure Pokémon was represented perfectly; we heard a lot about that partnership during our visit to Stern’s factory, and it’s obvious from playing the Pokémon machine that Stern really <em>gets</em> Pokémon. Lead Programmer Tanio Klyce explained, “A lot of work went into marrying the necessary pinball design with Pokémon,” and it is clear that they used the license to make a game about battling, catching, and living in the world of Pokémon.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/13/pokepremleft-1770998077040.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Premium version of Pokémon by Stern Pinball Inc.  Photo: Stern.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The art package is focused on Kanto Region Pokémon – the first 151 Gen 1 Pokémon introduced in Pokémon Red and Blue – and you start the game with Gen 1 starters available for battles, which we will get to in a bit. The toys and art are clearly a result of careful collaboration. Klyce says, “We didn’t draw anything, we essentially composited [The Pokémon Company’s] stuff … They are very particular. Line weights, colors, relative scales of characters went under tremendous scrutiny.” While that may sound intense, it actually ended up lending the project a sense of legitimacy, according to longtime Stern pinball designer and one of Pokémon’s co-leads, George Gomez.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Beyond the art on the cabinet, there’s plenty more Pokémon crammed into this machine. The monitor in the back glass works in anime clips from Seasons 10-25. For example, if you hit the right ramp a few times you can start a Pikachu vs. Raichu mode in which battle scenes from the anime are shown on screen while you play a multiball mode. The speakers blast the Pokémon theme song, and Meowth’s taunts from the anime are piped in – the voice actor for Giovani even recorded custom shoutouts for certain modes (deeper in the game there are Regional Rivals and even Gym Battles and an ultimate Master Battle against Giovanni. We didn’t get to those… yet!).</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Catch ‘Em (Pinb)All</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">While Gen 1 and Kanto region is the focus of the side art, backglass, and playfield art, Klyce adds, “We have Pokémon in the game from all the Generations … At launch we have 182 that you can discover and catch.” He also says “more are coming” which is a nod at the online nature of Stern Machines these days: Updates can be pushed in the background to add content or limited time events, which, of course, is a perfect match for Pokémon. Here’s how this could work: As you approach a Stern pinball machine, you can log in with a QR code on the Stern Insider Connected app on your phone. Once you do this, you can track your scores, unlock Achievements, and, in Pokémon, add to your Pokédex. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/13/poke112-1770998086640.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">A view of the Pokémon playfield and toys. Photo: Stern.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As you discover new Pokémon, a special Pokedex section of the Insider Connected app will get filled out. Stern may then push an update adding to the Pokémon available in the machine and thus expand the Pokédex. It’s not going to be easy! Catching Pokémon is kinda hard in pinball: First, you can basically hit any target or shot to fill a meter – the pop bumpers are “tall grass” that fills the catch meter fast. After this, a random Pokémon will appear. These are based on the biome you are in, which you play in order: Forest,  Lake, Mountain, Desert (in the Forest, we ran into a Kakuna, a Bewear, and a Venomoth). At this point you have to shoot a lit purple flashing shot to reveal the Pokémon in the Pokédex. Then you have to shoot the Pokéball toy to capture the Pokémon. This not only adds the Pokémon to your ‘dex, but also unlocks a Battle…</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Battle Ready</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite Ash’s favorite catch phrase, you don’t choose your starters. When start a game, you have a team of four: Squirtle, Pikachu, Charmander, and Bulbasaur. Once you start a Battle by shooting the scoop on the right, you must aim for shots that are lit up to guide you through the battle, with each lamp sending you up a ramp or around a loop or at a target. The first Pokémon automatically deployed in battle is Bulbasaur, and purple shots for poison attacks and green shots for grass attacks are lit up. If you dawdle, the adversary will attack you. In one battle vs. Scyther, we weren’t making good progress with Bulbasaur’s plant attacks, but after a few shots, we lit a shot in a scoop on playfield that let us switch to Charmander and then properly torched Scyther. It was actually kind of sad! The score went way up. Limiting your squad may seem odd, but it’s also super effective: Successfully nailing shots in pinball is a lot harder than selecting your next move in turn-based combat. It’s kind of like playing on a Game Boy while also juggling it! But it does feel like Pokémon, and catching, collecting, and battling Pokémon just feels totally cool and new when done with pinball flippers.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/13/pokepremiumtop-1770998364620.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The full Premium version Pokémon playfield. Photo: Stern.</figcaption></figure></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Version Differences</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">While they don’t come in Red, Blue, and Yellow versions, there are diffent versions of Pokémon available: The Premium and Limited Edition (LE) versions ship with an animatronic Pikachu toy that wobbles about, an interactive Pokéball toy that snatches the pinball and hides it from view, and a magnet that flings the pinball around under the Meowth Balloon toy. These versions also have metal ramps and a more complicated left whirlpool ramp. The LE version (a limited run of 750 machines) has additional lighting, colored “armor” (the metal lining and legs on the cabinet), and its own custom art scheme. The Pro version is stripped down a bit with a non-interactive Pikachu and Pokéball toy and no magnet, but it closely resembles the other models outwardly and also features the pretty cool Meowth Balloon that swoops across the playfield for an easy target (and easy multiball). Other Stern machines have much more striking differences across their models; the most we noticed about the Pro was that the lack of the metal parts and lighting made it look a bit cheaper – which it is. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/13/pokeleleft-020326-1770998278785.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Limited Edition cabinet for Pokémon Pinball by Stern.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We can’t wait to play more Pokémon from Stern – the idea of filling out a Pokédex in a whole new way across multiple machines, arcades, bars, and game rooms is super cool and like nothing that’s been done before. And while the innovation is clear in features like the Pokédex, battles, and DLC potential, the basic layout of Pokémon feels approachable and classic like Attack from Mars (central bash shot) or Monster Bash (obvious shots tied to characters). That makes sense because Pokemon Pinball is the product of both one of Stern’s newest designers, Jack Danger, and George Gomez, who worked on classics like The Lord of the Rings and the aforementioned Monster Bash. The shots were easy to hit and flow felt good, but we drained a lot – there’s nothing kiddie about the gameplay on this machine, despite its appearance. And that’s what both Pokémon and pinball have in common: Anyone can play, but few can become a master. We should hear more about Pokémon Pinball from Stern in the coming weeks; the MSRP of the Pro model is set at $6,999, with the Premium at $9,699 and the LE at $12,999 and all <a href="https://sternpinball.com/game/pokemon/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">models are available for pre-order now</a>.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/new-pokemon-pinball-machine-lets-you-catch-battle-and-complete-a-pokedex]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/console-archives-cool-boarders</link>
            <guid>1435669</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Hamster Corporation is on something of a winning streak, with the fantastic <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/every-arcade-archives-game-on-nintendo-switch-plus-our-top-picks">Arcade Archives</a> series continually dusting off and polishing hundreds of notable games from the annals of history. Well, those wizards are back with the fresh <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/hamsters-console-archives-starting-lineup-revealed-includes-more-than-10-titles">Console Archives</a> brand, and the now 30-year-old ‘radical’ PlayStation sports game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/console-archives-cool-boarders">Cool Boarders</a> is one of the first. Yes, 1996, three whole years before anything <strong>Tony Hawk</strong>-related would reach consoles.</p>
<p>Much like the difference between skateboarding and snowboarding, in Cool Boarders, your character feels heavy, and your movements must be slow and deliberate if you want to pull off tricks. All this while carving fresh powder to avoid hitting trees or plummeting to a mountainous death. 'B' lets you jump, which will build speed and help you initiate tricks when leaping off heights. Meanwhile, 'Y' works as the Drift button, letting you quickly change direction and better handle corners.</p>
<p>Ultimately, you are aiming to either get the highest trick score or the best time on each of the courses. You’ll start out meagrely, shrugging yourself off a ledge and maybe pulling off a 180, but there’s a high skill ceiling waiting to be found. When you ready a jump, the amount of time you press and hold a directional button before you leap dictates how fast you spin. Combine this with a Grab by holding 'R', and with a bit of patience, you’ll be hurtling down courses while pulling off sick 900 Nosegrabs.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the stubborn gameplay is accentuated with great and suitably audacious '90s music, and some silly but nostalgic sound effects and narration. But, compared to its favourably reviewed peer, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/1080d_snowboarding">1080 Snowboarding</a>, Cool Boarders doesn't quite compete in either the pure fun of the gameplay or the amount of content.</p>
<p>Hamster has preserved the visuals beautifully, glitches and all. Here, the PS1 original's 240p pixels are polished and presented faithfully, especially compared to the smooth anti-aliasing sheen found in the 2024 PS5 version, but anyone hoping for any upscaling options is out of luck. You can play around with the aspect ratio, either to fill the screen or condense it to perfect-pixel parity, but there's not much in the way of borders or other presentation options. However, the emulation seems to run perfectly, with no noticeable drops in frame rate or frame pacing, and thankfully, the CRT filters are gorgeous.</p>
<p>One issue is that while there is Quick Save and Quick Load, I would have just preferred a rewind option, or something as wild as the ability to slow the game's speed. I mapped the Save/Load buttons to the controller, but it still got things muddled up. Rewind would feel better, especially in a game where one mistake can ruin a run.</p>
<p>Neither the visuals nor the gameplay has aged as gracefully as 1080, but Hamster has done good work in presenting the snowy vistas and demanding gameplay for the modern day. Cool Boarders is a blast to play for short sessions, especially if you loved it back in the '90s, and while a couple of extra options might have been nice, this is the best way to play this beloved early entry in the ‘extreme’ sports genre.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/console-archives-cool-boarders]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-update-1-2-1-adds-limited-time-modes-and-new-map/</link>
            <guid>1435660</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Updates have been announced for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/battlefield-6/" id="1961">Battlefield 6 </a>in version 1.2.1.0</p>



<p>The Battlefield Communications team announced the next major update to the game. This next update adds new weapons, the “Contaminated” map, new limited-time modes, and more.</p>







<h2 id="h-new-modes-coming-to-battlefield-6">New Modes Coming to Battlefield 6</h2>



<p>The update, scheduled to go live on February 17, adds new modes. These limited-time modes are built around a new psychoactive weapon, VL-7</p>



<p>VL-7 Strike is a limited-time mode where psychoactive smoke spreads across select areas in multiplayer and REDSEC. Players must wear masks and carefully manage their filters, as running out will leave them vulnerable to the disorienting effects of VL-7.</p>











<h2 id="h-map-and-mode-fixes-weapon-balancing-coming-in-new-update">Map and Mode Fixes, Weapon Balancing Coming in New Update</h2>



<p>The update fixes numerous map exploits, traversal issues, capture logic problems, and world reset bugs across Conquest, Breakthrough, Strikepoint, Gauntlet, and other modes.</p>



<p>Additionally, the update delivers a broad recoil tuning pass across automatic weapons, alongside targeted balance fixes to improve consistency, clarity, and long-term weapon handling.</p>







<p>Other issues related to Portal stability, audio, and more were addressed. Players can check out the full statement <a href="https://x.com/Battlefield/status/2022340361868198355?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>
