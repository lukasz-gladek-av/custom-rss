            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/4/24235365/acer-ifa-2024-project-dualplay<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Out of all the new laptops Acer announced at IFA today, <a href="https://news.acer.com/project-dualplay-novel-gaming-laptop-concept-with-detachable-controllers-for-dual-player-experiences">Project DualPlay</a> pops out the most. It’s a concept laptop that Acer says gives gamers more ways to play on the go, but looking at the design, I’m not sure which gamers it’s talking about.</p><p>For Project DualPlay, Acer took its Predator gaming laptop and added a cutout beneath the keyboard to hold its custom gaming controller face-down. The back of the controller doubles as the laptop’s trackpad. A button at the top of the keyboard releases the controller and causes two 5W speakers to pop out from the sides of the laptop. The controller can be further separated into two gamepads, Nintendo Switch-style. </p><p>Acer’s press release says Project DualPlay lets a second person join you just as easily as detaching the controller.<em> Street Fighter 6 </em>is called out specifically as well as first-person shooters, though the latter only makes sense if the game supports split-screen play. You can also just use it for single-player games, of course.</p><div><figcaption><em>Acer’s Project DualPlay gaming laptop concept.</em></figcaption> <p><cite><em>Image: Acer</em></cite></p></div><p>Unfortunately, we didn’t get to see Acer’s concept in person at IFA, so that leaves me with a few questions. Mostly: is the controller any good? If a second person is using the controller, how pleasant is it to game on a laptop with a gaping hole where the trackpad should be? </p><p>None of the press photos show someone using the laptop with the controller removed. </p><p>Plenty of PC games have controller support, and many people prefer using a controller over a mouse and keyboard. So there’s something to be said for having a controller that fits right into your laptop rather than having to cart one around.</p><p>Project DualPlay is just a concept for now. But how much extra would you pay for a laptop with the controller built right in?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Warner Bros have released the first trailer for Vertigo and Legendary's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/minecraft">Minecraft</a> movie, the long-awaited or possibly, long-dreaded adaptation of Mojang's industry-straddling block-builder. Quick disclosure: I worked with Mojang and Microsoft on a book about Minecraft's first 15 years, shortly before joining Rock Paper Shotgun. As such, I am now obliged by the eternal laws of journalistic accountability to state that anything Minecraft-related is rubbish. But even if that weren't the case, I would describe this as pretty dismal.</p><!--more-->

<p>It's partly Hollywood-trailer-itis - they're doing that condescending thing where they slap a bass drop or local equivalent on every punchline - but it's mostly that they've monstered Minecraft's matchless visual direction, with a photorealistic spin on the original block aesthetic which makes me think of those fan mods that insist on forcing ray-tracing and hair physics into a game that is famously low-tech and simple.</p>
<p>I'm sure the film's visual direction represents many hours of skilled labour, and I empathise for the artists who are now reading the Youtube comments, but it all just seems so unnecessary. The original Minecraft didn't make waves because you could see your reflection in every Piglin's eyeball. I'm not sure it'll be "more appealing to a mainstream audience", either - if you've never played Minecraft, I suspect this will seem very disposable, another matinee CGI fest among many, but with a strange emphasis on right angles. Imagine if they'd taken a few cues from the LEGO movies or even the Spider-Verse films, and folded in different aesthetics from all across Minecraft's evolution in the hands of developers and players.</p>
<p>The cast includes Emma Myers from Addams Family spin-off Wednesday,  Danielle Brooks from The Colour Purple, Jason Momoa playing Jason Momoa But Comically Non-Macho, and Jack Black playing Steve, Minecraft's OG default character. I don't have any particular strong feelings about how Steve should be portrayed, but I am quite tired of Jack Black being Jack Black. They should have cast him as a Creeper. Anyway, here's some blurb:</p>
<blockquote><p>Welcome to the world of Minecraft, where creativity doesn't just help you craft, it's essential to one's survival! Four misfits--Garrett "The Garbage Man" Garrison (Momoa), Henry (Hansen), Natalie (Myers) and Dawn (Brooks)--find themselves struggling with ordinary problems when they are suddenly pulled through a mysterious portal into the Overworld: a bizarre, cubic wonderland that thrives on imagination. To get back home, they'll have to master this world (and protect it from evil things like Piglins and Zombies, too) while embarking on a magical quest with an unexpected, expert crafter, Steve (Black). Together, their adventure will challenge all five to be bold and to reconnect with the qualities that make each of them uniquely creative...the very skills they need to thrive back in the real world."</p></blockquote>
<p>The Minecraft movie was announced in 2014, and has been through several rewrites and changes of project leadership. Like many Hollywood productions, it also saw delays during the pandemic lockdowns. It'll hit cinemas next year. I'm morbidly interested to hear about how they worked out the visual direction, but I don't think I'll be buying a ticket.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/sektors-mortal-kombat-1-fatality-channels-marvels-iron-man-heads-out-of-this-world<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/mortal-kombat-1">Mortal Kombat 1</a> developer NetherRealm has released a gameplay trailer for upcoming DLC character Sektor, showing off her Fatality and Animality.</p><p>Sektor arrives as part of the Khaos Reigns expansion for Mortal Kombat 1, the latest game in the gory fighting game franchise that's sold over four million copies. The expansion adds new story mode chapters available from September 24, along with Kombat Pack 2, which itself includes six new DLC characters: Cyrax, Sektor, and Noob Saibot (available on September 24), and guest fighters Ghostface (Scream franchise), T-1000 (Terminator 2: Judgement Day), and Conan the Barbarian (post-launch release timing to be announced at a later date).</p><p>It’s Sektor who is the focus for this new gameplay video, though. It shows off the character’s abilities and moveset (flamethrower, missile strikes, and rocket thrusters for enhanced movement and hovering ability), and clips of cutscenes that shine a light on the story fans can expect.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Here’s the set-up, courtesy of publisher Warner Bros. Games:</p><blockquote>In Fire God Liu Kang’s New Era, Sektor grew up immersed in Lin Kuei culture – her father was its master armorer, and her mother was a leading warrior. This vast knowledge of weaponry and formidable martial skills passed down from her parents make Sektor a kombatant like no other. Sensing a kindred spirit, Sub-Zero shared with her his grand vision for the Lin Kuei's future and chose her to become his most trusted lieutenant. Now Sektor will force the Lin Kuei to evolve and those who cannot change will be eliminated.</blockquote><p>The highlight of the video, though, is a look at one of Sektor’s Fatalities. Here, Sektor channels Marvel’s Iron Man, complete with cool sci-fi in-suit headshot, as she drags her hapless opponent into orbit before heading back, their body burning up on re-entry.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/04/mk-main-1725458259235.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Sektor's Fatality in Mortal Kombat 1 has big Iron Man vibes.</figcaption></figure></output><p>NetherRealm, of course, is no stranger to the superhero genre via its Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe crossover fighting game franchise. We haven't seen a new game in that series for some time — perhaps it's time for a return, with James Gunn's new DCU set to kick off soon.</p><p>Meanwhile, the video also teases Sektor’s Animality, the finishing move that lets her to morph into a rhinoceros. Animalities are part of a free update for all Mortal Kombat 1 owners set to go live alongside Khaos Reigns on September 24.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

			<p>Today, Warner Bros. Games released a brand-new trailer for the <a href="https://wccftech.com/warner-bros-games-announces-mortal-kombat-1-khaos-reigns/">Khaos Reigns update</a> for Mortal Kombat 1, which showcases Sektor, one of the upcoming fighters. Sektor is one of six playable characters that will be added to the game with the new expansion, with the trailer showcasing Sektor's moveset and abilities as well as Sektor's story in Mortal Kombat 1.</p>
<p>In this new trailer, we get to see Sektor's deadly weaponry and her expertise in utilizing them, such as the capability to use a flamethrower, missile strikes and even rocket thrusters to demolish her opponent. Specifically, the rocket thrusters can provide Sektor with extra mobility, allowing her a few seconds in the air to attack while hovering. This short trailer also showcases the upcoming addition of Animalities, explicitly showing Sektor's animality in Mortal Kombat 1: Khaos Reigns.</p>
<p>Compared to some other characters in Mortal Kombat 1, Sektor's fatality is rather tame. While she is still seen to be breaking the bones of her opponent, there isn't as much gore and viscera as there is with other characters, such as Scorpion or Mileena, for example.</p>
<p><iframe title="Mortal Kombat 1: Khaos Reigns – Official Sektor Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/plWgLXmsRpI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The trailer is three minutes long, giving players a glimpse into her combat style as well as the story of her involvement in the Lin Kuei culture. Both her mother and father were crucial members of the Fire God Liu Kang's New Era, being a warrior and master armorer, respectively. Having both of them as assets in her life helped her become the intense and fiery warrior that she is today, with skills passed down from both parents.</p>
<p>The three-minute trailer shows Sektor's animality, where she can transform into a rhinoceros to gore her opponent and finish them off for good. While Khaos Reigns is a paid update for Mortal Kombat 1, the addition of Animalities is not and will be free to access for all players who want to use them.</p>
<p>Mortal Kombat 1: Khaos Reigns will be available on September 24, 2024. With this comes the release of Sektor and the free update of Animalities for all players to access, regardless of whether they own Khaos Reigns or not. The update will be released digitally at 8 AM PDT / 10 AM CDT / 11 AM EDT for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC. Those <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3134000/Mortal_Kombat_1_Khaos_Reigns_Bundle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who pre-order</a> the new expansion will get four new skins based on previous classic aesthetics, such as Wedding Scorpion, Empress Mileena, and Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 versions of Noob Saibot and Sub-Zero.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/death-guitar-preview-amp-up-your-speedruns</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/death-the-guitar-preview-%E2%80%93-amp-up-your-speedruns.971913/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/death-guitar-preview-amp-up-your-speedruns<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In <em>Death the Guitar</em>, you play as a living guitar who wants to take revenge on the humans who have killed its owner, who was the greatest rockstar of all time. I’ll give you a second to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2474220/Death_the_Guitar/">wishlist it on Steam</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Coming from Japanese indie developer Toroya My Battery Is Fried, <em>Death the Guitar</em>&nbsp;features a simple, sort-of two-tone graphic style. Yet, it drips with style and creativity. It's a 2D platformer that asks you to clear room after room using the power of rock.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After you complete a stage, you’re graded by your time and number of deaths, making this a pretty speedrun-friendly game. However, casual platformer fans will also find this game to be in tune with them.</p>

<p>Much like <em>Hotline Miami</em> or <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/katana-zero-review-zero-to-hero"><em>Katana Zero</em></a>, Death the Guitar is a one-touch, one-kill sort of game. It raises the stakes, but it also pushes you into finding the most efficient route to clear a level.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I played two separate preview builds over the summer, and so far, the controls are simple. You can jump and attack with a chord, and at some point, you can equip a special ability, like one that boosts you forward.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The magic in the game is how your jump and chord affects the world around you. Throughout each level, there are amps. Jumping off an amp gives you more height and an electrified aura to hurt enemies.</p>
<p>Attacking, on the other hand, boosts you forward, destroying enemies and glass walls in your way (not to be confused with the special ability boost, which can be done any time as long as it’s ready).</p>

<p>Amps aren’t the only thing you can interact with, though. Attacking a switch attached to a pulley lets you lower or raise amps, acting both as a platform and a means to crush enemies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, certain kinds of ground are shockable, meaning if you hit it with your attack, a shockwave will travel across. It’s a useful way to kill enemies from afar or below.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall, these different tools give you just enough options to figure out optimal strategies and paths for each room. As you run through a level, you’ll find all sorts of options to shred enemies with sound.</p>

<p>If you get hit once, you’re sent back to the start of the room, but it’s not as unforgiving as that sounds. These rooms are quick and breezy. After all, practice makes perfect, as any good rockstar knows.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The latest demo I played at PAX West culminated with a boss fight that taught me which basic attack does the most damage (spoiler alert, it’s the forward dash off an amp).&nbsp;</p>
<p>It felt like a classic boss in a 2D platformer like <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/sonic-mania-review-breaking-cycle">Sonic</a> </em>or <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/review/mega-man-legacy-collection-review-fun-trip-down-memory-lane"><em>Mega Man</em></a>, where you have to dodge some telegraphed but quick attacks while finding time to get your own hits in. It’s the sort of thing where on your first try, it might take a couple lives. But if you practice it, you can probably do a no-hit sub-30 clear easy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I’m realizing I gravitated toward a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/chainstaff-preview-bony-grappling-hook-we-deserve">lot of platformers</a> this PAX West, but <em>Death the Guitar</em> made my heart pump the most. Maybe it was because I wanted to get on the time leaderboard on the show floor, or maybe it was the pressure of the people behind me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Either way, I’ll be looking forward to <em>Death the Guitar</em>’s eventual release, which is scheduled for some time in 2025.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/celeste-speedrun-gdq-any-history-of-speedrunning<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Speedruns are some of the most bizarre and yet also entertaining ways a person can play a video game. They're also, if you've never tried one, <em>extremely </em>difficult, and require an intimate knowledge of the game you're trying to blast through. How intimate? Let's take a deep dive behind one to find out.</p><p><strong>The following chapter (by <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.twitch.tv/frozenflygone" target="_blank">frozenflygone</a></strong>) <strong>is excerpted from&nbsp;<em>ANY%: A History of Speedrunning</em>&nbsp;by Kat Brewster. The book is crowdfunding now – you can support it here:&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://eu-west-1.protection.sophos.com/?d=vol.co&amp;u=aHR0cHM6Ly92b2wuY28vY29sbGVjdGlvbnMvYW55LXBlcmNlbnQ=&amp;p=m&amp;i=NjU1ZjViOTc0NzgzNmM0NGFiYmUwZGM2&amp;t=dGd2VGtFVllSZ2lZWFRXNWk0VnVxNUNOV1U0U2F6VC9zeTk0RE53SjFCOD0=&amp;h=33569fd401a6482e8ce2921cc364eb0c&amp;s=AVNPUEhUT0NFTkNSWVBUSVYNc3yiWPkyC7ptxJDqsP8EBvWJL6K21KqITdx9hO4HuQ" target="_blank">https://vol.co/collections/any-percent</a></strong></p><figure></figure><p>I’ve always loved 2D platformers, so my very first game in my life that I one-hundred-percented was <em>Super Mario World</em>. I had my dad print out a guide for that game and I had like, 50 pages of it in my closet, getting all the dragon coins, all the secret exits, you know. So platformers have always been for me, they’ve always been something I feel that I’m very skilled at.</p><p>I learned about speed running first from watching [speedrunner] TGH playing <em>Undertale</em> and I was like, I wonder… And I saw his GDQ run, I watched that, and I was like, “Ohh, that’s that’s really interesting. I wonder if he is still streaming that.” And I turned on his stream and no, he was playing this game called <em>Celeste</em>! I was like, this game looks really cool. I’m gonna buy it. So I played it casually and then I bought it for my younger brother, who also loves video games. We played games all the time together, but I was in college and he was at home. When we had both finished the game and he sat down and he was like, “Do you wanna race?” I was like…okay. So, it was like a 2 hour race and he beat me and I was like, “Alright! Let’s race again!” Then it was like an hour and a half and then we raced each other to sub hour and he beat me. We would send our journals back and forth, and then I beat him to sub-50. And then he, you know, he stopped. He ran out of interest. And I just never stopped. I never stopped.</p><p>So it was just me and me and my younger brother Matthew. That was what got me interested in speedrunning. I started out on Switch, then I moved to PC and keyboard. And then I got, you know, sub-40, sub-32. And then I started playing mods and got my run into GDQ and all that. It’s always about having the people. For me it was my brother, and then I met the community, and then I had people teach me what was going on. And then I got to do that for other people and it’s so great. That’s how I started with <em>Celeste</em>. You know, it was a game I was drawn to. It really fits everything I love – its themes and its queerness and all that kind of stuff is really important. And it’s just an amazing community.</p><p>Speedrunning <em>Celeste</em> really ties into the themes of the game, of overcoming things. You’re gonna struggle, you’re gonna fall down the mountain. Sometimes it’s not going to be fun, but at the end of it, you will triumph and you’ll learn things about yourself. And that’s why speedrunning leans directly into the game… It encourages you to speed around it, and it’s a cycle. It’s why it’s still one of the most popular speed running games out there… My run is like, back when I got it I was in the top 200? My run is probably not even close anymore. But the fact that there’s a 24 [m] 58 [s] now is absurd.</p><p>I learned from a tutorial from Programmatic’s Any% tutorial, it’s very famous, while I was going through he did like a second version of it which was cool and I just went through that and every couple of you know, weeks, I’d focus on<br>a different level and I’d go through it. I would do my runs, I’d get a PB and then I’d watch the same video again and be like, oh, I forgot I wasn’t doing this part. Ohh, how do I get this better? OK, let me watch someone with the time who has like 5 minutes faster than me. What are they doing? And then just playing a lot, playing a lot.</p><figure></figure><h2>RUN OVERVIEW</h2><p>In <em>Celeste </em>speedruns, you rely on expert movement, climbing, dashing, jumping and grabbing the walls to traverse a dangerous mountain, collect keys, and reach the top. The run demands extraordinary platforming feats, chaining combos together, and good old fashioned skill. In order to maximize efficiency, runners have created their own taxonomy of different moves.There are a<br>handful of particular moves and skips utilized throughout. Here are a few:</p><p><strong>Dashing</strong>: There are super dashes, hyper dashes, wave dashes, extended dashes, ultra dashes, demo dashes… Dashing is critical. “There’s an important distinction between when you do a hyperdash and your hair is blue…and a hyper dash where your hair becomes red and you get your dash back. We like to call that an extended hyper or an extended wave dash where you end up getting your dash back… If you wait a certain number of frames longer before jumping, it kind of feels like you’re delaying and then you press the jump key, that’s how you’re going to get an extension…there’s something called supers and super dashes, also known as a dash jump, where you don’t hold any direction you just dash and then jump, that’ll get you more horizontal or that’ll give you more vertical height and you can also extend supers just like you extend wave dashes and you can get your dash back.”</p><p><strong>Bunnyhop</strong>: In essence, a short hyperdash followed by a jump that saves you frames. The momentum from a dash combined with a jump (which increases your speed +402 and saves you two frames each) gets you both higher and further. The bunnyhop is included in a number of different combos. Jumping is, in general, pretty important!</p><p><strong>Wall boost or wall bounce</strong>: “Another really, really important piece of speed tech that is super super clutch is called a wall bounce and what happens is…you dash up and then you jump away from the wall and that allows you to get really really high up. We’re going to use that in a ton of places to get our vertical height and our vertical distance.”</p><p><strong>Neutral jump</strong>: “A more niche technique is neutral jumping. [Usually when] you climb up a wall you will eventually run out of stamina. That can be really not helpful for us in some areas where we want to be climbing up and up and up and up! So, there’s a technique called a neutral jump where you are actually going to climb the wall by jumping away with no buttons pressed and then you go back…to the wall and then jump again and that allows you to climb up without expending any stamina.”</p><p><strong>Corner boost</strong>: An advanced jump around corners!</p><p><strong>Search skip</strong>: A left, a jump, a diagonal up jump, and a ledge grab or an up left dash. Sounds simple, right? This allows players to skip picking up a key, which is usually required to progress in the game.</p><h2>Forsaken City</h2><h2>0m 11s</h2><figure></figure><p>“Redhead girl goes very fast. Up a<br>mountain. And also discovers herself<br>along the way. That’s the crux of it.”</p><p>First, skip the intro cutscene. Then head onto Forsaken City. There’s a lot of movement manipulation and routing here to avoid things like unnecessary moving platforms.</p><p>At times, Madeline even dashes through and jumps off of spikes using frame-perfect moves. A guide to movement and some skips for the first level, Forsaken City, is from a TAS run.</p><h2>Old Site Mirror Skip</h2><h2>1m 33s </h2><figure></figure><p>So, this room is really interesting. To activate this cutscene you have to go away from the mirror and then come back to it and then you can skip the cutscene. But there’s a really cool skip where we’ll end up inside the Dream Block. This is a pretty easy to learn skip where we’re going to do an extended hyper and then do an up left dash kind of into the corner. Then we end up inside the Dream Block which is very silly. I don’t really understand why this happens, but your Y-distance is the same and we just get put in the middle of the room. So then you can just dash up!</p><h2>Badeline Fight</h2><h2>1m 49s</h2><figure></figure><p>So, now we’ve got Badeline. Badeline’s gonna be chasing us, and the most important thing is to just keep moving forward if you screw up your intended strat or anything like that just keep moving. Keep moving away from Badeline. She’ll always copy what you’re doing and as long as you don’t sit around and freeze, you can kind of stay out of her way and not die here.</p><h2>Entry Cycle Key Skip</h2><h2>2m 52s</h2><figure></figure><p>So, [let's] talk a little bit about cycles. When you enter the room, that’s what we’ll refer to as entry cycle. We also have something called death cycle and those are different. When you enter a room, when you die in a room, the pattern of the enemies will be different…so you have to be cognizant when you’re practicing to be sure to practice both the entry cycle and the death cycle until you get really really comfortable with going between rooms and you can kind of just prioritize the entry cycle uh stuff like that so…you want to do a super, be sure to extend (it so jump a little bit late) and then up right into the transition…Then you’ll then get your dash back, up right again, and you can climb up to the key! That way you don’t have to climb around.</p><hr><p>[<strong><em>Luke's note</em></strong>: because this is a website and not actually a book, you can watch the run in question below]</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="How To Train A Speedrunner - Celeste" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3H6kFzb8x8Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>The first trailer for A Minecraft Movie has dropped, giving us a glimpse of the blocky film adaptation of one of the biggest video games of all time. A Minecraft Movie will be in cinemas from 4th April 2025, for your next dose of video game movie Jack Black.</p>
<p><iframe title="A Minecraft Movie | Teaser" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PE2YZhcC4NY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>There’s a lot of things going on this reveal trailer, with four regular world humans pulled into the blocky Minecraft universe. Jason Momoa is the biggest name on the ticket, but there’s also Emma Myers (“Wednesday”), Oscar nominee Danielle Brooks (“The Color Purple”), and Sebastian Eugene Hansen (“Just Mercy, “Lisey’s Story”) who’s definitely channelling some young Paul Rudd, if you ask me.</p>
<p>The four of them will have to figure out how this world works, protect themselves from armies of Piglins and Zombies, get over the weirdly squared-off sheep, and just how high res and detailed all the blocks and lighting are.</p>

<p>But hold on a second. Four people pulled into a twisted video game world? Jumanji called – the newer ones and not the original – and it wants its plot back, please! It would also like one of its acting stars back as well, because Jack Black is back to do more Jack Black things in the role of Steve, an expert crafter who’s presumably been stuck in this world for decades. Come on, film execs. You’re making a movie about using your imagination, and the best you could come up with for you video game movie was to cast an actor who’s literally&nbsp;<em>just</em> been in&nbsp;<em>two other video game movies?!</em></p>
<p>Looking at the early comments on YouTube, and snap judgment are not especially kind to the film. In particular, there’s a lot of comments about having real actors within the very heavily stylised, over-saturated game world, and comparisons to “Minecraft vs Real Life” videos that were common in the mid 2010s. What do you think?</p>
<p>All involved will be hoping to replicate the rampaging successes of other video game movies – not <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/08/the-first-borderlands-movie-reviews-are-in-and-they-dont-hold-back/">Borderlands</a>, though. The gold rush was started in earnest by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/05/13/detective-pikachu-film-movie-review/">Detective Pikachu</a>, which garnered a whopping $450 million, before the first Sonic the Hedgehog enjoyed a $320 million worldwide gross and its sequel $404 million. Everything has now been dwarfed by <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/03/10/the-final-super-mario-bros-movie-trailer-looks-like-mad-max-rainbow-fury-road/">The Super Mario Bros. Movie</a>, which has a worldwide gross of $1.3 billion. So, of course you’re going to try and adapt Minecraft, which is the best-selling video game of all time, with over 350 million copies sold.</p>

			<p>A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead is an upcoming horror game set in the same haunting universe as A Quiet Place. The game is set for release on <a href="https://wccftech.com/a-quiet-place-the-road-ahead-launches-17-october/">17 October 2024</a> on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. This game is being created by Stormind Games and published by Saber Interactive. Today, a new developer diary was released, talking about the importance of sound design and how it was utilized in A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead.</p>
<p><iframe title="Sound Design in A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SUMKpw_-4fw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>For context, A Quiet Place is all about staying as quiet as humanly possible, otherwise you will be captured and killed by horrifying creatures. In this game, you play Alex, someone with asthma, while fighting for her life alongside her boyfriend, Martin. The creatures you are fighting against are completely blind, but have hypersensitive hearing and can hear the smallest of noises. You have to try to stay as quiet as you can while navigating a world full of obstacles and various objects that have the potential to make noise in any capacity.</p>
<p>This developer diary for A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead showcases some of the objects you'll have to interact with despite the fact that they can be incredibly noisy and give away your position. This includes rusty gates, cupboards, and even just walking through the city.&nbsp; In the developer diary, Diego Sambataro, the Sound Designer at Stormind Games, takes you through the importance of sound in this game, and how it can make or break your survival.</p>
<p>"The world that we've built mirrors our real world, where different materials not only create different types of noise, but that sound occurs at different loudness." Sambataro says, going on to explain different materials and how they may affect the gameplay: "If you're walking on sand, sound is diffused into the ground and results in quiet footsteps. Walking on compacted dirt may be a little louder. And rusty metal... well, you're going to want to move slowly to keep your volume levels low."</p>
<p>Diego Sambataro explains that every move you make should be deliberate and precise, as the sounds all have different volumes. In A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead, you don't know when they're going to scare you the most and throw you off balance. The developer diary for A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead is just under three minutes long but showcases some of the gameplay elements you can expect to interact with during your time in the game and how the sound will affect you and your survival.</p>
<p>As he goes on to explain, it isn't just surface-level noise you need to be worried about. "Leaves, water, glass, and other materials may be scattered across surfaces, each having their own loudness, which might attract the attention of creatures." It's not only walking that you have to be worried about, though. Even acts like opening doors and trying to scavenge for loot can end your life in a matter of seconds.</p>
<p>"Every formerly mundane movement is now a danger to your life. Want to open a door or a drawer? You had better do it carefully and quietly." Unfortunately, you can't get away with not opening things, either. Some of them will be necessary to interact with on your journey through A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead, as explained by Diego Sambataro in the developer diary.</p>
<p>A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead will be available on October 14, 2024, for $29.99<span>.&nbsp;<a href="https://aquietplace.game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pre-orders are</a></span><a href="https://aquietplace.game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&nbsp;available today</a>, which gives you some extra supplies to bolster your journey through the game.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/earthion-preview-new-game-for-sega-genesis</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/earthion-preview-a-new-game-for-the-sega-genesis.971868/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/earthion-preview-new-game-for-sega-genesis<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>No one is talking about <em>Earthion</em>, but I'm going to do my best to throw it into your line of sight. Consider this: a brand new <a href="https://techraptor.net/genre/shoot-em-up">shoot 'em up</a> (SHUMP) is releasing for the SEGA Gensis, a console that debuted over three decades ago. This SHUMP is retro to the core, rad as hell, and I can't wait to see more: Remember the name <em>Earthion</em>.</p>
<p>Developed by Japanese studio Ancient and published by <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/limited-run-games-showcase-gex-more">Limited Run Games</a>, you'll be able to boot up this banger on a physical cartridge and enjoy it the way God intended on that dusty old SEGA Genesis sitting in your closet. Well, it's time to give that bad boy a dusting so you can see why <em>Earthion</em> is so special.</p>
<p>From the show floor of PAX West, we checked out <em>Earthion</em>, so read on to learn more.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/earthion-3.jpg?itok=v4eDI8ri 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/earthion-3.jpg?itok=JAsvDUTs 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Screenshot courtesy of developer Yuzo Koshiro's Twitter account -- @yuzokoshiro. <em>Earthion </em>as seen running on his CRT screen.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Earthion</em>'s a New Game Running on Old Hardware</h2>
<p>Brand new games running on cartridges designed for long-dead consoles is nothing new; outside of fan-made creations, Limited Run has released certain games with this idea in mind. Knowing this, <em>Earthion</em> has to contend with the limitations of old hardware, but that doesn't stop it from going hard.</p>
<p>SHUMPs put me in an adrenaline-fueled frenzy, and <em>Earthion</em> is no different in that regard. It's about as authentic as it gets, from the visuals and audio down to the gameplay. Its gameplay is simple but elegant and refined, making for a fantastic time.</p>
<p>Take control of a spaceship and blast through space with your standard lasers, or various secondary weapons. You can arm this ship with rockets, extra machine guns, or even a flamethrower. Dodge and weave your way through enemies and avoid getting hit, else you'll lose a precious life.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/earthion-1.jpg?itok=Q7HUrMXG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/earthion-1.jpg?itok=FD24UQSI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Screenshot courtesy of developer Yuzo Koshiro's Twitter account -- @yuzokoshiro</figcaption></figure><p>Sounds like most other SHUMPs, but again, it does exactly what it needs to do. Visually, though, it's outstanding and richly detailed. The spritework is animated to perfection and colors pop, creating one of the best looking SEGA Genesis games (which might be unfair to say as a game coming out in ~2025).</p>
<p>I played the demo twice since it was pretty short, but it was fun enough that it merited even more plays. During the one level I played, a giant ship flies into the screen, presumably an ally, and explodes. This creates a debris field players then need to dodge around as enemy ships come flying in.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/earthion-2.jpg?itok=ObL6WQO1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/earthion-2.jpg?itok=JzoEzZ4O 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Screenshot courtesy of developer Yuzo Koshiro's Twitter account -- @yuzokoshiro</figcaption></figure><p>Soon enough, I arrive at the boss, this strange, robotic ship. It exposes its weak point after shooting some perilous projectiles at me. Shooting this weak spot requires some precision, especially when contending with the projectiles it shoots at you, so it's the perfect challenge for what is presumably an early level of <em>Earthion</em>. Be sure to use the rockets or extra machine guns for extra oomph!</p>
<p>There's only so much one can say about a demo that lasts roughly 5 minutes, but it was enough time for me to know I'm going to love the hell out of <em>Earthion</em> when it releases. For a brand new SHUMP with an undeniably old-school feel, <em>Earthion</em> is one you're going to want to keep an eye on.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/konami-reveals-deliver-at-all-costs</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/konami-reveals-wacky-50s-courier-game-deliver-at-all-costs.971865/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/konami-reveals-deliver-at-all-costs<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Konami and developer Far Out Games have announced&nbsp;<em>Deliver At All Costs</em>, a "thrilling action game" based around delivering "highly unconventional cargo" in a wacky late-1950s world.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1880610/view/4597699678395658839" rel="noopener" target="_blank">its announcement post</a>, Far Out Games describes&nbsp;<em>Deliver At All Costs&nbsp;</em>as taking place in a world ruled by rock'n'roll, polka dot fashion, and "the fear of nuclear apocalypse". How delightful.</p>
<p>It's this world you'll be exploring as Winston Green, a courier with the requisite "shady past" all noir-adjacent protagonists need. You'll be delivering packages in a destructible world, driving a variety of different vehicles, and undertaking "bizarre and perilous deliveries".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/deliver-at-all-costs-announcement-balloons.jpg?itok=iIPMsyZ9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/deliver-at-all-costs-announcement-balloons.jpg?itok=v87v4s_c 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Deliver At All Costs&nbsp;</em>takes place in a wacky 1950s world full of objects to destroy.</figcaption></figure><p>Deliveries range from "a giant flailing marlin" through to disposing of an atomic bomb "teetering on the edge of explosion", so it's safe to say you won't just be ferrying mundane packages around in&nbsp;<em>Deliver At All Costs</em>' world.</p>
<p>While the world will be chaotic and reactive,&nbsp;<em>Deliver At All Costs&nbsp;</em>does also have a story, and it's one of "mystery and intrigue", according to the devs. You'll meet a cast of "distinct and memorable characters" and watch Winston spiral down into insanity, which feels like an appropriate response to the 1950s.</p>
<p>You can check out the announcement trailer for&nbsp;<em>Deliver At All Costs</em>, which gives a sense of what kind of madcap antics the game will let you take part in, right here.</p>

<p>Although it seemingly won't feature any licensed music, <i>Deliver At All Costs&nbsp;</i>will offer an original soundtrack to immerse you in the period, as well as 50s-inspired design elements, radio ads, and user interface aesthetics.</p>
<p>In short,&nbsp;<em>Deliver At All Costs&nbsp;</em>looks rather like what would happen if&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/mafia-definitive-edition">Mafia</a>&nbsp;</em>met&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/death-stranding">Death Stranding</a>&nbsp;</em>by way of <i>Totally Reliable Delivery Service</i>, so if that sounds like your cup of tea, then you should be keeping this one on your radar.</p>
<p><em>Deliver At All Costs&nbsp;</em>is set to arrive on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1880610/Deliver_At_All_Costs/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10012329" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and Xbox Series X|S, although there's no release date for the game yet. Stay tuned for more on this one.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-the-final-preview<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>After nearly four decades of Zelda games across a ton of different platforms and perspectives, it’s truly hard to predict where Nintendo will take this beloved series. They’ve done open world and end of the world. They’ve had touch controls and motion controls. They’ve been single player and multiplayer. The latest installment, The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, is already shaping up to feel like a classic Zelda adventure, and in classic Nintendo form, also features some really cool and unique twists. It’s also the first Zelda game where Zelda is fully playable through the entire story and with that she’s brought a whole new way to experience it.</p><p>By learning “echoes” Zelda is able to quickly build up a collection of objects, creatures, and more that she can use to traverse the world, solve puzzles, and defeat enemies. After some routine world shattering chaos which Zelda is unfortunately blamed for, Echoes of Wisdom opens with a post-jailbreak stealth sequence that plays a bit like the part in Ocarina of Time where Link first sneaks into Hyrule Castle. However, while you might be able to have Zelda brute force this section by just running and hiding, I realized it was immediately much more fun to make the castle guards think they accidentally captured an insane demonic witch who could summon furniture at a whim and torment them with magically materialized objects falling from the sky. Now, I didn’t need to play like this, but hey, it was much funnier that way. A guard tried chasing me down and, in a moment of panic, I summoned a wooden table behind me to block and distract him and probably make him think he was losing his mind or that the place was haunted. I then proceeded to learn more echoes for my permanent collection: a wooden crate, the traditional ceramic pot that Link has destroyed tens of millions of, and more. It immediately made me wonder just how many of these things would become part of Zelda’s repertoire and if I’d be in possession of an entire IKEA catalog by the end of the game. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom - September 2024 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>And that’s where Nintendo’s vision for the next era of top down 2D Zelda games really clicked for me. It’s been eleven years since the excellent The Legend of Zelda: Link Between Worlds was released for the 3DS, a game that notoriously took the rather formulaic and predictable flow of traditional 2D Zelda games and made it much more freeform, allowing players to collect items and defeat dungeons in pretty much any order of their choosing. Since then Nintendo has also completely reinvented the 3D Zelda series. Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom not only gave players a massive open world sandbox to explore at their own pace, they also gave us a seemingly infinite toolset to tackle them. Tears of the Kingdom especially relied on these mechanics, nudging players to build elaborate (or janky) vehicles and contraptions to make their way across the lands and skies of Hyrule. And between Breath of the Wild and Tears, Nintendo gave us The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening, a gorgeously reimagined take on their excellent and uniquely weird 1993 Game Boy game, now with a toyetic and claymation inspired art style. It was about as traditional as 2D Zelda can get and I adored it, but it was also a remake of a game I’d played countless times before, so it didn’t exactly give us a clear vision of where the future of top down Zelda games was heading. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>One of the best parts of being a Nintendo fan is never really knowing what to expect next. </p></div><p>The obvious answer at the time was to remake the Oracle of Ages and Oracle of Seasons games in the same art style since they originally looked and played like Link’s Awakening did on Game Boy. But one of the best parts of being a Nintendo fan is never really knowing what to expect next. Just you when you think they’ll do the most obvious thing, they hit you with a surprise out of nowhere. The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom takes everything they’ve learned from decades of 2D Zelda games, throws in some of the freeform creativity and problem solving from Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom, and puts it all together in the beautiful Link’s Awakening remake art style. It’s also solving one of the biggest gripes players have with modern 3D Zelda games by bringing back the traditional dungeons, a key ingredient of this cherished recipe that’s been sorely missing recently. It’s taking all of the best things that the 2D and 3D Zelda games have done and fusing them together to create the future of the series, and so far it’s really working for me. Seemingly every screen in Echoes of Wisdom provided me with an opportunity to approach it in a unique way while still feeling like I was playing an old-school top-down Zelda game. Initially, my impulse was to just slash everything with a sword like I’ve made Link do for most of my life, and I was admittedly a bit frustrated that I couldn’t. It takes a bit to get used to Zelda’s abilities here, but once you find your groove, things start to get really fun and interesting. You could throw rocks at enemies to kill them like some sort of brute savage, but wouldn’t it be funnier to swarm them to death with bats, summon moblins to target them with spears, or my personal favorite: bowling ball them to death with a small army of adorable but dangerous Caramadillos? God, I love these weird little guys. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Zelda does eventually get a sword in Echoes of Wisdom - sort of - by defeating an evil imposter version of Link, taking control of his iconic weapon set, and learning swordfighter form. This form also lets you jump higher and perform spin attacks, but it’s not without its caveats. Zelda’s sword power is on a limited energy budget and once it’s been depleted, she’ll need to replenish it to use it again. It seems like you’ll be able to expand your sword’s energy reserves as you progress through the game, but at the start it can only be used for a brief time before it runs out – at least until you find some more energy again. Nintendo seems keen on making sure Zelda plays differently than Link usually does in these games, and you’ll likely be utilizing her Tri-Rod and its bottomless bag of summonable objects much more often, with her sword being used sparingly and for key moments and conflicts. After all, if you’ve got an ax-wielding Darknut warrior in your back pocket you’re less likely to miss your trusty blade in the moment.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Nintendo seems keen on making sure Zelda plays differently than Link usually does in these games.</p></div><p>Those Darknuts were particularly effective at defeating evil Link, almost to the point where I felt bad doing it. That’s Link! I love that dude! Cornering him with one psychotically possessed Darknut echo, looping around behind him, and spawning another one to catch him off guard proved to be a quick way to confuse and surprise him and deal a bunch of damage, but again, that was by no means the only way to take him down. I probably could’ve bludgeoned him to death with furniture or some other comically horrific way to kill one of my favorite guys. Do whatever you feel you need to do. There’s a limit to what you can summon with your Tri-Rod, with some things costing one point (meaning you can summon several of them) and others using several. I’m hoping you’ll be able to expand your Tri-Rod’s power later in the game, because summoning a small entourage of enemies to roll with you at any time would be really awesome. Or covering half of a screen with pots just because you can.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>One of the highlights of my preview demo was passing the controller back and forth with my fellow IGN Nintendo nerd, Zelda obsessive, and good buddy Logan Plant and seeing how he’d get through puzzles and battles in his own way. We each had unique solutions for problems, and personal favorite things we’d summon and watching somebody else think frantically and react on the fly was so much fun. Things like spiders (complete with climbable webs) and fire items added a chaotic and hilariously unexpected layer to each scenario. A thing you summon won’t attack you or deal you damage, but if it happens to say, light something else on fire, that fire could come back to hurt you. There’s a rules of improv thing happening here that totally works in its favor and created several laugh-out-loud scenarios that rewarded our creativity or stupidity. There was rarely a truly wrong way to solve something here in the same way you could technically cut a loaf of bread with a spoon, but there’s probably a smarter way to make a sandwich. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There’s a rules of improv thing happening here that totally works in its favor and created several laugh-out-loud scenarios that rewarded our creativity or stupidity.</p></div><p>The Suthorn Ruins dungeon was the perfect proving ground to test all of these toys out. It’s a traditional Zelda dungeon through and through and it looks and feels fantastic. It was truly exciting to finally be back in one of these again. But instead of relying on one newly discovered item or weapon to beat it like you would in an older Zelda dungeon, you’re learning how to summon new things every other minute. You’ve got an entire arsenal to play with, and each room feels rife for experimentation and playfulness. Some puzzles had a clear and obvious answer while others demanded some creativity, and seeing how different people solved them in different ways was a total joy. The speedrunning and sequence-breaking communities out there are gonna have a blast with this game.   </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom Traversing the Still World Trailer Stills</h3></div></output><p>This ever-growing library of tools and toys work wonderfully in the overworld, too, which seems absolutely massive by 2D Zelda standards. I am so excited to uncover every single secret on this map. Using your echoes you’ll be able to climb over walls and trees and other obstacles that used to keep you locked to specific paths and routes in the older Zelda games. I’m interested to see how they’ll manage to keep players from rushing to the final dungeon or boss, since as of now it seems like you can climb up and over nearly everything, whether you’re using a spider web or a crude staircase you made out of dirty old beds, which, by the way, will slowly heal Zelda if she sleeps in them long enough, creating a very funny scenario where she takes a nap in the middle of a fight with an enemy if that’s what you feel like doing. I’ve got a lot of questions around how these options will play out in the full game. The final boss battles in most Zelda games are epic and awesome and also generally require a specific sword stab or light arrow for the final blow. Will you be able to kill Ganon by dropping a coffee table on his head in Echoes of Wisdom? Well, who knows, but I’m excited to see players try these kinds of things out. One apprehension I do have is just how you’ll organize your gigantic collection of Echoes as the game progresses. There are a few decent options for selecting items to summon at a whim (like “most used”) but no favorites list as far as I can tell, meaning you’ll often find yourself scrolling through a ton of different objects, creatures, and other assorted nonsense that you might need at any given moment. It’s not necessarily tedious and the gameplay pauses to allow you to find what you need at the moment, but I could see it being a bit cumbersome once you’ve unlocked a few dozen different things in your library. And with nearly every enemy and object in the world seemingly being scannable, you’ll likely have a ton to sort through by the end of the game.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Beds will slowly heal Zelda if she sleeps in them long enough, creating a very funny scenario where she takes a nap in the middle of a fight with an enemy if that’s what you feel like doing.</p></div><p>Echoes of Wisdom is generally incredibly pretty to look at, which is no surprise since it’s using the very charming Link’s Awakening remake art style. The world is teeming with life, quirky characters, and animations, and the town I visited was lovely and I couldn’t wait to meet everyone and snoop around their houses. That said, the Link’s Awakening remake was notoriously taxing on the Nintendo Switch hardware with noticeable framerate dips frequently appearing in the overworld, and while Echoes of Wisdom feels much smoother on that front, there are still moments where it hiccups a bit. It’s not a dealbreaker or anything but it’s worth pointing out. Hey Nintendo, whenever you’re ready to release that Nintendo Switch successor you keep hinting at, we’ll take it.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>All in all, Echoes of Wisdom feels like an earnest and clever return to the Zelda games I grew up playing. Challenging, inventive, fresh, and genuinely just really fun. Every new puzzle and conflict is a blank canvas for experimentation, but it’s all wrapped in that distinctively familiar and challenging Zelda game vibe that made me fall in love with these games to begin with. It’s vintage Zelda mixed with the playful and creativity based gameplay that younger audiences are used to building their own stories with these days. It’s not pushing that side of things as far as games like Minecraft, Roblox, or even Tears of the Kingdom does, but it’s also not rigid and specific with the way it makes you approach it. Attempting to juggle several of the core tenets of what makes the Zelda games so special to so many people across so many generations and make them all happy is an extremely tall order. The longer any franchise thrives, the more difficult it becomes to please everyone that approaches it with specific expectations. Every fan has a different reason why Zelda is special to them. But so far, Echoes of Wisdom feels like it’s taking the best elements of the most beloved modern and vintage Zelda games and making them work together in a pretty clever synchronicity. Whether they’ll get along for the whole trip remains to be seen, but right now it feels like a smart move and a truly exciting way to push the classic side of the franchise towards the future.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Borderlands players are no strangers to cracking codes and uncovering secrets in the game franchise, but the latest round of community sleuthing has proven to be especially lucrative. Thanks to a seemingly ordinary card given out at the recent PAX West convention, Borderlands players have received what is arguably the best Shift code in existence, and all it took was a solid grasp of binary language.</p><p>The card in question (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/borderlands/the-borderlands-series-most-valuable-shift-code-ever-is-now-available-for-everyone-all-thanks-to-genius-fans-cracking-a-secret-code-that-im-baffled-was-solved-so-fast/" rel="nofollow ">GamesRadar</a>) featured a D20 die in the center, and the tabletop icon was flanked by an inconspicuous pattern.

After debuting to dismal sales just under two weeks ago, Sony made the call to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonys-new-game-concord-going-offline-after-just-over-a-week/1100-6526235/" data-ref-id="1100-6526235">pull the plug on Concord</a> and delist the title. But in the limited time that the game has left, players are trying to get a rare Platinum trophy by repeatedly killing their own characters in Concord's Rivalry matches.</p><p>Via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-players-are-jumping-off-cliffs-in-game-as-they-desperately-grind-for-the-platinum-trophy-before-shutdown" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, Rivalry was intended to give two teams of five players a best-of-seven contest to determine the winner. But since both teams get experience points for participating, players have taken to immediately jumping off platforms to their demise. It gives the rival team a win, but it also helps level up the losers as well.</p><p>In theory, developer Firewalk Studios could have added adjustments to Concord that would have made the team-suicide tactic less appealing to players by taking away the benefit. But since the title is only going to be online for an additional two days, it's extremely unlikely that issue will be addressed at all. The real question is whether players have enough time to grind their way to that Platinum trophy before Concord is pulled.</p><p>Sony clearly had grand ambitions for Concord, and the company even lent out the potential franchise to an episode of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/deadpool-director-making-a-video-game-tv-series-and-its-not-what-you-think/1100-6525800/" data-ref-id="1100-6525800">Secret Level</a>, Prime Video's upcoming video game anthology series that will premiere in December. Since the game itself will have been offline for months by that time, Concord's spotlight episode will get to be the last reminder of what could have been... at least for the people who aren't chasing that trophy.</p><p>Concord will be taken offline by Sony on September 6. It remains to be seen if it will return, and what form that would take.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mighty-morphin-power-rangers-ritas-rewind-preview-a-mighty-good-time.971832/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/mighty-morphin-power-rangers-ritas-rewind-preview-mighty-good-time<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As a child, I quit playing soccer to become a Power Ranger. My dream did not come true.</p>
<p>That's the harsh reality of the world, but it looks like I might have another chance at achieving a childhood goal with the upcoming beat 'em up, <em>Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Rita's Rewind</em>. We got to check this game out on the show floor of PAX West 2024, so read below for our thoughts!</p>

<h2>Grab Some Friends for <em>Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Rita</em>'<em>s</em> <em>Rewind</em></h2>
<p>The show floor of a convention is chaotic and loud, but the screams of joy from those playing <em>Rita's Rewind</em> could be heard across the entire building. I do not exaggerate when I say the folks playing this title were among the happiest in the crowd. A mix of nostalgia and rock solid, well-designed beat 'em up gameplay make <em>Rita's Rewind</em> an upcoming hit.</p>
<p>After actually playing <em>Rita's Rewind </em>for myself, the crowd's excitement is certainly understandable. The appeal of playing a beat 'em up with friends never dulls, and its entertainment value shoots up just a bit more with the bombastic, tokusatsu nature of <em>Power Rangers</em>.</p>
<p>In my demo, I played across two levels in the role of Blue Ranger, the very character I so wished to be as a child. Me and three other players button mashed to victory as our Power Rangers punched, grabbed, and jump-kicked across the stage, taking out goons unfortunate enough to be in our way.</p>

<p><em>Rita's Rewind</em> tends to err on the side of easy, at least for these two levels, but it's certainly a fun time. It does exactly what it needs to do and provides for a great outlet to unwind and beat up enemies. Your character's attacks aren't complicated to pull off, and thus, you get to do cool things. Dopamine is off the charts when you're brawling through the streets as a colorful group of badasses.</p>
<p>Brawling across a rooftop and fighting off the avian Tenga Warriors, we arrive in front of Goldar, which fans of the series will immediately recognize. We brawl away, avoiding (or soaking) attacks and eventually defeat him. But, in a surprise twist, Goldar enlarges and becomes the size of a skyscraper! That's when the demo ends, so clearly surprises are in store.</p>
<p>One point I want to heavily emphasize is the fantastic CRT filter Digital Eclipse created for <em>Rita's Rewind</em>. This filter isn't present in current screenshots, so it can be toggled. Just know that this is perhaps the most authentic CRT filter I've seen in a game.</p>

<p>The signature look of the CRT screen was authentically recreated on the demo floor's large, flat screen TV. It even replicated the slightly curved surface of the CRT, near the edges of the screen. <em>Rita's Rewind</em> will look great, filter or not, but this filter just brings it to the next level.</p>
<p>What else can I say about <em>Rita's Rewind</em>? It was a very quick demo, around 15 minutes in total, so I only got a short time with it, but it was a blast all the same. I just know I'll be grabbing a few friends so we can play this together, like any good beat 'em up deserves.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/no-mans-sky-aquarius-update<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hello Games has released the&nbsp;<em>No Man's Sky&nbsp;</em>Aquarius update, and it's perfect for you if you've been looking for a cozier and more relaxing way to spend your time exploring alien planets.</p>
<p>Aquarius follows recent&nbsp;<em>No Man's Sky&nbsp;</em>updates like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/no-mans-sky-worlds-part-i-update">Worlds Part I</a>, which introduced a graphical and performance overhaul to the game, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/no-mans-sky-orbital-update">Orbital</a>, which allowed you to customize your starship and more.</p>
<p>This time around, though, Hello Games' ambitions are a little more small-scale, at least from a player perspective. The big new addition in Aquarius is the ability to fish; you can now grab your fishing rod and kick back, either alongside your buddies or solo, catching some weird space fish.</p>

<p>To help you in your fishing endeavors, you'll have access to a deployable Exo-Skiff, which can float over water and hold its own cold storage inventory. It's ideal for keeping fish once you've caught them.</p>
<p>You'll also be able to build automated fish traps to help you catch fish while you're off doing other things. Once you've caught your fish - however you've done it - you can then use them in new cooking recipes and ingredient combinations.</p>
<p>Naturally, you'll also find a new page in the Wonders Catalogue, which lets you document all of the weird space fish you've caught and where you found them.</p>

<p>There's tons of other stuff to discover in the&nbsp;<em>No Man's Sky&nbsp;</em>Aquarius update besides fishing, too. You can read a full rundown of everything that's in the update <a href="https://www.nomanssky.com/2024/09/aquarius-update/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">right here on the game's official website</a>.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/first-minecraft-movie-trailer</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-first-minecraft-movie-trailer-is-out-and-it-kinda-sucks.971826/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/first-minecraft-movie-trailer<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Warner Bros has released the very first teaser trailer for&nbsp;<em>A Minecraft Movie</em>, showing off what we can expect from the upcoming video game adaptation, and it looks...well, pretty bad, to be honest.</p>
<p><em>A Minecraft Movie</em>, for 'tis its name, will star Jason Momoa, Jack Black, and Jennifer Coolidge, as well as&nbsp;<em>Wednesday</em>'s Emma Myers,&nbsp;<em>The Color Purple</em>'s Danielle Brooks, and Sebastian Eugene Hansen of&nbsp;<em>Just Mercy&nbsp;</em>fame.</p>
<p>Momoa, Hansen, Myers, and Brooks play people from the real world who find themselves transported into a magical cubic world where creativity is king. Together with Black's Steve, they must journey through this world, protect it from monsters like Piglins and Zombies, and "reconnect" with their creative qualities.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/minecraft-movie-trailer-jason-momoa.jpg?itok=MGVE9B1D 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/minecraft-movie-trailer-jason-momoa.jpg?itok=WCJnwNh7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>A Minecraft Movie&nbsp;</em>will star Jason Momoa and Jack Black.</figcaption></figure><p>The movie is helmed by&nbsp;<em>Nacho Libre&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Napoleon Dynamite&nbsp;</em>director Jared Hess, and the music comes courtesy of Devo's Mark Mothersbaugh, who also wrote the soundtracks for&nbsp;<em>Thor: Ragnarok</em>,&nbsp;<em>The Lego Movie</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart&nbsp;</em>(together with Wataru Hokoyama in the latter case).</p>
<p>Honestly, if you ask me, the trailer's looking pretty rough. Sure, it's visually impressive on a surface level, but the aesthetic looks off for&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em>; it's too high-fidelity, too polished, too clean.</p>
<p>That's to say nothing of the writing, which, to me, feels like your bog-standard bland Hollywood "well, that happened"-level snarky comedy. The day the Marvel Cinematic Universe stops infecting the writing approach of every other light-hearted franchise-minded movie out there will be a happy day indeed.</p>
<p>Should you wish to, you can see the first trailer for&nbsp;<em>A Minecraft Movie&nbsp;</em>right here.</p>

<p>If you feel as I do about the trailer, then you can take solace in the fact that&nbsp;<em>A Minecraft Movie&nbsp;</em>isn't the only&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>adaptation we're getting; an <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/minecraft-animated-series-netflix">animated series is also in the works</a> over at Netflix.</p>
<p>For now, though,&nbsp;<em>A Minecraft Movie&nbsp;</em>arrives in theaters on April 2nd. I look forward to it taking roughly all the money in the world regardless of its quality.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/12-things-to-do-while-youre-a-meatshield-in-black-ops-6.971823/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/12-things-to-do-while-youre-a-meatshield-in-black-ops-6<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
If somebody grabs you from behind and turns you into a human shield in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call Of Duty: Black Ops 6</a>, they can drag you around for about five seconds before you die, assuming they don't execute you early. Here are 12 things you can do in those five seconds:
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
1) Lean back in your chair, throw your arms up and luxuriously stretch out your shoulder muscles, while gazing through the window opposite at the sun and clouds and savouring anew the wonder and strangeness of being alive, on this particular day in this particular place on this particular ball of rock, in a vast and empty cosmos
</p>
<p>
2) Switch windows and complete a move order in the excellent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/arco">Arco</a>, a tactics RPG with freeze-time combat, set in a fantastical version of South America
</p>
<p>
3) Be the bigger person and congratulate your captor over the game's proximity chat. Say something like: "Oh my heavens, what an excellent flanking manoeuvre! You certainly called <em>my</em> duty."
</p>
<p>
4) Explain to your captor that they have blundered right into your trap. How could they have fallen for such an obvious ruse? Truly, it would be laughable if it weren't so <em>pathetic</em>.
</p>
<p>
5) Seize the opportunity to appraise the battle in pop-out third-person view. This is your chance to make note of future cover positions, and check out everybody else's usage of the new omnimovement system, without having to worry about hitting them. Generally, when I'm fighting somebody who knows how to omnimove in Blops 6 it feels like shooting at spiders. Very large spiders with assault rifles.
</p>
<p>
6) Ingest and chew exactly one mouthful of regular-flavoured Pot Noodle
</p>
<p>
7) Spit out exactly one mouthful of regular-flavoured Pot Noodle, because that shit has been on your desk since Friday, you really need to give the room a once-over before your folks get home - oh god, what time is it, how is it already 4pm
</p>
<p>
8) Unleash your patented nonsensical catchphrase. "There goes the barnyard, and you can tell 'em I said so!" "Snoot's as good as a slap to a whistle on Wednesday, Reverend!"
</p>
<p>
9) Don't just monologue over proximity chat - rediscover the lost art of conversation. Perhaps your captor is experiencing tough times and could benefit from a kind word from a passing stranger. Be sure to prepare some brief, supportive quotes in advance. For example: "The heart is the toughest part of the body - tenderness is in the hands" (Carolyn Forché).
</p>
<p>
10) Loudly and derisively compare the meatshield mechanic in Blops 6 to meatshielding in the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gears-of-war">Gears Of War</a> series and especially Gears Of War 3, which was superior in terms of both visual flair and intricacy of execution. Kids today wouldn't know a meatshield from a cover-mantle. You can't even turn me into a human bomb, you <em>poseur</em>.
</p>
<p>
11) Try to pass yourself off as the in-game match commentator. We're losing A!
</p>
<p>
12) Take a few seconds to drink in the spectacle of your character being abducted. Nod approvingly at your surgical choice of cosmetics, the perfection of your skin-and-camo accessorisation. Not many people can look fabulous while being hauled around like a mattress, but once again, you've managed it.
</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://remapradio.com/articles/five-questions-about-gamings-future-with-a-video-game-analyst/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>One of my favorite follows <a href="https://x.com/MatPiscatella?ref=remapradio.com"><u>on the cursed social network formerly known as Twitter is Mat Piscatella</u></a>, executive director and video game industry advisor at Circana, a company that analyzes and tracks consumer behavior. In other words, they track video game sales and trends, and try to figure out where the industry’s been, where it’s at, and where it’s going.</p><p>For old heads, you might remember Circana as the NPD Group. Back when there used to be semi-public access to video game sales information, the NPD Group’s monthly data drops were legendary. It was the “Steam concurrents” of the Obama era, a small but informative glimpse into understanding whether a game you were hoping might get a sequel had actually sold well.</p><p>Like I said, Piscatella is a great follow because he isn’t afraid to often spit back at the many, many weirdos who confront him for the sin of sharing context about how video games are doing.</p><figure><blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Dear Enthusiast Gaming Forum,</p><p>If you're gonna discount the success of Switch sales because it's a conncected/portable hybrid device, please discount the success of PS2 being a gaming/DVD player hybrid device.</p><p>Or, better yet, don't discount the success of either idk.</p></div>— Mat Piscatella (@MatPiscatella) <a href="https://twitter.com/MatPiscatella/status/1822648179600576882?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=remapradio.com">August 11, 2024</a></blockquote>
</figure><p>Consider this a potential setup for a podcast appearance, but I had an opportunity to run a few questions by him <a href="https://www.circana.com/intelligence/press-releases/2024/u-s-video-game-market-to-decline-in-2024-but-circana-forecasts-2025-rebound/?ref=remapradio.com"><u>because Circana released its “Future of Video Game Report”</u></a> that looks at 2024’s troubles—sluggish hardware, a continued post-COVID bump sales hangover, a distinct lack of Switch 2 or Grand Theft Auto VI—and why, with some luck, 2025 might be different.&nbsp;</p><p>Given how much we’ve talked on Remap Radio about the seemingly never ending layoffs and the “survive to 2025” mentality that’s gathered amongst developers, I wanted to call in an expert.</p><p>What are the reasons for optimism? And where might it all go wrong?</p><hr><figure><figcaption><span>Please, lord, give me an updated Steam Deck and a new Switch.</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Your report suggests the video game industry is looking at a “rebound” in 2025 because of <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em> and the expectation that Nintendo will release new hardware. I keep hearing that phrase “survive until ‘25,” aka just hold on until 2025. What does a “rebound” look like, though? Fewer layoffs?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>In this case, it would be mid to high single-digit percentage growth in consumer spending, and a return of some players that have lapsed following the peak of video game engagement seen in 2021. The challenge is that the market is shifting even more into winners and everyone else—meaning overall spending growth is expected in 2025, but the big winners of this growth are likely to be Take-Two Interactive and Nintendo.</p><p>However, not all developers or publishers will benefit equally. What may happen is a return of investment into other areas of game development helped by the growth in overall spending, which could theoretically ease the pressure we've seen over the past couple of years that has resulted in so many layoffs and closures—this is not guaranteed.</p><p>The video game market continues to be challenged by the “forever games” like <em>Fortnite</em>, <em>Minecraft</em>, <em>Roblox</em>, <em>Grand Theft Auto V</em> and Call of Duty, which continue to dominate player count and engagement. These games have fostered deep connections with the player base through continual updates and social hooks.&nbsp;</p><p>While in the past, a new game would have to compete mainly against other new games in its release window, now the biggest competitor to any new game entering the market is <em>Fortnite</em>.</p><p><strong>If 2025 is a rebound year, how would you characterize 2024? I feel like I'm drowning in a lot of good games to play, and yet layoffs are regular and enormous.</strong></p><p>Spending on video game products is up slightly in 2024 year-to-date compared to last year. However, this small gain has been mainly driven by mobile, with<em> Monopoly Go </em>doing most of the heavy lifting. There are great new games, sure, but engagement (and spending) is tending to pool at the very high end of the market, with the biggest games (particularly games like <em>Fortnite</em>, <em>Roblox</em>, <em>Minecraft</em>, and other forever games) taking more and more of the overall pie.&nbsp;</p><p>Finding breakout success for a new title is more like winning the lottery now. It's not enough to have a good game—it requires a lot of hard work, perfect timing, and more than a little luck. </p><figure><figcaption><span>A deep source of pain for many parents—and many video game companies chasing its profits.</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>People expected both<em> Grand Theft Auto VI </em>and new Nintendo hardware this year. It's hard to imagine it slips out of 2025, but <em>Grand Theft Auto VI c</em>ertainly could. What happens if one, or both, don't arrive in 2025?</strong></p><p>It's likely to be the difference between mid-to-high single-digit percentage increases in consumer spending on video games and mid-to-high single-digit percentage declines in 2025. We're on the downside of the PlayStation 5/Xbox Series generation, and the Switch is very late in its cycle. We still have the pressures of higher prices in everyday spending categories like food and more desire from consumers to spend on experiences, such as travel.&nbsp;</p><p>The mass market consumer needs a push to spend more on gaming, especially if they can play <em>Fortnite </em>or a free-to-play mobile game to scratch the gaming itch. <em>EA Sports College Football 2</em>5 did exactly this, bringing a significant number of lapsed players back to the console space, generating sales of not just the game but also of hardware and accessories. <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em> and a Switch successor are likely to do the same, but to an even bigger extent.</p><p><strong>In the report, you noted the decline of physical media. Do you think we'll even have physical media with the next generation of consoles? For game companies, what does physical media represent? Why is it still important to them, if it is at all?</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>I'm expecting one more generation of physical media for PlayStation, perhaps two more for Nintendo, but Xbox Series may be the last Xbox generation with physical media—we'll have to wait and see on that one. Some players certainly prefer physical media, especially collectors and families. There is also a convenience factor for those with limited or spotty internet access.&nbsp;</p><p>Looking at purchasing behavior, more and more consumers are choosing the digital route, with this adoption rate increasing over time. Physical media is much more nice-to-have than need-to-have at the moment, although there are certainly benefits to having a physical release.</p><p>However, I don't expect the digital adoption trend to slow down.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5uE0XFJSVZA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Fortnite Battle Royale Chapter 5 Season 4 - Absolute Doom | Official Season Trailer"></iframe></figure><p><strong>Part of the problem the last few years has been a change in spending habits from COVID-19. Was any of that real? Can the industry realistically try to capture that kind of attention, interest, and spending again, or was it all completely a mirage?</strong></p><p>Everyone who ever dreamed of spending more time playing video games did so during 2020-21. We know the ceiling for both the percentage of people who want to play video games and how many hours they'd like to play if they could play all they wished. Are we going to reach the same levels of player count and engagement again when there are so many other draws on their attention and time compared to 2020 or 2021? Not anytime soon, if we ever do.&nbsp;</p><p>As I see it, the video game market went from a growth market to mature practically overnight. Meaning, since <em>Pong</em>, the video game market has continued to grow as more and more people have discovered gaming over time. But in 2020-21, a huge influx of players and time found their way to the video game market and many of them liked it and stuck around. Others have again left gaming, having been pulled away by other things. So now, it's more about optimization of the player base rather than pursuing more organic growth by finding new players.&nbsp;</p><p>This has been a painful transition in thinking for many in the industry, especially those who assumed that player growth would continue forever, especially after the boom seen in 2020-21.&nbsp;</p>

It has its admirable qualities–particularly its banger soundtrack and, for the time, some impressively large and detailed sprites–but it feels stiff and awkward, and doesn’t capture the appeal of the NES game that inspired it. (If you want to get a good look at it for yourself, you can watch speedrunner LRock617 absolutely demolish the game in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/8ZW6cvXIrVQ?si=5oC2P323dSwGzKky&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/8ZW6cvXIrVQ?si=5oC2P323dSwGzKky" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this run from this year’s Summer Games Done Quick event</a></span>, but keep in mind that he makes it look easy; it’s definitely not.) <em>Haunted Castle </em>itself is here in the <em>Dominus Collection</em>, too, and it’s a very welcome inclusion, as it’s an interesting and important part of <em>Castlevania </em>history, warts and all. But what really makes it special is that it’s accompanied by a brand new remake that really is something to behold.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="a89f4d3a2abaef6f5fc0e9b1e5d676db" data-recommend-id="image://a89f4d3a2abaef6f5fc0e9b1e5d676db" data-format="jpg" data-width="2856" data-height="1608" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Simon Belmont strides past a ghoul and toward a skeleton in pixelated arcade glory with a snowy mountain in the background." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Simon Belmont strides past a ghoul and toward a skeleton in pixelated arcade glory with a snowy mountain in the background." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Konami</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a89f4d3a2abaef6f5fc0e9b1e5d676db" data-recommend-id="image://a89f4d3a2abaef6f5fc0e9b1e5d676db" data-format="jpg" data-width="2856" data-height="1608" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Simon Belmont strides past a ghoul and toward a skeleton in pixelated arcade glory with a snowy mountain in the background." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Made by the wizards at <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M2_(game_developer)&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M2_(game_developer)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">M2</a></span>, <em>Haunted Castle Revisited </em>is a terrific, top-to-bottom reimagining of the original arcade game. It’s one of those arcade-style games that looks so good, it’s less like a real arcade game and more like my idealized childhood memory of what a great arcade game looked like. In other words, it looks like a dream. Where Simon Belmont’s walking animation in the original is awkward to say the least, here he strides with smooth, graceful determination. The multi-layered backgrounds give the world a sense of depth as it stretches away from you into the distance, with strands of fog giving the landscape a touch of gothic dread. The soundtrack absolutely pops. Your whip cracks with satisfying impact. Gone is the original’s stiffness, with Simon now feeling responsive and powerful. This is the great arcade game that <em>Castlevania </em>has always deserved but never received, until now.<br></p><p><em>Haunted Castle Revisited </em>isn’t a long game, and your first journey from the countryside all the way to Dracula’s clock tower will probably only take you about 30 minutes. But that’s the way an arcade game should be–an experience you can come back to again and again for a quick jolt of adrenaline and satisfaction–and it’s great to have this short, stunning experience alongside the more elaborate, epic undertakings of the DS <em>Castlevania </em>games. It’s the kind of game that, for true arcade aficionados, rewards mastery, and I intend to keep playing it until I manage to get the ultimate satisfaction of a one-credit clear. Even if your interest is more casual, though, <em>Haunted Castle Revisited </em>is an audiovisual feast, a sumptuous treat of gothic richness that reclaims one of <em>Castlevania</em>’s most denigrated and overlooked games. It’s a treasure.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
