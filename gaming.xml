<p>Sega celebrated the 'Year of Shadow' in 2024</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="75bcb26d6fd1f"><a title="Shadow the Hedgehog" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/75bcb26d6fd1f/shadow-the-hedgehog.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life / SEGA</em></figcaption></figure><p>Last year, Sega ran a year-long campaign for Shadow the Hedgehog that lined up with the release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-x-shadow-generations">Sonic X Shadow Generations</a> and the introduction of the "Ultimate Lifeform" in the live-action Sonic movies.</p>
<p>This was generally well-received by Sonic fans, and it's now led to some discussion about how Sega could potentially recreate this magic with <em>other</em> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mastersystem/sonic_the_hedgehog">Sonic the Hedgehog</a> characters in the future. Speaking in a recent interview, Sonic Team boss Takashi Iizuka said he would like to continue this trend by spotlighting a different character in the future. Here's what he had to say (<a href="https://mynintendonews.com/2025/10/18/sonic-team-boss-says-hed-like-to-spotlight-other-sonic-characters-like-they-did-with-shadow/">via My Nintendo News</a>):</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067gzhint&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>836k</span></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Takashi Iizuka:</strong> “Last year, we promoted The Year of Shadow, influenced by the movie, but I’d like to choose a theme each year and spotlight different characters. I think we can predict which characters will appear in the upcoming movie, so I’d like those characters to play an active role.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As any Sonic fan would know, Sega and the Sonic Team has a huge cast of characters it can call on (and even revive). The most recent game release <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-racing-crossworlds">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a> features characters from multiple generations of Sonic. Apart from the main cast, this includes characters like Espio, Zavok, and even Sonic's Werehog form.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/emiru-statement-after-twitch-assault-twitchcon/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/emiru-releases-damning-statement-after-twitch-assault-%E2%80%98this-is-definitely-my-last-twitchcon%E2%80%99.1328815/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Recently, videos surfaced showing a harrowing assault on Emiru at TwitchCon in San Diego this weekend. While participating in a meet-and-greet with fans, the prolific creator was approached by a man who forcefully embraced her, attempting to kiss her in front of a crowd that included security staff.</p>



<p>It was an event that has been lambasted by attendees and viewers, with Twitch’s management and security of the event coming under fire from numerous angles. In response to the event, Emiru, a cosplay and League of Legends streamer with two million followers, posted a lengthy statement berating Twitch and how the firm handled the assault.</p>



<h2 id="h-that-is-a-blatant-lie-emiru-says">‘That is a Blatant Lie’, Emiru Says</h2>



<p>Emiru was attacked by a man at TwitchCon, and while the Twitch leadership and social teams stressed the incident was handled professionally, Emiru had other things to declare that directly conflict with those claims.</p>



<p>Here’s the <a href="https://x.com/emiru/status/1979602519967060414" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full statement from Emiru</a> following the TwitchCon assault:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Yesterday, the man who assaulted me was allowed to cross multiple barriers at twitchcon and even in front of another creators meet and greet to grab me and my face and try to kiss me. Fortunately he wasn’t able to, but a lot of people have pointed out it could have been a lot worse!</p>



<p>I’m obviously shaken up by what happened and it’s not the first time I’ve dealt with something like this, but to tell you honestly, I am a lot more hurt and upset by how Twitch handled it during and after the fact. </p>



<p>Like I said, I don’t understand how he was allowed to make it to me in the first place. The security in the clip who reacts is my own security (it’s true my favorite and usual security guard was banned for holding a stalkers arm to bring him to police, at a past Twitchcon)</p>



<p>However, there were at least 3 or 4 other TwitchCon security staff in the area who did not react and let the guy walk away, as you can see in the clip since they don’t even appear in the frame LOL </p>



<p>The woman who is walking me away is my own personal manager, and behind the booth, the only two people who were checking on me and comforting me were her and my friend. None of the Twitchcon staff came to ask what happened or if I was okay. </p>



<p>My friend who was present told me Twitch security were also behind the booth afterwards joking about how they didn’t even see what happened and immediately laughing and moving on to talking about something else.</p>



<p>So if no one was checking if I was okay or if I needed anything and they let the guy run away initially, I have no idea what anyone hired to keep the event safe was doing LOL </p>



<p>In Twitch’s statement they said that the guy was immediately caught and detained, I’m sorry but that is a blatant lie. He was allowed to walk away from my meet and greet and I didn’t hear he was caught until hours after he attacked me, and it felt like this only happened because of my manager pressing for it, not because Twitchcon staff present thought it was a big deal. </p>



<p>I have a lot more I want to say but I will say it on stream later today instead of writing a book on here. </p>



<p>Thank you guys again, sorry you all had to see that. This is definitely my last Twitchcon, and it saddens me to say as a 10 year off and on attendee of Twitchcon, I think other creators should seriously consider not attending in the future. I did not feel cared for or protected, even bringing my own security and staff. I can’t imagine how creators without those options would feel.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Some have compared the gravity of the event to the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-36506082" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">shooting of Christina Grimmie</a>, a YouTube star turned professional artist who was gunned down in Florida almost a decade ago during an autograph signing event. It’s impossible to know the intentions of some before it’s too late.</p>



<p>This video shows the moment Emiru was assaulted:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Following Emiru being assaulted at TwitchCon, her fans took to social media platforms to hurl accusations and insults at Twitch for their handling of the incident, which has now been revealed as lacklustre at best.</p>



<p>TwitchCon continues to be a source of controversy and ill topics regardless of where it’s held or what Twitch does to keep it as secure as possible. Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> if you’ve got any horror stories from this year’s TwitchCon event.</p>

Now, a new Nintendo patent filed in April and published this week has ignited rumours about Nintendo DS games potentially returning in the future.</p>
<p>As highlighted by <a href="https://x.com/MikeOdysseyYT/status/1978839968895074613">Mike Odyssey on social media (via GoNintendo)</a>, the three methods of dual-screen gaming detailed include "Dual Screen (Parent and Child Screens), Single Screen Mode (Picture in Picture) and Switch Mode (Switch between Screens)".

<p>The Nintendo DS library previously appeared on Wii U's Virtual Console service. It featured over 30 games and supported touch interaction on the system's GamePad. Considering this particular collection has already appeared on a Nintendo online service, it wouldn't be the biggest surprise if it did resurface at some point in the future.</p>
<p>Of course, this is just a patent, so it doesn't necessarily guarantee anything is in the pipeline for the Switch Online 'Nintendo Classics' library, and it could just be Nintendo going about its usual business. If we do hear anything else about this latest discovery, we'll let you know.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s the end of another week, but hopefully your streak has made it to the end, too! We’re looking at the latest NYT Connections hints and solutions in this guide, helping you to figure out the fastest way to solve today’s puzzle. It’s not so tough, but if you want to continue your streak quickly and get on with your day, you’ll want to scroll down.</p>



<p>Here are the top NYT Connections hints for today, October 19.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-october-19">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (October 19)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll get started with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will be enough to spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #861:</p>



<ul>
<li>SPINE</li>



<li>BUG</li>



<li>MARSH</li>



<li>FREAK</li>



<li>JACKET</li>



<li>SKORT</li>



<li>COVER</li>



<li>FALL</li>



<li>FLIP</li>



<li>WIPEOUT</li>



<li>LEAVES</li>



<li>TUMBLE</li>



<li>DOVER</li>



<li>CRUNCHY</li>



<li>WIG</li>



<li>SPILL</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>Unsteady footing? These words all suggest sudden loss of control</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em>Parts of a book—or a tree</em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>When emotions run wild…</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>Odd mix, but think geography and fashion</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, October 19.</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-for-today-october-19-861">NYT Connections Answers for Today, October 19 (#861)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– FALL, SPILL, TUMBLE, WIPEOUT</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – COVER, JACKET, LEAVES, SPINE</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – BUG, FLIP, FREAK, WIG</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – CRUNCHY, DOVER, MARSH, SKORT</li>
</ul>



<figure></figure>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Amazon’s God of War TV Series Casting Call Has Leaked]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-tv-amazon-casting-call-leak/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon%E2%80%99s-god-of-war-tv-series-casting-call-has-leaked.1328797/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A casting call for Amazon’s upcoming God of War adaptation has leaked online from one of entertainment’s biggest insiders.</p>



<p>PlayStation’s iconic God of War series has entertained players since 2005. Unfortunately, a Hollywood adaptation has never been successfully done or thought of. In 2022, Prime Video announced that the reboot titles would be brought to streaming as a show, with many of the game’s crew producing. Just recently, reports of a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-amazon-filming-march-2026-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spring 2026 shooting date</a> have surfaced, meaning production is getting into motion. Now, it seems one of the most anticipated parts is underway.</p>



<h2 id="h-god-of-war-tv-series-casting-call-leaked-details-characters-and-plot">God of War TV Series Casting Call Leaked, Details Characters and Plot</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>According to industry insider <a href="https://x.com/DanielRPK/status/1979632388855779583" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">DanielRPK</a>, notable for his credible movie leaks, Prime Video’s God of War is currently casting for the show. In particular, a casting call for several characters, including descriptions, is available and shows some insight into the show’s direction. We see what the team is looking for for Kratos, Atreus, and other parts. The exact descriptions can be found on <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/141416746?utm_campaign=postshare_creator&amp;utm_content=android_share" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">DanielRPK’s Patreon</a> and on a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1oa9013/god_of_war_tv_series_casting_call/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reddit post</a> dedicated to it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Though the Reddit post theorizes which description matches which God of War character, it’s up in the air. Regardless, take the leak with a grain of salt, as always. Still, it’s interesting to note a few things about the casting call. First is the description for series regular Alexander, which sounds a lot like Odin. However, Odin only makes a full appearance in Ragnarok, meaning the show may not follow the games too closely. Another interesting bit is for Joshua, likely Atreus, it lists him as a ‘one-year series regular’. This likely means that the show intends to find another actor to play the part after the first season. Atreus, in the games, does grow up, but they kept the same actor, Sunny Suljic, the whole time. </p>



<p>Given Amazon’s God of War’s upcoming start date, it’s likely we’ll have casting by the end of the year. Still, knowing these descriptions, fans can come up with even better fancasts and speculate. A few weeks back, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kratos-actor-shortlist-outlined-by-movie-insider/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">actors for Kratos surfaced</a>, and while some may not fit the description anymore, actors like Dave Bautista and in-game actor Christopher Judge still count. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The first script draft for the Sleeping Dogs film adaptation is finished, according to its actor and producer.</p>



<p>Released in 2012, Sleeping Dogs has become quite the cult classic. Following an undercover police officer in Hong Kong, players explore an open world with parkour abilities and martial arts. Despite positive reviews, low sales led to the series being dead in the water. However, Hollywood has gotten its hands on it, now reinvigorated by MCU’s Shang-Chi actor <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sleeping-dogs-adaptation-and-sequel-mentioned-by-simu-liu/">Simu Liu</a>, who’ll star as protagonist Wei Shen. Now, according to the actor himself, it’s farther along than we thought.</p>



<h2 id="h-simu-liu-gives-new-update-on-sleeping-dogs-film-adaptation">Simu Liu Gives New Update on Sleeping Dogs Film Adaptation</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>On <a href="https://x.com/SimuLiu/status/1979664278459388314?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Simu Liu’s Twitter/X</a>, the actor posted two pictures, with one being of his sleepy dog, Chopa. The other image was of the official Sleeping Dogs script. In the caption, shown above, it seems it has been completed and likely sent in for feedback. Interestingly enough, the name of the writer is blocked, so it could be a surprise new addition or director. Still, after scripting is casting and, eventually, filming.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While out of the blue, it’s good to know Sleeping Dogs is proceeding well with an adaptation. In the past, Donnie Yen of Rogue One fame was set to bring it to Hollywood, but <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/donnie-yen-sleeping-dogs-movie-dead/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nothing turned out</a>. Fortunately, Simu Liu has been very vocal about his desire to make it happen, even producing it himself. While Sleeping Dogs didn’t sell well for games, it may now get another chance with Hollywood.&nbsp;</p>

      <article data-ads="true" data-article-type="news" data-article-group="news" data-paywalled="false" data-premium="false" data-sponsored="false" data-type="article">


<header data-component="article-header">
  

    <div id="main-content">
  

        <p>About 400 other Blizzard workers voted to do the same earlier this week</p>

    </div>


  

    

</header>
  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
It's a busy week for union organisers at Activision Blizzard. Yesterday, in conjunction with the Communications Workers of America (CWA), a group of over 100 developers that work on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hearthstone">Hearthstone</a> and the mobile only strategy game Warcraft Rumble voted "strongly in favor of wall-to-wall union representation." This comes after around 400 Blizzard platform and technology workers <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/around-400-blizzard-platform-technology-staff-are-the-latest-microsoft-workers-whove-voted-to-unionise">voted to unionise</a>, also with the CWA.
</p>
<p>
The union is made up of numerous roles such as quality assurance testers, artists, designers, software engineers, and producers, having been particularly inspired by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/world-of-warcraft">World of Warcraft</a> devs that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/over-500-world-of-warcraft-developers-at-blizzard-have-voted-to-form-microsofts-biggest-wall-to-wall-union">voted to unionise last July</a>. Organising committee member and game designer Dominic Calkosz said in a statement, "My coworkers, as individuals, have voiced many concerns over the years, but it is easy for any company to ignore individuals. We chose to organise in pursuit of a collective voice and a force of solidarity that the industry cannot ignore."
</p>
<p>
Not that there's ever a bad time to form a union, but you can easily understand why these devs are putting in the work to do so right now. From <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-cancel-perfect-dark-reboot-and-shut-the-developers-down-in-the-name-of-continued-success">entire, massive game cancellations</a>, to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-layoffs-are-reportedly-underway-with-zenimax-and-king-employees-losing-their-jobs">sweeping layoffs at Microsoft</a>, to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/following-mass-layoffs-microsoft-exec-insists-return-to-office-mandate-is-not-about-reducing-headcount">policy changes</a> that might as well be more layoffs, it is not a secure time to be a game developer right now. Big solidarity to the newly unionised workers.
</p>
<p>
Also worth mentioning as part of ongoing internal tensions at Microsoft is its offering of its Azure cloud services to the Israeli Ministry of Defense as the country's military enacts its invasion of Gaza. The contracts related to these specific services were <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2025/09/25/update-on-ongoing-microsoft-review/">recently cancelled</a>, but Xbox <a href="https://bdsmovement.net/news/microsoft-blocks-israel%E2%80%99s-use-its-technology-mass-surveillance-palestinians">remains a target of the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions movement</a>. For more on how the game industry remains connected to this ongoing issue, you can check out <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-culture-of-intimidation-retaliation-and-oppression-how-microsofts-gaza-stance-fuelled-an-industry-spanning-boycott">this piece from Edwin</a> where he spoke with various game devs and tech workers about it.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/phasmophobia/">Phasmophobia</a> developer Kinetic Games has revealed a new map for the game, set inside an abandoned restaurant. The location--Neil's Diner--was unveiled during a TwitchCon panel that celebrated the recent fifth anniversary of the co-op horror game, and players can explore it starting November 11.</p><p>Kinetic Games described Neil's Diner as a "run-down, retro restaurant" that's been long-abandoned by staff and diners alike. While this is one of the smaller maps in Phasmophobia, it's still full of authentic details and phantoms hungry for thrills.</p><p>"We always thought a diner would fit perfectly, so Nell's was born, and it's been such a fun challenge bringing it to life," lead developer Daniel Knight said in a press release.

            <p>
I think if you were to travel back in time to around the 14th century to wherever Dante Alighieri was at the time, and showed him <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hell-maiden">Hell Maiden</a>, a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a>, bullet hell, deckbuilding, '90s anime-esque, essentially fan fiction sequel to his Divine Comedy, he'd probably say something like "Mama mia" and die on the spot in fear of what his own creation spawn hundreds of years later. Yet as ridiculous a concept as it is - and it is ridiculous - the demo for it is quite good.
</p>
<p>
To compare it to other games, Hell Maiden is like a mash-up of Hades and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-survivors">Vampire Survivors</a>, the latter leading the charge in moment-to-moment gameplay. You play as Dante himself, or in this case, herself, who is back in hell after having reached Paradiso, with amnesia. And so she begins the ascension to heaven once more!
</p>

<p>
When you start off, you're armed with Dante's quill, which sends out fiery blasts every second or so akin to Vampire Survivor's whip. You can have up to four weapons (at least that appears to be the limit in the demo), said weapons represented as cards. Leveling up gives you the opportunity to choose from three new cards, which most of the time will be weapon modifiers, doing things like adding more projectiles, increasing damage, that sort of thing, but you'll occasionally get new weapons to use.
</p><p>
If you pull a duplicate modifier card, you can fuse them with another to improve it, or place it on a different weapon if you so choose. There are even some cards that can affect multiple weapons depending on where you place them. 
</p>
<p>
Like in other Vampire Survivor clones you don't have much control over your attacks, though you can point them in one direction while moving in another, so you do have some control. This feels solid too, at no point did I feel frustrated or overwhelmed by what was on screen, I know each of my deaths was my own fault. It's all quite tightly woven together, especially impressive considering that whenever the game does launch it'll do so in early access.
</p>
<p>
The Hades element crops up in the form of narrative structure more than anything. Upon death you're brought to The Forum, a hub area where you can hang out and chat with various Poets of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/limbo">Limbo</a>, such as Homer, Virgil, and Horace. It seems that befriending them lets you unlock other starter weapons, and they all allow you to pick up different weapon and modifier cards too.
</p>
<p>
All of this is wrapped up in an incredibly well rendered vaguely '90s anime art style, at least when it comes to the dialogue scenes. The rest of the game is mostly pixel art, but there are special moves you can use that do screen-wide damage following some stellar, fully animated cutscenes showing off these anime girlified versions of, I would like to remind you, very real poets.
</p><p>
For the most part just mashing up genres, even if it's done well, doesn't inherently colour me interested in a game, but with its extremely well realised concept, I am currently sold on Hell Maiden. I just hope no one invents time travel so Dante doesn't die sooner than he was meant to.
</p>
<p>
Hell Maiden doesn't have a release date just yet, but when it gets one, it'll launch in early access. You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3372060/Hell_Maiden/">wishlist it on Steam</a> now.

<p>A live-service Halo game may be in the works at Halo Studios, one reliable insider claims.</p>



<p>If you know Xbox, you know Halo. As a beacon for the FPS genre, the sci-fi series has been going on since 2001’s Combat Evolved. With the upcoming 25th anniversary coming up and the Halo World Championships next week, the hype for more Halo is huge. Halo Studios themselves confirmed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-halo-game-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we’ll see something new</a> revealed there, likely the Combat Evolved remake. However, according to a credible YouTuber, we may actually see another new project, this time in the live-service genre.</p>



<h2 id="h-halo-studios-may-release-a-live-service-halo-title-in-2026">Halo Studios May Release a Live-Service Halo Title in 2026</h2>

(Exclusive Report)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/O4dWoH0Pa0E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4dWoH0Pa0E" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a video</a> from Halo Youtuber Rebs Gaming, who previously leaked <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/halo-ce-remake-virtuos-studio-claim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Virtuos co-development</a> for Halo CE, a new entry in the franchise will be revealed soon. The game, which will be live-service, is expected to drop next year, meaning two Halo games could come out then. Rebs says their source told them it will be similar to Fortnite, though they don’t know if it’ll feature Battle Royale. No other information was provided, so take it with a grain of salt.</p>



<p>As previously mentioned, a new Halo-focused showcase event&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/halo-studios-new-deep-dive-october-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was announced</a>&nbsp;for the Halo World Championship on October 24th, 2025. The deep dive has been hyped by Halo Studios ever since last year. With the Halo CE remake all but confirmed, a new spinoff would be welcome news to fans. Even more so, having two new titles in 2026 makes for one great anniversary plan. Either way, fans of the series may be in for a treat come October 24th.</p>

            <p>
It's been a while since we've last seen anything FIFA in the world of video games, namely because EA took a gamble on saying goodbye to the sports association's official licence <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ea-officially-ditch-fifa-and-will-rename-the-series-ea-sports-fc-from-next-year">back in 2022</a>. Whether that has paid off, literally, is neither here nor there right now though, as FIFA announced this week that it has signed a "multi-year partnership" with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/football-manager-2026">Football Manager</a>, once again bringing its recognisable (<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-32897066">if potentially tainted</a>) name back to video games.
</p>
<p>
Well, technically this is the second FIFA game connection since the EA split, seeing as earlier this month it also revealed <a href="https://youtu.be/qKWU52Et1ww?si=CDiUYE_OJLJ0nC8I">FIFA Heroes</a>, but that one's just for phones so we can ignore it for now. In any case, this particular deal sounds like it will go into effect pretty soon, as there'll be official licences for things like the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fifa-world">FIFA World</a> Cup, the Women's World Cup, and Club World Cup.
</p>
<p>
According to a <a href="https://www.footballmanager.com/news/football-manager-and-fifa-sign-multi-year-partnership">blog post</a>, all this FIFA stuff will be coming as part of a "playable, revamped International Management module," coming to Football Manager 2026 sometime next year, ahead of the World Cup itself - that kicks off (pun intended) the middle of June, so this update will at least be out in the first half of the year. Said blog post also notes that kits for all 48 of the participating teams in the world cup will be included, as well as some broadcast graphics and tournament branding.
</p>
<p>
Is any of this particularly necessary? Probably not, but it does show that FIFA is still quite interested in having a games presence. Time will tell if that recent, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/unionised-ea-workers-slam-billion-dollar-buyout-for-risking-layoffs-to-pad-investor-pockets-while-senators-worry-about-saudi-arabia-rewriting-us-history">internally controversial</a>, private <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ea-are-about-to-be-bought-for-50-billion-by-saudi-arabia-and-jared-kushners-investment-firms-claims-report">buyout of EA</a> will see EA Sports FC get its old name back.
</p>
<p>
Football Manager 2026 is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/football-manager-2026-will-be-coming-home-soon-enough-with-a-november-release-date">due out next month</a> on February 4th.

            <p>Workers in Blizzard's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hearthstone">Hearthstone</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/warcraft-arclight-rumble">Warcraft Rumble</a> teams have voted to unionise with the Communications Workers of America.</p>
<p>Over 100 software engineers, designers, artists, quality assurance testers, and producers voted to join the CWA Local 9510 in Irvine, California, joining 1900+ other Activision Blizzard employees who have similarly chosen to unionise.

<p>"My coworkers, as individuals, have voiced many concerns over the years, but it is easy for any company to ignore individuals," said organising committee member and game designer Dominic Calkosz. "We chose to organise in pursuit of a collective voice and a force of solidarity which the industry cannot ignore."</p><p>The move comes shortly after CWA president Claude Cummings Jr. met with workers at Blizzard's Irvine campus to "celebrate the growing wave of organising across the industry" as unionised staff across Activision Blizzard <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/cwa-president-claude-cummings-jr-visits-video-game-members-ahead-bargaining-session">joined the World of Warcraft Bargaining Committee</a> "for a solidarity walk as contract negotiations continued".</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/dualsense-v3-battery/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-dualsense-v3-doesn%E2%80%99t-have-a-removable-battery-despite-rumors.1328659/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Despite previous rumors that the DualSense V3 will have a removable battery, it has been debunked by tech reviewer and content creator Austin Evans.</p>



<p>In his latest video, the content creator looked at the latest PlayStation 5 Pro SKU, which was rumored to be bundled with a new DualSense V3 controller dubbed ‘V3. However, the latest revision of the controller certainly does not include a removable battery, although it is a different battery from those used in previous controllers.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-dualsense-controller-might-have-removable-battery/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">original rumor of a detachable battery originated</a> from the Polish retailer PPE, so it’s entirely possible that the rumor was lost in translation somewhere, as almost everything else from their PlayStation 5 Pro and controller report was accurate.</p>



<p>That being said, a removable battery for the DualSense does make a lot of sense. Still, with the latest revision having not implemented it, it’s likely a feature we won’t see until the next generation.</p>



<p>You can watch the whole YouTube video from Austin Evans below, which, at face value, does show that the PlayStation 5 Pro has some minor changes. One of them is a reduction in the console’s weight – a change that has become a common theme in these revisions.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>As for what’s next for PlayStation, well, all eyes are on its next generation, which will, somewhat obviously, be called the PlayStation 6.</p>



<p>In an exclusive report by Insider Gaming, we reported that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-playstation-6-is-planned-to-have-a-detachable-disc-drive-on-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation 6</a> is planned to feature a detachable disc drive, which was first introduced midway through the PlayStation 5’s lifecycle.</p>



<p>What do you think of the DualSense v3 not featuring a removable battery? Are you disappointed? Let me know what you’re thinking on the&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <p>
Like whatever genres you like, but for me personally, I find <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-platform-games-on-pc">platformers</a> to be the quintessential video game genre. Even with the most challenging entries, there are very few other genres that (when done well) are as easy and quick to pick up, play, and have fun with. I think that's why so many of them have such longevity, one such game being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/n">N++</a>, a tough but fair platformer that's celebrating its 10th anniversary with a new update.
</p>
<p>
Available now and appropriately titled TEN++ (as if there was any other choice), it's quite a simple update: more game! Which translates to more levels across the game's solo, co-op, and race modes. For solo there's two new level sets, titled "?!" and "!?" respectively, with co-op and race getting one level set each, both titled TEN++. In a trailer announcing the update, developer Metanet Software said that there's "no way anyone 100%'s it… for real this time!"
</p>

<p>
In a <a href="https://www.metanetsoftware.com/2025/celebrating-10-years-of-nplusplus">blog post</a>, the devs got a bit candid about working on N++ too, saying that "by 2018, we were very burned out, having worked tirelessly on N++ over 6 years. We took a little break - but the thing is, we always come back to making levels. Those of you who have tried it may understand; it’s just fun to do, and somehow there are always new ideas to be uncovered." Subsequently, over the years, they've kept making more levels, having "rediscovered what is so special about this game," thanking the game's community for its enthusiasm in helping them do so.
</p><p>
Oh, and there's another bit of good news too: Metanet Software have started development on their next game. They're keeping quiet about it for now, but you can <a href="https://www.metanetsoftware.com/newgame">sign up to hear about it</a> (and potentially play its beta) further down the line.
</p>
<p>
And if you've never played it before, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/230270/N_NPLUSPLUS/">it's currently less than three quid on Steam</a>, an offer that's hard to turn your nose up at.

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/xenotilt-hostile-pinball-action</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mini-review-xenotilt-hostile-pinball-action-switch-the-balatro-of-pinball-games.1328623/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/demons_tilt">Demon’s Tilt</a> deservedly received praise for its occult-themed gameplay, with many deeming it a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/demons_tilt">worthy spiritual successor</a> to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/tg16/devils_crush">Devil’s Crush</a>. Now, sole developer WIZNWAR is back with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/xenotilt_hostile_pinball_action">Xenotilt: Hostile Pinball Action</a>, a cyberpunk-inspired twist that improves upon its predecessor in almost every conceivable way. Simply put, this is one of the greatest pinball games ever made.</p>
<p>If <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/balatro">Balatro</a> managed to pull in players who have never even entertained the idea of playing poker, then Xenotilt has the power to do the same for pinball – it’s remarkably approachable while being <em>incredibly</em> difficult to put down once it's got a hold of you. In combining straightforward mechanics with a near-constant stream of points topping up your high score, you’ll find the desire to have “just one more go” almost impossible to ignore.</p>
<p>Set on a single ‘table’ (which is themed to look like a spaceship of sorts), the aim is simple: score as many points as you can with your three allocated balls. Split between three distinct tiers, the table houses a selection of boss characters that you’ll need to vanquish to gain huge chunks of points.</p>
<p>You achieve this by battering them with your ball via carefully aimed shots from the flippers, or by firing from auto-turrets. You activate these (providing you have ammo) by ‘cradling’ the ball on one of the flippers and pressing ‘down’. The turrets immediately lock onto enemies both big and small, and it’s a great way to clear the field and give yourself some more room.</p>
<p>Like other pinball games, you can also nudge the table to coax the ball into moving in specific directions, either to hit an enemy, grab a jackpot, or prevent yourself from falling into oblivion. Nudging too often within a short period of time can lead to a game over, so use this sparingly!</p>
<p>There's <em>endless</em> opportunities to ramp up your score, and if you’re able to maintain your combo multiplier, you’ll soon find that you’re able to break through the million-point barrier, perhaps even the billion. This is perfectly doable on ‘Normal Mode’, but if you opt for ‘EX Mode’, you can occasionally enter bonus areas completely separate from the main table. These offer up massive rewards, and one is even a quaint little spin on the game of snooker – it’s great fun.</p>
<p>It also looks the part too, with pixel art sprites, neon colours, and gloriously outrageous effects combining to create a stunning symphony of light and sound. It can sometimes be difficult to keep track of things in the default view, but Xenotilt also supports TATE mode, which looks awesome whether you’re playing on the OLED Model or the Switch 2. Similarly, the music is inspired, and I guarantee that at least one of the tracks will get stuck in your head long after you step away from the table.</p>
<p>If you’ve never played a pinball game before, then Xenotilt might well be the only one you’ll ever need. Heck, even if you don't <em>like</em> pinball, I suspect playing this might very well change your mind – it's mercilessly addictive from the get-go. Give it a shot and you’ll soon succumb to its will.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/xenotilt-hostile-pinball-action]]></content:encoded>

<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cult-of-the-lamb">Cult of the Lamb</a> is honestly not a game I expected to still be going for as long as and as strongly as it has. It came out in 2022! That was practically a decade ago, at least in games industry years, and yet here is developer Massive Monster showing off the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike's</a> next big expansion, Woolhaven. There's no release date other than an early 2026 release window, but a new trailer did at least show off all of that farming you'll get to do. Or, I guess get your cult to do.
</p>
<p>
The big theme for this expansion, as you may have gathered from the name already, is winter, that pesky incoming season those of us in England will inevitably complain about after having complained about the heat all summer. This particular trailer hones in on the new ranch and the steps you can take to deal with cold, harsh weather that stops your crops from growing as well.

<p>
Namely, you can raise animals, which includes things that look like goats, cows, crabs, snails, turtles. You can raise them from birth, breed them, even name them, and after all that you can shear them for some resources, or carve them up for Sunday dinner. Makes naming them just a little bit more difficult, but this is a game where you run a cult, if you take issue with slaughtering an animal for sustenance and not that, I would have questions.
</p><p>
You do also need to make sure they get fed, cleaned, protected from predators too, and there's the option to take them on a walk or ride on them. Over time and levels you can get your followers to attend to these duties, or even get a best animal friend of their own. This part I find quite interesting.
</p>
<p>
Like many sim games of its ilk, the ultimate goal is automation. Take <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a>, a game where given enough time, you'll get to a point where you don't even need to tend to your own crops anymore, freeing up your time for more leisurely activities or even bits of story.
</p>
<p>
Woolhaven comes with a couple of new dungeons, so I imagine this loop of building up your ranch as you go on more adventures works similarly to the rest of the game. But I am curious to see if there's any kind of direct commentary on the ever popular, and ever growing, farming sim genre, seeing as you have a whole cult to dictate.
</p>
<p>
In any case, there's apparently more reveals to come for Woolhaven, but in the meantime you can look forward to playing it early 2026.

At long last, I can role-play my Windrunner character with my spren partner, Malbifina (Mal for short), and stand against the Desolation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Developed by <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/producer/brotherwise-games"><u>Brotherwise Games</u></a> in close collaboration with Brandon Sanderson himself, the initial offerings for the Cosmere RPG focus solely on <a href="https://coppermind.net/wiki/Roshar" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Roshar</u></a> and the systems of the Stormlight Archive books, with three offerings: The Stormlight Handbook (the Player’s Handbook), The Stormlight World Guide (the Dungeon Master’s Guide), and Stonewalkers (a standalone campaign you can play through). For those who aren’t familiar with the Cosmere or Sanderson’s work, the Cosmere is a large galaxy-spanning, progressively more interconnected series of (mostly) epic fantasy novels by Brandon Sanderson. Composed of multiple worlds, each with its own unique and cleverly crafted magic systems, one of which is Roshar, home to Stormlight (magic lightning), spren (manifestations of different emotions and feelings), the Knights Radiant (super paladins), and millennia of war. We have a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/brandson-sanderson-cosmere-books-in-order"><u>comprehensive reading guide</u></a>, so to find out more and get a better picture, I suggest you head there and take a look.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Cosmere RPG Photos</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Cosmere utilizes a D20-based system, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/board-games-like-dungeons-and-dragons"><u>similar to something like D&amp;D</u></a> or Pathfinder, where you will use a 20-sided die to make various skill checks, with other dice used to fulfill other needs (such as dealing damage). The action economy will also feel familiar, with basic actions during combat falling into either Actions, Reactions, or Free Actions territories, with Actions requiring anywhere between one and three of your pool per turn. Generally, on your turn, a player will have two or three action points they can use, with more powerful Actions requiring multiple points to pull off. Thanks to its intelligent use of icons denoting the different types and how many points an action takes to use, the whole process is rather new player-friendly and quick to grasp. But just because aspects may feel familiar doesn’t mean that the Cosmere RPG doesn’t do anything new, however.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Considering this is a system that was designed in part by Brandon Sanderson, a man with the ability to write an inhuman amount of books in a short period of time, it shouldn’t be a surprise that narrative and story play a large part in the actual mechanics of the Cosmere RPG, too. A special d6, referred to as the “Plot Die”, isn’t used for every check and is instead reserved for those moments that the GM deems as moments critical to the plot and story they are telling. Moments where the stakes could be raised, granting unforeseen opportunities that impact the story or granting you an “Opportunity,” which is a special resource that can be spent. On the flip side, your roll of the plot die may instead cause a complication to arise in your plan, perhaps causing you to get in an ally's way during a crucial moment, or another blunder that results in a failure. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/17/cosmererpg-review5-1760730416654.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">This intertwining of narrative and story development also seeps into the character creation process and progression, resulting in a more open and flexible system that I found particularly enamored by. Before anything, you select your ancestry from either Human or Singer (and yes, you can mess around with Singer forms), which will help dictate what areas of the world or lore you specialize in. As a human, you can pick from what region you hail from, giving you an edge on checks on topics, legends, houses, and language, for example, that would make sense for your character to have. With your ancestry picked, you start fleshing out the sort of person they are.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Instead of picking a specific class like Warrior or Druid, players instead choose a Heroic Path, such as a Hunter, Leader, or Agent, each with its own unique skill tree and specialization lines that you can dive into. There are six base Heroic Paths (Agent, Envoy, Hunter, Leader, Scholar, and Warrior) available in the Stormlight Handbook, each with three specializations, and each has a special Key Talent that helps set each path apart from the others. When you level up, you aren’t leveling up a class but your character themself, meaning if you want you can continue down the path you have chosen already and unlocking new Talents (the abilities of the path) if you want, or you can freely choose a new path to start traveling down that makes sense for where your character finds themselves at that moment. No having to deal with complicated multi-class rules or different hit dice for health, none of that. It makes the idea of making a complicated and multi-faceted character more approachable and incentivized, and also just makes the leveling process quicker.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/17/cosmererpg-review7-1760730423665.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Once you hit level two, though, things really get exciting as, if you wish to, you are able to begin down a Radiant Path of your choice, and yes, all of them are here: Stonewards, Bondsmiths, Windrunners, Skybreakers, Dustbringers, Edgedancers, Truthwatchers, Lightweavers, Elsecallers, and Willshapers. Each Radiant Path will grant you a spren of your own you can come up with, access to that Radiant’s associated Surges, and of course, spending Stormlight and Investiture. If you have read the Stormlight books, then let’s be honest with ourselves, being a <a href="https://coppermind.net/wiki/Knights_Radiant" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Knight Radiant</u></a> is a big selling point of these books for us, but if you haven’t read them, think of these orders as super Paladins. Each order has access to pretty awesome powers, a little familiar, and eventually, you can even recruit squires to work with you. And just like the Heroic Paths, each Radiant Path features three talent trees you can dive into, with two focusing on a specific surge, Abrasion and Division, for example, with Dustbringers, and then a path that improves your bond with your spren, allowing you to swear further Ideals as a Knight Radiant. Yes, this is awesome, and yes, I have come up with more spren friends than I care to admit to since getting these books. Come at me, Unmade!</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I've found that more role-playing is always a good thing in TTRPGs.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">To help further define your character, you will also establish a purpose for them, something that drives the character in what they do, which will lead you to create goals for them to strive for. A goal may be something as simple as seeking revenge on someone to something more nebulous, such as finding new ways to heal others, but you are also required to come up with obstacles or character flaws that you have to contend with while striving for your goal. Perhaps in your pursuit of your goal to find new ways to heal others, your character could be blinded by some of the harm done in trying to confirm a hypothesis, or be willing to test ideas that may not be completely safe. Making this goal and obstacle component front-and-center not only helps the GM plan and tailor adventures to individual characters, but also makes the players think more about the characters they are playing as people and not just a character sheet. I've found that more role-playing is always a good thing in TTRPGs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While I may enjoy the mechanics of the Cosmere RPG, as a fan of Sanderson’s books, I would dare say I may like these RPG books more for the details they reveal and how they dive deeper into the world of Roshar and Cosmere as a whole. Since you are able to play as a member of any of the orders of Knights Radiant, I loved looking through the descriptions and breakdowns of not only the various ideals, but also their respective Surges (i.e. the special abilities of a particular order). Reading through these books, especially the World Guide, gave me a better idea of the cultures and visual identity of the peoples of Roshar.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/17/cosmererpg-review8-1760730427772.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Brandon has stated that the material in these guides will be <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/brotherwise/the-stormlight-archive-rpg/posts/4168574?lang=zh" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>considered canon </u></a>with the events in his books, and as such, a great amount of care has been taken by the team to consult and confirm with his lore keepers that everything fits. For readers who may not have finished <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/203578847-wind-and-truth" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Wind and Truth</u></a>, the latest entry of the Stormlight Archive that was released in December 2024, you will want to be careful of spoilers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a strange way, the wealth of information these books present also really drew my attention to what the Cosmere RPG doesn’t give me to play around and roleplay with, and it’s here where a vast majority of my complaints reside. Take, for instance, the <a href="https://coppermind.net/wiki/Herald" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Heralds</u></a>, legendary heroes that have held back the evil forces of Odium between desolations. Beings that entire religions on Roshar have been built up around, and whose influence is felt in nearly every facet of the lore. The books have nice sections talking about them, featuring gorgeous artwork, but the RPG is utterly lacking in details for folks that may want to try playing as one.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As someone who is typically in the “forever GM” chair, the fact that none of the books give me basic stat blocks for them is shocking to me. Why aren’t there rules or stats for the <a href="https://coppermind.net/wiki/Honorblade" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Honor Blades</u></a>? Going even a step further, the fact that the rules don’t give me details for big bads like the various Unmade or even the shards of Odium, Cultivation, or Honor, just bum me out. To a lesser extent, I wish that these first books gave us at least a little tease on what fans may expect from how the other magic systems may operate or the direction they want to take with them. The Ghostblood Enforce enemy does feature “Burning Pewter” which only serves as a buff, and doesn’t give much of an idea on how burning metals will differ from using Stormlight. I realize that each of the worlds will eventually get their own tomes of goodness that dive deep into these things, but couldn’t we have gotten a small, itsy-bitsy tease of how allomancy or AonDor may work? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to the physical books that will be available to the masses in November, Cosmere is seeing relatively frequent updates and additional supplemental materials being added to the Virtual Tabletop service. Not only are you able to snag digital versions of all the books right now, allowing you to build your characters and run games, <a href="https://cosmererpgnexus.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>CosmereRPGNexus.com</u></a> also has scenarios that you can run and provide you with details and rules to create custom higher-tiered enemies to contend with. If you would prefer just having PDFs, though, you can purchase them all at <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/publisher/6193/brotherwise-games" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Drive Thru RPG</u></a>, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For diehard Sanderson fans, even if you have no desire to play a TTRPG, these books, particularly the World Guide, is a must-buy just for lore and the information it provides on Roshar. As TTRPG books, they do well enough, but the item and enemy offerings are lacking in terms of options, especially when compared to other fantasy RPGs. As both a longtime TTRPG player and lover of the Cosmere, it surprises me that some of what has been omitted has left me a bit disappointed. It just comes off as “just wait for the second Roshar set” to me. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The physical Cosmere RPG books will be released on November 12, with digital versions available for purchase now on <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/publisher/6193/brotherwise-games" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>DriveThruRPG</u></a> or virtually on <a href="https://app.demiplane.com/nexus/cosmererpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Demiplane</u></a>. </p></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Oct 18, 2025 3:02 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">The Cosmere RPG’s initial offerings on Roshar are a strong first go for this new TTRPG system that offers a focus on flexible character development and stronger narrative mechanics than its peers.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/cosmere-rpg-review]]></content:encoded>

<p>Square Enix has released a new side-by-side comparison video for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a>. Not only do we get a look at the game's opening cutscene on the Switch 2 in docked mode, but alongside this is a direct comparison to the same moment on Xbox Series X, PlayStation 5 and PC.</p>
<p>In case you missed it, Square Enix previously confirmed Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade will run at a "stable 30 frames per second" on the Switch 2, while offering "smooth performance" and some "crisp visuals".</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:187149 @ 1760854512 -->
<p>Other details about the Switch 2 version haven't been revealed just yet, but the first impressions of this version have been relatively positive so far. The game's director has also recently gone into detail about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/lighting-is-the-crucial-factor-how-square-enix-made-final-fantasy-vii-remake-look-great-on-switch-2">how the team made this version look so "great"</a> while praising Nintendo's new device as a "truly amazing piece of hardware".</p>

<p>Square Enix mentioned last month how it <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/are-you-unsure-about-final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-for-switch-2-dont-worry-therell-be-a-demo">intends to release a demo for the Switch 2 version</a> of Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade by the end of this year, so if you're still unsure about it, this might help ahead of the full game's arrival on 22nd January 2026.</p>

            <p>Capcom and McDonald's have teamed up to introduce a number of Street Fighter-themed burgers and exclusive skins in Japan.</p>
<p>The promotion includes a limited-edition menu of "Street Burgers" inspired by Capcom's fighting franchise, including the Teriyaki x Ryu Scorched Garlic Mayonnaise Egg Teriyaki burger, Chick Fillet-O x Chun-Li Yakitori Mayonnaise Chicken burger, and Cheeseburger x Ken Torichi burger, all of which can be washed down with a McFizz drink served in a limited-edition collab cup.</p>

<p>As undeniably fabulous as the retro, burger-themed video spots are – not least for the sneaky appearance of Manon and Marisa in the background – a number of exclusive skins are also on the way.</p>
<p>There's very little information about them other than the blaze of red, yellow, and white costumes you can see displayed on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/mcdonalds-x-street-fighter-collab-in-japan-sf6-ex-colour-costumes-possibly-japan-exclusive.1326550/">ResetEra</a> – Guile's trousers alone require a full video essay – but <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202510/55254">Famitsu</a> does confirm that "the free distribution of original colour costumes to commemorate the collaboration in the latest title" – exclusive skins, in other words – are planned for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/street-fighter-6">Street Fighter 6</a>.</p>



<p>The colour palette aside, some fans are unhappy that Capcom has limited this promotion to Japan, mourning not only the unavailability of the limited-time food menu, but the exclusive skins, too.</p>
<p>"Regional exclusives always suck. Hope they find a way to bring them worldwide," <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/mcdonalds-x-street-fighter-collab-in-japan-sf6-ex-colour-costumes-possibly-japan-exclusive.1326550/#post-146475043">said</a> one unhappy fan, while another <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/mcdonalds-x-street-fighter-collab-in-japan-sf6-ex-colour-costumes-possibly-japan-exclusive.1326550/#post-146478208">commented</a>: "This should be a world wide promo."</p>

It features updated versions of three of 8BitDo’s existing products, including its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/619229/8bitdo-ultimate-2-wireless-controller-tmr-anti-drift-joysticks">Ultimate 2 wireless controller</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/31/23813761/8bitdo-retro-mechanical-keyboard-nintendo-famicom">Retro 87 Keyboard N Edition</a>, and <a href="https://www.8bitdo.com/cube-speaker/">Retro Cube Speaker</a>.</p></div><p>The updates made to the <a href="https://www.8bitdo.com/ultimate-2-bluetooth-nes-40th/">N40 version of 8BitDo’s Ultimate 2 controller</a> are mostly cosmetic, but it now features a black-and-gray design with bright red buttons and a charging dock that matches the aesthetics of the NES console. The controller will also include four swappable joystick caps while its grips are printed with dates that correlate to launches of notable Nintendo and 8BitDo products.</p><p>Functionality is the same as the original version of the Ultimate 2, including the TMR joysticks, Hall effect triggers, a ring of color-changing LEDs around the base of each joystick, reprogrammable bumper buttons, an extra pair of buttons on the back, and compatibility with the Switch, Switch 2, and Windows devices. The 8BitDo Ultimate 2 Bluetooth Controller - N40 is available for preorder starting today for $79.99 and comes with 8BitDo’s Retro Receiver for wirelessly connecting it to an original NES, and a 2.4GHz adapter providing a faster wireless connection for gaming. It will be released on November 15th, 2025, but will be limited to only 1,985 units.</p><p>For the new <a href="https://www.8bitdo.com/retro-68-keyboard-nes-40th/">8BitDo Retro 68 Keyboard N40</a>, the updates are the opposite. Despite being a little more compact than 8BitDo’s first mechanical keyboard because it features a 68-key layout instead of 87, the new N40 version looks very similar to the original but includes some significant hardware upgrades. The entire keyboard, including the shell, keycaps, and buttons, is made from aluminum alloy, and 8BitDo has switched from Kailh’s clicky Box White V2 switches to its linear Box Ice Cream Pro Max switches. The Retro 68 also includes a much larger 6,500mAh battery boosting usage to up to 300 hours between charges, and it comes with the original’s oversized programmable Super Buttons accessories that now wirelessly connect to the keyboard instead of being tethered by a 3.5mm cable.</p><p>The Retro 68 N40 keyboard is more than twice as heavy as the original, weighing in at a beefy 2,200 grams, and considerably more expensive. The Retro 87 debuted at $99.99 in 2023, but the new Retro 68 will be available for preorder starting today for $499.99 and is expected to ship sometime in January 2026.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.8bitdo.com/retro-cube-2-speaker/">8BitDo Retro Cube 2 Speaker N Edition</a> also looks nearly identical to 8BitDo’s Retro Cube Speaker that has been NES-themed since it first launched in 2016. But the new version introduces dual stereo speakers with music and gaming modes, a built-in microphone, a larger 2,000mAh battery offering up to 30 hours of playtime on a full charge, and the option to switch to a 2.4GHz connection instead of Bluetooth using a bundled dongle. Its USB port has been upgraded from Micro USB to USB-C, but the speaker can be charged by simply placing it on a new wireless dock that’s included.</p><p>The original version launched nearly a decade ago for $35, while the new Retro Cube 2 speaker is available for preorder starting today for $49.99 and is expected to be released on December 8th, 2025.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/801832/8bitdo-nintendo-nes-ultimate-2-controller-retro-keyboard-bluetooth-cube-speaker]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Exactly 40 years ago today, the Nintendo Entertainment System hit store shelves in New York City. The October 18, 1985 launch of the NES in the US revitalized home console gaming in North America. To commemorate the console's pivotal role in gaming history, 8BitDo is releasing a <a href="http://www.8bitdo.com/nes-40th-anniversary" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">new collection of NES-inspired gear</a> over the next few months. The NES40 Collection features three products: a <a href="https://www.8bitdo.com/ultimate-2-bluetooth-nes-40th/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">limited-edition Ultimate 2 Bluetooth Controller bundle</a>, a compact <a href="http://www.8bitdo.com/retro-cube-2-speaker/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">wireless gaming speaker</a>, and an <a href="http://www.8bitdo.com/retro-68-keyboard-nes-40th/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">ultra-premium 68-key mechanical keyboard</a> made of aluminum alloy.</p><p>Preorders for the NES40 Collection open today.

Considering the bundle comes with several notable extras, the N40 Edition is honestly a bargain. You'll get an exclusive transparent black 8BitDo Retro Receiver for real NES consoles. The Ultimate 2 Bluetooth and other 8BitDo Bluetooth controllers can sync wirelessly to original hardware with the adapter. A solid black version of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/8Bitdo-Retro-Receiver-nintendo-entertainment-system/dp/B01DJB43R2?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Retro Receiver</a>, for reference, carries a $25 MSRP. The bundle also includes a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Controller-Ultimate-Charging-Not-Machine-Specific/dp/B0CSDJF38Y?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">travel case</a>, which 8BitDo normally sells separately for $20. Inside the box, you'll find four custom joystick caps, including a pair emblazoned with "NES" and "40," and an 8BitBot keychain.</p><p>Though themed around Nintendo Entertainment System with its red face buttons, multiple tones of gray, and special-edition dock matching the design of the console, the N40 is a celebration of 40 years of Nintendo hardware. The handles are decorated with the dates of Nintendo home console and portable device launches around the world. The only exception here is the June 15, 2025 date on the right side of the controller, as this represents the date 8BitDo created the N40. The NES launch date is emblazoned in red, while the rest are in black. Most of the dates reference console launches in North America or global releases, but there are a couple tied to hardware launches in Europe and Japan. From top to bottom on each side, Here's what each date references:</p><p>Left handle: Wii U (NA), NES (NA), Nintendo 64 (NA), Nintendo Switch (WW), Switch OLED (WW), SNES (NA), Wii (NA), GameCube (NA).</p><p>Right handle: Game Boy (NA), Virtual Boy (NA), Switch Lite (WW), 3DS (EU), DS (NA), Game Boy Color (JP), Game Boy Advance (NA).</p></div>                      </div><figure

of the additional accessories, the N40 is the same flagship controller 8BitDo launched earlier this year. The Ultimate 2 supports 2.4GHz Wireless connections on Nintendo Switch, Switch 2, and PC. It also has Bluetooth support for Switch 1/2, Android, Apple, and SteamOS. It can run for up to 25 hours on a full charge and has a 1,000MHz polling rate. It's fitted with high-end TMR electromagnetic joysticks, two remappable back buttons, and an extra pair of claw shoulder buttons. It also has two trigger modes: Hall Effect linear and non-linear microswitch buttons (rapid-fire mode). Other features include 6-axis motion controls, two rumble motors, a Turbo button, and RGB lighting rings. Control customizations can be made with 8BitDo's Ultimate Software 2, and you can save up to three custom profiles that can be cycled through on the fly.</p><p>Read our dedicated story on the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/8bitdo-ultimate-2-switch-2-pc-controller-review-best-deals-at-amazon/1100-6529695/" data-ref-id="1100-6529695">8BitDo Ultimate 2 Bluetooth</a> for more details.

And just like with the charging dock on the 8BitDo Ultimate 2 Bluetooth and Pro 3 Bluetooth Gamepad, the dock has a built-in wireless extender for 2.4GHz audio.</p><p>The Retro Cube 2 has a 2,000mAh rechargeable battery with up to 30 hours of playback on a full charge. Charging time is 3-5 hours, but if you keep it on the dock, you'll struggle to run out of battery.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.8bitdo.com/retro-68-keyboard-nes-40th/" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.8bitdo.com\/retro-68-keyboard-nes-40th\/&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.8bitdo.com/retro-68-keyboard-nes-40th/">8BitDo Retro 68 Wireless Keyboard - N40 Edition</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.8bitdo.com/retro-68-keyboard-nes-40th/" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.8bitdo.com\/retro-68-keyboard-nes-40th\/&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.8bitdo.com/retro-68-keyboard-nes-40th/">$500 | Releases January 2026 in highly limited quantities</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>The N40 Edition 8BitDo keyboard is the manufacturer's first 68-key model. Generally, keyboards with 68 keys are called 65% keyboards. So far, 8BitDo's mechanical keyboards have been tenkeyless 87-key models and full-size 108-key editions.</p><p>Unlike the vast majority of 8BitDo products, the Retro 68 is <em>expensive</em>. At $500, it's by far the priciest product in 8BitDo's catalog. For reference, 8BitDo wireless keyboards typically sell for around $100. So, why does the N40 Edition cost so much more? Every component is made of aluminum alloy, from the frame to the keycaps to the first pair of wireless Super Buttons. The large microswitch buttons can be reprogrammed on the fly without using 8BitDo's Ultimate Software V2.</p><p>The custom gasket-mounted N40 Edition uses Kailh Box Ice Cream Pro Max Linear Switches with six custom dampeners and RGB backlighting. Like other 8BitDo keyboards, the N40 Edition has a hot-swappable PCB--though it's hard to imagine wanting to switch out the aluminum alloy components.</p><p>The Retro 68 supports Bluetooth LE, 2.4GHz Wireless, and wired connections on Windows and Android. It can run for up to 300 hours on a full charge. The limited-edition bundle also comes with a protective pouch and certificate of authenticity.</p><p>The Retro 68 would pair perfectly with 8BitDo's NES-inspired mouse.
