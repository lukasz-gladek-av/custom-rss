<p>It's a new month, and it means we're slowly getting closer to the release of another Switch game upgrade for the Switch 2.</p>
<p>Yes, apart from EA's update to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> this week, later this month Nintendo will also be launching <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-star-crossed-world">Kirby and the Forgotten Land - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Star Crossed World</a>. In case you missed it, this version will feature improved graphics and frame rate, and can only be played on the Switch 2.</p>

<p>One of the many new features of the Switch 2 is the Joy-Con 2's mouse mode ability. It's already been showcased within the launch window with new and old titles, and later this year, it will be available in Samus' first-person adventure, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>.</p>
<p>If you are eager to warm up your FPS skills beforehand, it's been confirmed the new Switch 2 upgrade for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> this week has added mouse controls. Gyro controls are also apparently supported. Some players have already shared their thoughts about these control options – with <a href="https://x.com/TheEpicManWorld/status/1952956457181139286">some individuals pointing out</a> how you can swap between these controls on the fly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TheEpicMan: "What impressed me is that you can change from normal controls to mouse mode instantaneously! No need to go to the menu to turn it on or off!" (via social media)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Apart from this, Apex Legends seems to have been well-received so far, although you'll need to make some space if you want to play it, as the title is over 78 GB on the Switch 2, according to the official eShop listing.</p>
<p>You can download Apex Legends for free on the Switch 2 (and Switch) and try out mouse mode right now. We've also got a Nintendo Life review for this game on the way, so be on the lookout for that. In case you missed it, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/mario_paint">Mario Paint</a> was also recently added to the Switch Online 'Nintendo Classics' service, and it also includes mouse support.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/complete-madden-26-trophy-list-how-to-get-all-achievements-and-trophies/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/complete-madden-26-trophy-list%E2%80%94how-to-get-all-achievements-and-trophies.1264032/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>For all of the completionists out there, here is everything you need to know about getting every trophy and achievement in Madden 26.</p>



<p>Earning achievements and trophies in sports games is much different than single-player narrative titles. Usually, they spoil story elements or give away secret easter eggs. But with&nbsp;Madden 26, for example, all you need to do is progress in different game modes and pull off miraculous performances on the field.</p>



<p>So without any further ado, let’s jump right into what you should expect.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-every-madden-26-achievement-amp-trophy">How to Get Every Madden 26 Achievement &amp; Trophy</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Playing as Josh Allen will make achievements easier. Image via EA Sports</figcaption></figure>



<p>Although there aren’t many trophies in Madden 26, it will still be a challenge for players looking to complete 100% of the game. Regardless of what game mode you prefer, getting every achievement and trophy requires you to master every phase of the game.</p>



<p>With that in mind, here is everything you need to know about earning every achievement and trophy—credit to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.truetrophies.com/game/Madden-NFL-26/trophies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TrueTrophies</a>.</p>

<h2 id="h-all-secret-trophies">All Secret Trophies </h2>



<p>There is only one secret achievement in Madden 26, and it is earned by forcing a fumble using the strip ball mechanic. </p>



<p>To use the strip button defense, it is R1 on PlayStation and RB on Xbox. For the best results, you should use this button when you are near the ball carrier and have an opportunity to knock the ball out of their hands. </p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-achievements-amp-trophies-in-madden-26">How Many Achievements &amp; Trophies in Madden 26?</h2>



<p><strong>There are 28 regular trophies and achievements in Madden 26 and one secret achievement. </strong></p>



<p>Most of the achievements should be easy to complete because there aren’t any restrictions on what difficulty you have to earn the trophy on, meaning you can adjust the settings to the easiest options and breeze through some of the challenges, such as finishing a game with at least 300 yards passing and no interceptions.</p>



<p>That being said, reaching max level with every Superstar position will take time and dedication. Additionally, it will be challenging to break the single-season passing and rushing records, regardless of how good you are at Madden. </p>



<p>Do you plan on earning every achievement and trophy? Let us know on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/complete-madden-26-trophy-list-how-to-get-all-achievements-and-trophies.3213/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forums</a>.</p>

<p>In case you missed it, there's apparently going to be a "playable" public demo of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Switch 2 Edition</a>. It will be available next week at the <a href="https://worlds.pokemon.com/en-us">Pokémon World Championships 2025</a> – taking place in Anaheim, California between <strong>15th - 17th August, 2025</strong>.</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22filukmj&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLc1VHm8D80" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>Additionally, the same demo will be available to play at Gamescom a week later – between <strong>20th - 24th August 2025</strong>. We don't know the specifics about this demo just yet, or if there's any chance of a demo being made available on the eShop in the future, but if we hear any updates, we'll let you know.</p>

<p>Again, if there are interesting details or findings within this demo, we'll let you know. And if there are other demo locations announced, we'll give you the heads up. This follows the release of a new trailer for Pokémon Legends Z-A during the July Pokémon Presents, which gave fans a look at Mega Dragonite and much more.</p>
<p>Nintendo has also released kiosks alongside the Switch 2 that feature <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/donkey-kong-bananza-switch-2-demo-spotted-in-the-wild">playable demos of games</a> like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>.</p>

<p>Nintendo has already launched <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_today">a news app this year</a>, and now The Pokémon Company International is following this up with its very own events application for mobile devices.</p>
<p>This new app – officially known as <strong>Pokémon Events</strong> – is <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pokemon.play.events">now available on Android and IOS devices</a> and as the name suggests, it's "your portal to Pokémon Events".</p>
<p>This app will allow you to keep tabs on upcoming activities, social gatherings, and events in your schedule by logging in with your account (<em>note: a login is required</em>).</p>

<p>This new app rolls out ahead of the <a href="https://worlds.pokemon.com/en-us">Pokémon World Championships 2025</a>, which will be taking place later this month at the Anaheim Convention Center in Anaheim, California between <strong>15th - 17th August, 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>You can find out more about this event on the official Pokémon website, too.</p>
<p>This latest mobile update follows on from the release of the mobile and Switch eShop puzzle title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pokemon_friends">Pokemon Friends</a>. You can find out more about this particular game in our review here on Nintendo Life.</p>

The Roblox farming simulator first launched back in March and has seen rapid success thanks to various updates and events since then. The overwhelming interest in this Roblox game has shown no signs of slowing down, and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/grow-a-garden/Chris_P._Bacon_Cooking_Event_Quests_and_Rewards">latest  cooking-themed event</a> has only fueled it further.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now that the game has entered further into the mainstream, we're already starting to see unofficial merch become available. A third-party seller on Amazon called VatanFari has a variety of Grow a Garden plushies for sale based on the pets from the game. The product pages for these plushies claim to be "drawing inspiration" from the Grow a Garden universe.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Grow a Garden Plushies at Amazon</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">There are a ton of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/grow-a-garden/All_Pets,_Pet_Eggs,_Abilities,_and_Traits#All_Pets_and_Their_Abilities_in_Grow_a_Garden">pets available in Grow a Garden</a>, but only a select few are available in plushie form so far. There's the more traditional animals like a Chicken and a Racoon as well as rarer options such as the Disco Bee. Despite the lack of choices, however, the Chicken Zombie that was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/grow-a-garden/How_to_Get_Chicken_Jockey_in_Grow_a_Garden_-_Chicken_Zombie_Pet">part of a limited-time giveaway</a> is included here as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All of the Grow a Garden-inspired plushies are available in a 10-inch size and cost around $18. The exception is the Chicken Zombie one that sits at 12-inches thanks to the little jockey. It's also quite a bit more expensive at $30. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As far as I can tell, there isn't any "official" merch yet available for Grow a Garden. For now third-party sellers on sites like Amazon or Etsy appear to be ramping up offerings as the latest Roblox sensation continues to take root.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3 data-cy="title3">Is VatanFari a trustworthy seller?</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the dangers of buying from third-party sellers on Amazon is that the products <em>might</em> not end up being of the highest quality. That being said, VatanFari appears to have a decent <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Rainbow-Monkey-Preferred-Birthdays-Purple/dp/B0BL3LHV3V/?th=1#averageCustomerReviewsAnchor" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">track record of reviews on some of its other offerings</a>. And plushies are a pretty low-risk item to order from Amazon. All of the options available from this brand offer <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GKM69DUUYKQWKWX7&amp;ref_=dp_ret_policy" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon's 30-day refund/replacement window</a> that you can take advantage of.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/grow-a-garden-plushies-are-already-available-to-buy-on-amazon]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/guilty-gear-strive-producer-on-lucy-upcoming-balance-changes-and-strive-200-evo-2025</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/guilty-gear-strive-producer-on-lucy-upcoming-balance-changes-and-strive-2-00-evo-2025.1263984/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">More than four years after it's release, Guilty Gear Strive is still going strong, with perhaps its most prolific DLC character yet, Lucy from Cyberpunk, releasing on August 21 as the final part of Character Pass 4. But that's not the only exciting thing going on in the world of Guilty Gear. During the finals of Strive at Evo, there was a trailer announcing a mysterious new chapter called Guilty Gear Strive 2.00, with two silhouhettes of characters that clearly indicate that longtime favorites Robo-Ky and Jam Kuradoberi are going to be making their way into Strive's ever growing roster. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">To get some details on Strive's future, I caught up with Ken Miyauchi at the show so I could pick his brain on all of these points and more. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>[Editor's Note: This interview has been lightly edited for grammar and clarity]</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>So at finals for EVO 2025, you guys revealed Guilty Gear Strive 2.00. Can you tell us a little bit about what's going to be in that version? </strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Ken Miyauchi, Producer on Guilty Gear Strive: </strong>Yes, we just announced a teaser trailer of something showing the version 2.00. We are not really particularly explaining what's in 2.00, but there's a reason behind why we show the number 2.00. We want to provide new, more exciting content toward Guilty Gear Strive and I'm expecting to show more details in the near future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>We also saw two silhouettes of characters that are going to be coming to Guilty Gear Strive 2.00. It seems like it's going to be Jam and Robo-Ky. Can you talk a little bit about those two characters?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Miyauchi: </strong>So yeah, we are showing that we are still working on developing more additional characters. Of course, Lucy is coming out in August 21st, but we are still continuing developing more character updates and those are going to be the two characters that we are currently working on. So please stay tuned.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>What can you tell us about Lucy and what her play style is going to be? Obviously she uses strings from Cyberpunk, but can you give us a little taste of what she is going to be like in Strive?</strong></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Miyauchi: </strong>Yeah, I think people are watching the trailers and trying to find out what she's doing and one of the biggest core mechanics that a lot of players might be very excited to see is her Quickhack move, which is really directly inspired from the Cyberpunk 2077 game mechanic. So we made it visually look very like the Cyberpunk 2077 Quickhack. And she has very, very unique moves that go along with that Quickhack. So the way she fights is going to be very unique, even compared to the entire Guilty Gear Strive cast. So yeah, I hope everyone enjoys her when she's out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Another thing that's coming to Guilty Gear Strive is going to be the ranked mode. What can you tell us about how the ranked mode will be in Guilty Gear Strive and how it's going to be different from the regular tower format?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Miyauchi: </strong>So yeah, I explained this in our own website column, Developer's Backyard. So if you want to find out more details about the rules of how you earn points and how you get ranks and what kind of variety of ranks you have, <a href="https://www.guiltygear.com/ggst/en/news/post-2550/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>you can check that out</u></a>. And so it's pretty much a regular standard rank match system that we've been also doing, and I think all other fighting games were also doing. We have battle points that you climb up together whenever you win a match and depending on your battle points, you will have higher ranks, and you get to the top, which is the rank called Vanquisher. You'll get into a rating match, almost like a master rank kind of, a rating match. So people who are playing really competitively can keep grinding to compete in the rating ranking and try to aim to the top of the ranking. And there is of course rewards to it. So I hope everyone who plays regularly will enjoy playing this mode.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In Ranked Match we also have several features that people would be excited. I mean, I hope they appreciate is that we also have the Wi-Fi indicator and also if there's a bad ping match-up goals, you will be able to vote a no contest. So those kinds of features will also be included. So I hope you find out how you can use those features.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>So you're also looking to make adjustments to things like RISC, Wild Assault, and I believe Guard Crush is another thing. Can you tell us a little bit about specifically what kind of changes you're looking to make about those mechanics?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Miyauchi: </strong>So yeah, we also announced that we are working on the battle balance patch and that's also coming out along with the Lucy character update. And so we are kind of trying to see the game balance and trying to incorporate a lot of player's feedback regarding how Guilty Gear Strive is currently playing. And we think there needs to be some tone downs on several, how do I say… the game mechanics, general game mechanics, the tools that everyone has access to. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>We think there needs to be some tone downs on several game mechanics, or tools that everyone has access to. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">And so there are lots of toning downs, but at the same time we also want to focus on the character uniqueness and making sure that characters can play how they would like to be played. And I think we had a lot of feedback from players that the current version of Guilty Gear Strive is in favor of those characters who have more access to those game mechanics. So not too much relying into the game mechanics and that's the direction of how we are balancing out for this patch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>So Arc System Works recently announced Marvel Tokon, and I think a lot of people are wondering, is there anyone from the Strive team that moved over to Marvel Tokon, or what is Strive's relationship with that game?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Miyauchi: </strong>Well, I wish I can say anything about Marvel Tokon, but unfortunately I don't have a right to, and I honestly don't know much about Marvel Tokon because that's really a high-end secure project that's also internally in Arc System Works.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>So no knowledge of Strive developers working on Marvel Tokon then?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Miyauchi: </strong>Well, we do have, it's a small company, so we do have a chat or discussion going on between teams. But yeah, that's everything that I can say.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Fair enough. So with each new update of Guilty Gear Strive, it feels like you're kind of going down a list and just kind of knocking off different features from 3v3 to now ranked mode. Are there any other kind of features that you want to add to Strive that are still on the list?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Miyauchi: </strong>So we have a lot of things that we would like to do, which is also something that a lot of players has been asking for and I can't share any details about it for now, but I'm hoping if I will be able to show that off in the next version of 2.00.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Do you ever see Guilty Gear changing direction from being a fighting game series or even just a spin-off to do something other than fighting games? Obviously Guilty Gear 2: Overture was an action adventure. Is there any kind of future for Guilty Gear that's not a 2D fighter, do you think?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Miyauchi: </strong>Well, I don't have any projected plan or anything that I can share for now, but as a producer I'm always interested to expand Guilty Gear as an IP to open to different genres so that people who are not fighting games would also get into the IP. So yeah, if I have a chance I would like to try on some different kind of genre. But yeah, I don't have anything to share right now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Mitchell Saltzman is an editorial producer at IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Irgendwas stimmt da nicht...</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">World of Warcraft just dropped a new major patch, the big kind that adds a new area, new quests, dungeons, a delve, a raid, loads of story, and much more. And while it's normal to have a few bugs any time new content comes out, 11.2 seems to be riddled with weirder problems than usual...including a goofy bug that's turning some players' banks German.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1mj43f4/bank_update_my_stuff_is_fine_but_it_is_now/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">German bug in particular</a> has been <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1mixnow/so_are_anyone_elses_bank_tabs_in_german_as_well/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported</a> by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1mivyy8/eu_all_my_bank_tabs_have_german_description_text/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">several players</a> on English clients, not on EU servers. It's not game-breaking by any stretch - just odd. It changes the player's bank tabs to German language. Everything else is unaffected. Funnily enough, some players in other countries and languages are reporting the same bug, but with different languages, such as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1mj43f4/comment/n784o0j/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this German player who says their tabs are in French</a>, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1mj43f4/comment/n7898w2/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this person</a> playing on the English client from Poland who has French tabs, while their wife's are German.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That's not the only bug players are facing, though. I've experienced several myself <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1miwt6p/new_patch_bugged_quests/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">just questing in the new zone, K'aresh</a>, with quests not completing, disappearing from the questlog mysteriously, and certain interactable objects needing the game fully reloaded in order to be used. I also experienced a lot of disconnects last night, and I'm not the only one. Some people are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1mj68lh/bug_new_zone_has_bricked_2_of_my_characters_from/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">having trouble logging in at all</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Others are running into weirder bugs. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1miot5x/man_inflation_is_absolutely_hitting_everyone/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This person reports</a> that the game is trying to charge them 500,000 gold just to visit the Darkmoon Faire, which is...a <em>little </em>high. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1miuf7h/i_have_found_a_bug_with_bags_and_bank_storage_i/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Another person found a bug</a> (which admittedly may be related to a downloaded mod) where their bags have somehow been increased to hold 98 items apiece - far more than any bag currently in the game actually allows.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the moment, it's difficult to say if Ghosts of K'aresh is exceptionally buggy compared to other patch releases, or if it just feels bad in the moment because we're all eager to play as much as possible as fast as possible. Most likely, all of these issues will be fixed within a few days, or at minimum by next Tuesday's weekly game update.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But in the meantime, if you want to use your bank, you might need to brush up on your German.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There is an entire category of games that can’t live on my phone for the sake of my health. <em>Vampire Survivors </em>and <a href="https://aftermath.site/balatro-golden-needle-challenge-how-to-beat" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Balatro</em></a><em> </em>are on the top of that list because they tap into a reptilian part of my mind that I’m not particularly proud of. Today I am adding another game to that list, the roguelite deckbuilder <em>Merge Maestro</em>. It’s simply too dangerous to have on any device if I want to get productive work done.</p><figure><figcaption>To defeat the scorpion, I'm simply having factories produce musical notation and turning those into trumpets.

Enemies appear on the top in waves and must be dealt with by using tokens. Low level tokens can be placed in the grid and merged with other tokens of the same type to increase their value, with values starting from one and eventually ending up at nine. As you progress in the game, those numbered tokens are replaced with specific emoji-like tokens, each with different effects. As wave after wave of enemies appear, you begin to build a deck and form synergies between different tokens. Tokens may trigger when they appear, merge, and/or are destroyed. Occasionally, consumables like strawberries and kiwis will appear on the field, which allow you to temporarily buff or trigger an existing token. You start out with four health, and if enough enemies attack you, your run is done.</p><figure><figcaption>Powers will either give you a temporary boost or alter the mechanics of the deck. Building decks around powers is key. Credit: Stingless</figcaption></figure><p><em>Merge Maestro's </em>superficial simplicity hides a shocking amount of complexity. Strategies and synergies develop organically, and different token effects impact how you place and prioritize those tokens. Rainbow tokens are plused-up versions of existing tokens, but their effect may be an objectively worse fit for your deck than a plain one. What’s more, tokens with similar mechanics tend to fall into the same “packs.” Some builds might favor infinitely generated tokens like those found in the “creativity” pack (brushes, notepads, paddles), while others may involve sacrificing tokens like those that appear in the Halloween pack (demon or coffin). The relative value of a token is almost entirely dependent on how you can make it sing in your deck.</p><figure><figcaption>Different packs focus on different mechanics. Creativity is great if you want to dial in on making a boatload of low level tokens. Credit: Stingless</figcaption></figure><p>Like <em>Balatro</em>, <em>Merge Maestro </em>features different unlockable boards, packs, difficulties and challenges to keep things interesting. It is a game that rewards experimentation and careful understanding of mechanics, but is simple enough to jump right into. It also has a free lite version for mobile and costs, as of this writing, two or three dollars on iOS, Android and Steam.</p><p>I downloaded <em>Merge Maestro </em>right after breaking my foot in several places, and it is a fantastic game to play while waiting for results in the hospital. It exists in a bizarre sweet spot between a smooth brained ambient phone game that’s just above a fidget spinner and a game that requires serious active strategizing. <em>Merge Maestro </em>is frictionless to pick up and engaging enough that it’s hard to put down. Sometimes you’ll accidentally create an absurd loop, like when I <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/papapishu.bsky.social/post/3lvpijembsk2r" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gave a prawn several hundred shots of whiskey</a> and he attempted to fight a shark for three minutes. You do need to make serious decisions about playcrafting and placement, but the game also gives you ample time between those big decisions so you can just glide. When you get into a nice groove and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/papapishu.bsky.social/post/3lvogxrskhs2o" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">create a combo that almost plays itself</a>, the rush of serotonin is a soothing balm.</p><p>That said, I’m deleting this shit from my phone <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-nerve-of-balatro-for-being-this-good" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">before it becomes a problem</a>. I know my warning signs. <em>Merge Maestro </em>is the bastard child of <em>Threes</em> and <em>Balatro,</em> and if that triggers any alarms in your brain, then perhaps you should proceed with caution as well.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/eddington-ari-aster-covid-movie-pedro-pascal-joaquin-phoenix"><h3>Eddington Is A Compelling COVID Drama Until It Isn’t</h3></a><p>The film is neither good nor bad, but a secret third thing.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/labubu-lafufu-lawsuit-pop-mart-7-eleven"><h3>Labubu To Lafufu: ‘See You In Court’</h3></a><p>Pop Mart is suing 7-Eleven for allegedly selling fake Labubus in its stores</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/ign-layoffs-ziff-davis"><h3>IGN Lays Off 8 Staff, 12% Of Union</h3></a><p>The layoffs follow wider cuts at Ziff Davis, buyouts, and layoffs and departures at acquired sites</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/merge-maestro-addictive-roguelite-ios-puzzle-game]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<p>Dead aim</p>
<p><strong>Version Reviewed:</strong> North American</p>
</section><section><p>I don’t think I’ve ever messed around with a game’s settings menu as much as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/house_of_the_dead_2_remake">The House of the Dead 2: Remake</a>. And, unfortunately, try as I might, I could never get the game to feel 'good'. Much like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/house_of_the_dead_remake">its predecessor</a> on the Switch, Forever Entertainment’s latest arcade revamp is limited to just two control schemes: analogue stick and gyro. Neither is an ideal way to play.</p>
<p>But let’s start with the positives. This is a remarkably faithful remake of the 1998 original, maintaining everything that makes the experience so memorable — including wacky boss battles and god-awful voice acting — while providing an extensive overhaul of the visuals. It’s a blast watching zombies’ limbs and guts go flying with each successful shot, and the way the enemy design has been revamped feels both fresh and respectful at the same time.</p>
<p>There’s plenty to get stuck into, including two versions of the campaign — original and arcade — a boss mode, and a training mode that throws you into a variety of challenges. These might entail protecting human NPCs or destroying barrels within a time limit, but it’s all useful in letting you get to grips with how the game plays on Switch.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, back to the control schemes. The gyro aiming, in theory, should be the way to go, but like the first remake, it’s way too erratic. Even when turning the sensitivity down in the settings, I could never hit that sweet spot. Either the reticle would fly off in random directions upon pressing the fire button, or it would inexplicably drift over to one side, requiring you to constantly recalibrate by moving it to the edge before recentring it.</p>
<p>Standard analogue controls feel more accurate, but again, it’s a monotonous exercise in tinkering with the sensitivity to find the setting that feels right. Spoiler: it never felt quite right. Even after landing on a setting that felt reasonably comfortable, the very nature of using an analogue cursor in a light gun game feels incredibly unintuitive. The fact that a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/house_of_the_dead_2and3_return">2008 port for the Wii</a> feels better is quite saddening, to say the least.</p>
<p>I should note that the game isn’t horrifically unplayable or anything like that. It’s perfectly serviceable, but a light gun shooter should be instantly playable and fun, and having to constantly fiddle around with the settings to achieve something close to satisfying is definitely frustrating. It's something that developer MegaPixel Studio really should have rectified from the first Switch remake.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I <em>am</em> glad The House of the Dead 2: Remake exists. Control woes aside, I suspect many players will eventually find some enjoyment from the game, provided you're willing to spend considerable time in the settings menu beforehand. It's a fascinating blast from the past, warts 'n' all, and a real showcase of some truly terrible voice acting from the '90s. Just make sure you toggle the 'Mute "Reload!" Scream' option – good lord.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/the-house-of-the-dead-2-remake]]></content:encoded>

Yup, QuakeCon is back and starts on August 7. <a href="https://kotaku.com/quakecon-2024-steam-sale-doom-fallout-elder-scrolls-1851618208">And as is often the case,</a> Bethesda and id Software are doing a giant QuakeCon sale on Steam, offering up a huge list of awesome PC games for cheaper than normal.</p> <p>Starting on Thursday and running until Sunday, August 10, <a href="https://quakecon.bethesda.net/en/event-highlights/">QuakeCon 2025 is happening in Grapevine, Texas.</a> And yes, lots of people are lugging their computers and monitors to the event to hook up with other players (digitally!

                <p dir="ltr">Persona 3 Reload launched on PS5, Xbox, and PC last year, and soon the remake of the beloved JRPG is making the jump to Switch 2. Persona 3 Reload launches on Switch 2 on October 23, and preorders are now live. So far, publisher Sega has announced a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FKNJHYR9?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">$60 physical standard edition</a> and a <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/persona-3-reload-digital-premium-edition-switch-2/?srsltid=AfmBOoo0uo0oq1kFopQ6-tss6FWwzXgKeIW3pCktHJP7k0MxapInHaEY" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$90 Digital Premium Edition</a>, which includes a selection of extra DLC content. Preordering either gets you some extra in-game music tracks as a bonus.</p><p dir="ltr">While both Switch 2 editions appear to include identical content to the PS5, Xbox, and PC versions that launched last year, there are some notable differences to keep in mind. First, <strong>Persona 3 Reload's physical Switch 2 release is a Game Key-Card</strong>--which means it doesn't include the game data on the cartridge, and instead works as physical DRM that lets you download the digital version to your console.</p><p dir="ltr">The other potential difference is its technical performance. Atlus has not confirmed the Switch 2 version's performance metrics, but based on trailer footage, it appears Persona 3 Reload will run at 30fps on Nintendo's new console, whereas it runs at 60fps on all other platforms. It's possible the final release could run at higher framerates than what's been shown, but for now, it's looking like the Switch 2 version could lag behind the others. Nevertheless, those who plan to preorder Persona 3 Reload on Switch can secure their copy at multiple online retailers.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Persona 3 Reload Preorder Bonuses</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4545008-psrswitch2pre.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4545008" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4545008-psrswitch2pre.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4545008"></a><figcaption>Persona 4 Golden BGM Set in Persona 3 Reload </figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4545008-psrswitch2pre.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Preordering any version of Persona 3 Reload unlocks access to the Persona 4 Golden BGM Set, which lets you swap select in-game music with tracks from Persona 4 Golden.

Compared to the original game, Reload features updated graphics and soundtrack, an overhauled UI, a re-recorded soundtrack, and an all-new voice cast. It also introduces new characters and story content, as well as major gameplay changes that make it an easier game overall compared to the previous versions of Persona 3.</p><p dir="ltr">One notable omission from both Switch 2 versions of Persona 3 Reload is the Episode Aigis DLC expansion, which incorporates post-game content from the Persona 3 FES version on PS2 into the new remake. Sega has confirmed that Episode Aigis will be available as a separate $35 purchase via the Nintendo eShop after launch--which follows the same release schedule as the PS5, Xbox, and PC versions--though the exact date has not been confirmed.</p><h2 dir="ltr">More Persona 3 Reload and Persona 3 Portable Deals</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4545020-portableb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4545020" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4545020-portableb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4545020"></a><figcaption>Persona 3 Portable</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4545020-portableb.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">If the Game Key-Card and potential technical downgrades have you concerned--or you simply don't want to wait for the Switch 2 version--Amazon is discounting the <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CGFCC193?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS5 version of Persona 3 Reload to just $20</a></strong> (was $70).

Sega brought Persona 3 Portable--which is itself an overhauled version of the game that launched on PSP in 2010 in North America--over to Switch, PS4, Xbox, and PC in 2023. While it doesn't have a dedicated Switch 2 version, the Switch version is playable on the new iteration of the hybrid console. Persona 3 Portable differs from both the PS2 and Reload versions of the game in significant ways, offering "Visual Novel-style" cutscenes and overworld exploration, rather than the full 3D cutscenes and city environments of the other releases. However, the Tartarus dungeon crawling and combat remain largely the same as the PS2 version--though it was notable for being the first version of Persona 3 to allow for full control over your party during battle.</p><p dir="ltr">Despite the more limited presentation, Persona 3 Portable is the only version of the game to include the option to play as a female version of the protagonist, complete with her own unique story content and social links to explore. If you're curious to check out Portable's unique content, or want to experience a more challenging version of Persona 3's gameplay loop, you can pick it up via the Nintendo eShop.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Madden 25 supported crossplay, but let’s see if EA decided to bring the feature back for Madden 26.</p>



<p>Several game modes were overhauled for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/madden-26-launches-on-august-14-first-trailer-released/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Madden 26</a>. In&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/madden-26-franchise-deep-dive-shows-new-coaching-updates-gameplan-changes-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Franchise</a>, some of the significant new changes include coach archetypes, weekly playsheet updates, a new weekly highlights show, and more. Superstar added Game Day Beats, Sphere of Influence, and Career Chapters, which challenge you to complete specific objectives and build relationships off the field. </p>



<p>As for Ultimate Team, EA promised more content than before post-launch, and the solo experience has been overhauled. Let’s take a look at if these game modes support crossplay. </p>



<h2 id="h-does-madden-26-have-crossplay">Does Madden 26 Have Crossplay?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Crossplay returns in Madden 26. Image via EA Sports</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Madden supports&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ea.com/games/ea-sports-college-football/college-football-26/faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">crossplay</a>&nbsp;between PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>and PC</strong>, <strong>meaning it is not a feature for the Nintendo Switch 2. </strong></p>



<p>In addition, this is the first year that Madden 26 will not be available on last-gen consoles, so that means crossplay is not necessary. </p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-use-crossplay-in-madden-26">How to Use Crossplay in Madden 26 </h2>



<p>Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use crossplay.</p>



<ol>
<li>Open the&nbsp;<strong>EA Connect menu</strong>&nbsp;in Madden 26. </li>



<li>Navigate to the&nbsp;<strong>Player Search</strong>&nbsp;tab.</li>



<li>Search for a player using their&nbsp;<strong>EA Identification number</strong>&nbsp;or by using their&nbsp;<strong>platform identifier</strong>&nbsp;(Xbox Series X|S gamertag or PSN ID).</li>



<li>Invite them to a game or Dynasty save.</li>
</ol>



<h2 id="h-which-madden-26-modes-support-crossplay">Which Madden 26 Modes Support Crossplay?</h2>



<p><strong>In Madden 26, you can play cross-platform in online Head-to-Head, Franchise, Ultimate Team, Superstar KO, and Superstar Showdown.</strong></p>



<p>In Ultimate Team, the Auction House does not support crossplay. As a result, PlayStation 5 players can only purchase cards from listings on the same console and vice versa. This might make cards more expensive, as there will be less supply and more demand because it doesn’t account for the entire player base.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-turn-crossplay-off-in-madden-26">Can You Turn Crossplay Off in Madden 26?</h2>



<p><strong>Crossplay is enabled by default, but you can opt out, regardless of which platform you are on.</strong></p>



<p>For players who opt in to cross-play, any leaderboard in any mode that supports cross-play will be a global leaderboard that includes players from all supported platforms. Players who opt out of cross-play will only see leaderboards for players on their own platform.</p>



<p>Here is a step-by-step guide on how to turn off crossplay.</p>



<h3 id="h-xbox-series-x-s">Xbox Series X|S</h3>



<ol>
<li>Go to your&nbsp;<strong>Xbox</strong>&nbsp;<strong>settings</strong>.</li>



<li>Scroll to&nbsp;<strong>Account&nbsp;</strong>and click on&nbsp;<strong>Privacy and Online Safety</strong>.</li>



<li>Click on&nbsp;<strong>Xbox Live Privacy</strong>.</li>



<li>Select&nbsp;<strong>View Details</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Customise</strong>.</li>



<li>Choose&nbsp;<strong>Communications</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Multiplayer</strong>.</li>



<li>Change “You can play with people outside of Xbox Live” to&nbsp;<strong>block</strong>.</li>
</ol>



<h3 id="h-playstation-5">PlayStation 5</h3>



<ol>
<li>Go to the In-game&nbsp;<strong>Settings tab</strong>.</li>



<li>Select<strong>&nbsp;Gameplay Settings</strong>.</li>



<li>Toggle the crossplay option to off.</li>
</ol>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the most exciting games to watch at Evo 2025 was Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fatal-fury-pros-dramatic-reaction-to-losing-at-evo-2025-goes-viral-but-it-was-actually-10-years-in-the-making">From KojiKOG's memeworthy and dramatic reaction to his loss in top 8</a>, to the incredible grand finals betwen Go1 and ET, and all of the exciting moments in between. It was a great reminder of how much fun the game can be. While I wasn't able to talk to anyone from SNK at the actual show itself, Producer Yasuyuki Oda and Animator Masami Obari were kind enough to answer several questions of mine via email relating to the release of Ken in City of the Wolves and a few other topics that I felt would be of great interest to fans of SNK and fighting games in general.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>One of the biggest surprises to me once I got my hands on with Ken is how similar to his SF6 counterpart he is, despite this being a completely different game. Can you talk a little bit about some of the challenges involving taking a beloved character from one series and making them fit under a whole new set of rules and mechanics?</strong><br>
<strong>Yasayuki Oda, Lead Producer on Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves:</strong> The biggest initial concern for us was finding how to bring Ken into the Fatal Fury gameplay system and world without compromising his identity as a character. Our development team has so many people that are passionate about the Street Fighter franchise, and I think their love and dedication to the series really shined through in all the little details we worked on for Ken. We slowly worked out over time how to incorporate Ken’s fast speed and flashy flame-based attacks into the system of City of the Wolves, constantly asking ourselves “What was missing?”, “What could we improve on?”, “What were Ken’s strengths and where could we leverage that?” After much repeated trial and error, this version of Ken finally took form. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Ken is a character that’s always been very strong in Street Fighter 6, thanks to being able to convert most regular hits on block to a Jinrai Kick that forces some risky decision making on defense, a plus on block gap closer in his heavy dragonlash kick, on top of just having really good neutral buttons and a balanced tool kit. Were you ever concerned that some of these elements might make him a bit too strong in Fatal Fury?</strong><br>
<strong>Oda</strong>: As you said, bringing Ken over the same way he is in Street Fighter 6 would undoubtedly make him a strong character in City of the Wolves. Of course, we had to make careful adjustments as we adapted him to the game. Integrating mechanics like Braking and REV Accel were challenging, but I think we were able to highlight what makes Ken special while also giving fans a chance to experience a different playstyle within the systems of City of the Wolves. We’re looking forward to seeing what fans think and how they engage with this version of Ken. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>With Terry and Mai appearing in Street Fighter 6, and now Ken, and later Chun-Li coming to Fatal Fury, do you have any interest in working together with Capcom once again for another entry in the Capcom vs SNK series? Or is that a far off dream?</strong></p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p><strong>That would be something, wouldn't it?</strong></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Oda:</strong> That would be something, wouldn’t it? However, there is nothing I can talk about at this moment. We are always happy to receive questions like this because it shows how enthusiastic the fans are for another Capcom vs. SNK. It’s a great source of motivation for us.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>How do you feel overall about guest characters in fighting games? Do you think it’s a healthy trend for the genre, and do you think we might see more in future SNK games, or even in future updates of Fatal Fury?</strong></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Oda:</strong> I think it’s a great trend. Of course, it is important to respect the story and world of other games, but the introduction of guest characters has great potential for the future of fighting games to create new “chemical reactions.” That is to say, it can lead to unexpected outcomes and birth something new.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for City of the Wolves, there are still characters we need to bring back before we start thinking about more guest characters. Please rest assured that we are putting all of our focus on that right now. Even after Mr. Big releases, there are still many new characters and new aspects of the game we are working on, so please look forward to them!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>I know she’s still a bit of a ways off, and we’ve got Joe coming first, but can you share any details about Chun-Li’s appearance in Fatal Fury? Will it be similar to the approach of Ken, in that you’re looking to her iteration in Street Fighter 6 as a primary source of inspiration?</strong></p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>We have a few surprises and finer details we're planning to add. We're looking to make this version of Chun-Li a culmination of her past iterations.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Oda:</strong> We are using her SF6 version as a base, but since many of our staff are fans of the entire Street Fighter series, we have a few surprises and finer details we’re planning to add. We’re looking to make this version of Chun-Li, like Ken, a culmination of all her past iterations, so please look forward to it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>For Obari-san, what was it like getting to create the animations for such an iconic character that’s outside of the world of SNK, like Ken. Were there any kinds of signature touches you felt like you were able to add, or did you try to keep things as close to the source as possible? </strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Masami Obari, Animator on Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves:</strong> First of all, I would like to say that it was a great honor to work on this project. I am extremely grateful to Capcom for this opportunity. As for the original elements, I would say the most work went into designing these characters in my style. I’d like to call it Bari-Ken! (Haha). It was extremely fun to draw Ken within the style and animation of the Fatal Fury anime.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Are there any dream crossovers that you’d like to work on, either within the realm of fighting games or outside of it? </strong></p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p><strong>I would be extremely happy to see a collaboration with a real pro wrestler. </strong></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Obari</strong>: I’m a huge pro wrestling fan, so I would be extremely happy to see a collaboration with a real pro wrestler. In terms of fighting games, I would be excited to see a crossover with Voltage Fighter Gowcaizer, a game I was originally in charge of the story and character design!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>And finally, canonically, who do you think would win in a fight between Ken and Terry?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Obari:</strong> To be honest with you, I think Terry would win. I think they are evenly matched in terms of strength, but Terry is carrying a lot on his shoulders, and his will is strong because of that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That being said, as a director of the anime, I would prefer not to decide and have the two work together to fight a common enemy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Mitchell Saltzman is an editorial producer at IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>Last week, Electronic Arts and Battlefield Studios held a big <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-bf6-dragging-people-multiplayer-reveal-ea-1851787385"><em>Battlefield 6</em></a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-reveal-la-event-behind-the-scenes-brie-larson-ea-2000614190?utm_source=kotaku.com&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=share">multiplayer reveal event in Los Angeles</a>. While there, <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-preview-destruction-classes-bf3-bf4-1851787384">I got to go hands-on with the online military shooter</a> for a few hours and learned a lot about the game. And since then, EA has done interviews and shared more information about the highly anticipated sequel, which is set to arrive in a few months. There’s also a big open beta launching later this week that will go for a few weekends.</p> <p>So yeah, there’s a lot of<a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-guarantees-battlefield-6-will-run-at-60fps-or-more-on-all-platforms-2000614503"><em> Battlefield 6 </em>information flying around out there</a>. To help you out, I’ve grabbed seven pieces of info and cataloged them here for your convenience. All I ask in return is that if you see me on the battlefield, don’t snipe me right away. Please? Anyway, here are seven new pieces of info we’ve learned about <em>Battlefield 6</em> over the last few days.</p> <h2><strong>When does the <em>Battlefield 6</em> open beta start?</strong></h2> <p>EA has split the <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-bf6-dragging-people-multiplayer-reveal-ea-1851787385"><em>Battlefield 6</em></a> open beta into three sessions. The first starts on Thursday, August 7, and runs until August 9. But you’ll need an early access code to play during this first window. Does that mean this is no longer an “open” beta? I’d say so, but whatever. Then, from August 9 until August 10, anyone who has downloaded the <em>Battlefield 6</em> open beta can start playing, with or without a code. The beta will wrap up early that Monday and then go live again on Thursday, August 14. This third session is also completely open and will end in the early morning hours on August 17.&nbsp; The <em>BF6</em> beta will be available on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S and can be pre-loaded now.</p>

 <p>Here’s a full schedule courtesy of EA and Battlefield Studios:</p> <ul> <li> <blockquote><p><em>Battlefield 6</em> early access beta</p> <ul> <li>From Thursday, Aug. 7 @ 1am PDT / 4am EDT / 9am BST to Saturday, Aug. 9 @ 1am PDT / 4am EDT / 9am BST</li> </ul> </blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p><em>BF6</em> Open beta – first weekend</p> <ul> <li>From Saturday, Aug. 9 @ 1am PDT / 4am EDT / 9am BST to Monday, Aug. 10 @ 1am PDT / 4am EDT / 9am BST</li> </ul> </blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p><em>BF6</em> Open beta – second (final) weekend</p></blockquote> <ul> <li> <blockquote><p>From Thursday, Aug.14 @ 1am PDT / 4am EDT / 9am BST to Sunday, Aug. 17 @ 1am PDT / 4am EDT / 9am BST</p></blockquote> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2><strong><em>Battlefield 6</em> will feature bots to help fill servers</strong></h2> <p>Battlefield Studios and EA have confirmed that matches in <em>Battlefield 6</em> can include bots if there aren’t enough active players in the server. These bots will be replaced as more players join and will only return if people leave early. <em>Battlefield 6</em>&nbsp;development director <a href="https://gnn.gamer.com.tw/detail.php?sn=289987">Anna Narrevik explained in a recent interview</a> that they have designed the game to “allow as many players as possible to play the game at the same time.” But when there are gaps, the bots will show up to help out.</p> <p>I actually played against some bots during the <em>Battlefield 6</em> reveal event’s afterparty. They were pretty stupid, but could revive people and take points, so they weren’t completely worthless, and having them around did make the battle feel more alive and larger in scale. I’ll be curious to see how often I run into bots when playing certain modes in the game once it’s out.</p> <h2><strong>The game will use some skill-based matchmaking</strong></h2> <p>Yes, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-matchmaking-will-include-sbmm-among-other-things-like-ping-location-and-server-availability"><em>BF6</em> will partially use skill-based matchmaking</a> to place players into different servers and matches. But, before you grab a pitchfork and riot or throw a party in celebration, EA wants people to know that a player’s skill is just one of many variables used during <em>BF6</em>‘s matchmaking process. During a Q&amp;A at the event, <a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1952011658143924686">as further reported by <em>CharlieIntel</em></a>, <em>Battlefield 6</em>‘s devs confirmed that numerous factors play a role in matchmaking. These include a player’s ping, location, what servers are available at that moment, and yes, skill factor.</p>

 <p>You might not think much about that, but for some players, skill-based matchmaking has become a dirty word, as they believe it makes shooters less fun as you are always matched up with people as good or better than you. Others think it keeps things balanced and more enjoyable. To me, it sounds like EA isn’t going to keep experts playing experts exclusively, but instead will try to keep teams balanced, something the series has done for a long time. So, until <em>Battlefield 6</em> is out, I think people can chill.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Battlefield 6 Maps, Modes &amp; Portal" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/92CHDiFW0wA?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <h2><strong>There won’t be a traditional server browser in <em>Battlefield 6</em></strong></h2> <p>EA has confirmed that when <em>Battlefield 6</em> launches, it won’t include a traditional server browser. This is a feature that has been included in most <em>Battlefield</em> games and lets players search for specific servers running maps or modes they want to play while avoiding the stuff they don’t like. Server browsers can also run specific rules and use moderators to control griefing while developing a community around them.</p>

 <p>Instead, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-has-a-server-browser-but-there-is-a-catch/1100-6533674/"><em>Battlefield 6</em>‘s server browser</a> will be included in Portal, a part of the game that will operate like Forge in <em>Halo</em> and let players make their own experiences, maps, and game modes. So it sounds like you’ll only be able to access community-created modes and experiences using this server browser and not official EA servers running vanilla maps and games.&nbsp; Alexia Christofi, a producer on <em>BF6</em>, <a href="https://x.com/Lex_mate/status/1951898828669395394">tweeted about the server browser</a> after the reveal event, saying that community-created modes can “award full XP” and confirming that the browser “will be front and center in our main menu, not hidden.” It’ll feature a filter, too. The question is how persistent servers will be and whether more traditional <em>BF</em> experiences will be a part of it, or if folks looking to play conquest have to rely solely on matchmaking. EA says more info is coming soon. Hopefully, that will clear things up.</p> <h2><em>Battlefield 6</em> on PC will require Secure Boot</h2> <p><a href="https://www.ea.com/en/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/secure-boot-information">Battlefield Studios has also confirmed that its upcoming military shooter will require Secure Boot on PC</a>. This is a newer way to try and stop cheaters from playing the game and malicious software from booting on your Windows 10 or 11 PC. While Secure Boot can be effective at stopping cheaters and bad actors, it can also cause a lot of headaches for users who have to upgrade older machines to support the feature. It is also prone to failure or causing other PC problems, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1mhpu0t/secure_boot_is_a_requirement_to_play_battlefield/">something you can spot in Reddit threads</a> with people asking for help getting the open beta launcher to load on their Windows PC.</p>

 <p>“Requiring Secure Boot provides us with features that we can leverage against cheats that attempt to infiltrate during the Windows boot process,” said EA in a blog about requiring the feature. “It also lets the Battlefield Positive Play team use its own features and related dependent security features like TPM to combat other forms of cheating, the most relevant of which include: kernel-level cheats and toolkits, memory manipulation, spoofing, hardware ID manipulation, virtual machines…” and other anti-cheat tools.&nbsp; While that’s all very true, its presence may still be a dealbreaker for some. And the worst part is that cheaters can still bypass Secure Boot. This won’t be a feature on consoles, which are closed systems with tighter platform control.</p> <h2><strong>All the maps that will be available in <em>Battlefield 6</em> at launch</strong></h2> <p>During the big reveal event, EA listed all nine maps that will be available in <em>Battlefield 6</em> when it launches later this year. Here’s the list:</p> <ul> <li>Siege of Cairo</li> <li>Iberian Offensive</li> <li>Liberation Peak</li> <li>Empire State</li> <li>Operation Firestorm</li> <li>Saints Quarter</li> <li>New Sobek City</li> <li>Mirak Valley</li> <li>Manhattan Bridge</li> </ul> <p>And yes, Operation Firestorm is a returning classic from <em>Battlefield 3</em>. EA has confirmed that it will bring back more classic maps in the future based on player feedback and requests. Also, EA confirmed that all modes are playable on all maps, as every level in <em>BF6</em> can scale up or down to better fit the selected mode. So if you play deathmatch on Empire State—a map set in NYC—you’ll play in a smaller section of the map designed for that mode. But if you return to the NYC-based map later and play conquest, you’ll get to explore the whole thing as it will be opened up more for modes that demand more real estate. So in a sense, you really have more than nine maps in <em>BF6</em>. What a deal!</p> <p><strong>When does <em>Battlefield 6</em> launch? How much is it? And what platforms?&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>During last week’s <em>Battlefield 6</em> multiplayer reveal, EA and Battlefield Studios confirmed the launch date for the game, as well price and platforms. <em>Battlefield 6</em> will arrive on October 10. There is no paid early access window. <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-price-70-80-ea-preorder-black-ops-7-1851787292">The game will cost $70</a>, though you can buy a fancier version for $100.&nbsp; And <em>BF6</em> will be available on PS5, PS5 Pro, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and PC.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The first-person shooter world is a diverse one populated by so many games, many of which boast a competitive scene that feeds into the wider esports ecosystem. From VALORANT to Counter-Strike, Apex Legends to Rainbow Six, and Call of Duty to Overwatch, first-person shooters are ten a penny these days.</p>



<p>In a recent interview, a former Counter-Strike pro player took a dive into the spread of games on the market, ranking them by how tough they are to master, from the perspective of a successful esports athlete.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-it-s-pretty-easy">‘It’s Pretty Easy’</h2>



<p>Fredrik ‘roeJ’ Jorgensen sat down for a lengthy interview ahead of the <a href="https://thunderpick.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Thunderpick</a> World Championship to review his career and sum up the state of the industry. Jorgensen started competing professionally in 2017 and retired earlier this year, but not before claiming more than $300,000 in winnings.</p>



<p>He revealed in his interview that he was earning around $8,000 a month at ‘his peak’, even though his team wasn’t qualifying for many major tournaments or sizeable events.</p>



<p>When the conversation turned to which games are the hardest to master, Jorgensen offered a breakdown of the top seven titles put to him, with <strong>only one </strong>being something other than a first-person shooter: Fortnite.</p>



<p>According to Jorgensen, the toughest first-person shooter to master is Apex Legends:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Apex Legends is pretty hard to be honest. I think it’s like one of those battle royale games if you’re not good at the game or you don’t really understand what’s going on, I think you’re just gonna get killed instantly and you just spend your time flying down.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>At the other end of Jorgensen’s scale sat Call of Duty, one of the oldest and most popular first-person shooter franchises in the world:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>When I think about Call of Duty, I think about Modern Warfare 2, where you just go in and you just play a team deathmatch and you just basically have to kill and you respawn and repeat.&nbsp; I think that’s one of the easiest games you can play.</p>



<p>Obviously, actually killing people is probably a bit harder, but just, you know, the sheer mechanics of the game is pretty straightforward. So, I say Call of Duty on that one. <strong>It’s pretty easy.</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<p>Counter-Strike, which was the game that put Jorgensen on the map, came in just two spots beneath Call of Duty on the scale, beaten in the toughness stakes by Rainbow Six Siege.</p>



<p>Do you agree with roeJ that Call of Duty is the easiest shooter to get good at? Let me know in the comments.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>CD Projekt Red has announced a new <em>Witcher</em> board game. This new entry, <em>The Witcher: Legacy</em>, will be handled by Go On Board, building upon the foundation of their past experience with the license to bring a new narrative-focused board game experience.</p>

<h2><em>The Witcher: Legacy</em> Board Game Announcement</h2>

<p>On its official <a href="https://gamefound.com/en/projects/go-on-board/the-witcher-legacy" rel="nofollow">Gamefound campaign</a> page, Go On Board's own Łukasz Woźniak discusses what players can expect from <em>The Witcher: Legacy </em>board game.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-witcher-legacy-miniature-promo-art.jpg?itok=irb7A2iA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-witcher-legacy-miniature-promo-art.jpg?itok=1KKUuYTM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The game is a story-driven scenario-based experience for one to four players. Each player takes on the role of a witcher from the School of the Wolf after a devastating attack has devastated their home..</p>

<p>Players will battle monsters, train their skills, explore the kingdom of Kedwin, and manage resources, all while tracking down the ones responsible. How will these witchers protect what remains of their legacy? That is for your table to decide. The game's narrative scenarios will feature challenging moral decisions with long-term consequences for your campaign, contributing to its high replayability.</p>

<p>Woźniak also confirms that <em>The Witcher: Legacy</em> will build upon what the design team learned from their last big experience with the franchise, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/witcher-old-world-now-on-kickstarter" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>The Witcher: Old World</em></a>. This Kickstarter success story is similar to <em>Legacy</em>, in that both are prequels set before the time of Geralt of Rivia and focus on witchers facing down monsters in a hostile environment.</p>

<p><em>The Witcher</em> is one of Poland's most popular fantasy franchises ever. What began as a series of novels swiftly shot to mainstream success with three acclaimed action RPGs designed by CD Projekt Red, several crossovers with <em>Soul Calibur</em> and <em>Monster Hunter</em>, and a popular live-action Netflix adaptation. CD Projekt Red has announced both <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/witcher-4-official-reveal" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>The Witcher 4</em></a>, featuring new protagonist, Ciri.</p>

<p>At time of writing, the Gamefound campaign for <em>The Witcher: Legacy</em> hasn't gone live. However, you can follow the campaign and receive updates if you are interested in backing the campaign.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/bravely-default-hd-switch-2-best-jobs-tiz-agnes-ringabel-edea-2000614612</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/these-are-the-best-jobs-for-each-bravely-default-hd-character.1263870/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p><i>Bravely Default HD</i> offers nearly limitless team customization thanks to its take on the iconic <i>Final Fantasy </i>job system. Want to have a Monk who can cast healing magic to back up the party? You can. Need a dedicated tank to take the hits while wielding two shields? No problem. Maybe your Black Mage could use swords and heavy armor, it’s all up to you! And as it turns out, there’s a <i>very </i>subtle layer of customization underneath that robust job system which might influence the way you build your party.</p> <p><i>Bravely Default </i>follows four main characters throughout its runtime: Tiz, Agnes, Ringabel, and Edea. Each has slightly different base stats, which <i>technically </i>makes certain characters fit select jobs better than others. It doesn’t make a huge difference, as a character’s power will be predominantly determined by their job and their equipment. Still, stats are stats, and what is an RPG if not an exercise in taking every advantage to make your damage numbers as big as possible? Below you’ll find a breakdown of what stats each character excels in, and what that means for how you should build them.</p> <h2>Each characters’ base stats in Bravely Default</h2> <p>Both <i>Bravely Default </i>on the 3DS and the HD Remake on Switch 2 appear to follow the same rules when it comes to each characters’ stats. Here is what each character excels at:</p>

 <p><b>Edea</b>: Highest STR and VIT of the party.<br> <b>Ringabel</b>: Highest DEX and AGI of the party, though his stats are well rounded. INT is also high.<br> <b>Agnès</b>: Highest INT and MND of the party.<br> <b>Tiz</b>: Highest HP of the party. Has high STR, VIT, and MND</p> <p>What do we make of this information? Well, let’s do another breakdown:</p> <figure id="attachment_2000614614" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614614"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614614">© Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p><b>1: Edea is a clear candidate for a physical attacker or tank role.<br> </b><b>2: Agnès is your best source of magic damage</b>. She has an edge as a healer too, though I’d personally say the best defense is a good offense.<br> <b>3: Ringabel is your best Thief or Ninja, but he can be a strong magic attacker as well.</b> Ringabel’s naturally high AGI means he’s slightly more likely to attack before your other party members, particularly in the early game.<br> <strong>4: </strong><b>Tiz can be best thought of as a Paladin, even if you don’t need to build him that way</b>. He’s your best healer if Agnes is already spoken for, and your best tank or physical attacker aside from Edea.</p> <p>Tiz only lags behind the party in INT and AGI, making him <i>almost </i>a near mirror image of Ringabel. Which is fitting, as Edea and Agnès are both also opposites in their stat distribution.</p>

 <h2>The best jobs for each character in Bravely Default (through Chapter 1)</h2> <p><b>Take this section with a grain of salt, for reasons we’ll get into below</b>. But if you’re still early enough in the game where these stat differences will be the most noticeable, consider giving each character any of the following jobs:</p> <p><b>Tiz</b>: White Mage, Knight, Merchant, Monk<br> <b>Agnès</b>: Black Mage, White Mage, Time Mage, Thief<br> <b>Ringabel</b>: Thief, Monk, Black Mage, Spell Fencer<br> <b>Edea: </b>Knight, Spell Fencer, Monk, Merchant</p> <figure id="attachment_2000614615" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614615"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614615">© Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p>Caption: A screenshot of <i>Bravely Default </i>for the Nintendo Switch 2. Tiz, Agnès, and Edea are looking at a Black Knight who has boarded their ship.</p>

 <h2>After the opening hours, don’t limit your job choices to each characters’ role</h2> <p>When you’re still getting your feet wet with the game, your future job choices will likely be determined by the jobs a character has already used. For example, if Agnès is your magic attacker, you’ll likely keep her as a caster so she can seamlessly carry over her spell-slinging prowess to whatever job she equips next. A well balanced party will help a lot early on, but the more jobs you unlock, the more you’ll realize just how the game rewards you for thinking out of the box.</p> <p>Does a party of four black mages sound crazy? Maybe, until you realize the job’s innate Black Resonance ability boosts magic damage for every Black Mage in your party, setting yourself up to potentially nuke bosses into the moon in a single brave-boosted turn. Conversely, you might decide to level up everyone as a Knight so they can learn the Two-Handed ability and tear through random encounters. Heck, if a character masters <i>every </i>job, they can become absolute monsters as a lowly Freelancer thanks to the Late Bloomer ability!</p> <p>All of this is to say that there’s a <i>lot </i>to be gained by experimenting with jobs, even the ones that don’t fit a character’s role. And to restate what was said above, most of a characters’ power will come from their build and not their innate stats. Edea won’t be quite as good of a Black Mage as Agnes, but she won’t feel weak if you decide to build her as one either. So please, <i>please </i>experiment with your job choices as you progress, as you may be surprised by the combos you uncover. And considering just <a href="https://kotaku.com/bravely-default-flying-fairy-switch-2-hd-mini-games-1851784559">how long <i>Bravely Default</i> is</a>, you’ll have plenty of time to level up your party before your journey is over.</p> <hr> <p><i>Bravely Default: Flying Fairy HD</i> is available on the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/sekiro-anime-web-domain-registration-surfaces-online/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sekiro-anime-web-domain-registration-surfaces-online.1263867/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Kadokawa Corporation has recently registered a web domain for Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice Anime. </p>



<p>Talks about a Sekiro anime have been circulating for a very long time; however, the latest development almost seals the deal. The only thing left now is an official announcement, which will also confirm who is involved in the upcoming project. Read more about the Sekiro anime web domain registration below. </p>



<h2 id="h-sekiro-anime-announcement-could-arrive-soon">Sekiro Anime Announcement Could Arrive Soon?</h2>



<p>Spotted on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/a-web-domain-for-the-long-rumored-sekiro-shadows-die-twice-anime-has-been-registered.1263348/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ResetEra</a> (via <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1953100767453220870" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Wario64</a>), Vestan has posted about the Sekiro Anime web domain registration on the forum. The domain has been registered by Kadokawa Corporation, which is the parent company of FromSoftware, the developers of Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice. The domain was registered on July 31, 2025, in Japan, and the name has been set as ‘SEKIRO-ANIME.JP’. It will expire on July 31, 2026. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The leaker has also provided more information about the upcoming Sekiro anime. It appears that a studio called Qzil.la, the creators of Hell’s Paradise, is bringing the Sekiro anime to life. As it is a relatively new studio, the anime adaptation is expected to have a low episode count. Moreover, as the domain has been registered, a reveal could arrive “soonish”. However, as this information doesn’t come from an official source, players should take it with a grain of salt. </p>



<p>In other news, FromSoftware is reportedly in “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fromsoftware-new-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">advanced development</a>” of an unannounced game that is expected to arrive next year.

                <p>The most traditional input throughout the lifespan of Battlefield has been a controller. While <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-6/" data-ref-id="5000-687940">Battlefield 6 </a>has full support for mouse and keyboard on PC as well as consoles, a majority of the playerbase will head into battle with a controller in their hands. Due to the popularity of controllers, Battlefield 6 offers a wide range of input settings, including some brand-new options that haven't been seen before in the franchise.</p><p>It can get a little daunting trying to go through all of the available controller settings, so if you want to set all of them correctly and head straight into the action, we have you covered. Below, you'll see a list of every major controller setting in Battlefield 6 and what you should be using for those settings.</p><h2>Best controller presets in Battlefield 6</h2><p>For starters, you'll want to head into the "Settings" menu of Battlefield 6, which is done by pressing the cog icon at the top of your screen. Once you're in Settings, go to the Controller section on the left side of the screen.</p><p>This brings you to a large image of your current controller layout. Here, you can choose to "Edit Presets" or "Edit Settings." Choosing to edit your presets allows you to simply go through all six of the available controller schemes and decide what buttons you want assigned for every action in those schemes. You can also "Edit Keybinds" by clicking edit presets, which allows you to change every single keybind within a specific controller scheme individually.</p><p>While you can customize everything to your liking, the simplest way to go about your controller schemes is by using the following presets:</p><ul><li><strong>Controls</strong>: Default</li><li><strong>Buttons</strong>: Alternate</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4544943-386bdfb69134c736d1188a83789bd073.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4544943" data-ratio="0.558984375" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4544943-386bdfb69134c736d1188a83789bd073.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4544943"></a><figcaption>The basic controller settings menu in Battlefield 6</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4544943-386bdfb69134c736d1188a83789bd073.jpg"></figure><p>By going with the "Alternate" buttons preset, you're swapping some key actions on your controller. The Alternate preset makes it so your Melee button is now assigned to B/Circle and your Crouch/Prone button is assigned to the right joystick on the "Soldier" controller scheme. This has always been the most popular way to play first-person shooters, but you can, of course, switch this back to default if that's what you're used to.</p><p>However, you really don't want to switch back to default in the "Vehicles" and "Aircraft" schemes. By swapping these to the "Alternate" preset, you change the left joystick to turn/yaw left and right instead of moving backward and forward. This makes it much easier to control aircraft and ground vehicles in Battlefield 6, and should result in you crashing less.</p><p>The other schemes can also be set to the "Alternate" buttons preset, but they're not as important.</p><p>Once you're done switching your presets, you can now press "Edit Settings," which launches you into an entirely new section of your controller options.</p><h2>Best control settings in Battlefield 6</h2><p>After clicking "Edit Settings," you can click on "Control Settings" in each of the different sections. Specifically, you want to click Control Settings within the "Infantry" section, as this changes how your character moves, aims, and shoots in Battlefield 6.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4544955-f641fa1cb2992114ffd16b99f5cd1792.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4544955" data-ratio="0.561863743148" data-width="2554" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4544955-f641fa1cb2992114ffd16b99f5cd1792.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4544955"></a><figcaption>The Control Schemes menu</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4544955-f641fa1cb2992114ffd16b99f5cd1792.jpg"></figure><p>In the Infantry Control Settings menu, you can change your aiming sensitivity, field of view, aim assist, and general movement settings.

In this section, select the "Controller Tuning" option.</p><p>Here, you can set all of your controller deadzones and vibration settings. These settings are always crucial to nail down in an FPS, so look below for the general options you should be using:</p><p><strong>Controller Vibration</strong></p><ul><li>Vibration: Off (unless you personally enjoy it enabled)</li></ul><p><strong>Controller Left Stick</strong></p><ul><li>Center Deadzone: 10 (and work your way up depending on your controller's stick drift)</li><li>Axial Deadzone: 15</li><li>Max Input Threshold: 100</li></ul><p><strong>Controller Right Stick</strong></p><ul><li>Center Deadzone: 10 (and work your way up depending on your controller's stick drift)</li><li>Axial Deadzone: 15</li><li>Max Input Threshold: 100</li></ul><p><strong>Controller Triggers</strong></p><ul><li>LT Deadzone: 0</li><li>LT Max Input Threshold: 100</li><li>RT Deadzone: 0</li><li>RT Max Input Threshold: 100</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4544957-3a4ec7bfa8fd12c2b757a87abc3d54fa.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4544957" data-ratio="0.56147220046985" data-width="2554" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4544957-3a4ec7bfa8fd12c2b757a87abc3d54fa.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4544957"></a><figcaption>Setting the right Controller Tuning settings</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4544957-3a4ec7bfa8fd12c2b757a87abc3d54fa.jpg"></figure><p>The Gyro and Flick settings in the Controller Tuning menu don't need to be messed with unless you're actively using those features.</p><p>With that, you now have all of the best controller settings to use in Battlefield 6.

                <p>The Battlefield franchise has always been known for its high-quality graphics, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-6/" data-ref-id="5000-687940">Battlefield 6</a> is no different. From what we've seen so far, PCs will be pushed to their limits, and a high frame rate might be difficult to achieve if you're not using the best graphics settings.</p><p>Fortunately, that's where we come in. We'll be listing off every single one of the PC graphics settings in Battlefield 6 and letting you know what you should set each one to. This will not only give you a great-looking game, but it will also allow you to play at a high FPS and get the most out of your PC.</p><h2>Best graphics settings in Battlefield 6</h2><p>To get started with your graphics settings, go to the main menu screen in Battlefield 6 and click on the cog icon at the top of the screen. From here, click the "Graphics" section on the left side of the screen.</p><p>Here, you'll be able to change around all of the general graphics settings, including choosing what resolution you play at and which monitor Battlefield 6 appears on. These settings are going to be more personal for every player, but you can find a list of our best settings for the general graphics menu below:</p><p><strong>Graphics</strong></p><ul><li>Graphics Quality: Custom</li><li>Brightness: 50-60</li><li>Sharpness: 75</li></ul><p><strong>Camera</strong></p><ul><li>Field of View: 105-110</li><li>Vehicle 3rd Person Field of View: 83</li><li>Weapon Field of View: Wide</li><li>World Motion Blur: 0</li><li>Weapon Motion Blur: 0</li><li>Camera Shake Amount: 20</li><li>Chromatic Aberration: Off</li><li>Vignette: Off</li><li>Film Grain: Off</li></ul><p><strong>Display</strong></p><ul><li>Fullscreen Mode: Borderless or Fullscreen</li><li>Fullscreen Device: Your preferred monitor</li><li>Fullscreen Resolution: Your preferred resolution from the monitor you're using</li><li>Aspect Ratio: Auto</li><li>Refresh Rate: Maximum Hz of your monitor</li><li>Vertical Sync: Off</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4544975-fe83912e6fb099ad597a10f9cb79e849.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4544975" data-ratio="0.56360078277886" data-width="2555" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4544975-fe83912e6fb099ad597a10f9cb79e849.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4544975"></a><figcaption>The main graphics settings menu in Battlefield 6</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4544975-fe83912e6fb099ad597a10f9cb79e849.jpg"></figure><p>There are other sections further down in the graphics menu, but they only relate to your HUD. Change them as you see fit, but they can be left alone for the most part.</p><p>Moving on, if you scroll back up to the Graphics section of the menu, you can click on "GRAPHICS" to modify each individual setting. This allows you to raise or lower the graphical fidelity of Battlefield 6 by changing settings that have a high or low impact on your PC's performance.</p><p>You can see a full list of these settings and what they should be set to below:</p><p><strong>Graphic Settings </strong></p><ul><li>Texture Quality: High</li><li>Texture Filtering: High</li><li>Mesh Quality: Low</li><li>Terrain Quality: Medium</li><li>Undergrowth Quality: Low</li><li>Effects Quality: Low</li><li>Volumetric Quality: Low</li><li>Lighting Quality: Low</li><li>Local Light &amp; Shadow Quality: Low</li><li>Sun Shadow Quality: Low</li><li>Shadow Filtering: PCF</li><li>Reflection Quality: Low</li><li>Screen Space Reflections: Off</li><li>Post Processing Quality: Low</li><li>Screen Space AO &amp; GI: Off</li><li>High Fidelity Objects Amount: Medium</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4544976-68cd1e35a19f117f41bbf8a7aa12c02e.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4544976" data-ratio="0.55660847880299" data-width="2005" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4544976-68cd1e35a19f117f41bbf8a7aa12c02e.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4544976"></a><figcaption>Customizing the individual graphics settings</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4544976-68cd1e35a19f117f41bbf8a7aa12c02e.jpg"></figure><p>Naturally, if you want the most frames per second possible, then just set every single setting to its lowest value. Our settings will still give you a decent frame rate, but they also keep your game's graphical fidelity high so you can see objects and enemies more clearly.</p><p>Finally, back out of the "GRAPHICS" settings and look right below the "Brightness" and "Sharpness" settings in the graphics menu. Here, you'll see an option called "ADVANCED." Click on it and you'll be brought to a new menu where you can change your upscaling and other performance options. Look below for the optimal settings in this menu:</p><p><strong>Advanced Settings</strong></p><ul><li>Fixed Resolution Scale: 100</li><li>Frame Rate Limiter: On and set to your maximum refresh rate (160,144, 240, etc.)</li><li>Nvidia Reflex Low Latency: Enabled + Boost</li><li>Upscaling Technique: DLSS for Nvidia users / FSR for AMD users</li><li>Upscaling Quality: Quality for better visuals, Performance/Ultra Performance for the highest FPS</li><li>Nvidia Frame Generation: Off (adds too much input lag)</li><li>Future Frame Rendering: Off</li><li>Performance Overlay: Off</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4544977-b736cb8b816eb2eee044551e3d5dc719.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4544977" data-ratio="0.56281800391389" data-width="2555" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4544977-b736cb8b816eb2eee044551e3d5dc719.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4544977"></a><figcaption>Going through the upscaling options in Battlefield 6</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4544977-b736cb8b816eb2eee044551e3d5dc719.jpg"></figure><p>Your choice of upscaling depends on your graphics card's brand and whether you want to run Battlefield 6 at a native resolution. You can also run Nvidia Frame Generation if you have a capable RTX GPU, but the added input lag is noticeable, so you'll have to decide if the extra frames are worth it.</p><p>With that, we've covered every available graphics setting.

              <p><span>Sometimes you hear about something and realize the trajectory of your life could have completely changed if one thing had happened differently. Or, I guess in this case, two things had happened differently. For years now, there’s been a story circulating online in </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>spaces about Nintendo of America allegedly asking Game Freak to give Pikachu, the lovable little yellow guy who would go on to become one of the most prominent pop culture mascots of all time, human-like breasts when bringing </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>over to the west. If that had happened, the world would be different, and I probably wouldn’t have a job here at </span><i><span>Kotaku </span></i><span>because I would have likely never been allowed near </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>as a child and gone on to become hyperfixated on the rest of nerd culture. This story has </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1mbg8nc/til_that_when_pok%C3%A9mon_was_being_localised_for_the/"><span>been disputed</span></a><span> because of what some deemed a questionable translation, but Japanese outlet </span><a href="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2025/07/29/155531.html"><i><span>Game*Spark</span></i></a><span> went looking and found the original interview and it sounds like, yeah, someone at Nintendo wanted Pikachu to have giant bazongas to appeal to Americans.</span></p> <p><a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/nintendo-of-america-really-did-suggest-giving-pikachu-large-feminine-breasts-at-one-point-japanese-media-confirms/"><i><span>Automaton</span></i><span>’s</span></a><span> translation breaks down the findings and the translation disputes.

Pikachu’s redesign was described as “a tabby cat with huge breasts,” similar to what you might see in the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical </span><i><span>Cats</span></i><span>, but the Japanese word “mune” is used here, which can be used to refer to either pronounced pecs or the presumed mommy milkers, which led to the aforementioned dispute. However, when the interviewer asked if this design was “like those girls who do Pikachu cosplays at anime conventions,” Ishihara said, “Yes, exactly.”&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Ishihara said that it was an interesting thought experiment and made him appreciate the cultural differences between the Eastern and Western audiences, but he thankfully turned down the design, we got the little yellow guy unchanged, and </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>still became a cultural phenomenon over here. That’s not to say that monster taming franchises can’t also have sexualized designs and be successful. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/digmon-story-time-stranger-preview-pokemon-pc-ps5-xbox-1851784677"><i><span>Digimon</span></i></a> <span>has several humanoid monsters like Angemon and Angewomon that appeal to people looking for that, but </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>’s longevity is tied to how timeless its characters are and how every new generation of kids can jump into it from anywhere. That certainly hasn’t stopped them from creating humanoid Pokémon over the years, but the visual identity of those characters has remained child-appropriate. The franchise already had to weather enough bullshit from people trying to paint it as </span><a href="https://filmschoolrejects.com/pokemon-satanic-panic/"><span>some kind of gateway to evil</span></a><span>. Imagine if it was also having to fight against parents accusing it of trying to corrupt children’s minds with sexual imagery. </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/70p101/til_that_a_40second_sequence_of_james_showing_off/"><span>Good thing that never happened, right</span></a><span>?</span></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/opinion-we-really-dont-need-a-donkey-kong-timeline.1263831/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="Donkey Kong Bananza Ending" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9824329e3a075/donkey-kong-bananza-ending.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>From the moment Nintendo revealed Pauline's presence in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, I knew one thing for certain: I was going to be writing a feature on the DK timeline in the next two months.</p>
<p>Look, you know I love Bananza. DK and Pauline have such a wholesome little relationship, I adored hearing the same senile rant from Cranky on each and every layer, and the little nods to the great ape's previous endeavours were perfectly balanced. It felt like a wall-to-wall celebration of all things DK while also serving as an introduction to the modern age of 3D platforming for one of Nintendo's oldest characters.</p><div><figure data-videoid="fMx2XNyAq4E" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5d98e4ksnotq&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMx2XNyAq4E" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>And then the ending happened. It's a wonderful set piece that I played with the biggest, cheesiest smile on my face, but it, along with the mere presence of a 13-year-old Pauline, throws up a lot of questions about where Bananza sits in the wider canon, and let's be honest here, DK doesn't need that.</p>
<p>If you've stayed with me this far and you think there's a chance I'll make it through the next 800 words without spoiling the end of Donkey Kong Bananza, you are very much mistaken. I'll be talking about the final sequence of Donkey Kong Bananza in depth. Heck, there might even be some screenshots thrown in for good measure.</p>
<p>If you don't want that spoiling (and I'd really recommend seeing it fresh for yourself — it's awesome), then wrap up your reading here and only scroll past the following image when you've seen everything for yourself, <strong>as there are major spoilers below</strong>.</p>
<figure><a title="Donkey Kong Bananza Ending" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ece8c9c5bafeb/donkey-kong-bananza-ending.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>3, 2, 1... right, that's it, I'm unpeeling things — <em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Where was I? Ah yes, the ending!</p>
<p>The final stage of Donkey Kong Bananza finally sees DK and Pauline get back to the latter's home turf on the surface, which is... New Donk City! Yep, the very one seen in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a>. There's some more platforming and a boss fight (I've broken it all down in an <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/donkey-kong-bananza-ending-explained-is-it-a-prequel-to-mario-odyssey">Ending Explained guide</a>, if you need reminding of the deets), but the tl;dr of it is that NDC returns to its rot-free glory, DK returns to the mines — <a href="https://youtu.be/wJO_vIDZn-I?si=_2rCxvy25prEHc_s&amp;t=4">like Steve, he yearns for them</a> — and Pauline gets to live out her dreams of singing in front of the whole city. Hmm.</p>
<p>That last note got under my skin when I first played through the grand finale, and I haven't been able to shake it in the weeks since. This is <em>Pauline</em>. This is <em>New Donk City</em>. This is <em>singing</em>. Nintendo could have played the riff from 'Jump Up, Superstar!' over the entire sequence, and it wouldn't have made it any more obvious that the game is going, "Look, it's just like that 2017 3D Mario game!! See??"</p>
<p>All these threads come together in a great big Odyssey-shaped signpost, actively encouraging us all to think about the prized plumber's previous platforming exploits and start to question where Bananza fits in around it.</p>
<p>And think about it I did. I was so ready for Bananza to end with Pauline saying something like, "You know what my <em>real</em> dream is, DK? To be mayor of this great city!," but it doesn't. Instead, it ends with an image of a very-much-still-13-years-old Pauline singing on the roof of City Hall (after the post-credits missions, that is), and all of those references to her grandma — which she's been banging on about throughout the game, let's not forget — ringing in your ears.</p>

<p>This isn't the Odyssey prequel that I thought it would be, but instead a <em>sequel</em>. Another child in the Pauline family tree (also called 'Pauline', confusingly), learning to love the giant ape that had caused so much drama for her ancestors. <em>Aw</em>.</p>
<p>No! Not "<em>Aw</em>"! This is exactly why I started this piece in the first place. I have put too much thought and energy into a timeline that, let's admit it, is a load of rubbish.</p>
<p>Don't even get me started on Cranky Kong. We all know that this elderly ape is <em>the</em> DK from the original arcade machine (it's even referenced in one of his Bananza speeches), so what's he doing <em>still</em> up and about all these years later? And what about his son, Donkey Kong Jr? Are we just going to assume that vest-wearing chimp faded away as he headed back to his home planet?</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, I can get behind a BS timeline. I know the <strong>Zelda</strong> one more than most and actually enjoy slotting things into it. But at least <strong>Hyrule Historia</strong> is based loosely (and I mean <em>loosely</em>) on the games' narrative events and not solely on "how old is this kid now, do you reckon?"</p>
<p>A Donkey Kong timeline — or, casting the net even wider in this instance, a <em>Mario</em> timeline — is a fool's errand right from the jump because there's almost no narrative to hang things on. Nobody is saying "<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/donkey_kong_country_tropical_freeze">Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze</a> <em>has</em> to come after <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/dk_king_of_swing">DK: King of Swing</a> because you can see DK still riding the high of the Jungle Jam Festival".</p>
<figure><a title="Donkey Kong Bananza Ending" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c11871822b222/donkey-kong-bananza-ending.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>And I really want to hammer this home, I <em>love</em> Donkey Kong Bananza, I just don't think that good things necessarily need to be strung up to other good things. I should be relishing in the glow of post-Bananza joy, but instead I'm getting myself wound up over lore that didn't exist until a month ago.</p>
<p>If we're going to keep pretending that the narrative events of DK or Mario matter to the wider pantheon of Nintendo games, at least give us a nicely bound lore book to add to the coffee table. The DK Dictionary? Kong Kompilation? Gorilla Glossary?... I'll work on it.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>EA is kicking off its first public beta for <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/battlefield-6/">Battlefield 6</a> tomorrow, and even though the first two days of this weekend's beta is only open to players who were able to grab a code through Twitch or sent out to players that previously signed up to participate in Battlefield Labs, servers for the beta are already starting to fill up, as tens of thousands of players are queued up for the beta ahead of launch.</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/tens-of-thousands-of-players-are-queuing-for-the-battlefield-6-beta-ahead-of-this-weeks-launch/">VGC</a>, players on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1mj6s2e/the_hype_is_real/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">Reddit</a> are sharing that the servers have already been maxed out, and there are thousands more waiting in the queue to get in, which means there are thousands who are keeping their devices on and ready, waiting in the game's lobby for the beta to go live tomorrow.</p>



<p>At least for these coming beta weekends, it seems like EA won't need to use <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-include-bots-servers-arent-full-classic-maps-fan-feedback/">bots to fill the game's servers</a>.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Even <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3081410/charts/">SteamDB</a> is showing thousands of users currently in-game with a peak of 24,879 players earlier today. </p>



<p>Pre-loading the beta has been available to players since <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-preload-now-available-matchmaking-skill/">yesterday</a>, and with thousands already chomping at the bit to try out the next entry in the Battlefield series, it's clear that the caption on the above Reddit post is right. The hype is indeed real, for Battlefield 6.</p>



<p>Will it live up to the hype is another question all together. <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-october-10-pre-orders-open-two-open-beta-weekends/">Last week's reveal</a> was a very promising show of the new shooter, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-hands-on-impressions/">Wccftech's Kai Tatsumoto had plenty of positive things to say in his hands-on impressions,</a> saying "<em>this is exactly what I've wanted out of Battlefield multiplayer since the days of Operation Metro and Strike at Karkand. Massive maps with the flow of infantry, tanks, and jets all coordinating in tandem, and the constant chatter of squadmates calling for revives or ammo packs. While I know what I've experience during the multiplayer reveal event is only a small slice of the complete Battlefield 6 package, October 10th can't come soon enough.</em>"</p>
