            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/642049/nintendo-switch-2-verge-staff-reacts<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Nintendo has finally aired its big Switch 2 Direct, and now we know a whole lot about <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/630264/nintendo-switch-2-specs-details-performance">its next console</a>. <em>The Verge</em> staff has a lot of feelings about the device, which will launch on June 5th, and we’ve collected our first impressions below.</p><div><p id="a-soulless-design"><h2><strong>A soulless design</strong></h2></p></div><p>Look, I love black. My entire wardrobe is almost exclusively black. But the Switch 2’s mostly-black design looks off to me. The original Switch may have launched with a gray Joy-Con option, but the neon red and blue controllers that also launched on day one became iconic. Now, the Switch 2 has just splashes of colors, and they’re mostly hidden.</p><p>I imagine Nintendo will inevitably release full-color Joy-Con 2 controllers in the future, but I think the Switch 2 out of the gate could have looked much more fun.</p><p><em>-Antonio Di Benedetto, laptop reviewer</em></p><div><p id="a-meaningful-screen-upgrade"><h2><strong>A meaningful screen upgrade</strong></h2></p></div><p>No, it’s not an OLED. And yes, Nintendo will almost certainly repeat its strategy of launching a Switch 2 with that display technology down the line. But even right now, there’s a lot to like about the Switch 2’s new 1080p screen.</p><p>Its much larger 7.9-inch size is a blessing for the eyesight of a generation that grew up with Nintendo consoles — myself included. And I was pleasantly surprised that the company went with a 120Hz panel that supports variable refresh rate (VRR) and wider HDR color.</p><p>It won’t deliver the inky blacks of OLED, but as long as Nintendo’s quality assurance is up to snuff, the LCD won’t dissuade me from buying a Switch 2 on day one.</p><p><em>-Chris Welch, senior reviewer</em></p><div><p id="the-joy-con-seem-like-a-big-improvement"><h2><strong>The Joy-Con seem like a big improvement</strong></h2></p></div><p>The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/642024/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-controllers-mouse-magnetic-attach-c-button">new Joy-Con</a> are bigger, look more comfortable, do indeed attach via magnets, and can even be used like a mouse. Now, the real question is: will the sticks drift?</p><p><em>-Jay Peters, news editor</em></p><div><p id="social-features-no-thanks"><h2><strong>Social features? No thanks</strong></h2></p></div><p>Just imagine: the joy of Zoom meetings, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/24343637/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-c-button-controller">now integrated into your gameplay</a>. Voice chat and video streaming are the worst parts about gaming to me. I will not be using these features to scare my friends away by yelling at them.</p><p>-<em>Marina Galperina, senior tech editor</em></p><div><p id="the-new-gamecube-controller-is-one-flaw-from-perfection"><h2><strong>The new GameCube controller is one flaw from perfection</strong></h2></p></div><p>I play a lot of my Switch games with a licensed PowerA replica GameCube controller. While it unfortunately uses AA batteries, it includes an additional ZL button that lets me play most of my Switch games. While Nintendo’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/641482/nintendo-is-releasing-a-gamecube-controller">official wireless GameCube controller</a> for the Switch 2 brings rechargeable batteries, Nintendo opted to give it a little nub of a ZL button instead of a full button. Hardly the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/637833/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-details">Pro Controller</a> replacement or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/9/23546851/nyxi-wizard-nintendo-switch-driftless-gamecube-controller-hall-effect#:~:text=for%20the%20Gamecube.-,I%20love%20the%20WaveBird,-(as%20do%20our">WaveBird</a> successor I was hoping for.</p><p><em>-Umar Shakir, news writer</em></p><div><p id="a-higher-than-expected-price"><h2><strong>A higher-than-expected price</strong></h2></p></div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/634603/nintendo-switch-2-price-release-date-details">$449.99</a> is higher than I was expecting for the Switch 2. I was hoping for $399. But still I’ll be doing everything I can to snag the $499.99 bundle with <em>Mario Kart World</em>, a game that costs an eye-watering $79.99 on its own. </p><p>Let’s just hope pre-orders, which start on April 9th, go ok. (I’m expecting disaster.)</p><p><em>-Jay Peters</em></p><div><p id="donkey-kong-bananza-looks-great"><h2><strong>Donkey Kong Bananza looks great</strong></h2></p></div><p>I’m sure I’ll play plenty of <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/634632/mario-kart-nintendo-switch-2-trailer">Mario Kart World</a></em>, but I’m an antisocial sort at heart, so I spent most of this Direct waiting for Nintendo’s first-party, single-player killer app. I never would have bet on <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/641537/donkey-kong-bananza-nintendo-switch-2">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> </em>leading the charge. </p><p>He may be as old as Mario, but this is only Donkey Kong’s second-<em>ever</em> 3D platformer, his first since 1999’s <em>Donkey Kong 64</em>, and his first solo game since <em>Tropical Freeze</em> in 2014. He’s an unlikely candidate for a system seller. Then again, that’s probably what <em>Mario Kart </em>is for.</p><p><em>-Dominic Preston, news editor</em></p><div><p id="charging-for-a-tutorial"><h2><strong>Charging for a tutorial?</strong></h2></p></div><p>The age of new consoles being bundled with a free game is behind us, but it’s confusing why Nintendo is charging for the <em>Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</em> app. Although it does appear to include a small selection of mini-games, the app seems to be more of a highly-polished interactive tutorial than a game.</p><p><em>Wii Sports</em> not only helped make that console a huge hit for Nintendo, it also cleverly introduced gamers to the Wiimote and Nunchuck’s unique capabilities and motion-controlled gaming. The <em>Welcome Tour</em> app feels like a similar idea, but with much less replay value.</p><p><em>-Andrew Liszewski, senior reporter</em></p><div><p id="no-super-smash-bros"><h2><strong>No <em>Super Smash Bros.</em> </strong></h2></p></div><p>Throughout the Switch 2 Direct, I was waiting for the iconic <em>Super Smash Bros. </em>logo to flash across my screen. And I nearly jumped out of my seat <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/641602/kirby-air-riders-switch-2-masahiro-sakurai">during the <em>Kirby Air Riders</em></a> trailer, which looked almost like an intro for a new <em>SSB </em>game.</p><p>It wasn’t, unfortunately, though <em>SSB</em> creator Masahiro Sakurai, who also directed the original <em>Air Ride</em>, is directing <em>Riders</em>. Here’s hoping he’ll be up for another <em>SSB</em>.</p><p><em>-Emma Roth, news writer</em></p><div><p id="gamecube-games-on-nintendo-switch-online"><h2><strong>GameCube games on Nintendo Switch Online</strong></h2></p></div><p>It’s been more than two decades since Nintendo released <em>F-Zero GX, </em>my favorite anti-gravity racer of all time, and Switch 2 Direct revealed that it and several other GameCube games are <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fwhatsnew%2Fwhats-new-with-nintendo-switch-online-on-nintendo-switch-2%2F" rel="sponsored">coming to the new console</a> as a Nintendo Switch Online feature. In addition to <em>GX</em>, I can’t wait to finally play bangers from Nintendo’s most adorable console in higher resolution without the need to screw around with the pain of emulators.</p><p><em>-Wes Davis, weekend editor</em></p><div><p id="virtual-cartridges-look-useful"><h2><strong>Virtual cartridges </strong>look useful</h2></p></div><p>After my decision to stick with digital game downloads for the original Nintendo Switch led to frustrations with playing those games on the Switch OLED, I was planning a return to physical cartridges for the Switch 2.</p><p>But Nintendo’s reveal of its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/637307/nintendo-switch-virtual-game-card-lending-system">new virtual game cards</a> last week has changed my mind. Being able to more easily move games between several versions of the Switch without the consoles needing a constant internet connection is exactly the upgrade Nintendo needed to introduce to streamline digital game management with the Switch 2 enroute.</p><p><em>-Andrew Liszewski</em></p><div><p id="promising-updates-for-old-games"><h2><strong>Promising updates for old games</strong></h2></p></div><p>Nintendo squeezed in some promising info about <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/641578/nintendo-switch-2-backwards-compatibility-games-faq">Switch 2 updates for older titles</a> during today’s Direct. The selection of games getting updates — which includes <em>Arms</em>, <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>, and <em>Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker</em> — is relatively small, and it sounds like Nintendo is taking steps to make them compatible with the Switch 2’s new GameChat feature. But Nintendo also said that the updates “may improve performance,” which feels <em>very </em>significant for certain titles on the list like <em>Pokémon Scarlet </em>/ <em>Violet </em>and <em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em>.</p><p>-<em>Charles Pulliam-Moore, film and TV reporter</em> </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

They’re also giving out a month of free Switch Online with purchases. With physical games now at $80 and $90 a pop, it won’t be hard to start racking up those coupons, though I’m personally not chomping at the bit to spend over $600 on what’s looking like a pretty middling launch lineup outside of <em>Mario Kart World</em>. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Optimized for the Nintendo Switch 2 system, including Joy-Con 2 mouse controls, the game not only features DLC from the original title, but also includes six new scenarios along with climactic Decisive Battles. Launch joint offenses with allies, break through the frontlines en route to enemy castles, and appoint officers to influence both political and economic strategies as players experience the life of a daimyo—a powerful Japanese leader—in the troubled times of the Warring States Period, 16th century Japan.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/642024/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-controllers-mouse-magnetic-attach-c-button<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>In its April 2nd Direct event, Nintendo revealed a lot of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/634603/nintendo-switch-2-price-release-date-details">Switch 2 details</a> we’ve been waiting for, including the console’s price ($449.99 in the US), its June 5th release date, and a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/641985/nintendo-switch-2-every-game-announced-direct">slew of new games</a> coming to it, like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/634632/mario-kart-nintendo-switch-2-trailer"><em>Mario Kart World</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/641537/donkey-kong-bananza-nintendo-switch-2"><em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em></a><em>. </em>The video and details the company published after the event also helped create a more complete picture of what we should expect from the second-generation Joy-Cons that come with the system.</p><p>The new Joy-Cons look a lot like the old Joy-Cons but are about a half-inch longer and black, with color accents on the connection rails and under the analog sticks — blue on the left and a pinkish-red on the right. Nintendo says they’ll be more comfortable, too. They have the same general button layout as the originals, but with a new “C” button on the right Joy-Con that’s used for a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/24343637/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-c-button-controller">Discord-like GameChat feature</a> that lets you talk to friends using a microphone embedded in the top of the Switch 2 and that includes screen sharing functionality and the ability to start streaming with the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/641352/nintendo-switch-2-camera-launch">Switch 2 camera accessory</a> Nintendo is selling separately.</p><p>As Switch 2 producer Kouichi Kawamoto describes in a <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fwhatsnew%2Fask-the-developer-vol-16-nintendo-switch-2-part-2%2F" rel="sponsored">new “Ask the Developer” interview</a> published today, the Switch 2’s Joy-Cons have “larger and more durable” analog sticks “with smoother movement.” On its site, the company says that the Joy-Con 2s are quieter, too. Smoother and quieter makes sense if Nintendo is using Hall effect sensors this time around, as previously rumored. Kawamoto also points out that the L and R buttons curve further down the side for easy reach. </p><p>The Joy-Con 2s connect to the Switch 2 magnetically, something Kawamoto says the company originally wanted to do with the first Switch. The Joy-Cons have larger SL and SR buttons that are made of metal, while the magnets themselves are embedded in the console. Disconnecting them involves pressing a release button on the back. In its Direct today, Nintendo claims they “won’t easily detach” on their own, but we’ll see about that when the system launches this summer. </p><p>Another big new feature of the Switch 2 Joy-Cons is that they can work like a mouse with select games. When they’re detached, you hold them, connection rail down, on a surface like a coffee table. Kawamoto said the feature will be used in games like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/640231/metroid-prime-4-nintendo-switch-2-enhanced-edition-beyond"><em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em></a><em>, </em>for aiming (gyro control is still an option, too, according to a footnote on the page), and the thoroughly named <em>Super Mario Party Jamboree Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV</em>.</p><p>Comparing it to the Wii Remote’s cursor, Switch 2 director Takuhiro Dohta, who is also featured in the interview, says the company sees the mouse functionality of the new Joy-Cons as a way to let the Switch 2’s touchscreen capabilities transition to playing in docked mode. The Joy-Cons come with wrist straps, which Nintendo says gives them a wider base for “smoother gliding and better stability.”</p><p>Kawamoto said the new Joy-Con rumble feature, now called HD Rumble 2, is updated “to allow for a wider variety of vibrations.” They’ll also be stronger, he said, and have “quicker response times.” According to Nintendo’s <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fgaming-systems%2Fswitch-2%2Ftech-specs%2F%23joycon2" rel="sponsored">official specs</a>, the controllers will last about 20 hours between charges and recharge in about 3.5 hours, same as the original Joy-Cons. </p><p><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fgaming-systems%2Fswitch-2%2Faccessories%2F" rel="sponsored">As for accessories</a>, apart from the included wrist straps, Nintendo has also announced a $19.99 set of two wheels you can attach the Joy-Con 2s to for games like <em>Mario Kart World</em>. The company will sell a $34.99 charging grip, and the console comes with a standard non-charging grip as well. </p><p>Nintendo did away with the IR sensor found on the right-hand first-generation Joy-Con, which I will miss for no reason other than that I love when gadgets have IR sensors. In every other way, the updated Joy-Cons sound like an improvement over their predecessors, with intriguing new features and Nintendo’s promise of better comfort and improved rumble. Now, we just have to wait to see if Nintendo managed to solve the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21504741/nintendo-switch-joy-con-drift-problem-explained">stick drift problem</a> of the first Joy-Cons.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is a powerful console and looks to be a huge improvement over the first Switch, but the cost of Switch 2 physical and digital media has left a sour taste in the mouths of players and potential buyers.</p>



<p>The Switch 2—almost known as the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-nintendo-switch-2-was-almost-named-super-nintendo-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Super Nintendo Switch</a>—has gone from being an unknown entity to being given an imminent <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release date</a>. I’m happy, fans are, and the thought of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-4k-120fps-hdr/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">120 FPS, 4K &amp; HDR</a>, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/donkey-kong-is-getting-a-new-3d-adventure-on-the-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> is bliss.</p>



<p>What isn’t bliss is the projected prices of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a> games. We’re entering a new era of gaming, but it could be a scary one for wallets and bank accounts.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-much-do-nintendo-switch-2-games-cost">How Much Do Nintendo Switch 2 Games Cost?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Will you buy straight away? Credit to Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Nintendo Switch 2 games are expected to cost between $70-90 for base copies of games.</strong></p>



<p>This figure could vary based on the physical nature of the game, as well as how much Nintendo possibly values the license—let me explain. </p>



<h3 id="h-increased-rrp">Increased RRP</h3>



<p>A ton of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-games-announced-during-the-nintendo-switch-2-direct/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">games were announced during the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct</a>. Some of the biggest reveals included <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mario-kart-world-revealed-as-nintendo-switch-2-launch-title/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mario Kart World</a> (AKA Mario Kart 9) and the aforementioned Donkey Kong Bananza.</p>



<p>Mario is a launch-day title, whereas Donkey Kong arrives later. But the key thing to note is the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-games-will-cost-80-for-digital-90-for-physical/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cost of both games</a>. The official Nintendo website states <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/featured-games/mario-kart-world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Mario Kart World</a> has an MSRP (Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price) of <strong>$79.99</strong>, with the physical edition costing an even steeper <strong>$89.99</strong>.</p>



<p>Over the years, it’s become traditional for digital games to be more expensive than physical media. Personally, this has never made sense to me as physical media requires shipping and practical manufacturing. But now it seems the tide is turning somewhat.</p>



<h3 id="h-franchise-status-could-affect-price">Franchise Status Could Affect Price</h3>



<p>Mario Kart World looks to be getting the full-price treatment. If we compare it to Donkey Kong Bananza—another first-party Nintendo series—it’s currently locked in at <strong>$69.99</strong> for digital and <strong>$79.99</strong> for physical.</p>



<p>I’m not here saying Mario Kart is a superior franchise to Donkey Kong in any way, but the evidence suggests that’s how Nintendo views Donkey Kong Bananza compared to Mario Kart World. The company believes Mario Kart will sell many more copies than DK, hence the price point difference.</p>



<p>This likely means the $80-90 RRP <strong>won’t apply to all games and franchises</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-do-nintendo-switch-2-game-costs-compare-to-switch-1">How do Nintendo Switch 2 Game Costs Compare to Switch 1?</h2>



<p>If we compare Mario Kart World to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, the former has an MSRP of <strong>$79.99 for the digital edition</strong>, whereas The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is <strong>$69.99 for a digital copy</strong>.</p>



<p>Nintendo is notorious for keeping the cost of its AAA titles the same. The top-tier games don’t get permanently discounted like Sony would God of War or Horizon. So there’s a clear difference of $10 between the two, showing you game media prices are going up.</p>



<p>The famed “$100 game” might, unfortunately, be closer than you think.</p>

<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 has been fully revealed with all of its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-features-officially-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bells and whistles</a>, and one thing that stood out was the console’s battery life.</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/tech-specs/?srsltid=AfmBOooxo0wVjRc2ml5KgPabZ0zRKqus_UgaTAA9k8ROq4mfc7XlpIk5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">specs released</a> on Nintendo’s website, the Switch 2 will have a more powerful battery than the original Switch. The new system features a 5220mAh Lithium-ion battery which is more than the 4310mAh&nbsp;battery of the Switch and 3570mAh of the Switch Lite. </p>



<p>When it comes to actual battery life, Nintendo says that the Switch 2 has a range from 2-6.5 hours. The company says that the times are “rough estimates” and that “the battery life will depend on the games you play.”</p>







<p>Should you need to charge your system, it will take around three hours to fully charge the console while the system is in Sleep mode. Should you actively be playing in TV mode, charging will take longer.</p>



<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 features a larger 7.9-inch 1080p LCD Screen that keeps the same overall size of the original Switch. The screen also supports HDR and up to 120 frames per second (FPS). Other features of the new system include 256GB of built-in storage, 4K at 60 FPS when docked, built-in microphone, two USB-C ports, and more. The Nintendo Switch 2 will also support MicroSD Express memory cards, meaning that the MicroSD cards compatible with the current system will not be supported.</p>



<p>What do you think of the Nintendo Switch 2 battery life? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

During the hour-long Direct, there was a LOT of info on both new and old games coming to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-23-new-details-release-date-price-gamechat-and-more">Nintendo’s new console</a>. From expected arrivals such as Mario Kart World to the complete surprise of what looks like a spiritual sequel to Bloodborne, here are 72 new details about the Nintendo Switch 2 games library as we know it right now.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Nintendo Switch 2 Direct April 2025 Games</h3><p>Every game shown in Nintendo's April 2 Nintendo Switch 2 reveal direct event.</p></div><h2 data-cy="title2"><u>Mario Kart World</u></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">1. The Switch 2’s flagship launch title looks set to be Mario Kart World, the first open-world Mario Kart game that will allow you to “drive almost anywhere”.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">2. Many new tracks were seen in the trailer, including one based on the original Donkey Kong game and a metropolis that could be Super Mario Odyssey’s New Donk City.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Nintendo Direct: Nintendo Switch 2 Mario Kart World Slideshow</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">3. The overworld’s roads and track conditions will change due to the environment’s changing weather and a day/night cycle.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">4. Up to 24 drivers in a race were confirmed, almost certainly leading to even more Mario Kart havoc.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">5. A new mode for Mario Kart World called Knockout Tour will be introduced. These will be longer races where you follow the checkpoints and have to remain near the leaders to avoid elimination and ultimately take the crown.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">6. You can also drive freely around the open world and meet up with friends. A photo mode will help document these adventures.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">7. New racing mechanics look set to be introduced. We see wall-riding and grinding in the trailer, as well as what looks like Birdo transforming into a semi-truck and Mario eating a burger to transform into a different version of himself? I’m sure we’ll find out what the hell is going on here soon enough.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">8. And that time could be 6am Pacific Time on the 17th of April, when Mario Kart World will be having its very own Nintendo Direct stream.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><u>Other Switch 2 Nintendo Games</u></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">9. Metroid Prime 4: Beyond will be getting its very own Switch 2 version, which allows you to take advantage of the new joy-con mouse controls.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">10. Metroid Prime 4 will also be available to play in two different graphics modes. Quality Mode allows for  4K 60FPS with HDR enabled when docked and 1080p 60fps handheld. Performance Mode offers 1080p with HDR at 120fps docked, but 720p 120fps HDR when handheld.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">11. A new 3D Donkey Kong platformer called Donkey Kong Bananza is heading to the Switch 2 on July 17th. It appears we’ll be able to smash everything in it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">12. Kirby Air Riders, a follow-up to GameCube racing spin-off Kirby Air Ride, is also coming to the Switch 2. It will be directed by legendary Super Smash Bros. developer, and Kirby creator, Masahiro Sakurai.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">13. Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour will offer a “virtual exhibition” of the new hardware, as well as being filled with minigames. This will not be packed into each Switch 2 at launch, though, but a paid-for game in its own right.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">14. Drag X Drive is a launch game that uses the Nintendo Switch 2 Joy-Con mouse controls to enable three-on-three basketball-style matches.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">15. Then there are a bunch of existing Nintendo-published games that will be getting Switch 2 upgrades. These won’t be free for existing owners, however, with paid upgrade packs being the barrier to entry. The list of Switch 1 games getting these upgrades so far includes: </p><p data-cy="paragraph">16. Mario Party Jamboree + Jamboree TV, the latter being an expansion centered around the Switch 2 camera and GameChat additions.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">17. The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom, with both receiving enhanced resolution and frame rates, as well as HDR implementation. A new Zelda Notes section on the Nintendo Today app will also be added to let you look at Hyrule’s map and easily share TOTK creations with other players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">18. Kirby and the Forgotten Land will be receiving an upgrade, as well as a new Star Cross World story expansion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">19. And Pokemon Legends Z-A will get its very own Switch 2 version with enhanced resolution when it arrives later in 2025.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><u>3rd Party Switch 2 Games</u></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">20. But that’s not it. During the Switch 2 direct a whole host of third-party games, both new and old, were revealed to be making their way to Nintendo’s upcoming console. We’ve got them all for you here:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">21. Perhaps the biggest surprise of the whole direct, FromSoftware is making what looks like a spiritual successor to Bloodborne exclusively for the Nintendo Switch 2. Releasing in 2026, The Duskbloods is officially described as “a brand-new multiplayer game" from the Dark Souls developers and we look forward to hearing much more about it when a Creator’s Voice article from Hidetaka Miyazaki himself drops on the Nintendo Today App on April 4th.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">22. FromSoft’s last game, Elden Ring, will also be making its way to Switch 2 with its Tarnished Edition.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">23. Hades 2 will arrive (presumably once out of early access)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">24. We finally got another little peek at Hollow Knight Silksong, which is listed for 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">25. Street Fighter 6 Years 1-2 Fighters Edition will be available on day one.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">26. Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion will launch on September 5th.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">27. Split-Fiction will also arrive at launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">28. Both the EA FC and Madden sports sims will be on Switch 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">29. Hogwarts Legacy, complete with mouse controls, will be available at launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">30. The Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4 Remakes will arrive in summer, as well as what looked like a tease for a Spongebob level (?)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">31. The Hitman World of Assassination Signature Edition will let us carry out contracts on the go.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">32. James Bond will make his way to Switch 2 when Project 007 is released by IO Interactive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">33. A Bravely Default Flying Fairy HD Remaster will launch alongside the Switch 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">34. Yakuza 0 Director’s Cut is also a launch title and comes packed with new cutscenes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">35. Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment – a prequel to Tears of the Kingdom – promises to tell the untold story of the Imprisoning War when it arrives from Koei Tecmo this winter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">36. Deltarune Chapters 3 and 4 are also set for launch day.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">37. And Borderlands 4 will fire its way onto Switch 2 alongside its thousands of different ridiculous pieces of weaponry.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">38. Civilization 7 will be taking advantage of the Switch 2’s mouse controls at launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">39. And both WWE 2K and NBA 2K will both be making their way to the console as well. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">40. Survival Kids, a colourful co-op survival game, will be arriving at launch, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">41. Cyberpunk 2077 Ultimate Edition is on the way from CD Projekt Red, complete with its Phantom Liberty expansion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">42. And Square Enix will also be bringing Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade to Switch 2 in all its glory.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">43. There were also MANY more games shown to be on their way to the Switch 2. Let’s rattle them off here, starting with Enter the Gungeon 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">44. Starseeker: Astroneer Expeditions</p><p data-cy="paragraph">45. Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</p><p data-cy="paragraph">46. Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar</p><p data-cy="paragraph">47. Goodnight Universe</p><p data-cy="paragraph">48. Two Point Museum</p><p data-cy="paragraph">49. Wild Hearts S</p><p data-cy="paragraph">50. Witchbrook</p><p data-cy="paragraph">51. Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S</p><p data-cy="paragraph">52. Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</p><p data-cy="paragraph">53. Marvel Cosmic Invasion</p><p data-cy="paragraph">54. Star Wars Outlaws</p><p data-cy="paragraph">55. Nobunaga’s Ambition: Awakening Complete Edition</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">56.

Human Fall Flat 2</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><u>Nintendo Switch Online + GameCube</u></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">66. But wait! There are more games. Even older ones! Nintendo Online will continue over to Switch 2 and if you subscribe to the +Expansion service, Switch 2 owners get exclusive access to a new classic game library: GameCube.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">67. There will be three titles at launch, including The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker. Yeah, it’s not the HD remaster that many have been crying out for but at least it’s a way of replaying the fantastic GameCube adventure on the go.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">68. SoulCalibur 2 is also a launch game, along with F-Zero GX. What’s more, multiplayer games like F-Zero GX will support four-player local and online play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">69. Games coming further down the line include Pokemon XD: Gale of Darkness, Super Mario Strikers, Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance, Chi bi-Robo!, Luigi’s Mansion, and Pokemon Coliseum.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">70. A 3D Mario platformer was also shown during the Direct, but not the brand-new one many were hoping for. Instead, Mario Sunshine will be available to Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion subscribers in the future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">71. All GameCube games benefit from superior image quality and improved resolution compared to the original versions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">72. Additionally, a dedicated Switch 2 GameCube controller is coming, available exclusively to Nintendo Switch Online members. It’ll connect wireless to Switch 2 and also has a C button for GameChat.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And that’s all the important information we picked out about the games heading to Switch 2 from Nintendo’s extensive Direct.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/hbos-the-last-of-us-showrunner-will-flat-out-not-go-past-the-story-in-the-games/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Craig Mazin, showrunner and writer for <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-part-ii-hbo-series-multiple-season-things-to-be-flipped/">HBO's The Last of Us</a>, has made himself crystal clear regarding whether he and the show's creative team will pull a Game of Thrones and go beyond the story he's adapting.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-features/the-last-of-us-season-2-craig-mazin-interview-1236169252/">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, Mazin said "<em>I am not going to go past the game. I’ll just say that flat out.</em>"</p>
<p><em>"I’m basically setting a decade of my rapidly dwindling life on fire to tell this story</em>," he continued.</p>
<p><em>"The show is so hard to make. It has to have an end. So I’m not going to go past. Who knows me, there might be a Dunk and Egg The Last of Us show that happens that somebody does. But for me, the only question is: Is it going to be one more season or will it require two more? If this can happen all in one more season, great. If we feel like it makes sense to break it into two, then we will do that.</em>"</p>
<p>After the first season of the TV series adaptation of Naughty Dog's beloved franchise covered the entirety of the first game, there have been a lot of questions regarding how quickly The Last of Us Part II's story would be covered.</p>
<p>Mazin and co-showrunner Neil Druckmann have previously commented about how the show will tell Part II's story over the course of multiple seasons, potentially even <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-show-will-have-a-shorter-season-2-but-season-3-will-be-larger-and-there-may-even-be-season-4/">needing a total of four seasons</a> to get the job done.</p>
<p>Whether it'll be four seasons or three will become clear as season two premieres, and we start to have a clearer picture of how the show is being paced out. If we're off to the races with Ellie chasing after Abby by the end of the first episode, then things might be moving fast enough to make it three.</p>
<p>In the same interview, Mazin also addressed criticism around Bella Ramsey potentially not being able to portray the darker side of Ellie that players saw in The Last of Us Part II. While Mazin admitted to understanding the trepidation viewers have, he reiterates that Ramsey's physique is not why she was chosen for the role.</p>
<p>"<em>I understand the difficulty that some people have where they say, “She looked like she was 14 in season one. She still looks roughly the same to us, even though now she’s 19.” Ellie in the game looks much older. Some people do change quite dramatically and some people don’t. I’m not interested in the physical aspect — although I’ve been looking at Bella’s face for years while editing, and I can see that she’s certainly grown. I’m interested in the emotional maturity, and the change in personality.</em>"</p>

I find city builders to be quite a stressful genre, mostly because I get freaked out as soon as my virtual bank account starts dipping into the red. Every now and then, though, one comes along that looks like it might actually be a calming time, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/synergy">Synergy</a> looks like it could fill that gap. It's been out in early access for almost a year now, but developer Leikir Studio announced today that Synergy will be leaving early access and entering 1.0 in just two weeks time on April 16th.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The announcement came with a new trailer that keeps things brief but hands over the important thing (the aforementioned release date), as well as an overall look at what the game will offer. Over on Steam, though, a few more details about what the 1.0 update will bring. First up is that there'll be a new campaign with three new scenarios to explore, though what those are, you'll have to wait and find out.

<p>
There's also new plants and buildings to work with, as well as some new challenges linked to dry seasons, alongside an exploration rework. Outside of saying "and more", the Steam post just makes note that there'll be "huge [Quality of Life] improvements you've been waiting for", but again, not specifics, so you'll probably have to check out the 1.0 patch notes whenever they drop.
</p>
<p>
For those unfamiliar with Synergy, you can probably guess just from looking at its <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/moebius">Moebius</a>-inspired stylings that it's a lot more plant and nature focused as opposed to the concrete jungles or historical encampments you might usually find in the genre. You can explore different regions, build up community, learn about its alien world. Nothing too stressful to be found here, just the way I like my sim games. You can check it out on Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1989070/Synergy/">here</a>.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6s-free-to-play-battle-royale-gamemode-has-been-datamined/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6%E2%80%99s-free-to-play-battle-royale-gamemode-has-been-datamined.1153107/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6s-free-to-play-battle-royale-gamemode-has-been-datamined/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>New leaks have revealed that Battlefield 6 will indeed have a free-to-play Battle Royale coming to the game.</p>



<p>The information originates from several different dataminers, who have been able to datamine Battlefield 6 having gained access to the files via Battlefield Labs. Last week, over <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-concept-art-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">20 concept art images of Battlefield 6 leaked</a> because of dataminers.</p>



<p>Allegedly, the datamines reveal that a Battle Royale gamemode will be coming to Battlefield 6, which was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-2025-battle-royale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previously exclusively reported by Insider Gaming</a>. </p>



<p>According to the datamines, the gamemode (which Insider Gaming understands to be in development by Ripple Effect), will have a lot of traditional features that you’d come to expect from a Battle Royale.</p>



<p>Such features include solo, duo, trio, and squad matches, an armor system, call-ins, loot rarity, update kits and weapons, and a shrinking zone. </p>



<p>Also mentioned was a “free-to-play component”, which is understood to be the core Battle Royale experience. Gauntlet, another mode that Insider Gaming reported on in the past was also mentioned and referred to in some of the game files.</p>



<p>As for if a Battlefield Battle Royale experience for Battlefield 6 can be success or not is unclear, but this time around DICE and EA seem to be doing the right thing by at least making the experience free-to-play. It’s believed such a decision was made by Byron Beede, the new General Manager of the franchise and who had been previously leading live service for Call of Duty.</p>



<p>It seems that this time around Battlefield wants to follow a similar to model of Call of Duty and Warzone, where the free-to-play experience brings in the players, with the hope that some cross progression and customization can eventually convert players into premium purchases of the full game with its campaign and multiplayer. </p>



<p>Are you looking forward to a free-to-play Battlefield Battle Royale? Let me know in the comments or on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-nintendo-switch-2-was-almost-named-%E2%80%9Csuper-nintendo-switch%E2%80%9D.1153104/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/the-nintendo-switch-2-was-almost-named-super-nintendo-switch/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>April 2 will go down in history as a monumental day for the Nintendo Switch 2. We finally got a deep insight into the console specifications and how it will perform, but I did not have the Switch 2 nearly being called the Super Nintendo Switch on my bingo card.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2 has a release date</a>, an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-officially-confirmed-at-449-99/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">eye-watering price tag</a>, and the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-games-will-cost-80-for-digital-90-for-physical/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">price of games</a> is a serious conversation to be had. The name of the Switch 2 has barely mustered a whisper, though. We all assumed it would be called the Nintendo Switch 2, it ended up being called the Nintendo Switch 2, and this very nearly wasn’t the case.</p>



<p>An interesting developer interview shows history could’ve looked very different. </p>



<h2 id="h-we-nearly-had-the-super-nintendo-switch-instead-of-the-switch-2">We Nearly Had The Super Nintendo Switch Instead of The Switch 2</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It would have been cool. Credit to Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p>A <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-16-nintendo-switch-2-part-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">special interview</a> with Nintendo developers Kouichi Kawamoto, Takuhiro Dohta, and Tetsuya Sasaki was released on the Nintendo website shortly after the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-games-announced-during-the-nintendo-switch-2-direct/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch 2 Direct</a> showcase.</p>



<p>Many questions and musings about the Switch 2’s development were posed. Topics covered include cross-platform capabilities between the Switch 1 and Switch 2, improvements in the Nintendo Switch 2, and the device’s name.</p>



<p>One interview question stood out: “However, we haven’t touched on the name yet…How did you land on the name Nintendo Switch 2?” </p>



<p>The answer was interesting: “There were a lot of ideas for the name, and we really struggled to find the right one. We even considered ideas like “Super Nintendo Switch.” However, Super NES, which came out after the NES, couldn’t play NES games. Since Switch 2 can play Switch games, it didn’t feel right to use the same naming convention as Super NES. Switch 2 is a new system with improved performance, but we’d like players who get their hands on it not to focus on the specs, but rather to think of it as the latest system developed by Nintendo.” So, in the hope that it becomes the new standard for Nintendo Switch, we named it Nintendo Switch 2,” said Kawamoto.”</p>



<p>So there you have it! The name “Super Nintendo System” was on the cards, but I question how close we were to the name. Nevertheless, it’s a cool detail and one to remember as trivia for obscure Nintendo quizzes in the future.</p>



<p>Should it have been called the Super Nintendo System? Would it have been a neat throwback to yesteryear? Let us know over at the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forum</a>.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Unlike a regular physical game cartridge, Game-Key Cards don't include game data but are instead a "key" that can be used to download and later access a particular game. The Game-Key Card is required even after that game has been downloaded and installed and is in many ways treated just like a normal game cartridge, minus the console actually running the game off it.</p><p dir="ltr">One note worth mentioning is that an internet connection is only required when booting up a Game-Key Card for the first time, after which the game can be accessed offline. However, the Game-Key Card will still need to be inserted into the Switch 2 console in order to access the digital game.</p><p dir="ltr">Games that are a Game-Key Card will be designated by a special white banner at the bottom of Switch 2 game cases, with a QR code that can be scanned for additional information. It's unclear if downloading a Game-Key Card game ties it to whatever console it's being used on, or if the Game-Key Card could be shared with a friend (or sold) and transferred to another system like a normal physical game cartridge.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4469598-0864551248-bee-gamekeycard-art-en.png" data-ref-id="1300-4469598" data-ratio="0.529" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4469598-0864551248-bee-gamekeycard-art-en.png" data-ref-id="1300-4469598"></a><figcaption>An example of a Switch 2 game case with a Game-Key Card label.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4469598-0864551248-bee-gamekeycard-art-en.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">While it's still unclear why some games are Game-Key Cards instead of a normal cartridge, we know of at least one Switch 2 launch title that will be using the feature: <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bravely-default-hd-remaster-is-a-switch-2-launch-title-will-feature-new-minigames/1100-6530569/" data-ref-id="1100-6530569">Bravely Default Flying Fairy HD Remaster</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Game-Key Cards, unless they can be sold or given to others, aren't entirely different from how Nintendo treats certain original Switch games that can be bought physically in a store but are in reality just digital download codes inside a case. Those games can also be played offline once downloaded but can't be transferred to others, with the game instead tied to that specific account.</p><p dir="ltr">Game-Key Cards are not to be confused with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-virtual-game-cards-will-let-you-share-digital-games/1100-6530424/" data-ref-id="1100-6530424">Virtual Game Cards</a>, a new system Nintendo is using for digital-only games on both the Switch and Switch 2. Virtual Game Cards are also treated as if they are physical games despite being digital, and can be shared with different accounts playing on the same Switch or members of the same Nintendo Switch family account via local wireless. Only one copy of a Virtual Game Card can be used at a time, meaning if a game is lent to a friend or family member, it will be inaccessible to the original owner, just as if they had physically let someone borrow the game. It's unclear if a game accessed via a Game-Key Card can also be used as a Virtual Game Card.</p><p dir="ltr">Nintendo has shared all kinds of new details about the Switch 2, going more in-depth with the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-will-support-hdr-4k-and-120fps/1100-6530547/" data-ref-id="1100-6530547">Switch 2 hardware and capabilities</a> as well as some of the exclusive games coming to the console.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/amazon-big-acquire-tiktok-platform/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>As the TikTok ban looms in the United States following President Trump’s extension of the shutdown, Amazon has reportedly made an eleventh-hour bid to acquire the entire platform. This news comes from the New York Times, wherein it was also revealed that <strong>nobody appears to be taking the offer seriously</strong>.</p>



<p>In recent months, a few potential buyers have been touted in the press, such as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bobby-kotick-buy-tiktok/">Bobby Kotick</a> and the owners of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kick-intends-to-buy-tiktok-us/">Kick.com</a>.</p>



<p>Could Amazon be about to acquire the biggest video-sharing platform in the world?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-last-minute-purchase">Last-Minute Purchase</h2>



<p>Amazon could be set to acquire TikTok to prevent the platform from being eradicated from the United States – and to pry it from the hands of its Chinese owners. TikTok faces a nationwide ban in America following concerns being raised regarding the inherent security of the app, given the ties it has to Beijing.</p>



<p>The recent article posted in the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/02/business/media/amazon-tiktok-bid.html?searchResultPosition=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">New York Times</a> explains that ‘parties who have been involved in the talks do not appear to be taking Amazon’s bid seriously’.</p>



<p>That might be down to how the bid has surfaced:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The bid came via an offer letter addressed to Vice President JD Vance and Howard Lutnick, the commerce secretary, according to a person briefed on the matter.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Attempts to reach ByteDance (TikTok’s owner) and Amazon have been fruitless, and nobody has any insight into how much Amazon has put forward for the acquisition or to what extent it <strong>could </strong>go ahead. </p>



<p>Amazon already owns Twitch, the premier streaming site that outclasses competing platforms like YouTube and Kick.com. If it were to acquire TikTok, it would have a dominant hold over content creators and streamers worldwide. </p>



<p>Unfortunately for Amazon, TikTok might not be for sale in the first place. In a statement released on January 18, ByteDance revealed a willingness to let TikTok go dark in the United States if the government enforced the ban.</p>



<p>Do you think Amazon buying TikTok is a shrewd move? Let me know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>If you wanted to indicate the power of the Nintendo Switch 2, look no further than this tidbit – <strong>Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition is coming to Switch 2 when it launches on June 5.</strong> The impending arrival of CDPR’s open-world epic was revealed today during the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct, stunning fans worldwide.</p>



<p>Dozens of games were revealed for the Nintendo Switch 2, including both brand-new titles and re-releases of older games, like Star Wars: Outlaws and Hogwarts Legacy.</p>



<p>Am I going to buy a Nintendo Switch 2 just to experience Cyberpunk 2077 from an all-new angle? Yes, I am.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-back-to-night-city">Back to Night City</h2>



<p>Cyberpunk 2077 is a rags-to-riches story like no other. When it debuted in 2020, it was a shambolic title that left people bewildered. It crashed in terms of reviews, fell down the charts, and came under fire from investors and shareholders.</p>



<p>Today, it’s considered one of the best open-world RPG titles ever made.</p>



<p>The turnaround is one for the history books, and although development has officially stopped on the game to facilitate the next title (and The Witcher 4), there’s one last run around the block left in the tank for Cyberpunk 2077.</p>



<p>It was revealed earlier today that Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition is coming to Nintendo Switch 2 on June 5 when the console hits the market. The Ultimate Edition is the best way to experience the game, given that it’s bundled with Phantom Liberty, a phenomenal expansion that was the first and last major piece of DLC for the game.</p>



<p>Netizens were quick to make jokes about the processing power of the Nintendo Switch, suggesting that Cyberpunk 2077 will look nothing short of laughable on the handheld console, but the new unit has a little more under the hood than the predecessor. It won’t look as good as it can on other platforms, but that’s the sacrifice you make for the convenience of gaming on the go.</p>



<p>Do you plan on buying Cyberpunk 2077 on Nintendo Switch 2? Let me know in the comments, or hit up the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
