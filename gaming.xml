            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/661290/fortnite-ios-iphone-epic-games-back-apple-app-store<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Fortnite</em> is once again available on the iOS App Store in the US, <a href="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/1924949632628523199">according to Epic Games</a>. You can get it from <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fortnite/id6483539426">the App Store here</a>. Epic says it has returned to the Epic Games Store and AltStore as well.</p><p>Apple kicked <em>Fortnite</em> off the App Store <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366438/apple-fortnite-ios-app-store-violations-epic-payments">nearly five years ago</a> after Epic Games added its own in-app payment system to the game, which violated Apple’s rules. But after a major court ruling in <em>Epic Games v. Apple</em> that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/659246/apple-epic-app-store-judge-ruling-control">forced Apple</a> to not take fees from purchases made outside of apps, the game is available to play on US iPhones once again.</p><p>Shortly after the big ruling hit, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/659271/fortnite-ios-apple-app-store-us-return">CEO Tim Sweeney said</a> that Epic planned to bring back <em>Fortnite</em> to iOS in the US. He also made a “peace proposal:” “If Apple extends the court’s friction-free, Apple-tax-free framework worldwide, we’ll return <em>Fortnite</em> to the App Store worldwide and drop current and future litigation on the topic.“</p><div><p>On May 9th, it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/664245/epic-submitted-fortnite-to-apple">submitted the app to Apple</a>. Ahead of that, Sweeney said that Epic would use <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/661237/epic-games-fortnite-apple-us-ios-app-store-eu-account">its Sweden developer account</a> to submit the game to the US App Store.</p></div><p>Late last week, Epic said that Apple had blocked <em>Fortnite’s</em> return to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/668232/fortnite-ios-unavailable-worldwide-apple-epic">the App Store</a>, and the game also became unavailable on other alternative app stores in the EU. However, Apple said that it had “asked that Epic Sweden resubmit the app update without including the US storefront of the App Store so as not to impact <em>Fortnite</em> in other geographies” and that “we did not take any action to remove the live version of <em>Fortnite</em> from alternative distribution marketplaces.”</p><p>Epic asked the judge in the <em>Epic v. Apple</em> case to order Apple to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/669047/epic-fortnite-filing-apple-app-store-review-order">review its <em>Fortnite</em> submission</a> on May 16th. Yesterday, the judge said <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/669676/apple-is-fully-capable-of-resolving-this-issue-without-further-briefing-or-a-hearing">in a filing</a> that Apple is “fully capable of resolving this issue without further briefing or a hearing,” and that if a resolution wasn’t reached, the Apple official who “is personally responsible for ensuring compliance” would have to appear at a hearing next Tuesday.</p><p>However, shortly after <em>Fortnite</em> returned to the App Store on Tuesday, Epic and Apple filed a joint notice saying that they have “resolved all issues” from Epic’s May 16th filing. Apple didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.</p><p>Epic also recently rolled out a new promotion to encourage players to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/659655/epic-games-store-revenue-share-webshops-apple-in-app-purchases">use its payment systems</a>: if you use Epic’s system in <em>Fortnite</em>, <em>Rocket League</em>, or <em>Fall Guys</em> on PC, iOS, Android, and the web, the company will give you 20 percent back in Epic Rewards that can be used for other purchases in its games or on the Epic Games Store.</p><p>In the iOS version of <em>Fortnite</em> that was released on Tuesday, the app shows you that 20 percent bonus when you pick which payment system you want to use to buy V-Bucks.</p><div><p>The company launched a new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/659347/fortnite-star-wars-galactic-battle-season-battle-pass"><em>Star Wars</em>-themed season</a> for <em>Fortnite</em> on May 2nd.</p></div><p>If you get the app from the App Store, it will be a small initial download, and after you actually open the app, it will download the rest of the game. For a colleague, that additional download was 12.95GB.</p><p><em><strong>Update, May 20th</strong>: Added details of Epic and Apple’s joint notice.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>When two things rub together, they create friction, and friction slows things down and creates wear. That includes not just things like analog sticks, but the keyswitches in our keyboards, too. Cherry, the German company that sets the standard for keyswitch quality and consistency, is offering their own answer to those problems with <a href="https://www.cherry.de/en-gb/company/news/press/article/cherry-leads-the-revolution-from-mechanical-to-smart-switches" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">some of their latest keyswitches</a>, announced this at this year's Computex computing convention, held yearly in Taipei, Taiwan.</p><p>One of the most common (and annoying) ways we see frictional wear as gamers analog stick drift, which occurs when the potentiometers beneath your analog sticks begin to wear out or get debris caught in them. Cherry has two of their own switches that look to prevent this issue, the MK and IK switches. Cherry name is so synonymous with their MX switches that you might think the company's name is Cherry MX, but these two switches help prove otherwise.</p><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4498373-ik1a-11lb_image002.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4498374-mx2a-hcad_image002.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4498375-mx2a-j1nb_image005.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4498376-mx2a-lc9d_image012.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4498377-unnamed%2821%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4498373,1300-4498374,1300-4498375,1300-4498376,1300-4498377" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1603/16030002/4498373-ik1a-11lb_image002.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1603/16030002/4498374-mx2a-hcad_image002.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1603/16030002/4498375-mx2a-j1nb_image005.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1603/16030002/4498376-mx2a-lc9d_image012.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1603/16030002/4498377-unnamed%2821%29.png"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4498373-ik1a-11lb_image002.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4498374-mx2a-hcad_image002.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4498375-mx2a-j1nb_image005.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4498376-mx2a-lc9d_image012.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4498377-unnamed%2821%29.png"></figure><p>Cherry showed off a preview of the MK magnetic switches at the show. They don't have a release window for these just yet, but they're in the works. Magnetic switches promise to offer "frictionless speed and gaming grade precision," according to Cherry. With these just in preview, they didn't have more more to say.</p><p>More imminent are the IK Series of inductive keyswitches, which the company says will release in Fall of 2025. These switches work on a similar principle to Hall Effect switches, but with Cherry's own patented design, which they say consumes 5% of the power required for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-dualsense-hall-effect-stick-replacements-now-available/1100-6528320/" data-ref-id="1100-6528320">Hall Effect switches</a> (and 50% of the power as compared to the aforementioned MK magnetic switches). According to Cherry, the IK switches feature "a robust, magnet- free metal-based design for enhanced reliability, analog precision, and long-term stability." This is coupled with "enhanced RGB lighting, customizable actuation, and ultra-low power usage."</p><p>However, if you prefer the traditional physical MX switch series--don't worry. Cherry still has you covered with three new switch offerings: MX Honey, MX Blossom, and MX Falcon.</p><p>The Honey switches are silent, tactile switches, meant to give the user the satisfying feedback of a tactile switch without the clicky-clack of traditional tactile switches. The MX Blossom switches, meanwhile, are the lightest linear mechanical switches the company has offered yet, with an actuation force of just 35 centinewtons (cN). For comparison, many of Cherry's other MX switches require between 60-70 cN, with others as low as 45 cN. So these switches are light and quiet. Finally, the MX Falcon switches are for heavy typists who want "bold feedback and a satisfying tactile punch," which the company says was inspired by the "crisp snap of typewriters." Even the look of the switch--which you won't see after installation unless you pull off the keycaps--was inspired by '90s retro design,' with a PC-beige-and-black housing and orange key stem.</p><p>These new MX switches will be available next month, with 36-switch consumer sets to follow a bit later.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/onimusha-2-samurais-destiny-review-jubeis-bizarre-adventure<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Repeat after me: Remasters are important. They allow for longtime fans to re-engage with a piece of media they love. Remasters also open the door for a whole new crowd to experience something for the first time. I'm in the latter with the remaster of <em>Onimusha 2: Samurai's Destiny</em>, and I'm very glad to have the chance to play this beloved series.</p>

<p>Beloved, indeed. The <em>Onimusha</em> series may not be as popular as <a href="https://techraptor.net/companies/capcom" rel="nofollow">Capcom's</a> larger franchises, but it's still revered by fans across the globe.&nbsp;This action-oriented series takes elements from the <a href="https://techraptor.net/series/resident-evil" rel="nofollow"><em>Resident Evil</em></a> franchise and makes it a faster-paced, Sengoku-era adventure as we step into the role of Jubei, a samurai hell-bent on revenge against a demonic Oda Nobunaga.</p>

Not anymore.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Onimusha 2: Samurai's Destiny </em>Gets the Remaster Treatment</h2>

<p>I enjoyed <em>Onimusha 2: Samurai</em>'s <em>Destiny </em>so much that I went back and played the original almost immediately after. Admittedly, I should have played the first game in the series, well, <em>first</em>, but the upcoming <em>Onimusha</em> inspired me to jump into the series in whatever way I could.</p>

<p><em>Onimusha 2</em> is a delightful remaster that contains almost everything you'd want to see: Enhanced visuals, support for modern platforms, and quality-of-life updates. In terms of visual fidelity, <em>Onimusha 2</em> does a lot to remaster the graphics of this nearly 25-year-old PS2 game.</p>

<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/761600/Onimusha_Warlords/" rel="nofollow"><em>Onimusha: Warlords</em></a>, the original game in the series from 2001, received a remaster in 2019. It's more or less the same age as its sequel, yet the remastered visuals in the original aren't quite up to snuff when you compare the two.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/onimusha-2-visuals-1.jpg?itok=WdOebxNl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/onimusha-2-visuals-1.jpg?itok=HQca-n1h 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This game oozes with style.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Onimusha 2</em>'s<em> </em>enhanced visuals are crystal clear. The backgrounds are exceptionally well done, breathing new life into an aging title. Textures look wonderful on higher resolutions. The various Japanese castles, dense forests, and supernatural, demonic environments are very well done here. Having a fixed camera assures that every angle looks quite spectacular.</p>

<p>The only thing it's missing is support for higher frame rates, but like its predecessor, it's locked to 60 FPS. It's not the end of the world, but it would have been nice to see. Other than that, the remaster ran flawlessly on PC.</p>

<p>In terms of controls, <em>Onimusha 2</em> translates well over to modern controllers. I like the option of using the d-pad for tank controls (as it was in the base version), but using a joystick is a much-needed and welcome quality-of-life improvement.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/story-paths-onimusha-2.jpg?itok=kJGpfbL6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/story-paths-onimusha-2.jpg?itok=Ffo22YUE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Upon beating the game, you can see where your relationship with certain characters impacted the flow of the story.</figcaption></figure><p>One additional quality-of-life feature, which wasn't in the remaster of the first game nor in the original version of this title, is auto-save. There are fixed save points, like <em>Resident Evil</em>'s typewriters, so with the new auto-save, if you have a power outage or just have to go at any given moment, you won't lose as much progress.</p>

<p>What <em>isn't</em> included that I would have enjoyed, other than support for higher frame rates, is New Game +. The story is structured in such a way that you have branching paths. Going back and filling in the blanks in order to see the whole story this game has to offer, well, you'll just have to start from square one. That means all your upgrades are for naught if you start a new game.</p>

<p>The intended course of action after beating the campaign is to up the difficulty -- and there is a new, brutal difficulty called Hell Mode, here -- but I'd much rather have an easier way of seeing all the story while retaining my health, magic, armor, and weapon upgrades from previous runs.</p>

<p>Since we're on the topic of story, let's talk about <em>just </em>how insane this game is. If you thought <em>Resident Evil</em> was campy, you ain't seen nothin' yet. <em>Onimusha 2</em> is so unabashedly goofy that it makes Chris Redfield punching a boulder look serious.</p>

<p>It's the translation and dub that make it what it is. It's not a quality translation, from what I've heard, and the voice acting is so bad that it becomes good. Jubei's dude-bro voice and just how nonchalant he is, despite going through literal hell to get his revenge, is endearing.</p>

<p>The downside to all of this is, if you're looking for a serious, Sengoku-era action flick, this isn't it. It's weird, it's zany, and the story is practically non-existent. The best way to enjoy it is by relishing in the weirdness and appreciating it for what it is, rather than what it isn't. I'll leave it at that. Go in blind, and you'll have a blast.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/onimusha-2-gameplay-3.jpg?itok=5jK9A7h1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/onimusha-2-gameplay-3.jpg?itok=d4PYz8pr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Don't mess with Jubei!</figcaption></figure><h2>Sengoku Swordplay, with Magic!</h2>

<p>For whatever reason, I was operating under the assumption that <em>Onimusha 2</em> played more like a <em>Devil May Cry</em> or <em>Ninja Gaiden</em> game. I was pleased to find it's more akin to <em>Resident Evil</em> than anything else, and that <em>Onimusha </em>deliberately borrowed many elements from it.</p>

<p>Fixed camera angles, limited resources, light puzzle solving, and more. If you like the older <em>Resident Evil</em> games, you'll definitely enjoy this. <em>Onimusha 2</em> is, however, more fast-paced with hack-and-slash combat, meaning you <em>don't</em> have to figure out whether you should conserve bullets or not; well, for the most part.</p>

<p>There are four separate weapons in this game, each behaving differently from one another. There's a sword, spear, double-blade, and a giant hammer. They have an element attached to them and have separate magic attacks. Being able to switch these on the fly makes combat smooth, and magic packs a much-needed punch on stronger enemies and bosses.</p>

They have their own set of moves.</figcaption></figure><p>You also have a bow and rifle, which won't be used as much since they have limited ammo. The main source of damage is through your melee weapons,&nbsp;though, and don't you forget it: This isn't <em>Resident Evil!</em></p>

<p>Enemy corpses drop souls, which you can absorb through your hand. These orbs are used to upgrade weapons and armor to become stronger, so there's a decent amount of progression available throughout the story. Some orbs also heal or regain your mana, so using this in the middle of combat when a bunch of foes surround you can be a bit tense.</p>

The Issen is a counter to enemy attacks. Right before they hit, Jubei can counter by doing a critical strike.</p>

<p>For many enemies, the Issen kills them in one hit or, at the very least, depletes their health by a <em>lot</em>. Getting the timing of this system down is very tricky and takes practice, as each enemy attack has different timings. Deliberately waiting for an enemy to strike, then countering with one powerful hit, is immensely satisfying.</p>

<p>Overall, combat is fun, but it's also a product of its time. The enemy variety isn't too impressive, and they also spawn to an absurd degree. Like a hydra head, cut one down, and two more will pop up.&nbsp;The original <em>Onimusha </em>got it down with enemy variety, as it wasn't overwhelming but still enough to be a challenge. <em>Ominusha 2</em> is relentless. Chill out, Nobunaga.</p>

<p>Well, Capcom, you can count me in as an <em>Onimusha </em>fan. With the next entry in the series dropping in, hopefully, 2026, I'll be very interested to see how Capcom modernizes the series' formula. And hey, it wouldn't hurt to have the third or fourth game remastered, too. Just sayin'!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/skyfall-rpg-comes-to-us-via-kickstarter-campaign<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The <em>Skyfall RPG</em> setting is coming to <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a> 2024</em>. The beloved setting, originally only available in Portuguese, will be coming to an international audience courtesy of a Kickstarter campaign. The setting will include brand-new magitech-based player options.</p>

<h2>The <em>Skyfall RPG</em> Setting Kickstarter Campaign</h2>

<p>According to its official Kickstarter page, <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/skyfallrpg/skyfall-5e-a-world-destined-to-end" rel="nofollow"><em>Skyfall RPG</em></a> was created by Capycat Games' CEO Silvia Sala. It has an established community of passionate fans in Brazil. Now, thanks to a partnership with Knight Moves Cafe, this Kickstarter is localizing Skyfall to an international English-speaking audience. This includes physical and digital books alongside official VTT support via Roll20 and Foundry.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/skyfall-rpg-giant-moth-monster-artwork.jpg?itok=VQuB4_np 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/skyfall-rpg-giant-moth-monster-artwork.jpg?itok=C89Abvn8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><em>Skyfall RPG</em> depicts the world of Opath. It is a land haunted by titular skyfalls: gigantic islands plummeting from the sky as if thrown by vengeful gods. The devastation caused by these skyfalls has led to a fractured world — a world whose people whisper of a prophesied cataclysm that will end all life as they know it.</p>

<p>But hope still thrives in Opath thanks to the discovery of a rare and volatile mineral called Aetherium. This mineral pulses with arcane power, giving rise to Aetherpunk: a blend of sorcery and invention. For those brave or desperate enough to utilize Aetherpunk gadgets, impossible machines can be made to reshape the world.</p>

<p>Between the fear of annihilation and the hope of Aether, the world of <em>Skyfall RPG</em> contains so much more. Alliances forged and broken in pursuit of power. Goddesses and Titans walking among mortals. An entity known as The Shade tempts people into deals for their mortal souls. The world is on the brink, and the question still lies: will you rise or be forgotten?</p>

The setting is (thanks to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/wizards-of-coast-releasing-updated-dungeons-dragons-2024-srd-at-end-of-month" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">new SRD</a>) based on the <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> 2024 ruleset and contains new Aetherpunk-based subclasses, four new playable species, new magitech equipment, including Bluster firearms, and over 40 unique monster statblocks.</p>

<p>The subclasses found in the book help bring a magitech twist to certain <em>D&amp;D</em> classes. For example, the Path of Augmentation Barbarians enhance their bodies with Aetherpunk enhancements, turning them into juggernauts. In addition, there is the Blustermage Wizard, a master of the arcane arts who also went to the magical gun firing range.</p>

<p>The four playable species also have their novelty. The Anuri are frogfolk descended from the royal swamp dynasties of Blurgh'ta. Drakelings are small metallic dragonkin dedicated to protecting the land. Sanguir are cursed nobles with vampiric heritages. Lastly, there are the Urodel, small lizard creatures tied to the changing of the seasons.</p>

<p>The pledge tiers for <em>Skyfall RPG</em> are as follows:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Digital Doomsayer for $25:</strong> A PDF of the campaign setting book, a Kickstarter exclusive prewritten adventure, access to playtests and weekly adventures, and your name in a Special Thanks in the books' credits.</li>
	<li><strong>Magitech Hero for $50:</strong> Everything in the <em>Digital Doomsayer</em> pledge, a physical copy of the book, and digital maps for a hexcrawl adventure.</li>
	<li><strong>Opath Techblade for $210:</strong> Everything in the <em>Magitech Hero</em> tier, physical and digital hexcrawl adventure maps, a DM screen, a hardslip case, physical campaign maps, character sheets, stickers, an exclusive soundtrack, and VTT access on Roll20 and Foundry.</li>
</ul><p>Lastly, the Kickstarter campaign addresses the overhanging issues of the imposed US trade tariffs. It states that, since the campaign doesn't include miniatures or dice, the products produced will be "paper only," <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/ttrpg-books-might-be-exempt-from-us-trade-tariffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">dodging increased import</a> costs.</p>

<p>At time of writing, the <em>Skyfall RPG</em> Kickstarter campaign has only made small steps, raising $320 of its $20,000 initial goal. The campaign concludes June 19.</p>

        <p>It's unclear why Patel left the studio</p>

            <p>
Whether or not we'll be getting any more <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/avowed">Avowed</a> somewhere along the line is still very much up in the air. But if we do, it seems it won't be under the leadership of Carrie Patel. In a quick post Patel shared on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/carrie-patel-80003aa_im-happy-to-share-that-im-starting-a-new-activity-7330425052565307393-bTzY/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAABpdx_8Bp2SwTs04t6viV8z8sBm7M5FTm_w">LinkedIn</a>, the game developer shared that she's "starting a new position as game director" at the team behind <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/oxenfree">Oxenfree</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/night-school-studio">Night School Studio</a>. Patel mentioned literally zero details outside of what her new role is, so it's not even clear why she left <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/obsidian-entertainment">Obsidian</a>. 
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
This'll likely have been in the works for a little while, as Night School were <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/night-school-studio_were-hiring-we-are-adding-a-few-new-folks-activity-7307830962854248448-9Pm_?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAABpdx_8Bp2SwTs04t6viV8z8sBm7M5FTm_w">specifically looking for a game director in March</a>. As a reminder, Avowed only came out this February. It also paints a slightly confusing picture for Night School themself. Earlier this year it was reported that an <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/netflix-has-laid-off-staff-at-oxenfree-developer-night-school-studio">unspecified number of workers were being laid off</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Things have been a bit quiet at the developer since they released Oxenfree 2: Lost Signals back in 2023, having not made anything original since then either. They did make a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/black-mirror">Black Mirror</a> tie-in game called <a href="https://x.com/nightschoolers/status/1910396546774127091">Thronglets</a>, a game featured in the most recent season of the anthology show (in case you forgot, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/netflix-have-bought-the-developers-of-oxenfree">Netflix bought the studio way back in 2021</a>).
</p>
<p>
Here's hoping Patel and co. get to make something original again. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/netflix">Netflix's</a> approach to gaming has been a bit all over the place, ranging from mobile titles, to AAA, but none of it has worked in the way the streamer has found success with film and TV. Their main AAA studio, Team Blue, which included <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a>, Halo, and God of War talent, was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/netflixs-team-blue-of-halo-overwatch-and-god-of-war-vets-close-without-a-single-game-to-their-name">shut down last year</a>, so more than anything I hope the same fate doesn't await Night School anywhere down the line.

So whether they’re aiming to snag single boosters or entire boxes, more people should have more shots at getting what they came for. It should also disincentive scalpers from swamping stores on days that new packs come out.</p><p>“Finally!” responded one person on Instagram. “I just saw a scalper fall to his knees at GameStop,” wrote another. Many were disappointed the change didn’t come sooner. “If only this rule was applied when the Prismatic Super Premium Collection dropped, I would have been able to get one,” another person wrote. Many locations had been giving out two per customer for Prismatic, even though stores were getting as few as 10 boxes in total. </p><p>Adding to some of the confusion has been a burgeoning ecosystem of communities and apps like Popfindr that help people track which stores are getting new stock for which sets when. Like whiskey nerds waiting outside liquor stores on small batch delivery days, some GameStop employees have noticed customers coming in asking them about store shipments they weren’t even aware of. “This app that people are using to get our inventory is actually starting to piss me off,” one GameStop employee <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/1kimvqr/exhausted_of_tcg/?share_id=flq9LrVDsRcJLimE6qh8T&amp;utm_content=1&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/1kimvqr/exhausted_of_tcg/?share_id=flq9LrVDsRcJLimE6qh8T&amp;utm_content=1&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote on Reddit</a></span>. “Is anyone experiencing that at all? People have updates of when we get our shipment and it’s weird. I’ve had numerous phone calls and people coming in store telling me I received a shipment with quantity amounts. It’s frustrating.”<br></p><p>Despite the lowkey chaos, GameStop has only doubled down on the Pokémon TCG market since it announced it would start grading and reselling cards last year. Some stores have become “takeover stores” where walls that used to be lined with games, Funko Pops, or other collectibles have been completely given over to displaying <em>Pokémon</em> TCG packs, only for them to get completely wiped out just days later. Once a bystander in that boom-bust cycle, GameStop now stands to profit off the hype of people reselling valuable cards. </p><p>“As a card collector myself, I hate what the hobby has turned into and frankly, I wouldn’t even feel upset if GS stops selling TCG because there are just so many bad apples that ruin it for everyone,,” one fan commented on Reddit. “Like it is totally NOT OK for vendors and restockers to have to worry about being stalked because a scalper air tagged their car. It sucks that to even have a chance in getting cards for the hobby, you pretty much need to camp ahead of release day.”</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Mike Pondsmith, the creator of the Cyberpunk tabletop RPG that formed the basis of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, has been discussing CD Projekt's in-development sequel, saying it'll feature second city that feels like "Chicago gone wrong".
</p>
<p>
CD Projekt <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekt-red-announces-cyberpunk-2077-sequel-future-witcher-projects-outlined">confirmed a Cyberpunk 2077 sequel was in the works</a> back in 2022, and only a scant few details have been shared since then. We know it's currently being referred to by the codename Project Orion, for instance, that it's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077-team-relocating-to-boston-for-sequel">being developed by CD Projekt's Boston and Vancouver studios</a>, and... well, that's about it.
</p>
<p>
Pondsmith, though, has now provided what might just be the first tangible details of CD Projekt's Cyberpunk 2077 sequel. Speaking to TVGRY during this year's Digital Dragons Conference in Krakow, he <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cthec500Ofo">explained</a> that while he's "not as involved directly" with Project Orion as he was its predecessor, he still sees the scripts and has been visiting its development studio.

"Last week," he revealed, "I was wandering around talking to different departments and seeing what they had... I spent a lot of time talking to one of the environment guys, and he was explaining how the new place in Orion... because there's another city we visit, and I'm not telling you anymore than that."
</p>
<p>
Luckily for everyone (except, perhaps, CD Projekt, which seems unlikely to have sanctioned any of these reveals), Pondsmith <em>did</em> share a little more. First, he confirmed "Night City is still there" alongside this second location, before teasing how Project Orion's two cities will differentiate themselves. "I remember looking at [the new location] and going, 'Yeah, I understand the feel that you're going for, and this really does work. It doesn't feel like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/blade-runner">Blade Runner</a>, it feels more like Chicago gone wrong'. And I said, 'Yeah, I can see this working.'"
</p>
<p>
Interestingly, while Pondsmith only suggested Project Orion's second location was <em>like</em> Chicago, fans have long speculated the actual city of Chicago will play a key role in CD Projekt's sequel. As explained in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/17jz77f/chicago_might_be_one_of_the_new_locations_in_the/">fairly comprehensive post on the Cyberpunk subreddit</a>, the in-universe version of Chicago has struggled through both an economic collapse, a corporate war, and a bio-plague - so "gone wrong" would very much apply here. Additionally, Cyberpunk 2077's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty">Phantom Liberty</a> expansion features a possible ending that can nudge players several years forward in the timeline, after which the Transcontinental Maglev Network project referenced in the base game - one linking Night City with Chicago - is revealed to be complete.
</p>
<p>
It's certainly a compelling theory, especially given Pondsmith's latest chatter, but there's obviously no guarantee any of this will make it through the years of development required to turn Project Orion - which is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekt-shares-witcher-and-cyberpunk-project-updates-announces-partnership-with-mobile-developer-scopely">currently in the pre-production phase</a> - into a complete and released game. That won't happen until sometime after <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a>'s still-nebulous launch window - but at least that leaves plenty of time to wrap up the original Cyberpunk 2077, which will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077-is-a-switch-2-launch-title">soon be making its Nintendo debut on Switch 2</a>.

He’s starred in huge movies and franchises. He’s pulled off some of the most amazing stunts ever performed on film. And he’s become Hollywood’s ambassador of Going To The Movies.

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/cd-projekt-red">CD Projekt Red's</a> sequel to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> is mostly a bit of a mystery, and it likely will be for a while yet given that they're currently full steam ahead on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a>. We know Anna Megill, who worked on Control and the upcoming Fable game, is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fable-and-control-writer-joins-cyberpunk-2077-sequel">attached as lead writer</a>, and that the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cd-project-devs-want-to-call-out-big-problems-like-homelessness-and-the-wealth-gap-in-cyberpunk-2077-sequel">team wants to deal with some big topics</a>, but there's been nothing like plot details shared so far. At the very least, Cyberpunk creator Mike Pondsmith shared some tidbits about it at Digital Dragons, namely to do with the game's map.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Pondsmith explained that with the sequel, he's "not as involved directly," but he does get to look at the scripts of the game. "Last week I was wandering around talking to different departments, and seeing what they had, ‘Oh look, this is the new cyberware, what do you think?’ ‘Oh yeah, that’s pretty good, that works here.’"

<p>
In terms of things he shared about the game itself, Pondsmith explained that he "spent a lot of time talking to one of the environment guys, and he was explaining how the new place… because there’s another city that we visit, and I’m not telling you anymore than that, but there’s another city that we visit. Night City is still there." He went on to say, "I remember looking at it and going, ‘I understand the feel that you’re going for, and this really does work, it doesn’t feel like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/blade-runner">Blade Runner</a>, it feels more like Chicago gone wrong’. And I said, ‘yeah, I can see this working’."
</p>
<p>
I'm going to assume that he probably isn't even meant to say as much as he's said here, but he's also the literal creator of the world of Cyberpunk, I think we can cut him some slack.
</p>
<p>
Based on Pondsmith's comments, we'll be able to roam around Night City once more alongside this new, Chicago-like city. Smart thinking, honestly. I know people complained about how Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom just used the same map again, but if you ask me it expanded and changed it in some pretty interesting ways. 
</p>
<p>
The Yakuza series repeatedly used the same locations too, not only working well as asset flips, but as a narrative tool too. I don't even like Cyberpunk 2077 all that much, but I'd still be curious to see how Night City changes between games. I'm sure we'll get some idea of what the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> will be like in, hmm, at least seven years? Yeah, that sounds about right.

According to developer Koei Tecmo, the game will also delve further into the lore and characters from this mysterious time period.</p><p>"This game takes place during the Imprisoning War, which is shown in fragments in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom," Koei Tecmo's Yosuke Hayashi said during Nintendo's latest Creator's Voice video. "In this Hyrule Warriors game, you'll see how the people of Hyrule contended with the threat of the original Ganondorf."</p><p>Though the war is the focal point of the story, Age of Imprisonment will also offer a deeper look at Hyrule itself. "As a story that you can only fully experience here, it doesn't just depict the battles of the Imprisoning War via a Warriors game. It also shows life in the kingdom of Hyrule after Princess Zelda is sent back in time," Koei Tecmo producer Ryota Matsushita explained.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jT8ojj0HrzA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jT8ojj0HrzA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Moreover, the game will shed light on some mysterious characters from this time period. As previously confirmed, King Rauru and Mineru will both be playable characters, but Matsushita teases that players will "also get to know the four masked sages from The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom."</p><p>Like previous Warriors games, Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment is a large-scale action game that pits players against hundreds of enemies at a time, with more appearing on the battlefield than before thanks to Switch 2's added horsepower. "Nintendo Switch 2 has made it possible to include lots of enemies in our Warriors games," Matsushita explained.</p><p>"At the same time, it was also important that you could play with higher frame rates than the Nintendo Switch system. We were able to achieve that with this game," Hayashi added.</p><p>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment is slated to arrive "this winter," while the Switch 2 itself will launch on June 5 for $450. Nintendo is also offering a limited-time Mario Kart World bundle for $500, but this will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-world-switch-2-bundle-will-be-discontinued-this-fall/1100-6530950/" data-ref-id="1100-6530950">only be available through Fall 2025</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/going-rogue-galactic-andor-star-wars-rogue-one-tabletop<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Weeks ago, I found myself playing revolutionary over Discord. I was playing Choli, a Charli XCX-esque spy running a nightclub wrapped in layers of gregariousness so that no one would suspect her. What I would be roleplaying that night was the final night of her life.</p><p>I was playing <em>Going Rogue</em>, a companion for the tabletop roleplaying game <em>Galactic</em>, which is inspired by the <em>Star Wars</em> universe. I had been invited to play by the game’s designer, Jess Levine, who had previously asked me to write a piece of fiction as a setting supplement for the game’s physical edition, <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/galacticgoingrogue/galactic-and-going-rogue-two-ttrpgs-of-war-among-the-stars?ref=echmoi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which is being Kickstarted right now</a>. <em>Going Rogue</em> intrigued me specifically because it was inspired by <em>Rogue One</em> and <em>Andor</em>—in particular,<em> Going Rogue</em> has a mechanic baked into the game where your character is more or less guaranteed to go out in a blaze of glory for the cause.</p><p>“<em>Going Rogue</em> is a game where your characters are fated to die at the end,” Jess told me over a Discord call. “That was one of the things that I wanted from the very beginning, because I was having those feelings, like, was any of this work that we did worth it?”</p><p>Jess first started developing this game during the first Trump administration and the protests for George Floyd. In her experience as a political organizer, she often felt the absence of the kind of catharsis you might get while watching a movie like <em>Rogue One</em>. In a fictional setting, you can know for sure that a character’s sacrifice has been worth it. In real life, you never really know if you’re planting the seeds of trees whose shade you’ll never sit in, or just digging yourself a big hole.</p><figure></figure><p>“With <em>Going Rogue</em>, I was having the emotional struggle of like, was this worth it? And so what I wanted in the design of the game was that I could feel the catharsis, the bleed,” she said.&nbsp;</p><p>She explained that “bleed” is a tabletop gaming term for when “you experienc[e] the emotions of your characters, and it bleed[s] out into real life. I wanted to design the game in a way that, as your character realized that they were willing to voluntarily sacrifice their life for this, you were narratively guaranteed by the mechanics that that sacrifice was worth it. You get to see, after they die, how it transforms the galaxy. I wanted you to get that feeling because you don't get that certainty in real life.”</p><p>Levine says that she knows that there are limits to the kind of change one can effect by designing a left wing tabletop roleplaying game. She didn’t make this game to convince anyone to become a socialist, but instead to create an emotional tool that serves as a mirror for the players’ own feelings about what it means to devote your life to a political cause.</p><p>“<em>Going Rogue</em> asks you to design your character, design your world, what you see in it, what you want and what you are struggling with in participation in the struggle, and you feel feelings that you are feeling outside of <em>Going Rogue</em>,” Levine said. “For people who aren't already organizers, it's a fun game, a game that lets them play in some cool themes.”</p><p>Like Levine, I am a huge fan of <em>Star Wars</em>. As every <em>Star Wars</em> fan knows, being a <em>Star Wars</em> fan means you hate <em>Star Wars</em> as much as you love it. <em>Going Rogue</em> was also a way for Levine to work out her issues with the series that inspired these games.</p><p>“You can reskin <em>Going Rogue</em> to be all the original stuff [from <em>Star Wars</em>]. I prefer, at this point, to play it not in canon <em>Star Wars</em>,” Levine said. “And also, there are things I hate about canon <em>Star Wars</em>. I think it sucks that the Jedi are child kidnapping, sexless acetics!”</p><p>In particular <em>Going Rogue</em> is a remix of <em>Rogue One</em>, which depicts the lives of a group of rebel agents who give their lives for the rebellion before the original trilogy.</p><p>“I love <em>Rogue One</em> and I hate <em>Rogue One</em>,” Levine said. “I was just watching that movie and like, watching that conflict happen in these meetings Mon Mothma and everyone else, and I was like, ‘This is what I'm going through in the organizing spaces I'm in right now.’ And that's super compelling.”</p><figure><blockquote><p><em>Going Rogue</em> aims to do more than just allow players to 'fix' <em>Star Wars</em>’s narrative problems.</p></blockquote></figure><p>In playing <em>Going Rogue</em>, you assemble a group of characters who don’t all agree with each other, or maybe have nothing in common with each other than their commitment to the rebellion against a fascist dictatorship. When I was developing Choli in the playsession that Levine invited me to, I was thinking about how to create a character who would deliberately push people’s boundaries and invite friction into conversations. This galactic party girl was someone who was brutal and ruthless, hiding her ability to manipulate and coax information out of people behind charm and opulence. I envisioned her as someone who feels self righteous about how much she has given to the cause, inviting the ire of people who put themselves in physical danger.&nbsp;</p><p>This is basically the kind of character that I wish was in a <em>Star Wars</em> story, but doesn’t ever appear. For Levine, <em>Going Rogue</em> was partially an exercise in fixing the things about <em>Rogue One</em> and <em>Star Wars</em> in general that bother her—especially <em>Rogue One</em>’s lead character, Jyn Erso.</p><p>“Jyn is a terrible character,” Levine said. “This is, from what I can tell, because of a series of rewrites. In the original version of <em>Rogue One</em>, she is a rebel from the beginning and is very committed. And when Gilroy came in, he wrote this character who is more ‘I'm cynical and jaded, and they're forcing me to be here,’ but you end up with a mishmash.”</p><p>Levine said that one of the playbooks for <em>Going Rogue</em> is based on the Gilroy version of the character: the Leveraged.</p><p>“Leverage is defined by the fact that someone is forcing them to be here,” she said. “They are being leveraged, but they have something in their heart, and you get to choose during character creation, what it is that challenges even their cynicism.”</p><p>It doesn’t escape Levine’s notice that this is, essentially, the story of Cassian Andor, lead character of the acclaimed Disney+ series <em>Andor</em>, which has just finished its second and final season. Levine said that she thinks that the <em>Andor</em> show made good on the promise of Jyn Erso’s arc, showing how someone can go from being blackmailed into a cause to being so committed that he ends up giving his life for it.</p><figure></figure><p>But <em>Going Rogue</em> aims to do more than just allow players to “fix” <em>Star Wars</em>’s narrative problems. It also allows players to explore this narrative of rebellion without having to interface with an evil entertainment empire: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/22/opinion/andor-star-wars-leftist-radical.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Disney</a>.</p><p>“I put this whole crowdfunder together in five months because Disney announced that <em>Andor</em> season two was premiering April 22 and [<em>Galactic </em>creator Riley Rethal] and I had always been like, it would probably be good for us, from a business perspective, to release the physical edition around <em>Andor</em>,” Levine said. “So I start putting it together in late December, early January, and then Riley messages me and goes, ‘Did you see that Disney+ is now on the BDS list?’”</p><p>Currently, Disney+ is a priority target on the <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-bds-games-journalism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BDS boycott list</a>, which asks supporters of the rights of Palestinians to economically and culturally divest from Israel. Disney+ is a priority target because of Marvel’s <em>Captain America: Brave New World</em> and Disney’s <em>Snow White</em>.</p><p>“[These movies] star actors Shira Haas and Gal Gadot, respectively, that have consciously and irrefutably taken up roles as cultural ambassadors for Israel, directly representing genocidal Israel’s propaganda efforts,” the statement on the <a href="https://bdsmovement.net/Guide-to-BDS-Boycott" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BDS website</a> reads. “For <em>Captain America</em>, Marvel and Disney are reviving the racist character of Ruth Bat-Seraph, whose decades-old backstory includes working for Mossad. Disney+ is therefore clearly implicated in enabling Israel’s genocide by<a href="https://variety.com/2024/film/global/palestinian-filmmakers-accuse-hollywood-dehumanizing-gaza-israel-1236120786/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> dehumanizing Palestinians</a>.”</p><p>Jess Levine and Riley Rethal have both <a href="https://bigbadboycott.carrd.co/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">already participated in a boycott</a> meant to pressure a tabletop roleplaying game convention into making a statement against Zionism, and wanted to figure out a way to make this game compliant with the ongoing BDS boycott. Eventually they settled on including a statement about the BDS boycott that encourages people to cancel their Disney+ subscriptions every time they mentioned the Disney-owned <em>Star Wars</em> property. They both found that including that statement led to people leaving comments about canceling their Disney+ subscriptions in solidarity with the BDS boycott.</p><p><em>Going Rogue</em> is an opportunity for <em>Star Wars</em> fans to make the story of <em>Star Wars</em> their own, including making it more in league with their own politics by taking Disney out of it.</p><p><br>“Something I like about tabletop role playing and adaptational tabletop role playing is it says, ‘Actually, fuck them. They don't get to own this thing,’” Levine said. “We can't fully divest from the connection to <em>Star Wars</em>. Obviously, we are downstream of it in certain ways. But we are also trying to say, fuck [Disney’s] ownership of this thing that you love.”</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/suplex-wrestling-love-letter"><h3>A Love Letter To The Suplex, Wrestling’s Greatest Move</h3></a><p>If you ever get suplexed in real life, you probably deserved it and it was raw as fuck</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/web3-nft-crypto-game-fail-close-scam-snake-oil"><h3>Oh No, Anyway</h3></a><p>'What went wrong?'</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/wind-breaker-shonen-anime-toxic-masculinity"><h3>This Shonen Anime Fights Toxic Masculinity</h3></a><p>Wind Breaker is a shonen anime where teenage boys talk about their feelings while punching toxic masculinity in the face.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/darumi-amemiya-the-hundred-line-last-defense-academy-emo-cringe-punk"><h3>The Hundred Line’s Darumi Amemiya Is Mortifying And I Will Defend Her With My Life</h3></a><p>Never before has a character been as embarrassing to be around and while being so relatable</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/the-last-of-us-season-2-hbo-tv-series-show-impressions"><h3>The Last Of Us Season 2 Is Bad Television</h3></a><p>It's not great, whether you've played the game or not</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/671051/lost-in-cult-editions-physical-game-releases<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/cameron-faulkner">Cameron Faulkner</a> <span>is an editor covering deals and commerce. He joined in 2018, and served as commerce editor at Polygon until May 2025.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Editions is the name of a new game publishing label launched by <a href="https://www.lostincult.co.uk/">Lost in Cult</a>, the same company known for making gorgeous books about video games, like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/663177/go-deep-down-the-animal-well"><em>Outer Wilds: Design Works</em>.</a> The new label’s aim is to preserve indie games, including some that haven’t been released on physical media before, and to celebrate their artistic contributions to the medium by including plenty of extra goodies. Notably, Lost in Cult is working with DoesItPlay? to validate its titles before they’re released. The group specializes in game preservation, ensuring that games can be run from the physical media they’re stored on without the need for a download or an internet connection.</p><p>The focus on elegantly preserving these titles is similar to what we’ve seen from Limited Run Games, while Editions’ focus on indie games reminds me of the Criterion Collection’s approach. Each game included in the Editions lineup will come with a fold-out poster, a sticker, a numbered authenticity card, a 40-page essay and developer interview, and gorgeous cover art, along with the game itself. The first three games to launch under the label include <em>Immortality</em>, <em>The Excavation of Hob’s Barrow</em>, and <em>Thank Goodness You’re Here</em>. Editions plans to announce a new game every month, starting in July.</p><p>Each of the three games is <a href="https://www.lostincult.co.uk/">available to preorder</a> through the Lost in Cult site starting at £59.99, with the option to choose between Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 5 editions when applicable. PS5 owners can opt to buy the entire first run of Editions games at a discounted price, containing <em>Immortality </em>and <em>Thank Goodness You’re Here</em>, and they’ll get a third (as of yet, unannounced) Editions title when it launches in July. Lost in Cult is asking for patience with shipments, which may take up to six months. But if they’re as good as the books, the wait will be worth it.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> RoadCraft Official Launch Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>To a certain extent, RoadCraft is a crafting game, except it stays close to reality. Players can't simply take short cuts and skip past the clean up stage. Once the debris has been taken away, the rebuilding process begins. Laying down new roads is a part of that, but not the end. RoadCraft is designed to let the players decide where everything should go, and how they want to put it there.</p><p>RoadCraft allows players to utilize cranes, haulers, bulldozers, and other machines either solo or alongside up to three other players while coordinating with voice chat. Progression is shared and the game also supports <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-cross-platform-games/2900-5425/" data-ref-id="2900-5425">cross-play</a>.</p><p>There are eight different maps to reshape to your whims, included forested areas and deserts. Players can fully develop these locations or take a more minimal approach with the rebuild. It's entirely up to you, once the game is in your hands.</p><p>RoadCraft is currently on sale at Fanatical for $35.59, 11% off its regular price of $40. It's also available on Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5. </p><p><em><i>Disclosure: Fanatical and GameSpot are both owned by Fandom</i>.</em></p>

			<p>Cyberpunk 2077 has come a long way since its 2020 launch, to the point where players can't wait for what CD Projekt RED has coming next in the sequel currently codenamed <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-will-evolve-much-like-the-witcher-games-in-cdprs-plans/">Project Orion</a>.</p>
<p>According to the creator behind the Cyberpunk series the games are based on, Mike Pondsmith, CD Projekt RED will have a whole new city for players to explore, on top of the infamous Night City that players have already spent hours digging into.</p>
<p>Pondsmith revealed the second city during Digital Dragons 2025, (spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/cyberpunk-2077s-sequel-features-a-second-city-that-feels-like-chicago-gone-wrong-reveals-creator/">VGC</a>) saying, "<em>I'm not as involved directly, but I see the scripts. Last week I was wandering around talking to different department and seeing what they had, like 'this is new Cyberware, what do you think?' I spent a lot of time talking to one of the environment guys, and he was explaining how the new place...because there's another city that we visit, and I'm not telling you anymore than that, but there's another city that we visit. Night City is still there.</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>I remember looking at it and going, 'I understand the feel that you're going for, and this really does work, it doesn't feel like Blade Runner</em>," he continued. "<em>It feels more like Chicago gone wrong.' And I said, 'yeah, I can see this working</em>."</p>
<p>It's exciting to consider that we'll have all of Night City, and then a whole new city, potentially even around the same size, to explore in Project Orion/whatever the final official title of the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel will be. But it'll be a long time before we see it, since CD Projekt RED still has to get through<a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-polaris-new-saga-pre-production-witcher-remake-cyberpunk-sequel-concept/"> The Witcher 4</a> before it heads back to Cyberpunk.</p>

            <p>
Alright, so, I know those of us on PC haven't even had the chance to play the first one yet, but it seems like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/shift-up-corporation">Shift Up</a> have essentially confirmed that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stellar-blade">Stellar Blade</a> 2 is in the works. As spotted by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stellar-blade-2-sequel-quietly-revealed-by-developer-shift-up/">Insider Gaming</a>, Shift Up recently shared its <a href="https://shiftup.co.kr/eng/ir/irdata.php?ptype=view&amp;idx=254&amp;page=1&amp;code=irdata_eng">investor relations presentation</a> for May of this year, most of it being businessy nonsense neither you or I could give two tosses about. The key thing is a slide in its strategy section, showing a very basic plan for its games Nikke and Stellar Blade.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
On Stellar Blade's section, it shows a label titled "platform expansion", presumably in reference to that upcoming PC port. There's also a bit that just plainly says "sequel", which, I don't know about you, certainly implies that a sequel is likely to be in the works. This section also shows that all of these steps are being taken between 2024, i.e. the original release year of Stellar Blade, and 2027, seeming to suggest that Shift Up plan to release a sequel by then.
</p>
<p>
On top of that there's the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stellar-blade-studios-next-game-reportedly-aaa-action-rpg-titled-project-witches">previously reported Project Witches</a> listed, also seemingly due out before 2027. Not many details on that one still, but it appears to be early days still as another section notes that there's only 18 people working on it currently compared to the 107 devs working on Stellar Blade, and 148 devs working on Nikke. Worth noting this might have changed by now, as these figures are as of March 2025, either way, you probably shouldn't expect a proper reveal of that for a while.
</p>
<p>
Whether the sequel comes to PC whenever it launches, I couldn't tell you, but the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action</a> game is due out for us in less than a month. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stellar-blade-pc-will-release-on-11th-june-according-to-leaked-trailer-montage-of-technical-improvements">You'll be able to pick it up on PC on June 11th</a>, though not necessarily everywhere, as it's currently region locked. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stellar-blades-devs-would-like-you-to-know-you-dont-need-a-psn-account-on-pc-as-they-work-on-the-region-lock-problem">Shift Up is working on fixing that at least</a>!

                <p>According to leakers and data miners, code for double jumping and wall-running has been added to Call of Duty with the latest update, but it remains unclear if this will be used for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6/" data-ref-id="5000-630093">Black Ops 6</a> or Call of Duty 2025, if used at all.</p><p dir="ltr">Several reliable Call of Duty accounts on X: <a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1924770383665745976" rel="nofollow ">CharlieIntel</a>, <a href="https://x.com/thebluefoxvn/status/1924328399679697079" rel="nofollow ">AndrewVN</a>, and <a href="https://x.com/CODWarfareForum/status/1924347527991541904" rel="nofollow ">COD Warfare</a>, all shared a look at the code in the new update, as well as video of it in action. It's important to note that the double jump and wall-running are not live in the actual game but instead are being demonstrated by someone who activated the code that was added. The movement looks similar to the movement in Black Ops 3, which originally introduced the controversial wall-running mechanic. It's been confirmed that a Black Ops 3 map, Fringe, is being remade for Black Ops 6 as part of Season 4. The map may not work without wall-running or significant changes, providing a possible reason for these being added.</p><p dir="ltr">As for what exactly this is being planned for, if it's going to be used at all, is unclear. It could be leftover code; it could be for a special mode in Black Ops 6 or used in this year's Call of Duty. While unannounced, it is rumored that Call of Duty 2025 is Black Ops 7 and a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-will-be-black-ops-2-sequel-report/1100-6520054/">sequel to Black Ops 2</a>. Black Ops 2 had a near future sci-fi setting, but with the sequel coming out the same year the game was set, it would likely get bumped to a farther out date. It would make sense that the futuristic Call of Duty game brought back the futuristic mechanics of wall-running and double jumps.</p><p dir="ltr">The code was found as part of the most recent update to Call of Duty, which prepares <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-season-4-start-date-and-details/1100-6531690/">Warzone and Black Ops 6 for Season 4</a>, set to release on May 29.</p>

            <p>
Carrie Patel, who served as game director on this year's acclaimed fantasy action-RPG <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/avowed">Avowed</a>, has confirmed her departure from Obsidian Entertainment after nearly 12 years with the studio and announced a new role at Netflix.
</p>
<p>
Patel, who was very much the face of Avowed throughout its development, shared the news in a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/carrie-patel-80003aa/">brief update on LinkedIn</a>, revealing she's now working within Netflix's gaming division, having joined Oxenfree developer Night School Studio as a game director.
</p>
<p>
She offered no further clue as to what she'll be working on at Night School in her update, but the Oxenfree and Afterparty studio has an impressive track record, despite its limited output since being <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-acquires-oxenfree-developer-night-school-studio">acquired by Netflix in 2021</a>. It released Oxenfree 2: Lost Signals in 2023 but nothing else until <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-new-netflix-black-mirror-series-has-another-bandersnatch-like-gaming-crossover-moment-but-you-might-not-even-notice-it">Black Mirror tie-in Thronglets</a> arrived earlier this year - a release that followed an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-culls-staff-at-oxenfree-developer-night-school-studio">unspecified number of layoffs at Night School</a> in March.

<p>
Netflix's gaming strategy has taken some dramatic shifts in direction since the streaming service's first tentative steps back in 2021. After an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-halo-infinite-creative-head-joseph-staten-joins-netflix-games">initial focus on mobile titles</a>, it seemed ready to stride into the world of AAA console gaming in 2023, even <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-acquires-oxenfree-developer-night-school-studio">hitting up longtime Halo creative lead Joseph Staten</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> executive producer Chacko Sonny, and God of War art director Rafael Grassetti to found a new development team.
</p>
<p>
However, Netflix <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-closes-aaa-internal-studio-led-by-halo-creative-head-joseph-staten">quietly closed the studio late last year</a>, and is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-games-boss-says-consoles-not-the-future-as-streamer-looks-to-phone-controlled-party-games">reportedly now focusing on</a> narrative and transmedia projects, on big mainstream IP, on being a destination for families, and on party games played on TVs using mobile phones as a controller. That does, of course, still leave room for Night Studio - and Patel - to continue making the kind of games it does best.
</p>
<p>
As for Avowed, prior to Patel's departure from Obsidian, she suggested it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/avowed-director-hints-at-a-future-for-the-franchise">wasn't a one-and-done effort</a>. "Now that we've built this wonderful world, and also built this team strength and muscle memory around the content and gameplay in this world," she explained, "I'd love to see us do more with it." Next up for Obsidian, though, is <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-outer-worlds">The Outer Worlds</a> 2. It's due later this year, with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-announces-june-showcase-event-reveals-game-getting-this-years-big-spotlight">special developer deep dive set to air on 8th June</a> following the Xbox Games Showcase.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/a-love-letter-to-the-suplex-wrestling%E2%80%99s-greatest-move.1194486/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/suplex-wrestling-love-letter<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In the international wrestling community, one of the go-to icebreaker questions is asking a fellow fan about their Mt. Rushmore of professional wrestlers. One’s Mt. Rushmore of wrestlers is shaped by wrestling eras, match quality, and nostalgia for iconic performers, all without crowning one over the others. While my Mt. Rushmore shifts from month to month, I’ll never change my mind on the wrestling move I fuck with more than the other 1,000 holds in wrestling: the suplex.&nbsp;</p><p>A <a href="https://prowrestling.fandom.com/wiki/Suplex" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suplex</a> is a wrestling maneuver where a wrestler lifts their opponent into a bridging position before slamming them onto the mat. While it might seem like a basic throw, its deceptive simplicity allows for a wide range of physical expression. Wrestling moves — like words on a webpage — come in different fonts, each infused with a unique style. Before I wax poetic about my favorite suplexes, I will set the stage explaining how wrestling moves come in more permutations than Fanta flavors.&nbsp;</p><h2>Wrestling Moves For Dummies</h2><p>Suplexes and fundamental moves like drivers, powerbombs, busters, and splashes are the bedrock of a wrestler’s arsenal. While anyone can do them, how they're delivered truly sets them apart. A performer’s gimmick, technical prowess, and artistic flair can turn one of these simple maneuvers into a spectacle worth popping out of your chair in unbridled excitement.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="The Undertaker Finisher - Tombstone Piledriver" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qyJKrP7L-kM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Take <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsdG0HyLHP0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Undertaker’s Tombstone Piledriver</a>. It’s a devastating finisher that the WWE’s “Deadman” has performed for three decades because it wins him matches. It begins with a signature throat slash gesture, signaling to the crowd that his opponent is about to meet his end. Taker then flips a dude upside down, cradling their head between his thighs, and spikes them headfirst into the mat. He then methodically crosses their arms like they’re being prepped for a funeral (because they are), and rolls his eyes back at the hard cam — holding the pose unti the referee’s three count seals their kayfabe fate.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Kenta Kobashi debuts the burning hammer" width="710" height="533" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EuEoimAW604?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Despite the Tombstone Piledriver being a certified “move I wouldn’t want to take,” it's far from the riskiest in the grand scheme of wrestling drivers. There’s the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLkN6p0Mqf8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Package Piledriver</a>, where a wrestler locks their opponent tightly upside down in the feeble position before drilling them into the mat; the <a href="https://youtu.be/mqDZRZVw4jo?si=qSmNUPKs0e3ZWP5r" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Canadian Destroyer</a>, a piledriver variant where a wrestler front flips while holding their opponent before driving their head into the ground; or, my personal favorite, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ah2e64-VcxQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kenta Kobashi’s Burning Hammer</a>, an inverted twist on the Death Valley Driver where instead of flipping his opponent onto their back from a fireman’s carry drop, he spikes them neck-first into the canvas.&nbsp;</p><p>When a wrestler masters a move, it becomes one of their signature moves. If a move reliably results in their victory, it becomes their finishing move. Over time, that move earns a legacy by renaming its modification and variation after the person who perfected it, passing it on to a new generation of wrestlers to add to their toolkits, like <a href="https://www.cagematch.net/?id=2&amp;nr=455&amp;gimmick=Jushin+Thunder+Liger" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jushin Thunder Liger</a>’s sit-out powerbomb the “Liger Bomb,” or <a href="https://www.cagematch.net/?id=2&amp;nr=541" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mitsuharu Misawa</a>’s double underhook powerbomb the <a href="https://prowrestling.fandom.com/wiki/Wrestling_throws#Tiger_driver" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tiger Driver</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2>Suplexes come in different shapes and sizes</h2><p>As mentioned above, wrestling moves are like fonts. But the real magic happens with a move’s modifiers. Like how text can be bolded, italicized, or underlined to change its impact, wrestling moves transform depending on speed, elevation, and execution. And the anatomy of a suplex has a plethora of variations.&nbsp;</p><p>If a wrestler executes a suplex from the top turnbuckle, it transforms into an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srq6iNLtOxo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“avalanche” suplex</a>. If they burst into the suplex without a drawn-out wind-up, prioritizing speed over theatrics, it’s classified as a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggn0Ubi6uks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“snap” suplex</a>. Sitting between these two variants is the <a href="https://prowrestling.fandom.com/wiki/Professional_wrestling_throws#Brainbuster" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Brainbuster</a>, a suplex with a distinctly brutal twist.&nbsp;</p><p>The Brainbuster, often called a <a href="https://prowrestling.fandom.com/wiki/Vertical_Suplex" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Delayed Vertical Suplex</a>, begins with the wrestler locking their opponent in a front face lock — one hand gripping their hip, the other tucked behind their neck. Unlike a standard suplex that follows a graceful arc, a Brainbuster cuts the rotation short. Instead of rolling into a controlled fall, the wrestler delays the drop and spikes their opponent straight down onto their head in a sheer whiplash-inducing impact.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Top 20 Variations of the Brainbuster" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BN1CHgRialI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><h2>My Favorite Suplexes</h2><p>Now that I’ve thoroughly explained the ins and outs of wrestling throws and the variations of suplexes, here are my all-time favorite suplexes in no particular order.&nbsp;</p><h2>Northern Lights Suplex</h2><div><figure><p><iframe title="Alicia Fox- Northern Lights Suplex" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QJbBP5f3f2E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Key qualities for a grade-A <a href="https://prowrestling.fandom.com/wiki/Suplex#German_suplex" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Northern Lights Suplex</a> are how fluid the rolling motion of the throw is, how high the arch of the offensive wrestler’s bridge is, and most importantly, whether they point their toes into the ground and maintain their balance while executing the move. My favorite Northern Lights Suplex belongs to WWE’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alicia_Fox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alicia Fox</a>. Her bridge is beautiful, and she makes the move look like a walk in the park.&nbsp;</p><h2>German Suplex</h2><div><figure><p><iframe title="Konosuke Takeshita's German Suplex Collection (110+ Clips)" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pYHx_Dc1ByI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>I said I wasn’t picking favorites here, but the <a href="https://prowrestling.fandom.com/wiki/Suplex#German_suplex" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">German Suplex</a> is my favorite. I pop off when I see it in other media, like <a href="https://youtu.be/_H0Vf16JYHI?t=1460" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kratos taking an impromptu German Suplex from Baldur in <em>God of War</em></a>. I’m such a slut for a German Suplex that I hoot any time any wrestler executes any kind of variation of this suplex. It can be a deadlift German Suplex, a pop-up German Suplex, or a rolling German Suplex, I don’t care. It’s just something about watching a wrestler slipping under their opponent’s guard, locking their arms around their waist, and snapping their hips into a golden ratio arc into the mat that pleases the caveman wrinkles in my brain. It fucks. Though if I were to pick a favorite wrestler’s German Suplex, it would be my <a href="https://www.fightful.com/wrestling/konosuke-takeshita-and-cinnabon-greatest-love-story-wrestling?utm_source=TW-Fightful&amp;utm_medium=Fightful%20Wrestling%20News&amp;utm_campaign=dlvr.it" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cinanbon-loving son</a>, Konosuke Takeshita, who <a href="https://www.wrestlinginc.com/1104609/facts-only-hardcore-fans-know-about-konosuke-takeshita/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote a 20-page college thesis on the move</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2>Dragon Suplex</h2><div><figure><p><iframe title="Mayu Iwatani - Bridging Dragon Suplex compilation" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UJ-69MKqIUs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>The <a href="https://prowrestling.fandom.com/wiki/Suplex#Dragon_suplex" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dragon Suplex</a> is synonymous with Former Stardom-turned Marigold Ace Joshi pro wrestler <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayu_Iwatani" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayu Iwatani</a>. The move is like a standard German suplex but has stages like the Power Rangers assembling the Megazord. First, she props her opponent up in a belly-to-back suplex position. While having them suspended in the air, she locks them in a full nelson and snaps them back, neck-first into the mat. Sometimes, if she’s feeling fancy, Iwatani will bridge her back and point her toes into the ground. However, it doesn’t happen often because Iwatani is a sicko who goes incredibly hard in her matches, often crumpling into a heap after delivering super kicks, so she’ll sometimes just settle for hitting the move and crumpling in exhaustion until the three-count sounds her victory.&nbsp;</p><h2>Tiger Suplex</h2><div><figure><p><iframe title="Perfect Tiger Suplex from Tiger Mask IV" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uBX-FAKf2YY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>The <a href="https://prowrestling.fandom.com/wiki/Suplex#Tiger_suplex" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tiger Suplex</a> is another variant of the German Suplex. Its uniqueness lies in how wrestlers set up their opponents before slamming them into the mat. Instead of locking their opponents from their waist or from a full nelson position, the Tiger Suplex has an offensive wrestler lock their adversary from the inside of their elbow, the cubital fossa if you will, from the belly-to-back position before foisting them from the earth and dropping them from a high angle on their shoulders and neck. The kayfabe psychology of the suplex, and other moves restricting an opponent's arms, is that it would prevent them from breaking their fall, making the impact more devastating. I think it’s neat that suplexes are an equal opportunity naming convention for animals.&nbsp;</p><h2>C4 Bakudan Suplex</h2><p><a href="https://www.cagematch.net/?id=2&amp;nr=16564&amp;gimmick=AZM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AZM</a> (pronounced Azumi)’s suplex is so complex that it has its unique name. In fighting game lingo, the <a href="https://x.com/WhirlingAndy/status/1813541450304692356" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">C4 Bakudan Suplex</a> (or C4 Bomb) is like a command grab counter move. After deflecting a front kick from her opponent, AZM dips under their guard while folding their kicking leg to their hip like they were crossing their legs like a cool guy. After which, she performs a German Suplex. Yes, it's just a German Suplex with the bare minimum of extra steps, but the velocity with which “High Speed Bomb Girl” executes the move gets all the brownie points from me.&nbsp;</p><h2>Twilight Dream</h2><div><figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Tam Nakano delivers a tiger suplex setting up the debut of her "Twilight Dream" finisher. 💫</p><p>Kagetsu vs. Tam Nakano<br>STARDOM at the Korakuen Hall<br>9th Anniversary Show (January 19th, 2020) <a href="https://t.co/o6jXjUyEob">pic.twitter.com/o6jXjUyEob</a></p></div>— nimbus ✨ (@surfingnimbus) <a href="https://twitter.com/surfingnimbus/status/1601126459158200320?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 9, 2022</a></blockquote></div></figure></div><p>The Twilight Dream is one of the more complicated suplexes on this list.

The move sees the “Top Kawaii of the Cosmos” wrestler place her opponent in a combination of a hammerlock and seatbelt wrist hold, fastening their arms to the front and back of their waist, leaving no room to escape, before hoisting them up for a suplex. She typically punctuates the move by holding her back in a bridge and anchoring her tippy toes into the mat like the showoffy idol she is, and I love her for it.&nbsp;</p><h2>Ocean Cyclone Suplex&nbsp;</h2><div><figure><p><iframe title="Manami Toyota's Japanese Ocean Cyclone Suplex" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Yos3DFvNRlk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><br><a href="https://www.cagematch.net/?id=2&amp;nr=2265" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Minami Toyota</a>’s <a href="https://prowrestling.fandom.com/wiki/Manami_Toyota" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ocean Cyclone Suplex</a> is what happens when a German Suplex meets an <a href="https://prowrestling.fandom.com/wiki/Electric_chair" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Electric Chair</a> (the wrestling move).

			<p>Developer Raccoon Logic's <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/best-tips-for-starting-revenge-of-the-savage-planet/">Revenge of the Savage Planet</a> has surpassed 1 million players, the studio has announced. Nearly two weeks since the game launched, the studio celebrated the milestone, though creative director Alex Hutchinson still lamented the fact that, due to Revenge of the Savage Planet being available on subscription services, 1 million players doesn't mean 1 million sales.</p>
<p>"<em>We are super grateful to all the 1M players who have taken up revenge against Alta</em>," a statement from Raccoon Logic on the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2787320/view/537728173036537047">Steam page</a> began.</p>
<p>"<em>Thank you for the support. On the team side, we are continuing to make fixes very regularly to ensure that everyone has the best experience possible. We're also working on a roadmap for new features/updates/etc that we want to share with you very soon! In the meantime, keep kicking brainards, raccoons, and decking out your habitat STV Cribs Style. The team loves seeing all your creations, gifs, memes, etc. Keep em' coming!</em>"</p>

<p>On X, creative director Alex Hutchinson still celebrated the milestone, but seemingly with an upset tone that the game's inclusion on Xbox Game Pass means it doesn't exactly reflect the financial success that 1 million players would have meant in the days before subscription services like Game Pass.</p>
<p>"<em>In the modern world it sadly doesn't mean sales with the subscription services but still an awesome milestone</em>," Hutchinson<a href="https://x.com/BangBangClick/status/1924124703427371070"> wrote on X</a> while sharing a photo celebrating 1 million players.</p>
<p>In our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/revenge-of-the-savage-planet-review-funny-beautiful-and-tedious/">review of Revenge of the Savage Planet</a>, we praised the game's style and its humor, but still found it a tedious journey that cut any momentum it was starting to build at various points in the game.</p>
<p>"<em>Ultimately, Revenge of the Savage Planet is a fun mix of sharp satire and toilet humor, with a layer of environmental systems that do work well together, once you have the upgrades to manipulate and use them all. It thrives mostly due to the charm, care, and whimsy pumped into its design and nearly every aspect, but it lacks any narrative chops to push it further. Tedious missions and a poorly executed gameplay arc dampen the experience, potentially to the point where I wouldn't blame you for putting it down</em>."</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/creature-keeper-review-dog-walker-for-hire</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/creature-keeper-review-dog-walker-for-hire.1194471/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/creature-keeper-review-dog-walker-for-hire<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Creature Keeper</em> is a monster collector from Chicago-based studio Fervir Games, and one that went through the trenches to get here. A successful Kickstarter campaign in 2019, and an expected release of 2021, was just the beginning of a road built piece-by-piece in real-time whilst they were traveling on it, and indeed, even now. It’s always nice to see the fruits of labor, regardless of the outcome.</p>

<p>You play as Blank, a young up-and-coming “Creature Keeper” from Thera, based in the hills of Sodland. After a grueling training period, Blank immediately has their feet put to the fire, as a growing corruption is enveloping Thera, as well as ruining the livelihoods and prospects of several nearby towns. Together with the creatures uncorrupted by this mysterious influence, Blank has to learn quickly.</p>

<p>There’s a lot that<em> Creature Keeper</em> keeps under the bonnet, namely, what exactly is being showcased. Is it a <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/pokemon-red-and-blue" rel="nofollow"><em>Pokémon</em></a>-esque creature collector? Is it an action-RPG in the <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/diablo" rel="nofollow">Diablo</a> </em>vein? Is it a brawler evoking <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/dynasty-warriors-fighting-game-turned-musou" rel="nofollow"><em>Dynasty Warriors</em></a>, of all things? The answer is all 3, and more, including a gardening mini-game. Inside and out, you can tell this is someone’s baby, “nurture over nature” as it gleefully sprawls out on screen like a Jackson Pollock painting.</p>



<p>This works both for <em>Creature Keeper</em>’s benefit and against it. When the game is showing you how it works in its initial throes, it’s all very contained. You’re given a creature to control, and in their own time, the AI can attack whatever’s attacking Blank. If you want to expedite the process, however, you can select the monster as the game slows down, and choose whether it’s a normal attack, a special attack that you can switch out for each separate creature, or whether they ignore that monster entirely.</p>

<p>In this contained environment, it works well. It helps that Blank is also an element in each fight, with weapons readily available and found throughout chests in Thera. Cracks start to show almost immediately however, as after the tutorial, each fight is an insane explosion of mushy pixels that cannot and will not determine separate factors in each fight you decide to take on.</p>

<p>You see, it’s not just Blank and their monsters on display, but the monsters that have been corrupted, and the monsters you can befriend that haven’t been corrupted. Then there’s the icons attached to the corrupted monsters, your owned creatures' health bars, and the damage numbers in tiny groups of pixels, and the projectiles certain monsters will fire profusely to the point of sub-5 FPS slowdown… and the hats. It’s mesmerizing, albeit completely unintelligible chaos, and that’s before you’re allowed more than one creature to follow you on your adventure.</p>



<p>There’s no real way to mitigate this. All but a small handful of creatures will have collisions on their sprites, but that’s when they showcase size on top of their massive attacks, so what you have is a melting pot of nothing. You can strategize and line up attacks for your creatures to make, but it’s tough to determine in the heat of the moment where it starts and ends, even with appropriate set-ups.</p>

<p>It’s the set-ups themselves that seem to have the primary focus in <em>Creature Keeper</em>. Creatures level up, and they unlock perks, but there are some absolutely baffling design decisions made here. Why would I want my creature to get a 10% damage buff, but an increase of 15% in damage taken? Why do HP bonuses only offer paltry +10s when my creatures can reach health that pushes 1000? Why is movement speed a bonus to consider when the creatures are strictly tethered to the player character?</p>

<p>There are also other bonuses you can attach in the form of a garden where you can plant seeds, which you can place clay figures of your current party nearby certain seeds, so you attain bonuses in battles. It’s not as explicitly black-and-white as that, but you’d be hard pressed to find the strategy involved. Even when the game introduces its Rock/Paper/Scissors mechanics for monster weaknesses and strengths, the trick lies in staggering.</p>



<p>Hit a monster enough times, and they’ll become stunned briefly, and you can wail on them, which is Blank’s job. It appears that Fervir Games anticipated this, which is why Blank’s damage doesn’t scale to the same height as the monsters you can catch, so before long, your role in the battle becomes near-negligible.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You’re still a stagger merchant, make no mistake, but as a player, you become tertiary to a creature system that only relies on numbers; numbers in power, numbers in size, neither of which demand the intricacies that <em>Creature Keeper</em> promises.</p>

<p>That isn’t a detriment, as it’s nice that the game gives enough leeway for the player to simply just play it without worrying about its largely context-less flow in battles. Indeed, it was more fun trying to see the world of Thera as Fervir have crafted it, which does lead to some interesting moments. The campaign isn’t exactly <em>Moby Dick</em>, but <em>Creature Keeper</em> pulls punches when necessary with some heartfelt decisions, ones that lean into the lore with vigor.</p>

<p>Mind you, this is when the game isn’t forcing through some unbelievably painful attempts at comedy. This may be a complaint that varies with how one perceives comedy, but each time <em>Creature Keeper</em> is attempting to make the player chortle, it is always with long-winded scenes, mixed in with unnecessary and downright annoying pixelated emojis plastering the screen. It barely adds anything to proceedings, just pure eye-rolling whenever it tries to hit you with a goofy Jerry Lewis prat-fall in 16-bit format.</p>

<h2><em>Creature Keeper</em> Review | Final Verdict</h2>

<p>Did I have fun with <em>Creature Keeper</em>? It’s really hard to say. It’s a true “shut your brain off” button masher that doesn’t do enough with its tactical potential, and its story is sandbagged by some truly unfunny comedy beats. Beyond its mostly ineffectual perk system, what changes could be made would also poison the well of its extremely specific flavor, and as it stands, it HAS identity. As it stands, the journey <em>Creature Keeper</em> has made to be here could be worth the price of admission alone.</p>
