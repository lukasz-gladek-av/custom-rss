			<p>Battlefield 6 has been a long time coming, arguably all the way back to when we assumed this was what Battlefield 2042 would be called. This is actually a return to what Battlefield has done best over the decades, with 64-player battles, a modern warfare setting, defined classes, and a steady sense of player progression that feels like the good old days. It’s as close to a modernised Battlefield 3 or 4 as you could hope for, and the franchise’s best shot to meaningfully challenge Call of Duty in almost a decade.</p>
<p><iframe title="Battlefield 6 Review –&nbsp;Finally, a Battlefield 4 sequel" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/it1ZxHggEl4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>With a week of pre-release multiplayer sessions under my belt, it definitely strikes a lot of the right notes for me. At the heart of Battlefield 6 are series staple large scale game modes, with Conquest and Breakthrough leading the way – the first an open map with check points, the other pitting attackers against defenders to fight from one side of the map to the other. Rush, in this iteration, is more like a 12v12 shrunk down version of Breakthrough. Joining them is Escalation, which takes Conquest and ramps the stakes up over time. Starting with seven control points, you need to hold more than the other team to build up a meter to try and score a point, at which point the map shrinks by one objective and you go again, with more and heavier vehicles unlocking over time. The first to three points wins, but this can really swing back and forth, and it can be really rather fun.</p>



<p>The map rotation we experienced put a lot more emphasis on the city maps than those with more open spaces. Six of the nine maps are in towns or cities, and I’ll be honest, I was fine with that – I did partake in the occasional Operation Locker grindfest back in the day. These offer up mazes of buildings and rooms, letting infantry be the focus and showcasing this game’s take on destruction. There’s quite a good balance to this effect, giving the effect of destruction, both cosmetic and impactful, without letting you fully level a map in the style of Bad Company 2. While I enjoyed this, there is an imbalance here and the game does need more open maps. As popular as Operation Firestorm is, it’s going to do a lot of heavy lifting here alongside the mountainside battling on Liberation Peak, and the one other open level, Mirak Valley. There’s also an oddity with one map – Saints Quarter – which isn’t usable for any large modes.</p>

<p>The big modes are then joined by small scale modes TDM, Squad DM, Domination, King of the Hill, and it’s here that I really got to grips with weapon handling and the pace of battle. The time to kill can be very quick, and there’s a lot more sliding round corners these days, but this forced me to consider my approach a bit more, instead of just rushing headlong into the fray. That and the pre-launch lobbies needing a bit of help from bots to fill the player count did wonders for my K:D ratio.</p>

<p>There’s a traditional set of four character classes, which harks back to Battlefield: Bad Company 2 by combining medic, ammo supply and LMG into the Support class, which allows Assault to be a two-gun frontline soldier, Engineer to really focus on anti-vehicle gear, and Recon for sniping, spotting and sneaky spawn points. It is, I think, close to being a perfect blend of roles and duties, and while open gun choice does muddy the waters a little bit, I think the class bonuses for sticking to their particular signature weapon is enough, and there’s enough weapons within each bucket to let you lean in a different direction as well. The second LMG has a rapid 30-bullet clip that makes it more like an AR, for example, especially with foregrips enhancing your aim. I feel there’s been some positive changes since the beta here as well, so the Assault doesn’t have totally free reign with their second weapon choice, and they might consider a breaching charge instead double weapons to lean into the level destruction.</p>
<p>Progression is generally quite straightforward. Weapons and gear are unlocked as you rank up, and then attachments come via weapon mastery –&nbsp;using it lots, in other words. Feeding this is a slew of basic daily challenges to score with a particular class and weapon, such that open weapons are really useful, and then weekly challenges that can get more specific, as well as overarching challenges that grant specific XP boosts or cosmetic unlocks.</p>

<p>You’re rewarded mid-battle as well through Field Specs. Yes, you have your key gear and equipment, but you also gain class and role-specific buffs and boosts as you earn points in a round. Assault can passively get better movement speeds while aiming, Support the ability to share life and ammo with nearby allies, and so on. There’s only a couple Field Specs per class, so this feels like an area for DICE to expand on through future seasons.</p>
<p>This is, of course, a live service game, and after fluffing their lines for the last couple games, Season 1 for Battlefield 6 promises two new maps and a seasonal makeover through the end of this year, as well as half a dozen new weapons, a new vehicle, new mode and more. That’s a significant improvement, and it’s also before talking about the Battle Royale game mode that’s coming down the pipe. We don’t know precisely what the long term monetisation will look like at the moment, outside of there being a battle pass and expected cosmetics. The developers have repeatedly stated the intent to stick to grounded military looks, and that’s true of the base game, but with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/28/electronic-arts-saudi-investment-fund-trump/">EA’s impending ownership change</a>, you might wonder if <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/26/cristiano-ronaldo-joins-the-fatal-fury-city-of-the-wolves-roster/">a&nbsp;Cristiano Ronaldo skin will be unceremoniously shoved in eventually</a>.</p>

<p>That will live alongside Portal, which puts sweeping editing tools in the hands of players to create custom levels and game modes. Playing on PS5, we don’t get to fiddle with these tools and they weren’t available pre-launch regardless, but there’s already officially created infantry-only versions of Breakthrough and Conquest, and a Hardcore mode from the off. They’re splintered off from the default game mode selections – just as the Closed Weapon playlist is hidden away – and they’ll have to do a lot to ensure that the best experiences are made discoverable, but it’s good that they’re there.</p>
<p>While multiplayer is obviously the main part of Battlefield 6, this game sees the return of a single player campaign, a side to the franchise that has swung between highs and lows since the first effort in Bad Company. In this case, it’s just too by the numbers, and lacking in polish.</p>

<p>NATO is under attack by a mysterious PMC known as Pax Armata, whose rise rapidly escalates from a territorial rivalry into all-out conflict through Gibraltar, New York, and beyond. There’s some fun highlights and grand spectacle, squeezing in some Battlefield staples, like repairing a tank through urban combat and open area missions later on, but it’s wrapped up in a largely uninteresting mystery and the presentation isn’t up to snuff.</p>
<p>There’s missing canned animations, there’s mission scripting that doesn’t trigger properly if you outpace your AI team or do things in atypical ways, and the enemy AI is just painfully dumb. Then there’s the story beats that don’t land because interpersonal relationships and conflict aren’t in the final game, there’s cutscenes that take take control away from you for highlight moments that you should 100% be playing, and which have so much shaky cam that even Jason Bourne would need a sit down.</p>
<p>This is the part of the game that really needed more time, and it’s a shame that Motive and Criterion, who led the campaign’s development, didn’t get it.</p>

						<h5>Battlefield 6</h5><p><span>October 10, 2025</span>
					</p></div><div>
							<h5>Platform</h5><p><span>PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S</span>
						</p></div><div>
							<h5>Developer</h5><p><span>Battlefield Studios (DICE, Ripple Effect, Criterion, Motive)</span>
						</p></div></div></div>			
			<p>Battlefield 6 has a lot on its shoulders. EA put the effort of four studios together under the Battlefield Studios banner (Motive, Criterion, Ripple Effect, and DICE) to try and get a win for the series after the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-acknowledges-disappointing-battlefield-2042-reception/">overall loss that was Battlefield 2042</a>. As of last week, it has to try to get people to forget that, in a year's time, EA will <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-confirms-agreement-to-be-acquired-by-pif-silver-lake-and-affinity-partners-for-55-billion/">likely be a very different company under its new ownership</a>, despite what chief executive officer Andrew Wilson might claim. It also has to try to compete with an annual franchise <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-games-almost-half-of-all-best-selling-playstation-games-in-us/">that makes up for nearly half the best-selling games on what is arguably the biggest console platform</a>.</p>



<p>Battlefield 6 has to be good enough to account for all of that and <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-targeting-100-million-players/">hit the insane expectations that EA has for the game</a>. So is it good enough to do all of that? Well, not really. If you were already rethinking your purchasing habits towards EA games based on who its new owners will be next year, if/when its privatization deal goes through, Battlefield 6 probably isn't going to stop you, nor is it a hill to die on. Can it compete head-to-head with Call of Duty on the sales charts? Again, probably not, though at the time of this writing, it seems to have more public favour than Call of Duty, so we'll see where we stand by the end of the year.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Haz Carter in Battlefield 6.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>But can it make up for Battlefield 2042, and be definitive proof that this long-running series is back in fighting shape? Absolutely. Battlefield 6 is undoubtedly one of the best Battlefield games ever. What we all played and felt in the beta this summer was real; this is a return to form for the series, with large, well-designed maps and destruction mechanics that drive the idea of being in the middle of a major battle home.</p>



<p>A wide array of weapons that sound great and feel punchy to use, stunning visuals on every front, and as a small cherry on top, an actual campaign mode. It's unfortunate that the campaign isn't actually very memorable or overall that good, but it's better than nothing, and even a bit better than that.</p>



<p>Let me start there. The campaign takes place over the course of nine missions, and over the course of the six or so hours it took to play them, there are some truly stunning moments of spectacle. Battlefield is already capable of creating cinematic moments in its multiplayer, so it wasn't surprising to see it accomplish the same in an environment where it could carefully plan out and direct those moments for players.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>(From left to right) Gecko, Lopez, and Hemlock in Battlefield 6.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Which is what makes it even more mind-boggling that those moments aren't everywhere in this campaign. I wouldn't say any of the missions are necessarily bad or that they're not fun to play through. They all reach a pretty fair quality bar, and they are all fun. Only a few of them, however, actually step up to the kind of quality that I'd expect from a campaign in a triple-A first-person shooter. I'm not saying it needed to have <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/baldurs-gate-3-review/">Baldur's Gate 3</a>-level writing and characters, or that there should be environmental storytelling that rivals <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-make-way-for-the-elden-lord/">Elden Ring</a>. I think we all know the score with shooter campaigns. </p>



<p>The most memorable ones play out like a really well-put-together action movie, with characters that are engaging enough so you care about them when they're in jeopardy, a score that properly backs up high-stakes moments, and spectacular, stunning, jaw-dropping action. And of course, the gameplay has to be solid throughout.</p>



<p>Battlefield 6 sees you step into the boots of different members of the Dagger 1-3 squad, beginning with a cutscene where the Dagger squad has infiltrated the house of someone who you learn is their CIA handler, Melissa Mills. The year is 2028, and in Battlefield 6's fictional version of Earth, a private military coalition formed by multiple countries called Pax Armata has essentially waged war on the rest of the world and specifically anyone still part of NATO, caused enough political rifts to have even more countries on its side looking for protection, and is armed to the teeth with a seemingly endless supply of new weapons and recruits. They're generally faceless, save for an antagonist called Kincaid, not representative of any particular country, and the sort of 'enemy faction' that can be vague enough to try and remove any of the political realities of making a military shooter centred around American soldiers as the 'heroes.'</p>

<p>There are five members in Dagger 1-3, with the initial four each representing one of the classes you play as in multiplayer. Haz Carter is the squad leader and Assault character, Dylan Murphy is the squad's Engineer, Simone 'Gecko' Espina is the Recon member, and Cliff Lopez is the Support member of the squad. Hemlock is the fifth member of the squad, described as a CIA operative who we don't know much about. Almost like his poisonous name is meant to represent something deeper.</p>



<p>As Murphy interrogates Mills about the truth and the true objectives behind each of their missions, starting in 2027, you play through each of them, cutting back to the house for another cutscene to set up the next mission in between most of them. I don't want to spoil what happens, but I will say that it's terribly underwhelming the whole way through when it comes to the story. It falls particularly at the end, since it clearly sets up some sort of continuation that I have no doubt will be sold in a future DLC package or poorly continued through an element of Battlefield's live service trappings. That might sound cynical, but I don't have any reason not to be when it comes to EA repackaging elements of games that used to just be in the game you bought and reselling them to you in a drip feed and charging $25-a-pop for each.</p>



<p>Gameplay-wise, thankfully, it's a much better experience throughout. The first mission, 'Always Faithful', is a bombastic opening that starts things on the right foot. 'Night Raid' does a good job at filling the spot of obligatory night-vision-focused mission, and 'Moving Mountains' has a fun and intense chase sequence where you get the President out of a burning New York. The final two missions, 'Operation Ember Strike' and 'Always Forward', are perhaps the two most spectacle-filled missions across the whole campaign, and unsurprisingly, the best missions in the campaign.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Battlefield 6 campaign</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>What I did appreciate was how elements of the multiplayer made their way into the campaign. Since each level is mostly set within a map you'll play again and again in multiplayer matches, it was nice to see those maps still open to you in a way that lets you choose your own approach in each firefight. It wasn't so linear that you were completely on a track the whole time; you had the space to try a different route or strategy, including destroying the entire building that a Pax soldier was taking cover in. You could also be revived (though this option is removed on the hardest difficulty) and revive your squadmates, and they would respond to different call-outs you make, adding a small flavouring of tactical shooter gameplay to the campaign.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, that element isn't executed very well and is easily ignored. There were also more than a few bugs I encountered while playing. Some were small and more comical, like watching a floating pair of goggles be handed to me, and others were genuine interruptions, like how every time you made it to a point in the level where you watched a short in-game cutscene, it awkwardly set you in position, cutting whatever momentum you began to feel. </p>



<p>There was also plenty of visual pop-in, and when I consider the bugs, with the lacking story, and the fact that some levels didn't have the kind of action-spectacle I'd expect, and how very silly it felt every time a member of the squad would yell out, "<em>Engineer down!</em>" or a different bark that represented a Pax soldeir by his assumed class, it all left me feeling like Battlefield 6's campaign lacks a few layers of polish.</p>

</figure>



<p>But even that still makes it a 'not bad' compared to other games at this scale doing a campaign, because most other shooters trying to be as big as Battlefield 6 don't even bother with a campaign nowadays. They go all-in on multiplayer.</p>



<p>Which is also true here, in many ways. In fact, when you finish the campaign, EA adds the "<em>Uninstall campaign</em>" button to the home screen to ensure you have enough space for the multiplayer and the constant updates it is sure to receive. So with that in mind, let's move on to the multiplayer, which is really what we're all here for.</p>



<p>A couple of bits of housekeeping to get out of the way first. Due to the fact that (<a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-ps5-retail-full-game-on-disk-no-download/">despite some copies getting into the wild</a>), there just simply weren't as many people playing in multiplayer matches over the course of the review period as there will be when the game is out and available to everyone, every match I played was filled with bots, one way or another.</p>



<p>I also didn't get to spend any time with Portal, though that's because it wasn't made available during the review period "<em>due to some unexpected infrastructure and global logistics issues</em>." EA clarified that the mode will be available at launch despite the issues preventing it from being available for reviews.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Battlefield 6 multiplayer</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>So the multiplayer experience I had for this review is not the one that you will have when you load up your first match on launch. But I can still talk about how the weapons feel, the maps, and the breadth of what's available to you in Battlefield 6's multiplayer.</p>



<p>Starting with the last point on that list: it's a lot. That's not to say it doesn't need more content, just that it has a good foundation at launch. There are seven game modes (not counting variations like CQB, Closed Weapons, or separating Squad and regular Team Deathmatch) for regular multiplayer play, each of them satisfying a different element of Battlefield gameplay. Conquest, Breakthrough, and Rush still deliver on the kind of spectacle I expect from a Battlefield game, and I'm very glad to see how well destruction has been implemented to add what was a missing piece from Battlefield 2042's gameplay.</p>



<p>Adding in the many variations on each mode, and the launch of Portal, and you'll always have an option for the kind of gameplay experience you want to have. It's also a strong suite of maps, though I already have favourites among the nine available at launch. Liberation Peak, Mirak Valley, and New Sobek City stand out as my top three maps for larger-scale battles, while Saints Quarter absolutely takes the cake for the close-quarters-focused maps. If anything, I would like to see smaller maps of the same calibre added to the roster sooner rather than later, since whenever I'm playing any other map, I just find myself wishing it were Saints Quarter instead.</p>



<p>That said, I don't want to see the large-scale maps get any bigger. I'd appreciate more verticality, but the size of these maps all feels just right for large-scale battles without feeling like you have to run for miles to get back into the action.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Battlefield 6 multiplayer</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>As I mentioned earlier regarding the weapons, they feel and sound great to use (the same goes for the vehicles), and I'm already enjoying working my way through to unlock each one, but I'm not entirely sold on how you unlock the full arsenal. It's not just about reaching an overall level or mastery; you have to complete specific challenges, which, on the one hand, is beneficial because you can focus on just completing that challenge instead of grinding to level 25 or whatever to unlock it. But I don't love how that switches your focus in a match from playing with your squad and completing the objective to completing your own personal goal, which might not be what your team needs in that moment.</p>



<p>I've no problem grinding for levels, I know that's the deal here, and I'm ready for that. It's a way to shake things up and opens an avenue through which you can dictate how you unlock and experience the weapons available. I'm just not sure I gel with it.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Battlefield 6 class loadouts UI</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>On the performance and technical side of things, besides the bugs I mentioned in the campaign, and some connection issues that were more likely due to something on my end or the fact that EA and Battlefield Studios were doing maintenance at times when the multiplayer servers were live for us to use, it was a smooth experience on my PlayStation 5 console. </p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>Of course, the reality when reviewing any multiplayer-focused game is that it will change. In six months' time, with new maps, weapons, vehicles, and game modes, Battlefield 6 could look entirely different. The <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-season-1-starts-october-28-roadmap-unveiled/">first new map, game mode, vehicle, and weapons</a> arrive before the end of the month on October 28. </p>



<p>And I'm really looking forward to it. The single-player experience might be lacking in polish, but the multiplayer experience couldn't be any shinier for launch. It's true; Battlefield is back, and I hope this is only the beginning, with the quality bar trending upwards from here.</p>

				<p>Battlefield 6 is an incredibly strong return to form for the series, with a multiplayer experience that is finely tuned with huge potential for what it could build into, destruction mechanics that bring a level of immersion back to the series that it was missing, and a more than solid visual and sound design package tying up how endlessly fun it is to play.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I used to have the time of my life with old&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/series/battlefield" rel="nofollow">Battlefield</a>&nbsp;</em>titles. You ever just take a grenade launcher to a house and completely demolish it in multiplayer, exposing enemy players to your gunfire? I thought the destruction in those games --&nbsp;<em>Bad Company 2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 3,&nbsp;</em>specifically -- was revolutionary, but we're in 2025, and&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6&nbsp;</em>is here to show you that destruction can get even bigger and better than ever.</p>

<p>Seriously, I can't get over how cool it is to fire tank missiles, grenades, and the like at buildings and blockades and see them crumble apart.&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6</em>&nbsp;goes all in on the cinematic, bombastic action and destruction it's known for, and delivers a powerful multiplayer experience, and, for better or for worse, a single-player campaign.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/battlefield-6-campaign.jpg?itok=rX4o2EQF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/battlefield-6-campaign.jpg?itok=YEwEy7fN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It does look beautiful, I'll give it that.</figcaption></figure><h2>Does the <em>Battlefield 6</em>&nbsp;Campaign Exceed Expectations?</h2>

<p>You heard that right,&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6&nbsp;</em>returns with a single-player story. I'm a sucker for campaigns, to the point that I found myself gravitating toward boomer shooters since most other <a href="https://techraptor.net/genre/first-person-shooter" rel="nofollow">FPS</a>' ditched singleplayer in favor of multiplayer-only content.</p>

<p>Needless to say, I was excited to see what&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6</em>&nbsp;had to offer. The year is 2028, and you play as multiple members of a special forces unit within the Marines, MARSOC. NATO's alliance is crumbling as it faces an unprecedented threat -- PAX Aramata.&nbsp;</p>

<p>PAX Armata is a fair compromise as a villain when you consider the current affairs of the world. Painting any particular country as a villain opens up a can of worms that is probably left closed. Any other enemy other than a fictitious one could hit too close to home. In this case, PAX Armata is like a conglomerate of mercenaries of no particular nation, yet they've managed to amass an army with the latest hardware.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/battlefield-6-campaign-explosions.jpg?itok=jGtqVC53 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/battlefield-6-campaign-explosions.jpg?itok=8j64jOQ7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Big ol' explosions! Whoom, boom!</figcaption></figure><p>Okay, that concept alone is already a little unrealistic, so I absolutely had to suspend my disbelief with&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6</em>. Perhaps I'm misremembering&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 3</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 4</em>'s campaigns, but I recall them being somewhat grounded in realism.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The campaign feels like something closer to&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty</em>&nbsp;than the&nbsp;<em>Battlefield&nbsp;</em>series I know. Or rather, it tries to imitate that over-the-top, action movie formula and fumbles. The plot is incoherently written to the point where most dialogue is military jargon that will fly over most players' heads, mine included.</p>

<p>It's a globe-trotting tale featuring your squad of Gary and Mary Sues. You'll fight PAX Armata in the backstreets of Cairo and in the rugged terrain of Tajikistan, and while I appreciate the variety of locales, something smaller and more focused would have been better than this hodgepodge of ideas thrown into a pot.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/battlefield-6-campaign-1.jpg?itok=mqTaSTd2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/battlefield-6-campaign-1.jpg?itok=wXJGRhjt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Gotta have a night vision level.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>The story ends so abruptly that I could scarcely believe it was over, not that I really cared for the story at that point. Thankfully, it's a pretty short narrative overall, so it's not there to waste your time. A lot of the campaign is actually to acquaint players with&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6</em>'s mechanics, like the squad dynamic and how vehicles operate.</p>

<p>Its gameplay, I suppose, is serviceable. There are some enjoyable, if mindless, sequences that can look amazingly cinematic. As an example, one mission has you command a tank platoon on the outskirts of Cairo. With a tank, you see&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6</em>'s destruction on full display, and it's chaotic, but bloody exciting as overpasses and buildings crumble before you.</p>

<p>There's one other mission that takes place within a large, open area. The type of landscape that the <em>Battlefield&nbsp;</em>is known for is these rural, sparsely populated war zones. You're supposed to take out several pieces of military hardware, and you can tackle those in whatever order.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/battlefield-6-sam.jpg?itok=Eg-SlXU5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/battlefield-6-sam.jpg?itok=907Ib-Kb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Down with SAM.</figcaption></figure><p>This non-linear mission shows a hint of promise and perhaps a vision for something greater, but that potential is never realized.&nbsp;You're even given a drone for this particular mission, which is horrifically effective and a bit scary when you think about how it's being used in real-life war.</p>

<p>And so, if you're able to turn your brain off, you'll actually find that the campaign can be enjoyable. Outside of the disappointing narrative, I didn't dislike its gameplay by any means because the gunplay in&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6</em>&nbsp;is so tight and refined, but mileage with it will vary. One playthrough is more than enough for me.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/battlefield-6-m277.jpg?itok=Ht6ERWIX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/battlefield-6-m277.jpg?itok=kqay0L3d 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>They could never make me hate you, M277.</figcaption></figure><h2>A Gun Nut's Delight</h2>

<p>Allow me to nerd out for a minute. Just a few years back, during the pandemic, the U.S. Army went out to bid for the Next Generation Squad Weapon. This was an effort to replace the now-dated M4, the de facto rifle of the time. In comes Sig Sauer's M7, the new rifle chosen to define the future of warfare.</p>

<p>The thing is, it's a pretty controversial firearm. Even though it conformed to the specs the U.S. Army put forth, it was a <em>hefty&nbsp;</em>boy.&nbsp;Not only that, it had a 20-round magazine (10 rounds less than its predecessor) in order to accommodate the larger cartridge it used.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is all to say, I'm a big stickler for gunplay in FPS games. It might not matter to some, but for me, how a weapon feels is pivotal to how I perceive the overall quality of the title.&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6</em>&nbsp;has, by far, some of the best gunplay in a AAA title, and this game's version of the M7 -- called M277 in this case -- made me realize that.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/battlefield-6-variable-zoom.jpg?itok=Pycjq_HZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/battlefield-6-variable-zoom.jpg?itok=EichiAQL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>J.A.R.V.I.S., enhance.</figcaption></figure><p>Another cool tidbit about the M7, it features a super fancy optic that features, among other things, a variable zoom. This means the scope can adjust according to how far out the target is.&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6</em>'s M277 also features this, and I fell in love with this damn thing. I felt like a real pro, zooming in or out in accordance with the target.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Battlefield Studios even gave that darn thing a 20-round mag, and man, you run out of ammo so fast, so I can see why it was a common complaint.&nbsp;You feel the power of the larger cartridge, though, and it was a blast to pick off enemies with this thing, even if I found myself reloading far more than I wanted to.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is just one of&nbsp;<em>many</em>&nbsp;weapons you can use in&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6</em>. As you play more multiplayer and rank up, you'll unlock new weapons. Focusing on a specific firearm will also allow you to choose from a myriad of attachments. Gun customization is as good as it gets in&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6.</em></p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/battlefield-6-progression.jpg?itok=3E-smb7H 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/battlefield-6-progression.jpg?itok=C_am5j38 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A steady stream of attachments and new guns means you'll be spoiled for choice.</figcaption></figure><p>The variety is really staggering here, and I found myself constantly switching between different guns in multiplayer. Each gun has a distinct feel, so nothing felt like a repeat of the other. Later on, I discovered the PW7A2, a submachine gun best used by the Engineer class. It has this attachment that allows you to sprint while shooting, changing up the way I approach gunfights with it.</p>

<p>I'm certain there will be a meta, as there always is in games such as this. I'm a casual enjoyer of&nbsp;<em>Battlefield</em>, so if you're a gun nut and love to customize and use various weapons, you can't go wrong here.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tank-gameplay-bf6.jpg?itok=GhPU7Clz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tank-gameplay-bf6.jpg?itok=S3bOIBhv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Put me in one of these bad boys and I'm gonna have a great time.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Battlefield</em>&nbsp;Multiplayer is Back and Better Than Ever</h2>

<p>But yes, the multiplayer is the premier&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6</em>&nbsp;experience. For complete transparency, I was able to play multiplayer during select times throughout my review period. That said, many of my games were composed of several players on either side, with the remaining slots being filled by bots.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bots inflated my ego a bit because they're not particularly smart. It was like shooting fish in a barrel. Either way, I expect&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6</em>'s multiplayer to have a healthy player count without the need for bots in most, if not all, games. I say that, not because it's a popular series, but because the multiplayer is that addicting.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bf6-multiplayer_0.jpg?itok=FOCymdfx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bf6-multiplayer_0.jpg?itok=_mtjcb3N 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Yeah, I dabble in a bit of camping, so what?</figcaption></figure><p>EA would shut off the servers for the day, and I'd feel sad I couldn't play more. The progression is addictive, acquiring and upgrading guns. There are tons and tons of challenges to complete, weapon camos to unlock, and more.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There is a nice variety of multiplayer game modes in&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6</em>. Whether you prefer short fights or long conflicts, there's something for you. Team deathmatch is a traditional FPS game mode comprising a lower number of players and closer quarters. This was a&nbsp;blast&nbsp;to play when we had a group of nearly all players.</p>

<p>Still, the smaller maps don't hit the same as the larger ones. The true&nbsp;<em>Battlefield&nbsp;</em>experience, in my mind, is these gigantic maps with tons of vehicles, mayhem, and destruction. You'll find that in spades here. During peak hours, we were able to get a larger group of reviewers together, and that's the most fun I've had in&nbsp;<em>Battlefield</em>&nbsp;in a long time.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/battlefield-6-multiplayer-map_0.jpg?itok=vaEXOJm9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/battlefield-6-multiplayer-map_0.jpg?itok=g4DauhZy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Keeping watch on the rooftops!</figcaption></figure><p>Everyone was either pushing objectives, riding in vehicles, or just causing utter mayhem. There I was with a Stinger launcher trying to shoot down every jet and helicopter just so I could be <em>that&nbsp;</em>guy, and it was cathartic. That vision of "all-out warfare" is the vision&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6</em>&nbsp;is trying to sell. It achieves just that.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This opinion stands only on those larger, open maps. While I did enjoy fighting in some of the more urban environments, I wasn't a particular fan of the layouts, especially those taking place within New York City. They felt too cramped despite being actually quite large in size, and too repetitive with all the buildings, many of which you couldn't enter.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/battlefield-6-loadout.jpg?itok=zuNcHUhe 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/battlefield-6-loadout.jpg?itok=h9Hppqz3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Gotta go with the grenade launcher, it's crucial!</figcaption></figure><h2>Fulfilling Your Role in&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6</em></h2>

<p>On the note of classes, the signature Assault/Engineer/Support/Recon makes a return in&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6</em>. Now, there's some contention about any class being able to use any weapon. At first glance, it seems to blur the lines of what makes a class what it is, and also that it might mean players just end up using whatever weapon is the most "meta."</p>

<p>Those are valid concerns, but Battlefield Studios makes an admirable effort to mitigate them. One way&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6</em>&nbsp;does this is by including "Signature Weapons." For the Support class, that's light machine guns. They get a benefit no other class gets from using LMGs, which is that they aren't slowed down by the rifle while sprinting. They can also aim down their sights faster, giving you a bit of an edge over, say, an Engineer using an LMG.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bf6-grenade-launcher.jpg?itok=BtQ-FOh3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bf6-grenade-launcher.jpg?itok=KqCJvsN8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Lobbing 'nades is fun.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>I found myself sticking to my class' designated weapons, but it's a toss-up if other players will feel inclined to do so as well. Personally, it's a smart inclusion and, at least in casual play, should make classes feel more distinct. Other than that, classes have different abilities and gadgets to further distinguish their role.</p>

<p>For example, Engineers have a range of launchers to choose from. They can, like other&nbsp;<em>Battlefield&nbsp;</em>titles, repair vehicles. We also have active abilities, so a Recon can live up to its name and toggle a UAV to disclose enemy locations. I actually sometimes forget about having these abilities, so it's good to get into the habit of using them right from the start.</p>

<p>I have some strong thoughts about the campaign. At this point, I think I've made my point that the story is incredibly lackluster. It's like a Michael Bay movie: All style, no substance. It's fun to look at, but that's about as much as you'll get out of the campaign.</p>

<p>Despite this drawback, the main attraction here is the multiplayer, and I had a helluva time with it. The tight, fierce gunplay kept me addicted to the progression so I could unlock more guns and customize them. The destruction and mayhem on the battlefield are cinematic and jaw-dropping, as well as incredibly immersive.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Yeah,&nbsp;<em>Battlefield</em>'s had a few fumbles here and there, but with&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6</em>, it feels like it's returning back to what it was meant to be. Pure, adrenaline-fueled multiplayer with rich destruction physics and plenty of guns and vehicles to commandeer.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A group of ex-ZeniMax Online Studios developers have banded together in order to form a new company by the name of Sackbird Studios, and it's pledging to create "bold, character-driven experiences".</p>

<p>Several of the developers involved in the formation of Sackbird were previously working on looter shooter&nbsp;<em>Project Blackbird&nbsp;</em>for Xbox, but that project was reportedly canceled during Microsoft's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/latest-microsoft-layoff-wave-king-zenimax" rel="nofollow">recent layoff frenzy</a>&nbsp;(which also saw studios like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/everwild-canceled-rare-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">Rare</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shut-down" rel="nofollow">The Initiative</a> impacted).</p>

<p>Now, however, as reported by <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/laid-off-zenimax-online-studios-developers-form-sackbird-studios" rel="nofollow">Game Developer</a>, a number of the staffers who were involved with that project, as well as with developing&nbsp;<em>The Elder Scrolls Online</em>, have formed Sackbird together, including luminaries like technical director Robert Ballantyne and tools engineer David Worley.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-elder-scrolls-online-zenimax-sackbird-studios.jpg?itok=B6EWujUM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-elder-scrolls-online-zenimax-sackbird-studios.jpg?itok=vcpjy5zr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Sackbird Studios has risen from the ashes of layoffs at&nbsp;<em>The Elder Scrolls Online&nbsp;</em>developer ZeniMax Online Studios.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Sackbird <a href="https://www.sackbirdstudios.com/news/studio-takes-flight" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">itself</a>, the studio is employee-owned and self-funded, and it will feature "no outside investors", thus giving its developers "full creative control". I really hope Sackbird can stick to those values in what is becoming an increasingly frantic and chaotic industry.</p>

<p>Worley says he and his team "wanted the freedom to take smart risks without waiting for a greenlight or chasing quarterly targets", and that the studio will "only answer to people who are passionate about games".</p>

<p>Other team members apparently describe Sackbird as a "developer-first environment with a long runway and a tight, senior team", which currently consists of fewer than ten people. I'm assuming that's being announced in order to demonstrate that there isn't a "too many cooks"-style issue at the top.</p>

<p>Sackbird is apparently already hard at work on its first project, which it describes as "an original project for PC and consoles", with more information becoming available "when the game is ready".</p>

<p>In any case, we'll have to wait and see just what exactly Sackbird Studios has in store for us. Stay tuned for more on this and all other things industry-related.</p>

First <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/rubiks-wowcube-announced/">announced earlier this year</a>, the Rubik’s WOWCube is a simpler 2x2 version of the puzzle that trades colored squares for 24 tiny color LCD displays. It still rotates like a traditional Rubik’s Cube, but instead of aligning colored squares those mechanics are used to play mobile games such as guiding a race car to the finish line by lining up track pieces scattered across its various screens.</p><p>Cubios debuted an earlier version of the WOWCube a few years ago, but in 2024 the <a href="https://wowcube.com/news/wowcube-teams-up-with-spin-master-owners-of-the-world-famous-rubik-s-cube-">company announced a collaboration with Spin Master</a>, which had acquired the Rubik’s brand in early 2021, for an officially licensed version of the device. It’s now <a href="https://wowcube.com/">finally available for preorder for a steep $299</a>, with shipping expected ahead of the holidays this year. Battery life is claimed to be up to five hours, and the WOWCube comes with a proprietary charger.</p><p>In addition to being able to rotate the 24 screens, the WOWCube features sensors allowing games to be played by tilting the entire cube, shaking, or tapping it. Through a mobile app you have access to the <a href="https://wowcube.com/store">WOWCube’s app store</a> which includes a mix of free and paid titles that are sent to the device wirelessly over Bluetooth. Cubios also offers an SDK for developers wanting to make their own apps or games.</p><p>The selection isn’t anywhere near as expansive as what you’ll find on Apple or Google’s app stores, but it includes versions of popular games like <em>Space Invaders, 2048,</em> and <em>Cut the Rope</em> that have been customized with unique gameplay for the WOWCube. There are also productivity apps like timers, screensavers that create tiny aquariums, and widgets that can display the weather, upcoming appointments, and even stock prices.</p><p>And yes, the WOWCube can even function like a traditional Rubik’s Cube. Should you fail to solve it on your own, instead of having to peel and reposition stickers to realign the colored squares, you can just reset it.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/797601/spin-master-rubiks-cube-wowcube-puzzle-app-store-mobile-games]]></content:encoded>

Developers Heart Machine have announced that its development is ending, with an unspecified number of layoffs at the studio having been announced at the same time.</p>
<p>It's a depressingly rapid downward trajectory for the follow-up to a game which generally received strong and positive reception, tempered by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hyper-light-drifter-impressions-2">some criticism</a> of elements such as how it handled communicating the best way to keep making forward progress.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Heart Machine confirmed the winding down of Hyper Light Breaker's development and the forthcoming layoffs to <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/heart-machine-making-layoffs-and-ending-development-on-hyper-light-breaker">Game Developer</a>, but didn't specify how many workers will be affected by the latter. "This was not our ideal path, but rather the only one available given the circumstances," the studio wrote in a statement.</p>
<p>"While this path will include a conclusion on the project, it reflects broader forces beyond our control, including shifts in funding, corporate consolidation and the uncertain environment many small studios like us are navigating today," they continued. Heart Machine went on to suggest that, while the game's full original vision will be left unrealised, there are plans to polish it as much as possible over the coming months.</p><p>"We still have something coming in January," a spokesperson told <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/heart-machine-making-layoffs-and-ending-development-on-hyper-light-breaker">Game Developer</a>. "We plan to deliver something meaningful and as polished and complete as we can given our current circumstances. We’re doing our best to refine what we can, complete key systems, and have the game culminate in a satisfying punctuation point."</p>
<p>They added that there'll be no updates or dev Q and A sessions for the rest of 2025, citing the need to be able to work on the final release while facing "limited resources with team members rolling off the project".</p>
<p>The early access version of Hyper Light Breaker which only came out in January this year, with news of its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hyper-light-breakers-first-major-update-is-taking-an-axe-to-its-structure-and-it-sounds-better-for-it">first major update</a> following in April. Despite the work that's gone in, a mixed initial reception has lingered. James summed up his thoughts after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hyper-light-breaker-early-access-review">jumping in right out of the gate</a> thusly:</p>
<blockquote><p>The real meat of a roguelike is, to be fair, not the climactic challenge but the preparation for it: the massing of gear and experience, and the primeval pleasure of Numbers Going Up. As much as Hyper Light Breaker is unfinished and more than slightly broken, its biggest issue is how that meaty part just isn’t all that enjoyable. The combat is awkward, the progression is doddering, and the world isn’t interesting enough to motivate indefinitely repeating visits to it. That makes for an awfully long to-do list, early access or no.</p></blockquote>
<p>Our best to all affected by the layoffs at Heart Machine.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p><span>It doesn’t take long until everything starts blowing up in </span><i><span>Battlefield 6</span></i><span>.</span></p> <p><span>After a lean introduction that outlines the collapse of international order in the late 2020s, you assume the role of Gunnery Sergeant Dylan Murphy, an American marine on a NATO base in Georgia. Murphy and his squadmates are about to evacuate this base ahead of its transfer of control to a giant private military company called, bleakly, Pax Armata. Within minutes, the base comes under a surprise attack from the impatiently aggressive PMC. Soldiers scream and die, gouts of flame blossom on the tarmac like nasty orange flowers. Gunfire rattles. Here are the explosions, ahead of schedule.</span></p> <p><i><span>Battlefield 6</span></i><span>’s opening plays out as a statement of intent. You are here, it knows, to shoot enemy soldiers and watch the vehicles, buildings, and natural world all around your character fall apart or combust in spectacular fashion. The point of the game, whether in its single-player campaign or multiplayer mode, is to make you feel like you’re an agent of small change within the overwhelming chaos of a warzone.</span></p>

 <p><span>To that end, the game’s first mission is a kind of Disneyland ride for the </span><i><span>Guns and Ammo</span></i><span> set. As Murphy, you grab the turret of a Humvee and rattle off hundreds of bullets at Pax forces as a landscape of greenly forested hills and concrete military installations flies by, speeding past exploding buildings and burning vehicles until there’s a chance to catch your breath on the lip of a cliffside overlooking an office building in mid-construction. From there, Murphy and his squad rush into a gunfight. You’re introduced to the on-foot rhythm of popping in and out of cover to shoot enemies, order a teammate to throw a grenade, and set charges to blow up the office, destroying data servers before Pax can capture them. The evacuation goes wrong and the level ends with Murphy and his team shot down in a helicopter, fighting off overwhelming forces in a heroic last stand.</span></p>

 <p><span>There’s a saccharine series of death scenes. Murphy reminds his friends that their motto is “unconquerable spirit” as their life drains, messy and red, onto an American flag conspicuously dropped onto the mangled floor of the helicopter. He alone is rescued in the nick of time. Murphy drapes the flag on a corpse, presses his hand to it, and watches blood spread out through the fabric and onto his gloves.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000633397" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000633397"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000633397">©EA</figcaption></figure> <p><span>This is hardly subtle stuff, but it is invigorating in a retrograde sense. It’s also, to </span><i><span>Battlefield 6</span></i><span>’s credit, something of a false indication of what’s to come. Over the eight missions to follow, the game tries–and sometimes succeeds–in subverting its players’ expectations of what a modern military shooter should look like, both in the direction the plot takes and in the ways that many fights play out.</span></p>

 <p><span>The campaign takes place over the course of nine missions, bookended by cinematics that show Murphy confronting a CIA agent sometime after the past-tense levels have taken place. Though the scope of the game is global, it’s told almost entirely through the perspective of Murphy and his fellow Americans in a special Marine squad dubbed Dagger 13. This means that the NATO allies encountered throughout the game serve only as backdrop for an international conflict that ends up largely centered on the United States.</span></p>

 <p><span>The exception is the primary villain of the game: a British Pax leader called Kincaid. </span><i><span>Battlefield 6</span></i><span> places its world-changing action within the context of personal relationships and so Kincaid is an embittered soldier formerly betrayed by an American comrade, a foil for Murphy’s doubting patriotism with a massive chip on his shoulder and a gruesome acid burn scar on his face to match.</span></p>

 <p><span>Much of the first half of the game sees Dagger 13 hunting down Kincaid for more information on his involvement with Pax Armata’s mysterious access to advanced technology. It’s a simple enough way to propel a plotline forward, and it works—though the campaign also moves between set pieces at such a breakneck pace that it could hold a hamster’s attention. The player is tossed between a variety of scenarios that break up the gunfighting formula, like one in which you lead a tank column between the wrecked cars and cracked roads of a bombed-out Egyptian highway, or another that sees you hopping across the wrenched-apart steel and concrete of a collapsing bridge.&nbsp;</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000633400" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000633400"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000633400">©EA</figcaption></figure> <p><span>There are also mission introductions that involve parachuting through the clouds and down past glowing tracer fire toward the cramped, sun-soaked streets of a war-torn Gibraltar. And, later in the same mission, a beach landing on a heavily defended shore where you rock along on an amphibious tank, battleships sinking into the waves behind you and artillery raining down on vehicles ahead. There’s a sense of choking dread in both cases, and especially in the latter, when crashing through the roiling sea and onto a beach defended by mounted guns, an inferno of oily black clouds of smoke and raging fires obscuring the view.</span></p> <p><span>Unfortunately, the finer points of each enemy encounter aren’t nearly as engaging as their presentation. The shooting is finely tuned, with the basic act of pattering bullets into a Pax soldier or punching a hole through the side of a wall with a rocket launcher gratifying. The enemies just aren’t very interesting to fight. Despite solid level layouts that facilitate basic, on-the-fly tactics like flanking or dodging into cover, enemy infantry typically arrives in waves of dopey soldiers running directly onto the battlefield from some hidden corner in lumped-together masses. Your AI squadmates, who can be ordered to shoot, toss smoke or frag grenades, and mark enemies, are pretty braindead, too. Though the trappings of just about every battle are vibrant and creative, they’re let down by a sense of artificiality at their center.</span></p>

 <p><span>The sound design in </span><i><span>Battlefield 6</span></i><span>, as in past entries to the series, goes a long way toward keeping the illusion of real danger present. Regardless of how pedestrian it might be (in video game terms) to shoot through encounters with one group of enemies after another, the crack of an overhead sniper shot or boom of a nearby explosion, bits of gravel dropping down like hailstones, provides a sense of deadly chaos. </span></p> <p><span>I</span><span>t’s also one of the highlights of </span><i><span>Battlefield 6</span></i><span>’s multiplayer. Freed from the confines of its story, the narrative reduced to a backdrop for eternal battles between NATO and Pax forces, the game comes alive as a lavish digital toybox. Over the review period, the multiplayer was mostly made available in two- or four-hour sessions, the servers filled with other reviewers and too many bots. While this makes it hard to gauge exactly how matches will feel once the game is properly live, a limited tour of the various modes and features represents, along with the beta test period from this summer, a worthwhile indication of what to expect.</span></p> <div>           <ul>                           <li>                 <p>Back-of-the-box quote:</p>                 <p>“It’s like World War III, but fun.”</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Developer:</p>                 <p>Battlefield Studios</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Type of game:</p>                 <p>Single-player and multiplayer military-themed first-person shooter.  </p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Liked:</p>                 <p>Appropriately nihilistic campaign, great sound and visual spectacle in campaign and multiplayer.</p>               </li>                               </ul><ul>                                         <li>                 <p>Disliked:</p>                 <p>Dull enemy AI and underdeveloped cast of characters; smaller maps and stripped-back modes are underwhelming.</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Platforms:</p>                 <p>PC (played), PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Release Date: </p>                 <p> October 10, 2025</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Played:</p>                 <p>Just over six hours to complete the campaign; roughly 10 hours of multiplayer.</p>               </li>                                     </ul>         </div>  <p><span>The maps are largely very good, especially in the case of a valley in Tajikistan, its ruined houses dwarfed by snowy mountain ranges, or the stretch of muddy ground surrounding a construction site outside of Cairo. In each of these, </span><i><span>Battlefield 6</span></i><span> shines by providing lots of room for grand engagements between infantry and tanks, helicopters and jets either attacking ground forces or fighting their own battles in the sky. </span></p>

 <p><span>The classic </span><i><span>Battlefield</span></i><span> frustration of spawning in and either immediately getting shot or blown up, or sprinting toward the center of the action only to get sniped from an unseen shooter, remains. But so, too, does the controlled chaos of large-scale combat between squads, all working toward the same objective in different ways. Fighting on-foot in a dilapidated house while tanks roar by outside the windows remains one of the most distinctive, exhilarating experiences in a multiplayer shooter. The smaller maps are less successful. While serviceable as a stripped-down infantry-on-infantry shooter, </span><i><span>Battlefield 6</span></i><span>’s combat works best when it’s augmented by other factors, like needing to mine routes that tanks might take toward an objective or shooting rockets at enemy helicopters. In comparison, close-quarters fighting just isn’t as strong of a draw.</span></p>  <p><span>There’s a lot to do in multiplayer as well, and a good amount of flexibility in how to do it. After every match, across a wide variety of game modes, a confetti blast of new weapon attachments and vehicle customization options fills the screen, providing incentive to continue customizing your approach to combat until, in coming months, the real obsessives kill the joy of experimentation by locking down a mathematically superior loadout for every class. At its core, though, the focus on objective-based modes and the enjoyment that comes from taking any part in such large-scale matches means that even the lousiest player can get something out of the multiplayer.</span></p> <p><i><span>Battlefield 6</span></i><span>’s general look and feel is easier to appreciate when playing online, but its campaign is still worthwhile as tone-setting and a piece of modern military fiction in its own right. The characters are too flat, and the plot fails to dig deep enough into its richest elements, but there’s a bitterly nihilistic edge to the story that speaks to something truer than its paranoiac World War III premise might suggest. As the plot progresses, the instances of patriotic heroism its characters try to engage in ring hollower and hollower. The flag-centric last stand from the opening mission seems like a cruel joke to the Americans of Dagger 13, who begin to see, in the nakedly monetary goals of Pax Armata, an unintended reflection of their own nation and the crumbling goals of Western hegemony.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000633395" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000633395"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000633395">©EA</figcaption></figure> <p><span>There’s an honesty to this tone and narrative. Like the climate apocalypse backdrop of </span><i><span>Battlefield 2042</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Battlefield 6</span></i><span> is a game that acknowledges the doomed trajectory of the current Western political landscape and, rather than offer a hopeful alternative, figures we all might as well enjoy the dramatic thrills of its take on a world order falling violently apart. It points very directly to America’s stewardship of this process but assigns real blame to a Hobbesian understanding of human nature—one in which survival, in the form of moneymaking, is an eternal guiding principle that will send us all to ruin.</span></p> <p><span>At one point, the villainous Kincaid poses a question to one of the Dagger 13 heroes: “Don’t you want to die for something real?” And the answer, by then, is clear. There’s nothing worth dying for when these characters can no longer believe in their country or its allies.</span></p> <p><i><span>Battlefield 6</span></i><span>’s campaign is too unevenly executed to make its vision as compelling as it ought to be, but it still works well enough to inflect the entire game with a healthy cynicism unusual for the genre. Though every multiplayer military shooter feels at least slightly callous when viewed from a distance, unending war modeled with a twinned desire for both realism and the rendering down of martial violence into sport, </span><i><span>Battlefield 6</span></i><span> manages to make a natural home for its design ethos in that discordance. It finds the road to global ruin pretty exciting, and believes that you will, too. For the most part, it’s right.</span></p>      </div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-review-steam-ps5-campaign-multiplayer-2000633379]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Heart Machine, developer of 2016’s hit action-RPG <i>Hyper Light Drifter</i>, has fallen on hard times after that game’s follow-up, the roguelike prequel <i>Hyper Light Breaker</i>, failed to resonate with players. Still officially in Early Access, the game will get some more attention from Heart Machine, but the studio has announced that it is winding down development, and that members of the team have been laid off.</p> <p>“We’ve had to make the difficult decision to part ways with a number of talented team members,” Heart Machine said in a statement (h/t <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/roguelike/still-in-early-access-hyper-light-breakers-ending-development-and-laying-off-staff-this-was-not-our-ideal-path-but-rather-the-only-one-available-given-the-circumstances/">Joshua Wolens at <i>PC Gamer</i></a>). Attributing the challenges its facing to “broader forces beyond our control, including shifts in funding, corporate consolidation and the uncertain environment many small studios like us are navigating today,” Heart Machine has hit bumpy patches in the past as well, with <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/hyper-light-breaker-developer-heart-machine-confirms-layoffs">a previous round of layoffs</a> implemented toward the end of 2024, Though it seems like <i>Hyper Light Breaker</i> might never be completed in the ways its creators once envisioned and hoped for, the studio is promising to issue an update in January and bring <i>Breaker</i> to some kind of finish line.</p>

 <h2>‘As an avid <i>Hyper Light Drifter Fan</i>, I have tried to enjoy this game multiple times. I just can’t’</h2> <p>Fans of the very cool and visually captivating 2016 indie hit <i>Hyper Light Drifter</i> have, by and large, failed to latch on to what <i>Breaker</i> is offering. “I just can’t,” <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198372477945/recommended/1534840/">reads one Steam review</a> of the game in its present Early Access state. “The only thing that actually ties this game to <i>Drifter</i> is the title of the game and the art style. […] Characters currently are limited to select weapons to artificially promote character diversity. Extraction as a concept is pointless aside from being a source of infinite health.”</p>

 <p>“The core combat feels decent enough at times,” <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/BloodClayston/recommended/1534840/">reads another negative review</a>. “But pretty much everything this game has to offer is either very rough around the edges or just questionably designed, on top of a large amount of smaller issues that quickly add up.”</p>

 <p>It’s not all doom and gloom in the reviews section. Some folks seem to be more patient with the game in its Early Access state, while others are finding genuine fun. Still, these are the lesser voices speaking out behind the game’s “Mixed” user review status on Steam.</p> <p>Though the game is still going to receive some attention, it’s unfortunate that its creators will never be able to implement their full vision for it, and particularly unfortunate that people have lost their livelihoods. Heart Machine continues on with its other projects, including the side-scroller <i>Possessor(s) </i>due out next month. “We are deeply grateful to everyone who contributed to all of our projects, and to our community for their continued support as we look forward to the future of Heart Machine,“ the statement says.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Battlefield 6 Campaign Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-campaign-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-campaign-review.1320889/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s been seven years since the last Battlefield campaign. A decade since the last one set in the modern day — the intriguing, but ultimately flawed Hardline. In that time, Doom and its sequels took the speed of a single-player first-person shooter to the next level, Titanfall 2 pushed level design forward in inventive ways, and even Call of Duty reinvented itself on several different occasions to varying degrees of success. But Battlefield 6 has little interest in innovation, instead firmly looking back at what made the series so successful two console generations ago. Aside from being an impressive technical showcase at times, its small set of routine missions has little new to offer. There is <em>some </em>variety and a few moments of impressive scale to be found, but it’s all over so quickly you barely have time to savour them. Though it never quite feels like a full-on afterthought, it’s a campaign that comes across as the sidearm of Battlefield 6’s arsenal when placed alongside its more grand multiplayer suite.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Across its nine missions, Battlefield 6 zips around at a furious pace, but I couldn’t help but feel that I’d done it all before, albeit at much lower fidelity. It’s flashy, but lacking when it comes to genuinely interesting level design, with its great feeling gunplay not supported by what you’re asked to achieve with it. On one hand, it makes sense for Battlefield Studios to take this approach and treat the campaign as a training ground for its trademark large-scale online warfare — the pure size and number of enemies that flood the screen in its missions are certainly in conversation with this. But in the other palm, it crushes all hope of crafting a thrilling story that has the chance of stepping out of the shadow cast by those multiplayer modes.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Battlefield 6: Single-Player Campaign Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s not to say there aren’t splashes of inspiration. A particular highlight was a sequence that takes place on a crumbling New York bridge. It’s at least visually interesting, even if it offers no great variance in what it’s asking you to do gameplay-wise. There’s just no one mission that screams out as an all-timer here, even if there are attempts to ape Modern Warfare’s Clean House — which fails to capture any of the desired tension — or its own version of a Normandy landing as you storm a Gibraltar beach. It’s, oddly, very much a ‘Call of Duty’ campaign in its map and objective design, and struggles to stamp much of the signature Battlefield large-scale action that made me fall in love with the series. I find it frustrating not to see risks being taken creatively, especially when such a vast budget is available to fuel such ambition.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One later chapter set amongst the mountains of Tajikistan does take place in a wide open area and echoes the multiplayer roots of the series, as you’re encouraged to take your own approach when completing the task at hand. In theory, this could be exciting, with all manner of airborne and ground vehicles ready to be controlled at your fingertips and a vast library of weaponry and gadgets to gear up with. In practice, it presents as more of a thin veneer of choice rather than drastically different ways to tackle objectives, with the range of tools at your disposal kept frustratingly limited. You’re given a drone to play with and a choice of ATVs and armored trucks to drive, but little beyond that. I’m just not a fan of this larger map approach when it comes to first-person shooter campaigns, much preferring an authored hand to level design, rather than being handed a box of crayons to make my own fun with. These stretches are worryingly close to Modern Warfare 3’s “open combat missions” at times — a memory I never wanted to relive, yet again so soon after, but at least they do feel philosophically more at home as Battlefield arenas.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I wanted to be the star of the show, but I just ended up feeling like a passenger.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Thankfully, these don’t make up the majority of the campaign, but what’s found in its smaller scope staging isn’t any more exciting. You’ll often find yourself hunkering down in tight city streets or behind hulking tanks, waiting for the right opportunity to pop your head out. A run-and-gun mentality simply isn’t welcomed here, with a patient, cover-based approach encouraged — the gunplay is snappy at least, with a satisfying weight to it whenever you do choose to open fire. Assault rifles and LMGs pack a powerful punch and serve as efficient tools when faced with another wave of enemies, and sniper rifles are satisfingly devastating — even if the enemy AI displays little brain to blow out. It gets especially exciting when the impressive destruction tech takes a chunk out of the building you’ve been finding solace in, and you’re forced to scramble to another safe haven. These claustrophobic moments of true jeopardy really are all too rare, though, as for the most part, the campaign is reduced to rinse and repeat objectives that were getting old in FPS campaigns a decade ago. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Having one mission include a sequence where you need to destroy anti-aircraft guns or SAM sites can be forgiven, but doing this on more than <em>three </em>occasions is just downright boring and grinds any gathered momentum to a halt. There are only so many times planting C4 can be considered a fun time, and all too often, you are tasked with standing still amongst the action and pressing a single button in order to continue. On multiple occasions, I was asked to watch some explosions that I didn’t even get to set off take place, or sit in the back of a speeding vehicle and control a mounted turret that only gives you a mild feeling of being responsible for the carnage on screen. It's on-rails all too often, taking its most exciting moments out of your hands and displaying them in cutscenes, resulting in much of the campaign feeling like the most straight-faced Disney ride ever built. I wanted to be the star of the show, but I just ended up feeling like a passenger.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">An early mission that takes you through an abandoned WW2 tunnel network-turned-museum to the decades-old war serves as an unfortunate symbol for the campaign as a whole — a relic of first-person-shooter design dressed up in a new guise. Being funneled through corridors towards the next static shooting gallery to gun down fish in a barrel is hardly exciting in 2025, and it barely was 20 years ago. Outside of a series of tank battles as dry as the desert roads they take place on, it attempts to sprinkle very little of that Battlefield magic into the mix, largely negating environment destruction as part of your toolkit and never once putting you in control of an airborne vehicle. Is it really Battlefield if I’m never zooming along in a fighter jet or unleashing hell from a helicopter gunship?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s a slight glimmer of tactical ops magic to be seen, as you can call on your squadmates to activate their personalised skills to help you in a fight. They each come packed with their own multiplayer-class-flavoured abilities, such as Gecko, the recon specialist, being able to tag targets, which, admittedly, does make certain situations ridiculously easy, as every enemy in the area is revealed to you instantly. Ultimately, though, each member ends up playing practically the same and feels like another missed opportunity to add a dash of variety into the mix.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">They each fall under the banner of an expert Marine Raider squad called Dagger 1-3 — an unfittingly sharp name for such a dull bunch. On the whole, they’re a fairly cookie-cutter military unit who love nothing more than getting their boots on the ground and shouting “hooah”, with memorable character moments near non-existent. The performances and the shells of humans they inhabit are wholly forgettable, barely coming across as fully formed, and it’s hard to detect any sort of emotion, even when one of their own falls in the line of fire. Nuance is hardly the name of the game when it comes to Battlefield 6’s campaign, though, and its story, centered on taking down a rogue private military force called Pax Armata (ironically, Latin for Armed Peace), proves to be anything but a peaceful one.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Battlefield Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a fairly straightforward affair that doesn’t leave too much room for interpretation. For a military shooter about the collapse of NATO, it’s all oddly apolitical in its presentation, and as such, it feels like it has nothing of real substance to say. It’s safe, and as a result, largely uninteresting. At least Call of Duty has attempted to take on subjects such as chemical warfare and terrorism, even if they’ve ultimately been misguided efforts that come across as antithetical to its larger message. It’s not easy to present such important themes delicately, so I can understand why Battlefield Studios may have felt like trying to fire and catch a bullet laced with hot-button issues may have been a risk not worth taking when it could simply choose not to pull the trigger at all. It just means it doesn’t have anything to say on a global or personal level, and all feels a little hollow as a result. It’s a far cry from when the series did tell some engaging tales through the eyes of fun characters in its Bad Company days.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I did also fall victim a few annoying little glitches on the way, such as my character zipping across the screen involuntarily, fuzzy textures popping in, and occasional bullets aimed right at enemy heads leaving zero impact. But on the whole, there’s no denying that it looks and sounds very impressive, with spectacular explosions peppering skylines and gunfire whizzing and cutting through smoke and debris as mayhem ensues around you with regularity. I just wish there was a little more substance hiding behind it all.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Simon Cardy is a Senior Editor at IGN who can mainly be found skulking around open world games, indulging in Korean cinema, or despairing at the state of Tottenham Hotspur and the New York Jets.

It’s a staggering spectacle to behold at times, and a treat for the ears at others, but when it comes to mission design and an engaging plot, it fails to deliver at all. A quick afternoon of fun, it's a safe reimagining of what Battlefield once was, but far from a bold reinvention of what it could, and maybe should, be now.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-campaign-review]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">It is one of the most debated unanswered questions in all video games: how much will <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> cost? Amid the speculation, new research has suggested that a $100 price point would actually earn Rockstar <em>less</em> money than if went for the “sweet spot” of $70.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick is often asked how much GTA 6 will cost, with some predicting fans would be willing to fork out $100 for what is expected to be the biggest entertainment launch of all time. And each time he’s asked, Zelnick dances around the question, pointing to delivering value for customers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Adding fuel to the scrutiny is the industry's recent jump from $70 to $80 for some games. If Nintendo is charging $80 for Nintendo Switch 2 games like Mario Kart World, and Microsoft, as many expect, jumps to $80 for its games from next year after backtracking on doing just that this year, then it's hard to see GTA 6 priced any cheaper.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But we just don’t know what Rockstar plans to do. Analysts, meanwhile, have offered a mixed set of predictions. Earlier this year, a $100 GTA 6 was mooted by Epyllion CEO and analyst Matthew Ball in a <a href="https://www.matthewball.co/all/stateofvideogaming2025" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>lengthy presentation on the state of gaming in 2025</u></a>. Near <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-price-many-in-the-video-game-industry-hope-for-80-if-not-100-analyst-says"><u>the end of the presentation</u></a>, Ball said that “some gamemakers hope GTA 6 will be priced at $80 to $100, breaking the $70 barrier and helping $50 titles to move up to $60, $60 to do $70, $70 to $80 etc."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Packaged game prices have never been lower in real terms than they are today — even though budgets are at all-time highs and player growth is stalled,” Ball wrote. “GTA 6 could re-establish packed video game prices after decades of deflation despite rampant cost growth.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-at-100-would-be-a-bridge-too-far-even-for-grand-theft-auto">Other analysts have poured cold water on the $100 suggestion though</a>, saying that such is the huge excitement around GTA 6 that there’s simply no need to limit the game’s potential audience by pricing some out of the experience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, new research has claimed that if Rockstar were to go with $100 for GTA 6, it would actually cost the company money, insisting the revenue “sweet spot” remains $70.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A MIDiA Research study, reviewed by IGN, rejected the $100 price point for GTA 6. MIDiA’s model, which leans on the Gabor-Granger pricing analysis and a nationally representative survey of more than 2,000 U.S. consumers, shows that going for $70 would maximise sales potential and keep fans happy. A $100 launch price, however, would reduce both unit sales and overall revenue.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">$69.99 specifically generates the maximum revenue of any of the prices asked in the survey, MIDiA Research's Tsion Tadesse told IGN, and this ties into existing research suggesting that consumer psychology favours prices ending in .99</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perry Gresham, Head of Data at MIDiA Research and co-author of the report, said: “Our research suggests that GTA 6 will generate more revenue at a standard $69.99 price point than the much discussed $100. A $100 price point would actually leave money on the table.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Any revenue increase from people who still buy GTA 6 above the “optimum” price of $70 would be less than the lost revenue from those who do not, the data suggests.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">GTA 6 Lucia Caminos Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Brandon Sutton, Games Analyst at MIDiA and co-author of the report, added: “Our research shows that 59% of consumers have some interest in purchasing GTA 6, highlighting the immense appeal and commercial potential of the game. This notoriety also makes GTA 6 the perfect test case to understand consumer expectations around video games pricing. Our findings should serve as a caution to game developers looking to raise game prices in the future.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Key findings include:</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>60% of consumers who expressed interest in GTA 6 said they would 'definitely' or 'probably' buy the game at $69.99</li><li>35% of consumers who expressed interest in GTA 6 said they would 'definitely' or ‘probably’ buy the game at $99.99</li><li>79% of consumers who expressed interest in GTA 6 said they would 'definitely' or 'probably' buy the game at $49.99, compared with 16% who said the same at $149.99.</li><li>At the highest price point of $149.99, superfans were almost twice as likely to purchase as the average consumer (9% vs. 5%), though not enough to offset the wider drop in sales.</li><li>Launching at the optimal price point would result in around 8.6% of the U.S. adult population purchasing the game, equating to 22.9 million copies sold and approximately $1.6 billion in revenue.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Price is just one of the many unanswered questions swirling around GTA 6. Another is what Rockstar plans to do with GTA Online. Could the company charge more for access to GTA Online? Will it be a standalone free download? Could Rockstar sell a subscription? Will Rockstar and Take-Two really keep GTA Online available at no additional cost, as before?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hopefully it won’t be long before we get answers. GTA 6 is due out May 26, 2026, on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

                <p>Two of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-rpg-ps5/2900-6701/" data-ref-id="2900-6701">best RPGs on PS5</a> will soon be available in a convenient new bundle, as the <a href="https://na.store.square-enix-games.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-_-rebirth---twin-pack-physical-edition" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade and Rebirth Twin Pack Physical Edition</a> is set to arrive on December 4. Its name is a mouthful, but it's shaping up to be the easiest way for players to catch up on the first two entries in the planned trilogy. It's only releasing for PS5, but preorders should be opening soon--and we're expecting the twin pack to be quite popular.</p><p>There are a few caveats with this cool bundle. For one, there's some confusion with its release date and preorders. The official <a href="https://www.square-enix-games.com/en_US/news/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-rebirth-twin-pack-physical-edition-now-available-ps5" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Square Enix blog</a> says the Twin Pack is "now available," while its <a href="https://x.com/finalfantasyvii/status/1976271756118868009" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">social media</a> accounts claim it's dropping on December 4. The latter is clearly the correct date, but unfortunately, no preorders have opened. Folks in the UK and Europe might have some luck on the Square Enix Store, but the <a href="https://na.store.square-enix-games.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-_-rebirth---twin-pack-physical-edition" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">link</a> for North America currently leads to a lovely 404 error.</p><p>At any rate, we're hoping to see it at additional retailers in the future, though no plans have been made official by Square Enix. It's also unclear if it'll eventually launch on platforms beyond PS5. The trilogy has been confirmed to arrive on Switch and Xbox (starting with Remake Intergrade on January 22), but there's no mention as to whether this Twin Pack is included in the multiplatform plans. Hopefully things become clearer as we get closer to its December 4 release.</p><p>Can't wait until December to dive in? You can find <a href="https://www.amazon.com/FINAL-FANTASY-REMAKE-INTERGRADE-PlayStation-5/dp/B08XNRM6QN?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a> for $40 and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Final-Fantasy-VII-Rebirth-PlayStation-5/dp/B0CGXZQ4CD?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Rebirth</a> for $50 at Amazon.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Nintendo has updated the library of games in its SNES portion of Nintendo Switch Online, but one addition is more significant than most. Mario &amp; Wario, a 1993 puzzle spin-off of both the Mario and Wario series has come west for the first time in history. It's joined by two other games, Bubsy in: Claws Encounters of the Furred Kind and Fatal Fury Special, and you can check out all three in the video below.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/13ieq0wTB2E"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/13ieq0wTB2E" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Mario &amp; Wario was developed by Game Freak, a studio primarily known for its world-famous Pokémon series. In fact, much of the team behind Pokémon Red, Blue, and Green is credited on Mario &amp; Wario as well; both games are directed by Satoshi Tajiri, feature art from Ken Sugimori, and include music from Junichi Masuda. In the game, you control a fairy named Wanda who helps Mario navigate various obstacles while his eyes are covered with Wario's various traps, including barrels and giant eggshells.</p><p>Like Mario Paint, Mario &amp; Wario uses a mouse peripheral as its main controller, and the player clicks the screen to manipulate the environment and safely bring Mario to his goal. On Switch 2, you can use a Joy-Con 2 to play, but for Switch 1, you'll need a USB mouse plugged into the console.</p><p>Meanwhile, Bubsy in: Claws Encounters of the Furred Kind is the first in the Bubsy series, a mascot platformer from 1993. While modern attempts to revive the character have been largely unsuccessful, this first outing was received very well, with Game Informer's staff at the time giving it an average score of 8.75 <a href="https://gameinformer.com/magazine-archive/9-bubsy-in-claws-encounters-of-the-furred-kind">and putting it on the cover of our ninth issue</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Fatal Fury Special, on the other hand, is an enhanced version of Fatal Fury II, including more characters and faster animations. All three games are available on Nintendo Switch Online for Switch 1 and 2 starting today.

            <p>It took 14-and-a-half years of walking but finally someone has made it to the edge of the world. Of Minecraft.</p>
<p>That person is Kurt J. Mac, and he began his adventure on 28th March 2011 with one goal in mind: reach the rumoured Far Lands - the theoretical hard edge of a Minecraft world - and on Sunday, 4th October, he made it.</p>
<p>Mac streamed the occasion, as he has streamed every footstep of his adventure so far. He was in a wooden boat at sea and rowed forward, and as he did, a strange wall began to arise before him on the horizon, shaped like a top-down view of a world. This, apparently, is the Far Lands.</p>

<p>The Far Lands is a romantic name for a bug in the game's code, essentially. It's where the world starts to garble and glitch and break, if a player were to reach it. Minecraft creator Markus "Notch" Persson revealed this bug in a blog post (since taken down) in 2011, and it was this bug that prompted the journey Mac's been on.</p><p>852 recorded episodes later, Mac has made a living from it, gathering a strong following on both YouTube and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a>. There's <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/a-journey-to-the-end-of-the-world-of-minecraft">a nice piece on The New Yorker written by Eurogamer contributor Simon Parkin</a>, which picks up on Mac's story three years in. At the time of writing, it was estimated that Mac, at the speed he was going, wouldn't reach the edge of the Minecraft world for another 22 years. He has shaved considerable time off of that estimate, then.</p>

<p>Reaching the edge of virtual worlds is something that fascinates me, so this feels like a good opportunity to point you towards the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FM9CqgIve_o">Red Dead Redemption 2-related short film The Grannies</a>, in which a group of players exploit a crack in the game's playing boundary and break through.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sakurais-a-fan-of-this-award-winning-monastic-adventure-and-now-its-coming-to-switch.1320850/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>One of the most unique video games of 2024 was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/indika">Indika</a>, a third-person adventure game where you play as a nun who has a connection to the Devil itself. It's a surreal, absurd adventure and it addresses faith, religion, and authority with a darkly comic (and tragic) tone.</p>
<p>And now, Odd Meter's extremely unusual title is coming to Switch on <strong>17th November</strong>, with a physical version following over a week later, on <strong>28th November</strong>. The above trailer (via Gematsu) <em>really</em> doesn't give away much except that there's nothing else quite like it!</p>
<p>But, if you need a little encouragement, just last month, Indika won the Game Designers Award at the Japan Game Awards, presented by none other than <strong>Smash Bros.</strong> and <strong>Kirby</strong> maestro Masahiro Sakurai.</p>
<p>At the ceremony, Sakurai gave the audience some background on the game, and detailed what makes it special — in the form of a short movie. Well, it's a lot of recorded gameplay with some explanations of some of the mechanics.</p>
<p>Sakurai praises the variety, the atmosphere, the story, and the questions it pushes onto the player (approximately translated via <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NyLPvWz3_lY">the Japan Game Awards stream</a>).</p>
<p>For more details on the game, we'll throw it over to the press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>A Surreal Journey Through 19th-Century Russia<br></strong>Set in an alternative Russia at the turn of the 19th century, <em>INDIKA</em> follows a young nun as she ventures beyond the monastery walls, accompanied by the most unexpected companion imaginable: the devil himself. What begins as a simple errand quickly transforms into a surreal and darkly comic odyssey, exploring themes of faith, authority, comedy, and tragedy with a uniquely inventive twist.</p>
<p><strong>Meet Indika: Not Your Ordinary Nun<br></strong>Indika appears to live a quiet, monastic life, but her unlikely friendship with the horned tempter drags her into a world where the sacred collides with the profane. Every step reveals new mysteries and challenges, immersing players in a story reminiscent of Dostoyevsky’s depth and Bulgakov’s surreal humour.</p>
<p><strong>Explore a Bold Indie Vision<br></strong>Developed by Odd Meter, <em>INDIKA</em> blends atmospheric exploration, dark humour, and inventive puzzles across surreal landscapes. Its distinctive style is punctuated by 2D pixel-art mini-games that reveal hidden layers of Indika’s past.</p>
<p><strong>Key Features:<br></strong>- Third-person, story-driven adventure with darkly comic tones<br>
- A young nun’s journey of self-discovery across a surreal reimagining of 19th-century Russia<br>
- The devil as an unlikely and mischievous companion<br>
- Puzzle-solving and exploration interwoven with narrative<br>
- Surreal, atmospheric environments with striking visual design<br>
- 2D pixel-art mini-games that illuminate Indika’s backstory</p>
</blockquote>


<p>Our sister site Push Square reviewed the game back in May 2024, and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/indika">were full of praise</a>. One for the radar, we think.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>Indika launches on Switch next month on 17th November. Will you be checking this one out? let us know in the comments!</em></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/sony-amd-mark-cerny-jack-huynh-project-amethyst-ps6-playstation-6/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mark-cerny-seems-to-tease-playstation-6-arrival-in-%E2%80%9Ca-few-years-time%E2%80%9D.1320847/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, in a new video published by Sony and AMD, PlayStation console architect Mark Cerny and AMD's senior vice president and general manager of computing and graphics, Jack Huynh, talked about Project Amethyst and the two companies' "<em>shared vision</em>" for the future of gaming technologies and hardware. While most of the video was focused on what these three technologies will be, Cerny did slide in a slight tease for when we'll be seeing PlayStation 6 and that next generation of hardware.</p>



<p>"<em>Overall, it's of course still very early days for these technologies, they only exist in simulation right now, but the results are quite promising, and I'm really excited about bringing them to a future console, in a few years time</em>," Cerny said towards the end of the video after <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-unveils-radiance-cores-neural-arrays-universal-compression-next-gen-rdna-gpu-architecture/">discussing advancements like Neural Arrays, Radiance Cores, and Universal Compression</a> for most of the video.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="From Project Amethyst to the Future of Play: AMD and Sony Interactive Entertainment’s Shared Vision" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ItXPvGrI6gY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>It's not a lot to go off, of course, but it does at least give us public confirmation of the timeline that Cerny, Sony, and AMD have in their heads for when we can expect PlayStation 6.</p>



<p>The PlayStation 5 was released in 2020, with its mid-generation refresh and improved 'professional' version arriving last year in 2024. It wouldn't be surprising to see the PlayStation 5 generation last at least seven or eight years, putting an estimated release window for PlayStation 6 in 2028 or even 2029.</p>



<p>Even with the next generation still being years away, we've already heard several rumours about what the PS6 will include, like rumoured specs that <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps6-specs-rumor-34-40-tflops-6-12-rt-performance-uplift/">estimate it'll have somewhere between 34 and 40 teraflops</a>, and even what it'll not include, like a built-in disc drive that's tied to the console. It'll instead <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-reportedly-have-detachable-disc-drive-at-launch-ps6/">have a detachable disc drive at launch</a>, which lines up with the current state of new PS5 consoles, since the disc drive on every model PlayStation makes now is detachable.</p>



<p>The video is an exciting prospect of what's to come from PlayStation hardware and AMD in the future. Hopefully, whenever it does arrive, it'll have been worth the wait.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/uesp-wiki-met-with-bethesda-to-design-a-character-for-the-elder-scrolls-vi-and-left-%E2%80%98extremely-excited-about-what%E2%80%99s-in-store%E2%80%99.1320844/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The team behind the <a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Main_Page" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">UESP wiki</a>, the Unofficial Elder Scrolls Pages (the most reputable fan-made wiki dedicated to The Elder Scrolls franchise), <a href="https://x.com/UESP_net/status/1976097106516639813" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that they have met with Bethesda Game Studios to design a character for The Elder Scrolls VI. They also claimed to have left the meeting 'extremely excited' about what's coming.</p>



<p><em>We just finished up a meeting with Bethesda where we got to design a character for The Elder Scrolls VI. Honestly, a lot of us went into the meeting pretty nervous and even reserved, but now we're all extremely excited for what's in store.</em></p>



<p>Now, they did not clarify exactly what they're excited about. They might have been given a rough outline of what will be in the game; they might have actually seen footage from an early build; or they might just be talking about that character they have designed and how it's coming along. They won't be able to say anything more for now due to the Non-Disclosure Agreement they were no doubt forced to sign beforehand.</p>



<p>Either way, this will get TES VI fans talking for a while. After all, it's been a very long time since Bethesda formally announced The Elder Scrolls VI. It was at E3 2018 that the studio let everyone know about its existence, but it was just a reassurance that the studio would not abandon its trademark single player RPGs following the Fallout 76 experiment. BGS then set to make Starfield, its first new IP in over 25 years, and TES VI <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-vi-is-officially-in-early-development-but-you-wont-hear-any-more-about-it-for-some-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">only entered active production on August 30, 2023</a>, following the launch of Starfield. Elder Scrolls Game Director Todd Howard had teased just a few days before that The Elder Scrolls VI <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-vi-ultimate-fantasy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">would be the 'ultimate fantasy world simulator'</a>. </p>



<p>A few months later, in March 2024, Bethesda celebrated the franchise's 30th anniversary by <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-vi-early-builds-are-being-played-right-now-at-bethesda/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealing</a> that early builds of TES VI were being playtested internally. Its release window is still far from our grasp, but chances are it might happen between 2027 and 2028. It would certainly be a fantastic year for Western RPG fans if The Witcher IV and The Elder Scrolls VI launched in the same year, and that's not so far-fetched as things stand.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/nintendo-pikmin-short-animated-film-mario-zelda-app-2000633651</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo%E2%80%99s-short-films-feel-like-they-could-be-the-start-of-something-much-bigger.1320835/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Fans spent a lot of time trying to decipher <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-just-shared-a-4-minute-pixar-like-animated-short-with-no-explanation-2000632524">possible clues hiding in a recent Pixar-like Nintendo short film</a> featuring a baby and, as it turned out later on, <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendos-mysterious-animated-short-was-a-pikmin-tease-after-all-2000633212">Pikmin</a>. Were they a tease for a new <em>Pikmin</em> game? Rosalina’s origin story in the <em>Mario Galaxy</em> movie? Apparently not. Nintendo now claims this short film experiment was all just for fun. It’s easy to see where it could go in the future, though. Are these the first building blocks of Nintendo’s version of a Disney-style streaming library?</p> <p>“These are the first short films created by Nintendo Pictures Co., Ltd.,” the company <a href="https://x.com/Nintendo/status/1976272772725923992">posted online this morning</a>. “Nintendo Pictures will continue to explore new creative possibilities through video content.”</p> <p>The <em>Pikmin</em> shorts come just a couple months after a series of claymation<em> Mario</em> videos that felt like something out of <em>Sesame Street</em>. While they turned out <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-announces-mario-claymation-show-as-part-of-new-kid-themed-my-mario-product-line-push">to be hocking</a> new merchandise for the <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> 40th anniversary, it was easy to imagine a whole streaming series based around a similar aesthetic and visual gags. This isn’t even the first time Nintendo has experimented with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANpP2PebOW0">short movies and made <em>Pikmin</em> the stars</a>.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">We hope you enjoyed the two “Close to You” videos released on October 7 and 8.<br>The second video is available on Nintendo Today!, a free app available on your smart device.<br>These are the first short films created by Nintendo Pictures Co., Ltd.<br>Nintendo Pictures will continue to… <a href="https://t.co/GKizLT0Ckv">pic.twitter.com/GKizLT0Ckv</a></p> <p>— 任天堂株式会社 (@Nintendo) <a href="https://twitter.com/Nintendo/status/1976272772725923992?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 9, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>It’s notable that the second of the two<em> Pikmin</em> short films is only viewable inside the Nintendo Today! app, a strange Switch 2-era digital curio that Nintendo still seems to be figuring out. It’s part of a growing and weirdly aligned set of entertainment touchpoints for the brand. There’s the music app with soundtracks dating back to the NES days, Switch Online’s library of classic games, new theme parks, and box office blockbusters like the upcoming <em>Mario Galaxy</em> and<em> Zelda</em> movies. Also alarm clocks, amiibo, Lego, and a whole adjacent universe of <em>Pokémon,</em> whose streaming app inside Switch <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/64104/~/discontinuation-of-pok%C3%A9mon-tv-on-nintendo-switch">was killed off a year ago</a>.</p>

 <p>I would never expect Nintendo to do something so sane, rational, and predictable as trying to wrap all of this stuff into one coherent super-app, but it is easy to see an opening for more Nintendo content on streaming. The company doesn’t need an entire platform of content to win people over with a few hits. Millions of households sign up for Disney+ <a href="https://kotaku.com/disney-plus-price-raising-bluey-season-4-jimmy-kimmel-2000627947">just for <em>Bluey</em></a>. Where is Nintendo’s <em>Bluey</em>? I say that not as some writer cosplaying as an industry analyst, but as a parent with three children who love Mario and have run out of <em>Bluey</em> to watch.</p>

  <p>They still occasionally watch the old <em>Mario</em> cartoons from the ’90s that I grew up with. What else are they going to do when they finish <em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</em> and get tired of streaming <em>The</em> <em>Super Mario Bros. Movie</em> for the 50th time? If your answer is “Go back and play<em> Super Mario Bros 3</em>,<em>“</em> than you’ve never watched young kids who weren’t raised on 8-bit graphics try to grapple with the low-stimulation limitations of unforgiving 2D platforming.</p> <p>Nintendo execs have spoken in the past about how the company’s biggest competitors aren’t PlayStation or Xbox but Netflix and the smartphone. It gave up trying to put games on mobile marketplaces dominated by free-to-play casinos, but it’s finally seeing if there’s a place in the ever-expanding universe of short-form video for a <em>Mario</em>-sized respite from all the algorithmic junk. That would be nice! I would take that <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-alarmo-preorder-scalpers-bed-1851670175">over an Alarmo 2</a>.</p>

              <p>You let me know if anything like this has happened to you. You’re trying to record something eventful on your phone. Maybe it’s your kid on their way to scoring their first goal in their peewee soccer league. You decide to run alongside them to keep up with your phone camera capturing this precious moment. But then afterwards, you look to the new video in your camera roll and see that it is an unwatchable mess. The frame is unstable, bouncing around with every step you took. You can’t even tell what is happening in the shot.</p>
<p>That’s why any professional or amateur video aficionado is going to want to keep a gimbal stabilizer in their kit. Even though Prime Big Deals Days has passed, Amazon still has a couple of DJI’s phone stabilizers on sale. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4668/">The DJI Osmo Mobile 7P which normally goes for $149 has come down to just $120</a>. Likewise the DJI Osmo Mobile 7 has dropped from $89 to just 75.</p>

<p>Now the Osmo Mobile 7 and Osmo Mobile 7P are pretty similar, but the 7P has a couple enhancements over the standard 7. Mainly, the 7P is equipped with a retractable extension rod inside the handle, providing your with more flexibility when using it as either a selfie stick or tripod.</p>
<p>Mounting your phone to the gimbal couldn’t be easier. The DJI Osmo gimbals use a magnetic connection to pair the phone so you can start filming immediately.</p>



<h2>Intelligent Tracking</h2>
<p>Both gimbal stabilizers from DJI can make your filming life so much easier by tracking your subject and eliminating any unwanted camera jitter that comes from shaky hands or you needing to move while shooting. Even if your subject quickly changes direction, the Osmo Mobile 7 or 7P will be able to adjust automatically, keeping them in the spotlight at all times. Even if your subject is momentarily obscured like if they pass behind a tree, the gimbal can maintain continuous tracking ensuring your footage is fluid throughout.</p>
<p>Record or take photos in selfie mode with no one behind the camera. The Osmo 7 and 7P’s handles convert into a tripod base so they can stand upright on their own. You can then use gesture controls to direct the shot from afar. Raising your palm tells the gimbal to start or stop tracking you. Making a “double-L” with your thumbs can be used to adjust framing. Then making a V or peace sign gesture will tell it to take a photo or start or stop video recording.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4668/">The battery will reliably last your for 10 full hours. Then when you’re done recording, the gimbal can be quickly folded back up into a portable form factor.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Activision has seemingly heard the cries of players, and a major change for Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 multiplayer is coming to the game at launch. In a post on the game’s website, the publisher announced that Black Ops 7 will have non-disbanding multiplayer lobbies at launch. </p>



<p>That means once you find a game lobby, you’ll remain in it until you either leave or it’s disbanded. </p>



<p><strong>“We’ve heard the community discussion and dialogue around lobby disbanding, and as we mentioned earlier during the Beta, we’re focused on keeping players together from match to match more often,”</strong> <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2025/10/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-patch-notes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Activision said</a>. <strong>“Today, we’re excited to announce we’ll have persistent lobbies at launch for Black Ops 7. We’re committed to improving this experience for players, and will be sharing more details soon.”</strong></p>



<p>In addition to persistent lobbies, Activision also announced that it <strong>“open matchmaking with minimal skill consideration will be the default for Black Ops 7 multiplayer.</strong> In other terms, that means skill-based matchmaking is being taken out of Black Ops 7</p>



<p><strong>“Simply put, imagine the matchmaking experience of Open Moshpit from the Beta, but as the standard in Black Ops 7 on day one,”</strong> they said. <strong>“Our team feels strongly about providing players with a more varied experience, and the Beta proved to be a great opportunity to test this approach. We’ll be sharing more details as we get closer to launch!”</strong></p>



<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 launches on November 14 for PlayStation, Xbox, and PC.</p>

                <p>A new video with PS5 lead architect Mark Cerny and AMD SVP Jack Huynh has shed more light on the technology that could potentially power the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-6-everything-we-know-about-sonys-next-generation-console/1100-6533561/">yet-to-be-announced PlayStation 6 console</a>. AMD and Sony have been collaborating through Project Amethyst, an initiative designed to push gaming technology forward, and Cerny added that he's really excited to bring recent breakthroughs to a "future console."</p><h3>Expect a "game-changer" in future upscaling technologies</h3><p>According to Cerny and Huyn, there have been three big developments recently. Cerny explained that current technologies like FSR and PSSR are extremely demanding on GPUs and system memory. The first new concept revealed was Neural Arrays, which Hyung explained was designed to overcome inefficiencies encountered by subdividing neural network problems across many compute units. Neural Arrays allow compute units to "team up" and share data, and the end result here is that this can lead to better FSR and ray tracing effects, more efficiency, and better scalability as a workload grows.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCMzw-_dMw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1LCMzw-_dMw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"Neural Arrays will allow us to process a large chunk of the screen in one go, and the efficiencies that come from that are going to be a game-changer as we begin to develop the next generation of upscaling and denoising technologies together," Cerny explained.</p><p>Cerny and Hyung also expect ray tracing to improve through the use of Neural Radiance Caching--which was unveiled at Computex earlier this year--and Radiance Cores. Together, ray tracing and path tracing can be handled together in real time, allowing developers to access a new level of realistic lighting while also allowing the CPU to focus on geometry and simulation tasks. "A cleaner, faster, and more efficient pipeline built for the next generation of ray-traced games," Huynh said.</p><p>The other big reveal was Universal Compression, a new system designed for future GPUs and software-on-chips as a way to dramatically reduce memory bandwidth usage. This is an expansion of current technologies utilized on PS5 and PS5 Pro, and Universal Compression will evaluate and compress every piece of data on its way to the system memory. This will then lead to lower power consumption, higher visual quality, and improved performance.</p><p>"It's still very early days for these technologies, they only exist in simulation right now, but the results are quite promising and I'm really excited about bringing them to a future console in a few years' time," Cerny concluded.</p><p>This year will mark the fifth anniversary of the PS5's launch, but there have been a few hints from Sony regarding its plans for a successor console. O<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps6-will-go-modular-with-optional-disc-drive-report/1100-6534538/" data-ref-id="1100-6534538">ne proposed idea is a detachable disc drive</a>, giving the rumored console a layer of modularity. We also know that Sony <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/for-ps6-sony-is-betting-on-hardware-power-not-the-cloud/1100-6532420/">will continue to rely on hardware over cloud technology</a>, as it's aware that its users prefer the "local execution" of games that comes from a physical disc or having the software directly downloaded to the system.</p>

We believe this differentiates our games significantly from the franchises mentioned."</p><p dir="ltr">Anime Village Online is stated as having "true cross-platform multiplayer," but there isn't a listing for the game on other storefronts. However, GamePoc does have two other games on the way. Orbital Station Simulator has a May 2026 release window <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10015557/" rel="nofollow ">on PSN</a>, while Cyberpunk Fighter has a general TBA release <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1483830/Cyberpunk_Fighter/" rel="nofollow ">on Steam</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>This year marks the 15th anniversary for MachinesGames and to celebrate the milestone, the developer is releasing a new update for <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> tomorrow, on October 10. It will add the heavily requested New Game+ feature to the game, which includes a new ending sequence, a new but classic Indy outfit, and additional voice-over languages.&nbsp;</p><p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle launched on Xbox Series X/S and PC last December, and it hit PlayStation 5 earlier this year. Players on every platform can expect this free anniversary update tomorrow, and you can get a look at the new features in a special trailer below:&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4u-QnuhfLmE"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4u-QnuhfLmE" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>As you can see, the main highlight of the update is New Game+. Once you've completed the main story, New Game+ will be available right from the main menu. All you have to do is select a save slot containing a completed playthrough of the story, and a New Game+ menu will appear. MachineGames says, "Because you'll be significantly stronger this time around, we recommend bumping your difficulty up," and notes you can adjust this during the initial New Game+ setup.&nbsp;</p><p>As for what carries over, you will have all collected and unlocked Adventure Books as well as any unspent Adventure Points, local currency, and Medicine Bottles. If you complete the story in New Game+, you'll unlock a "brand-new ending sequence after the credits," MachineGames says.&nbsp;</p><p>Elsewhere in the update, you'll receive the new Cairo look from <em>Raiders of the Lost Ark</em>. To wear it, just visit the Outfit tab in the Options menu, and you can select the Cairo outfit at any point whenever Indy isn't wearing a disguise.&nbsp;</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> is finally releasing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-review-a-faithful-remake-with-a-few-missteps-along-the-way">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a> and Rebirth as a physical double pack.</p>
<p>These games are the first two parts of the Remake trilogy, which reimagines the original PS1 classic <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy 7</a>.</p>
<p>Available from 4th December exclusively on PS5, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-7-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-guides-tips-tricks-9403">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</a> Twin Pack Physical Edition (as it's known) will cost $59.99 / €69.99 / £59.99. You can pre-order it now from the <a href="https://gb.store.square-enix-games.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-_-rebirth---twin-pack-physical-edition?_gl=1%2Alcp8u1%2A_gcl_au%2AMjM5MjUyNTcuMTc1NjcxNjY0MQ..&amp;_ga=2.95225759.2068626468.1760015048-116765061.1756716641">Square Enix store</a>.</p>

<p>Rebirth alone currently costs £69.99 on the PSN store, so it's decent value.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-gets-switch-2-release-date">Final Fantasy 7 Remake will also be coming to Xbox and Switch 2</a> on 22nd January next year, which will be followed by Rebirth afterwards, though that remains without a release date.</p>
<p>It's unknown, therefore, if an equivalent double pack will make its way to other consoles in the future.</p>

<p>What's more, there's still the third part of the trilogy to arrive at some point in the future, which is due across all platforms. Will a triple pack of the complete Remake trilogy be released physically? It would seem likely, but don't expect it at launch if the wait for this twin pack is anything to go by.</p>
<p>The Xbox and Switch 2 versions of Remake will come with Pixel Remaster-style boosts to help progression, which will also be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remakes-progression-helping-boosts-arent-exclusive-to-switch-2-and-xbox-will-also-arrive-via-patch-for-ps5-and-pc">retroactively added to the PS5 and PC versions too</a>.</p>
