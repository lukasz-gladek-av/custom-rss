            <p>The Rogue Prince of Persia is finally leaving early access with a full 1.0 release set for August.</p>
<p>A fresh trailer for the game was shown at the PC Gaming Show over the weekend, showing plenty of its 2D roguelike gameplay, parkour abilities, and stylish combat.</p>
<p>Published by Ubisoft, The Rogue Prince of Persia is being developed by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dead-cells">Dead Cells</a> studio Evil Empire. It released into early access last May.</p>

<p>The game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-rogue-prince-of-persia-the-second-act-update-effectively-relaunches-the-game-makes-prince-no-longer-purple">received a huge update back in November</a>, revamping the art style and doubling the game's size.</p>
<p>The full version will finish the story, add extra biomes with a proper final boss, and include more enemies and weapons. The developer has also promised news of an exact release date as well as console releases on the way.</p>
<p>It's heavily inspired by Dead Cells too, as you'd expect from the same studio.</p>
<p>"What it definitely gets from Dead Cells is an enviable forward momentum," wrote <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/theres-a-lot-of-dead-cells-in-the-rogue-prince-of-persia">Christian Donlan for Eurogamer last year</a>. "The Prince is all leanness and athleticism, decked out like a modern Olympian but with a bright red sash that flows out behind him and highlights his swiftness, his elegance."</p>
<p>Evil Empire is a subsidiary of original Dead Cells developer Motion Twin, which was spun off to work on updates and DLC. It <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-cells-developer-ends-support-focusing-on-new-projects">ended support for Dead Cells last year</a> to work on a "secret project", which turned out to be The Rogue Prince of Persia.</p>
<p>Motion Twin, meanwhile, has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/motion-twins-windblown-releases-in-early-access-even-sooner-than-you-think">its own game in early access: Windblown</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      </div>
<p>It's surprising that the issue wasn't addressed by launch, and given Nintendo's family-friendly reputation, we wouldn't be shocked if a future update limits or eliminates the ability to make the Switch 2 transcribe those words.</p><p>Nintendo has already disclosed that it reserves the right to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-may-record-your-audio-and-video-chats/1100-6531383/" data-ref-id="1100-6531383">"collect, monitor, and record"</a> audio and video chats conducted through Switch 2. The company later clarified that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-clarifies-how-and-why-switch-2-could-collect-monitor-and-record-your-gamechats/1100-6531419/" data-ref-id="1100-6531419">it will only review those recordings if the chats are reported</a> for violating community guidelines. Nintendo has also disclosed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-camera-nintendo-responds-to-safety-and-spying-concerns/1100-6530594/" data-ref-id="1100-6530594">several safety measures to prevent children</a> from being preyed upon by older GameChat users. For example, players younger than 16 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-gamechat-will-require-phone-number-for-security-purposes/1100-6531774/" data-ref-id="1100-6531774">need a parent or guardian's permission to use GameChat</a>, and a phone number is required for all users to sign up for it.</p><p>The Nintendo Switch mobile app was recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-mobile-app-updated-with-gamechat-and-other-switch-2-features/1100-6531907/" data-ref-id="1100-6531907">updated with GameChat and other Switch 2 features</a>. The app now allows players to invite friends to GameChat, view each others' play history, and add new friends via friend code or a QR code. It also let's players see <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-nintendo-switch-2-games/2900-6128/" data-ref-id="2900-6128">the Switch 2 games</a> in their play history.</p><p>GameChat is free for now, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/what-happens-if-you-press-the-switch-2s-c-button-without-nso-now-we-know/1100-6530684/" data-ref-id="1100-6530684">it will become a paid feature</a> on April 1, 2026.</p>

			<p>During the Xbox Games Showcase 2025, Korean developer EVR Studio unveiled MUDANG: Two Hearts, an intriguing Metal Gear Solid-like game with a key premise: what if North and South Korea reunited as a single country? And what if, on the day the bill was supposed to be signed, a terrorist group attacked the South Korean National Assembly?</p>
<p>In MUDANG, players control two protagonists from contrasting backgrounds: Ji Jeongtae, an elite North Korean special forces operative fighting through enemy lines to uncover the truth; and GAVI, a K-pop idol under constant surveillance who plays a pivotal role in exposing a dangerous conspiracy. These opposing perspectives provide different gameplay experiences and narrative arcs that ultimately converge on a single, disturbing truth.</p>
<p>The game supports open-ended level design, allowing players a high degree of freedom when it comes to choosing their path throughout the missions. No matter what approach you take, the game offers a wealth of options, such as environmental takedowns; a wide range of close-quarters combat (CQC) moves, both lethal and non-lethal; a robust toolkit of gadgets, such as goggles, EMPs, grenades, lures, and mines; and a deep arsenal of firearms.</p>
<p><iframe title="MUDANG: Two Hearts | Xbox Games Showcase 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L6-5vM_tSVw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>EVR Studio also claims that the enemy AI will be particularly challenging. It was designed to be versatile, dynamically adapting to the player's actions in real time. When the player character is hidden, the enemy forms search parties to investigate suspicious signs, such as fallen allies, disabled lights, or nearby footsteps, and raises the alarm when something is amiss. During combat, they work together to flank and outmaneuver the player.</p>
<p>MUDANG: Two Hearts will also feature seamless, immersive cutscenes, a narrative that responds to the player's choices, and formidable bosses that will test the player's combat skills to the limit. The game will launch sometime in 2026 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

<p>Casey has been writing the Mass Effect TV show for "almost a year", the publication noted. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-is-officially-getting-a-tv-adaptation-at-amazon">Amazon officially announced a Mass Effect TV show</a> was in development in November last year, when Casey's involvement was initially confirmed.</p>

			<p>Typically, the big reason the&nbsp;<em>Rune Factory&nbsp;</em>series always appealed to me a bit more than its sister franchise <em>Harvest Moon, </em>was because of the more fantasy-focused setting. While&nbsp;<em>Harvest Moon&nbsp;</em>always presented a pretty chill and down-to-earth Japanese farm fantasy, the&nbsp;<em>Rune Factory&nbsp;</em>series always leaned a bit more Western and high-fantasy in its style. I’ve come to associate that setting with the series, which made the initial reveal of <em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma&nbsp;</em>and its traditional Japanese twist on the setting make me feel a bit conflicted. Despite a vibe shift and new setting, though, this game is an incredible new take on the <em>Rune Factory&nbsp;</em>series that shines just as bright as my favourite entries.</p>
<p><iframe title="Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma | Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/incsbQ-ygJI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While I wasn’t immediately sold on the shift in setting for <em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</em>, something that I was immediately excited about was the approach to character design and romance options in the latest entry of the series. Like any life-sim farming game, dating the hot guys and girls in your town is a staple of the genre. The <em>Rune Factory&nbsp;</em>games, though, typically have you playing as a protagonist with a pretty young look. Most of your eligible romance options end up being just as young or younger, while the adult characters with equally exciting personalities and designs often stay on the sidelines. Nearly every character in this game, including your romance options, have more adult design or personality, and as someone who grew up playing the series, it’s nice to see the newest entry age along with me and focus on romance options that feel a bit more geared toward me.</p>


<p>Bonding with your favourite hunk or hottie happens pretty regularly in between the smorgasbord of other activities you’ll engage in throughout the game, from action RPG battles to crop caretaking and settlement building. There’s a bit of a tighter narrative pushing along the events of <em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</em> compared to past games, and having every character directly involved in those story beats makes your eventual courtship all the more exciting. I was even blown away by a surprising quality-of-life feature introduced in this game that ties into the romance options – Rewoven Fates.</p>


<p>This feature lets you hop into alternate timelines that are fully standalone parallels to your main game, letting you experience the full romance route of any other characters without having to do an entire new playthrough of the game. It helps retain the importance of who you end up picking in your main playthrough, while easing some of the FOMO of missing out on the stories and dialogue from options unexplored.</p>
<p>One of the other major new features in <em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma&nbsp;</em>is that settlement building loop I mentioned earlier. As you progress through the story, helping gods reawaken and a small village rebuild, you’ll eventually be able to recruit NPCs to tend to your gardens and crops automatically while you go off battling bosses and running errands for townsfolk. It’s a really fun feature that helps put a more obvious sense of progression on the farm-life aspect of the game, which is usually a bit more self-driven in these games. It also helps make the game world feel so much more naturally alive – my biggest gripe with the previous <em>Rune Factory&nbsp;</em>game was that your town felt more like a bunch of standalone buildings lazily plopped into an open map than it felt like an actual lived-in village. As your settlement grows in this game, though, it does such an amazing job of adding life to the world in a way no other entry in the series has.</p>

<p>While combat isn’t necessarily the main focus of the game, it thankfully feels better than ever before. You’ve got a wide variety of weapon types to use, each with their own unique movesets and styles. Different enemies have certain weaknesses and vulnerabilities, but you can typically approach battles in whatever style you prefer and make it through just fine. Plus, bringing your favourite characters into battle with you adds another fun avenue to interact with them and feel immersed in the blooming friendships and romances as the calendar ticks by.</p>
<p>I ended up absolutely loving everything about <em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma,&nbsp;</em>even the parts of it I was initially put off by in its announcement. The world and your town feel so alive, and it has some of my favourite characters from across the entire franchise. It reinvigorates the <em>Rune Factory&nbsp;</em>formula on every level, feeling like the proper evolution and upgrade this franchise has needed.</p>

			<p>During the Xbox Games Showcase 2025, Polish developer Bloober Team (Silent Hill 2 Remake, Layers of Fear, Layers of Fear 2, The Medium, Observer) announced a release window for Cronos: The New Dawn. The new sci-fi IP will debut at some point in the upcoming Fall season on PC (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2101960/Cronos_The_New_Dawn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/cronos-the-new-dawn-85b409" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>), <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-pl/concept/10011556" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/productid/9p7tflq7ctxn" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox Series S|X</a>. Wishlisting is already available on all platforms.</p>
<p>Of course, alongside the news, Bloober also presented a new Cronos: The New Dawn trailer, offering a closer look at the terrifying Orphans and revealing intense survival moments inside their nest. The Orphans are twisted monstrosities born from humanity's darkest nightmares. The trailer showcases their behavior (they are exceptionally aggressive and relentless), which turns every encounter with them into a desperate fight for survival. Most importantly, players must prevent the Orphans from merging. In Cronos: The New Dawn, defeated enemies must be burned immediately. Otherwise, they risk being absorbed by other foes, triggering a merge that creates an even stronger and faster enemy.</p>
<p>The new trailer also recounts part of the story of a mysterious predecessor, a traveller ND 3500,&nbsp; and their cryptic travel log. In this game, players will journey through unsettling post-apocalyptic environments inspired by the Polish district of Nowa Huta, where decaying Brutalist architecture is warped and twisted by reality-bending anomalies.</p>

<p>Previously, Bloober Team <a href="https://wccftech.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-combat-will-lean-towards-resident-evil-dead-space-featuring-a-special-mechanic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">clarified</a> that the game's combat was inspired by survival horror classics such as Resident Evil and Dead Space. The developers have also been loosely <a href="https://wccftech.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-gets-deep-dive-from-bloober-team/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inspired</a> by FromSoftware's Dark Souls to make a more challenging game. When it comes to the setting, they were influenced by other media, like the movies 12 Monkeys and The Thing and the TV series Dark.</p>
<p>The game is powered by Unreal Engine 5. The official PC system requirements have already been <a href="https://wccftech.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-pc-system-requirements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> and don't seem too onerous on paper.</p>

The handheld is weighty and ergonomically satisfying, but my favorite discovery is that players can launch Steam games natively from the Xbox dashboard.</p><p>The game library, which players may access at any time by pressing its dedicated button on the handheld, features all your titles regardless of which platform you own them on. A discrete label beneath the game’s title denotes which storefronts they belong to. Furthermore, you can quickly access third-party storefronts like Steam and Epic Games Store by pressing the Ally’s Xbox button, which launches the Windows Game Bar, and selecting the desired application just beneath your recently played games.&nbsp;</p><p>“Our new aggregated library lets you quickly access all of your games. Because this is Windows, you can launch and play natively, both your games from Xbox as well as other leading PC storefronts," Roanne Sones, head of Xbox devices, says. "You can also stream your console games through cloud gaming or remote play. So what this means is that your library, including hundreds of Game Pass games and all of your installed games from third-party storefronts, is all in one place for you, ready to play on your Xbox Ally through remote play gaming or natively on the device."&nbsp;</p><p>Many questions remain, including whether Microsoft tracks data to unlock Xbox achievements while playing a game from another storefront like Steam or Epic Games Store. We’ve reached out to an Xbox representative for comment.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Though she does not possess the power of Mana,<br>she has sharp instincts and excels at logistical support.</p><p>Cheerful and friendly, she speaks to Adol and Karja with an open heart, but is often curt toward Canute—likely due to frequently having to deal with his difficult behavior.</p><p><strong>■ About <em>Ys X: Nordics</em></strong></p><p>Released in 2023 to commemorate the 35th anniversary of the <em>Ys</em> series, <em>Ys X: Nordics</em> is the latest mainline entry in the acclaimed <a title="Genres > Action RPG [1,684 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg/action-rpg">action RPG</a> franchise.</p><p>The story follows Adol Christin, a young adventurer who once explored the ancient kingdom of Ys, and Karja Balta, a Norman girl feared as a pirate princess.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gematsu.com/2025/06/fantasy-life-simulation-rpg-mandrake-announced-for-pc<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>You are the last of the Mandrakes, a sorcerous line of gardeners. At long last, you’ve returned to your family’s abandoned home. Make friends, tend your gardens, and put down roots. Fish, gather and delve in the wilds. Make a place for yourself, and uncover the mysteries your family left behind.</p><p><strong>The Lost Arts of Horticulture</strong></p><p>Horticulture is a cursed and forbidden practice… except to you. You come from a long line of sorcerers who practiced the green and growing arts, and you’re able to grow such marvels as: runner beans! Cherry trees! The humble turnip!</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>And as your skills grow, you’ll be able to plant stranger seeds, like thunder-calling taran, or rhewyn, which waters your gardens for you. Perhaps you’ll even grow a goose-tree! (Where did you think geese came from? Other geese? Preposterous.)</p><p>Place beds, decorations and resting spots. Find, plant, nurture, grow and harvest plants both mundane and magical, and gradually expand your gardens into the tangled grounds of your family’s abandoned castle.</p><p><strong>A World to Inhabit</strong></p><p>Discover a beguiling new world inspired by British history and folklore. A world of old, wild powers, of uncanny spirits that reside in those places mortals dare not go; of deep histories, and deeper mysteries.</p><p>You won’t just work in your gardens. Forage for resources in the nearby woods and along the beach. Go fishing (but take care not to be cursed by the river). Delve into dangerous mines in search of bright minerals and stolen secrets.</p><p>Breathe life into the Mandrake lodge with your choice of furnishings and renovations; acquire old books, and spend the evenings reading in the candlelit comfort of your study. Learn to cook. Meet your neighbors, become entangled in their lives, give them gifts and learn their stories.</p><p><strong>Fireside Menace</strong></p><p>Long ago, the world changed. The <a title="Games > Covenant [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/covenant">Covenant</a> of the Hearth decreed that the day belonged to humanity, but the night… the night belonged to other things. Now, all earthly lights save hearthfires go out when the sun sets, and the Mara ride the night-winds. Don’t go out after dark—the night is not for you.</p><p>For now. (After all, what self-respecting sorcerer follows the rules?)</p><p><strong>Human, Humble Magic</strong></p><p>Magic in Mandrake isn’t about flashy fireballs and shimmering shields, but about folkloric ingenuity, whimsy and patience. Grow a cherry tree from seedling to maturity in seven days rather than seven years, then fashion your sorcerer’s staff from its wood. Befriend a river. Eavesdrop on the dead. Spend a haunted night at the Butcher’s Oak. Drink tea with the god who lives in your chimney.</p><p><strong>A Host of Lavishly-Realized Characters</strong></p><p>Welcome to the village of Chandley. It’s small, it’s complicated, and everyone’s got their own story.</p><p>Meet Rosen—bee-keeper, candlemaker, rook-speaker—the even-handed village leader charged with steering this troublesome community of eccentrics. Or Gideon, the somber hunter who makes pacts with the wild powers of the woods.</p><p>Befriend Nessa, the village smith, whose kindness conceals the scars of an old tragedy; and Thackery, the effusive Voicer, who keeps technology that no-one—least of all he—fully understands.</p><p>Visit the lighthouse, where Jory and Ruan Vicory live with young Tamsyn: the girl they saved from the sea, and who still hears voices calling to her from beneath the waves…</p><p>Chandley may be small, but it’s old, thick with secrets, and set in its ways. Is it ready for the return of a Mandrake?</p><p><strong>Beyond the Firelight</strong></p><p>Encounter the spirits, gods and bogles that live alongside the people of Chandley: the smiling revenant imprisoned in a tree, who claims he knows you (even though he’s hundreds of years dead). Lonely, long-armed Granny Jakes in her hidden orchard, who offers you a sip of a drink that the world has forgotten how to make. The Regent of the Woods, bearer of a white crown. The shy thing that whistles an old tune in the depths of a mine no-one has worked in decades. Hroame, who is sometimes stone and sometimes not.</p></div><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p></div>]]></content:encoded>

Cataclysmic events have wrought havoc on the natural order, and the very world will change as time goes on revealing new opportunities for exploration and conquest to the bold and daring. Establish expansive cities to spread your influence and strengthen your economy, raise armies and command troops in turn-based tactical battles to overcome your enemies by force, and push forth into the unknown to uncover the dark secrets that lie at the planet’s core.</p><p><strong>Lead Disparate Factions</strong></p><p>Whether you command righteous warriors descended from the stars or hive-minded aliens that know only how to fight, feed, and propagate, <em>ENDLESS Legend II</em> features vastly different factions each driven by their own philosophies, histories, capabilities, and narratives. Each of the factions have unique traits that set them apart from one another whether on the battlefield, in matters of commerce, with regards to empire-building, or in diplomatic affairs—it is up to you to adapt to their strengths and weaknesses and build strategies and distinct playstyles.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <ul><li>The choice of faction will influence every aspect of the game. Will you prefer to benefit from a constant state of fighting, untethered by the need to justify your wars, spawning additional warriors with each victorious battle to grow endlessly in strength? Or will you choose to benefit from cohabitation and cooperation, spreading tendrils of influence throughout the world to build a network of allies, leveraging relationships with the minor factions of the planet to further enrich your empire? Learn what makes each faction distinct and use it to your advantage whether you’re leading them, or looking to destroy them.</li><li>Military doctrine varies greatly between the factions, providing unique opportunities for a capable commander to gain an advantage over their foe, even when out of combat. Whether you’re building massive fortifications as the Kin of Sheredyn to defend your cities, establishing connections to powerful weapons and support systems waiting in orbit, or you’re investing in the spread of coral that allows the units of spiritualist Aspects to support themselves outside of friendly territory, know your enemy and know yourself to gain the upper hand in any conflict.</li><li>Either auto-resolve combat or take direct control of individual units within your armies when battle begins, using the surrounding terrain to your advantage as you seek out chokepoints, cover, and the high ground. Apart from having faction-specific units, traits, weapons, and attributes, each faction also features special battlefield abilities that can turn the tide of battle if properly utilized. Where one faction might work best with a patient commander, able to meticulously maneuver troops to secure powerful adjacency bonuses, another might rely on force of numbers and overwhelming strength.</li><li>Recruit heroes and watch them grow over time as they gain new traits to bolster their abilities, build relationships that provide them with various boons, and acquire equipment useful both in and out of battle. Powerful commanders, properly trained and armed, can turn the tide of entire wars when wisely utilized.</li></ul><p><strong>Reign in an Evolving World</strong></p><p>Empires will rise and fall based on their ability to adapt to a changing world. Starting from a single humble city, expand according to your faction’s unique strengths and limitations while adapting to the periodic monsoons and tidefalls. Build districts around your cities’ central structures, exploit strategic and luxury resources littered around the world, and develop your technological capabilities and industrial might.</p><ul><li>Cataclysmic tidefalls will expose new opportunities and threats as the oceans recede to unveil new land ripe for expansion. While your existing territory will remain unscathed, the newly revealed terrain from the retreating oceans will open up new avenues of approach for you and your enemies, alongside new resources to exploit and new anomalies to explore. While this can fundamentally change the strategic value of various locations as time goes on, a wise leader will plan for the inevitable—will you prepare to expand into new lands as soon as a tidefall occurs, or focus on shoring up your defenses where you anticipate new landbridges to appear?</li><li>Plan the development of your cities to focus on population growth, industrialization, and commerce, or prioritize their contribution to the sciences, your empire’s influence, and your military might— the choice is yours based on the needs of your burgeoning empire. Establish districts that provide fortifications or further the production of various resources, take advantage of adjacency and terrain bonuses, and pursue technological advancements that allow you to upgrade established districts or unlock entirely new options. Will you patiently seek out ideal locations to establish long-term economic hubs and military strongholds, or will you spread rapidly to secure new lands and increased productivity ahead of your enemies?</li><li>The lands around you are teeming with both opportunity and danger alike. Crush the weaker minor factions littered around the world to pillage their resources, or instead cultivate friendly relations and have them join your growing empire, incorporating their distinctive units and heroes to further strengthen your people. Explore ancient ruins and strange anomalies, braving the dangers of the unknown to enrich your lands and gain powerful artifacts to wield against your enemies.</li></ul><p><strong>Write Your Own Legend</strong></p><p>A deep mystery lies buried beneath the surface of this once-tranquil ocean world, where an ancient power stirs in the darkness. Gain dominion over the planet through violent conquest, seek victory through diplomatic and technological advancements, pursue quests and tackle events that can alter the course of a campaign, or empower your sworn heroes to unveil the story of your people—the choice is yours.</p><p>Will you be a ruthless conqueror or a cunning builder? A cultivated diplomat or a flesh-eating beast? Will you bring harmony back to the planet, seeking out lost legends and heroes, or will you defy the fate that drives your faction and carve a legend of your own?</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Early Access Release Date Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="ENDLESS™ Legend 2 - Early Access Date Trailer | PC Gaming show" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bANqX6Jpv0s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/mcfarlane-toys-doom-diablo-mortal-kombat-ign-live-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">New Elite Edition series on the way.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">During a special IGN Live edition of Up at Noon today, McFarlane Toys’ Brian Walters (Director, Brand Creative) stopped by to chat with Max Scoville and Brian Altano about what the company has in the pipeline, including their new Elite Edition series that’s kicking off with Doom Slayer from Doom: The Dark Ages, followed by Lilith from Diablo IV. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Walters said the idea behind the Elite Edition was “to create highly decorated, super detailed, iconic version of characters from games.” One way these figures stand out is by their inclusion of soft goods, such as the fur cloak on Doom Slayer, and Walters noted they were “Introducing new materials we haven’t used.” </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/08/purple-and-white-modern-business-youtube-thumbnail-2-1749426039362.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Walters pointed out the many accessories Doom Slayer came with, including the Pulveriser, flail, combat shotgun, and shield saw, saying he felt it was ”a really great first item for [Elite Edition].” Though pre-orders for Doom Slayer were currently sold out, Walters said the figure would be available at retailers like Walmart and Gamestop upon release. And yes, it was implied some monsters are in the works for the Doom Slayer to battle. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lilith in the meantime just went up for pre-order today, tied to IGN Live. Her accessories include multiple palace fates for a variety of expressions, and Williams said the idea was they were “holding nothing back with this figure,” including articulated wings and “a soft PVC tail so you can pose it however you want.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Williams said the challenge with a figure like Lilith was “the balance of executing the design but still making a functional toy. You have to make tough decisions.” He added that probably the hardest thing was pulling off “the engineering without compromising the look of the character.”</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/08/purple-and-white-modern-business-youtube-thumbnail-3-1749426293886.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">As for what else McFarlane Toys had in the pipeline, there’s the Power Armor from Fallout, which is based on the game, not the series. The previous figures they made for the TV version were from the Movie Maniacs line, so the Power Armor will be the first articulated Fallout figure. Williams teased there was “more to come here. We’ve got some good surprises coming.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last but not least, Williams showed off two of the figures from the upcoming Mortal Kombat Classics line - including a boxed Sub-Zero, featuring very fun retro arcade packaging that includes joystick controls on the box art and the original character select image of Sub-Zero, along with his bio, on the back. </p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-creative-team-on-how-they-crafted-season-2s-most-crucial-episodes-ign-live-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Full Spoilers for The Last of Us Season 2 follow. </strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">At IGN Live today, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tv/the-last-of-us-the-series">The Last of Us</a> Co-Creator and Executive Producer Craig Mazin was joined by several of the show’s core creative team – including Ksenia Sereda (Cinematographer), Ann Foley (Costume Designer), Don Macaulay (Production Designer), Alex Wang (VFX Supervisor), Timothy Good (Editor), and David Fleming (Co-Composer) – to discuss the tremendous amount of work that went into the just-completed second season of the HBO series. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As the panel began, Mazin remarked, “The truth is that Neil [Druckmann] and I are vastly over-credited for the success of the show. We work really hard on it but these are the people that bring it to life and they deserve so much credit… All of it is necessary to make it what it is.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">When the panel was asked to name their favorite episode from Season 2, nearly everyone named either <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-season-2-episode-2-review">episode two</a> ("Through the Valley") or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-season-2-episode-6-review">episode six</a> (“The Price”), which made sense since they were such standouts - and segued nicely into the fact that these were the two episodes moderator Amelia Emberwing focused on for the conversation. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Through the Valley” of course had two monumental events, including the horde of infected attacking Jackson and, well… that other thing which we’ll get back to. With footage of the massive attack sequence playing, Mazin noted that there were visual effects in basically every shot, saying, “I think Alex had to touch nearly everything here.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Rewatching the attack on Jackson, Macaulay joked, “All I can think about is the thousands of meetings we have,” saying they quite seriously probably had 10 meetings about how the barrels would be launched from the town gates into the horde. As he put it, “Nearly every shot in this took 10-15 meetings. Craig loves meetings!” Even after all of that there was “a lot of retrofitting on set. Lots of rooftops we weren’t planning to do.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Foley said episode two was definitely the hardest part of the season for her as the costume designer because of how many actors and extras were in that episode working on multiple filming units - and that it was all taking place while they were also working on the Seraphite costumes for upcoming episodes. As she explained, this involved "65 people in three different areas.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Wang stressed that previs is crucial, and the many discussions they have about what Macaulay will build vs. what Wang will oversee being added digitally. It’s a long process, with Wang noting, “You’re planning for success 6-8 months down the line” and that he’s constantly in communication with Macaulay, the stunt team, and many more. Mazin joked that when he calls Wang in for one of his infamous meetings, “His heart sinks because he knows he’s about to go over budget again.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">One reason the infected horde was so tricky was that it dealt with such a large army and as Wang explained, in the visual effects world, when you have a group that large “repetition is usually okay,” since you have characters in the same costumes or creatures of the same type. Here though, Mazin wanted to sell that these were all originally different human beings who were different sizes and ages in different outfits before they were infected. As he put it, they nearly “broke Wētā [FX]” over the specifics they asked for. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then there’s Good and his crucial work as editor. He has to begin editing without the final effects in place, which can be tricky. And not just because, as he pointed out, in the early footage “a Bloater isn’t a Bloater, it’s a green dot.” But after they may have cut of the episode they're happy with, “we get the animation back and everything’s changed. The motion’s become faster than a human actor is able to do," so they have to re-edit to adjust. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">When it came to scoring the “Through the Valley,” Fleming described it as particularly challenging, because Mazin asked him, “How do we start this at 11 and then keep going up for the whole episode?” The idea was they were “building up momentum so it just felt relentless relentless relentless. Then at the end, it was kind of the opposite with the pivotal scene with Joel.” When Fleming paused and said he’d been avoiding talking about how that episode ended for so long, Mazin couldn’t resist chiming in: “He died!” </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As Fleming explained, the original music for Joel's wrenching death scene was much busier but then “Craig asked ‘strip it back.’ It was a less is more situation.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While praising the performances of Pedro Pascal, Kaitlyn Dever and Bella Ramsey, Good revealed that for Joel’s death “I actually edited it five times before I was ready to show it to Craig,” because he knew how important it was to get it right. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As Joel’s death scene played out, the panel couldn’t help but become somber and when Mazin cracked, “Let’s talk about the golf clubs we picked out. They have lots of meaning" to release some tension, he then paused and added that actually, when it came to which exact club Abby would use to beat Joel with, “There was a whole discussion!” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The conversation then moved to episode six and its flashbacks to Joel and Ellie together set between Season 1 and 2. The sequence where Ellie climbs the dinosaur was shown and Mazin remarked, “I love this in the game. I love that we got to do it!” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">He added that this was a funny situation where the actual dinosaur built for Ellie to climb “was wobbling too much so then Alex stopped it from wobbling. But then it looked fake so we had to make it wobble [again] a little bit.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Discussing Joel and Ellie’s clothes, Foley noted they did their best to match their looks in the game, though there might be slight changes occasionally for specific reasons. One such case was in the museum scene. In the game, Ellie is wearing a tank top in this sequence. However, on the show, they wanted to underline that Bella Ramsey was playing a more youthful version of Ellie in these flashback scenes, so they ended up making it a t-shirt because “changing it from a tank to a t-shirt made it look baggier and make her look younger.” In general though, “Joel and Ellie are in the same things they wear in the game because there’s no reason to change it.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ksenia Sereda said she was both excited and nervous about shooting the scene where Ellie and Joel go inside the space capsule, because “the way it was done in the game was so brilliant,” including the close up on Ellie smiling, imagining going into space. Sereda joked the game provided “the most expensive previs I’ve ever had to work with.” </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Mazin marveled how Sereda lit the screen so that all of the light changes on Ellie’s face were done practically, without visual effects needed. Sereda explained how difficult it was, because “the whole sequence is lit through this teeny tiny window on the side of the capsule. It was very challenging to find this whole look.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This sequence had particular significance to Mazin because “This is the first thing that Neil ever showed me from the second game.” He elaborated that when he went to Naughty Dog to speak to Druckmann about turning The Last of Us into a TV show, the team were nearing the completion of The Last of Us Part II. When Druckmann showed Mazin the space capsule sequence, his response was, “‘We’re doing that!’ In my mind, I was like, 'We need to do a good enough job for Season 1 that we’re renewed [to do that].'" </p><p data-cy="paragraph">With Season 3 of The Last of Us now in the works, Mazin said he was eager to get back in the thick of it, turning to his fellow panelists and saying “I can’t wait to do that. I can’t wait to do that with all of you.” He then proclaimed: “Don, are we going to have meetings!!”</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/09/stars-of-icarus-preview-out-with-steampunk-in-with-space/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/stars-of-icarus-preview-%E2%80%93-out-with-steampunk-in-with-space.1212825/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/09/stars-of-icarus-preview-out-with-steampunk-in-with-space/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Steampunk is, let’s face it, old hat now. Specifically, it’s a top hat with goggles, some cogs and maybe a timepiece or two on it. But space? Well, space is always going to be filled with wonder and cool. So it makes total sense that Muse Games would look to the stars for their successor to Guns of Icarus, the aptly titled Stars of Icarus.</p>
<p><iframe title="Stars of Icarus | Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wQSOF3HGQo4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Of course, while people might dream of the smooth utopian future of 90s Star Trek, the likely reality of space travel is going to be much grimier and difficult. Stars of Icarus sees crews of ragtag spacefarers battling over scraps, facing off in abandoned scrapyard, space stations and around asteroid belts for the right to whatever spoils might be had.</p>


<p>Two teams of five players face off in combat, but the spaceships that you can pilot can accommodate between one and three people. A single-person ship is going to be small and nimble, a little fighter that can move quickly, but it won’t have anything when compared to the multiple turrets of a two-seater corvette, or the thick shields, gun batteries and sheer survivability of a three-seater frigate.</p>


<p>Coordinating your efforts works on multiple levels, both in terms of ensuring that your ships stay together and can support one another, taking a tactical approach to engaging the enemy, but also within a ship. In a corvette, one person has to pilot, manoeuvring the ship with an eye on what the enemy is doing and facing them with the particular guns that are available, not to mention turning away from incoming fire if part of the shields are breached. Meanwhile, the other crew member can dash back and forth between weapons, unloading their ammo and then switching to another point, repairing components as they take damage, and deciding where to put the one AI helper – put them on a particular gun battery and they’ll keep blasting away at anything in sight with decent efficiency.</p>

<p>It’s really satisfying to have it all come together. I enjoyed playing in a solo fighter, the mouse and keyboard controls reminding me of trying to play classic X-Wing and TIE Fighter games in the early 90s without a flight stick… but this game’s meant for these inputs. But I also really enjoyed playing as a crewer in a corvette or frigate, scrambling back and forth between fixing and firing. The one time I tried to pilot a corvette… well, let’s just say I wasn’t really taking the 6DOF field of battle into account very well, and angling the ship to bring guns to bear took a lot of brain power for a newcomer. By comparison, the team at Muse were dab hands at quickly rotating the ship between long-ranged and short-range turrets.</p>
<p>But fans and veterans from Guns of Icarus should take to this much more quickly, though with the new rotational factor coming into play a lot more, adding to the verticality of the game’s combat.</p>
<p>Of course, the ships can be extensively customised with different gun loadouts and gear, so you can have a short-ranged bruiser or a powerful long-ranged sniper style of ship, or perhaps put a repair beam on a corvette so that you can fall back, regroup and go again much more easily. That opens up plenty of tactical variety, especially when combining with the environments, where you could drop down into some cosmic fog, use constructs to block views and approach angles, laying traps or springing them to get an advantage.</p>

<p>Muse Games took inspiration from 90s anime for Stars of Icarus’ art direction, so there’s cel shaded characters and ships, bright block colours and chunky ship designs. In combat, it helps things to read quite well, keeping the visuals relatively uncluttered. It also lends itself well to quick character customisation with colour palettes. As a premium game, Stars of Icarus will have all the ships, tools and weapons unlocked from the start, and a healthy selection of customisation options… though more cosmetics will feature in an in-game store. Sometimes you got to show off, right?</p>
<p>And that sometimes could be in the in-game lobby, a gathering place to run around with your anime-styled avatar and hang out with other community members. Muse hopes that much of the sense of community that they found with Guns of Icarus can carry through to Stars of Icarus as well when it launches in 2026.</p>

You can read up on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-games-showcase-2025-everything-announced"><u>everything announced at that show here</u></a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Exploring Space as an Earth Directorate Agent</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Players are dropped into The Outer Worlds 2 as an Earth Directorate Agent. Obsidian describes these do-gooders as “space cowboys or space sky marshals” or  “good guys that go in to places and fix everything that’s wrong.” How you build out your character and experience from here, though, is up to you.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Filling out your character’s story means choosing things like a Background and Traits, with the latter setting the foundation for how you approach gameplay throughout the story. You can be Brilliant, Heroic, Innovative, Lucky – or Dumb, if that’s your thing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are also skills, which have been refined this time around, and perks, which are heavily inspired by the system used in Fallout: New Vegas. One example of a perk shown during the Direct is Assassin, an ability that grants a movement bonus after a stealth kill.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">More Guns, More Choice</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The Outer Worlds 2 is about expanding the universe Obsidian created in 2019, and that means introducing vast improvements to the gameplay across the board. There are more guns with more unique animations to be found here, with many of them shown off during the Direct.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s all very Borderlands, as some weapons carry unique traits. Rookie’s Reward is a great example of what’s in store, as this firearm slowly levels up with the player as it's used through the game, celebrating each new level with a confetti and fireworks show. There’s also the Pop-Up Gun, which distracts enemies with pop-up ads projected by a pesky drone. Another highlight is a music-infused sword that rewards players who smack enemies to the beat of a song.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Much of this creativity was carried over into the new throwable tools. Grenades, for example, can trigger a simple explosion, or players can use science grenades that suspend foes with zero-gravity technology.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for movement, Obsidian says it’s revamped its approach to exploration, too. That means more freedom to run, jump, slide, and parkour around Arcadia as they find valuable loot. You’ll also be able to take advantage of both first- and third-person perspectives after the option was absent from the original game.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Flaws Are Back and Better (and Worse) Than Ever</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">One beloved elements from the original The Outer Worlds were Flaws, a feature that gave players the option to take on negative attributes in exchange for other perks. We got to see four Flaws as part of today’s presentation: Bad Knees, Kleptomaniac, Sungazer, and Overprepared.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bad Knees gives players, well, bad knees, allowing them to move quicker in exchange for joints that pop (and alert enemies) when leaving the crouching position. Kleptomaniac grants higher selling values for stolen items while occasionally forcing players to nick some items against their will, while Sungazer causes permanent vision damage in exchange for a daytime healing passive and increased weapon spread. Overprepared is a Flaw for the kind of player who is always cautiously reloading, granting them increased magazine sizes with a penalty if a clip ever organically runs out of ammo.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Factions and Companions</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">To no one’s surprise, The Outer Worlds 2 is populated by an army of key factions and individuals to help and halt your journey. The Protectorate, for example, is described as an authoritarian group in the isolated colony of Arcadia.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Their dictatorship is thematically based around the question of how much freedom people will give up for security and luxury,” Obsidian describes. “For Protectorate subjects, unfortunately, that answer is ‘everything.’”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s also the Order of the Ascendant, an offshoot of the Order of Scientific Inquiry from the original Outer Worlds that also has past ties to The Protectorate. These major factions and more have been made to have close ties to the story and themes of The Outer Worlds 2, but they’ve also been made to be even more absurd as Obsidian aimed to expand the humor. Additionally, players can expect to listen to a Fallout: New Vegas-inspired radio system, which features stations from each major faction, with each carrying around 20 original songs. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Factions have been fleshed out and improved for The Outer Worlds 2, and Obsidian says companions, of which there are six, have received the same treatment. Niles, an Earth Directorate agent whose story can be shaped by the player’s action, is the first companion you’ll meet. Today’s Direct also showcased the “somewhat cute” automech drone, who helps Niles, named Val, as well as the deadly assassin and mathematician Marisol, the cultlist Aza, a combat medic who survived experimentation named Inez, and Tristan, a heavily armored Protectorate arbiter.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">The Bridge</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Obsidian wants players to know that they’ve got options when it comes to how they choose to experience The Outer Worlds 2, and the best example of player choice is an early mission called The Bridge. It’s all about finding ways to lower a bridge, with players able to take more straightforward options like convincing The Protectorate to lower the bridge themselves, sneaking to the control room, and going in guns blazing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Obsidian takes the options a step further, though, giving players the choice to use a shield that protects against poison gas to get around dangerous areas or jump boots that offer more traversal options. You can even sacrifice a companion in order to gain bridge clearance. This is the kind of freedom the team says players can expect from The Outer Worlds 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As today’s Direct came to a close, Obsidian shared its thoughts on the sequel, saying, “The Outer Worlds 2 is really the biggest game we’ve ever made.” As we move closer to its newly announced release date, it’s easy to see why. For more on The Outer Worlds 2, you can read up on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-outer-worlds-2-release-date-revealed-at-xbox-games-showcase"><u>its October release date announcement</u></a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/06/microsoft-dives-into-the-handheld-gaming-pc-wars-with-the-asus-rog-xbox-ally/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>Back in March, we <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/03/six-ways-microsofts-portable-xbox-could-be-a-steam-deck-killer/">outlined six features we wanted to see</a> on what was then just a rumored Xbox-branded, Windows-powered handheld gaming device. Today, Microsoft's <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/06/08/xbox-handheld-rog-ally-x-games-showcase/">announcement of the Asus ROG Xbox Ally hardware line</a> looks like it fulfills almost all of our wishes for Microsoft's biggest foray into portable gaming yet.</p>
<p>The Windows-11-powered Xbox Ally devices promise access to "all of the games available on Windows," including "games from Xbox, Game Pass, Battle.net, and other leading PC storefronts [read: Steam, Epic Games Store, Ubisoft Connect, etc]." But instead of having to install and boot up those games through the stock Windows interface, as you often do on handhelds like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/05/the-asus-rog-ally-runs-windows-eats-battery-and-needs-time-to-cook/">the original ROG Ally line</a>, all these games will be available through what Microsoft is calling an "aggregated gaming library."</p>


<p>Asus and Microsoft are stressing how that integrated experience can be used with games across multiple different Windows-based launchers, promising "access to games you can't get elsewhere." That could be seen as a subtle dig at SteamOS-powered devices like the Steam Deck, which <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/03/why-the-steam-deck-might-be-too-open-for-fortnite-and-destiny-2/">can have significant trouble with certain titles</a> that don't play well with Steam and/or Linux for one reason or another. Microsoft also highlights how support apps like Discord, Twitch, and downloadable game mods will also be directly available via the Xbox Ally's Windows backbone.</p>
<p>And while the Xbox Ally devices run Windows 11, they will boot to what Microsoft is calling the "Xbox Experience for Handheld," a bespoke full-screen interface that hides the nitty-gritty of the Windows desktop by default. That gaming-focused interface will "minimize background activity and defer non-essential tasks," meaning "more [and] higher framerates" for the games themselves, Microsoft says. A rhombus-shaped Xbox button located near the left stick will also launch an Xbox Game Bar overlay with quick access to functions like settings, performance metrics, and fast switching between titles. Microsoft also says it is working on <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/10/valves-deck-verified-badge-will-show-which-games-run-well-on-steam-deck/">a "Deck Verified"-style program</a> for identifying Windows titles that "have been optimized for handhelds."</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sunless-sea">Sunless Sea</a> and Mask of the Rose developer Failbetter Games has unveiled Mandrake, its very first project away from the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallen-london">Fallen London</a> universe. It's a rural life sim set in a "world of old, wild powers" where horticulture is forbidden, and it'll eventually be making its way to PC.
</p>
<p>
Taking inspiration from British history and folklore, Mandrake casts players as the last in a line of horticultural sorcerers - one who finally returns to their family's abandoned home in the 'small, complicated' village of Chandley after a long time away. 
</p>
<p>
Initially at least, Mandrake sounds like pretty familiar stuff. You'll tend to your garden, fish, forage, cook, and craft furniture to decorate your home; you'll venture into the woods, to the beach, to the mine in search of minerals, and into the community to befriend the locals, learning their stories and becoming intertwined with their lives.
</p>

<p>
But Failbetter's announcement hints at something a little darker and more mysterious around Mandrake's periphery, and it's here the studio's knack for the peculiar starts to peek through. Soon, for instance, you'll be trading turnips and runner beans for stranger, more intriguing seeds; you can befriend a river, eavesdrop on the dead, drink with a god who lives in your chimney, and spend a haunted night at the Butcher's Oak.
</p>
<p>
The eccentric locals, meanwhile, include a hunter who makes pacts with the woods, and a girl saved from the sea, who still hears voices calling to her from beneath the waves. Chandley is home to spirits and other strange creatures too, including the long-armed Granny Jakes who lives in a hidden orchard, and Hroame, "sometimes stone and sometimes not". But not everything is friendly. "Don't go out after dark," Failbetter warns, "the night is not for you."
</p>
<p>
Mandrake doesn't have a release date yet, but Failbetter says that due to its complexity and "some very unusual features" it'll be seeking player feedback as the game continues its journey toward launch. To that end, it expects to run a number of playtests prior to Mandrake's release, so curious sorts should <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3710210/Mandrake/">considering wishlisting it on Steam</a>.
