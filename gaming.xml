<p>It's a goal!</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>One of the most unique a beautiful games of the year — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/despelote">despelote</a> — is all about the beautiful game itself and the communities it helps build, and it's coming to Switch on <strong>11th December</strong> in North America for just <strong>$14.99</strong>.</p>
<p>Japan will get it on 18th December, while the rest of the world will have to wait for kick-off on 13th January 2026.</p>
<p>despelote isn't your typical soccer game where you're kicking about a ball to win matches; this is a slice-of-life narrative-driven experience which is all about the importance of soccer to Ecuador and, in particular to eight-year-old Julián, in the run up to the World Cup.</p>
<p>In despelote, you'll dribble, pass, and shoot the ball around Quito, but not for victory — simply, to connect. How will people react? Will Ecuador qualify for the World Cup? And how does everyone feel about the beautiful game, of their city, their country?</p>
<p>It's a short game too, clocking in at around 2 hours, but from looking at reviews back when the game launched on PC, PlayStation, and Xbox in May, it'll stick with you long after. Here's a rundown of what toe expect from the game:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><u>Features:</u></p>
<p>- A bittersweet and sometimes dreamy semi-autobiographical tale of youth.<br>
- Explore a dense town space at your leisure, full of activities, interactions, and mischief to get up to.<br>
- A physics-based soccer ball that feels good to kick around in a first-person perspective.<br>
- A vibrant world full of characters that have funny, and genuine conversations.<br>
- Photos and audio recorded on location in Ecuador are used to create a strong sense of place.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/ea-sports-fc-26-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-battlefield-6-black-friday-eu-sales/</link>
            <guid>1376203</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>A new report from <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/ps5-ea-sports-fc-26-and-hogwarts">The Game Business</a> has, as it does each week, the latest <a href="https://www.gamesalesdata.com/login">GSD Sales Data</a> for the top-selling games in the EU. This time, the weekly sales are from the week of November 24-30, which includes all of the Black Friday sales numbers, with EA Sports FC 26 winning the day in both sales by revenue and units sold. Meanwhile, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 was able to stay ahead of Battlefield 6.</p>



<p>In fairness, both of fall 2025's popular shooters were in the top five for the week, with Black Ops 7 riding its launch wave and Battlefield 6 <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-black-friday-deal-amazon/">getting put on a fairly significant Black Friday sale</a>, though the discount <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-loses-ground-eu-sales-charts-black-friday-sales/">wasn't enough to change the rankings from the week before</a>, with Black Ops 7 still holding fast just above Battlefield 6.</p>



<p>Hogwarts Legacy was another notable entry in the charts. Even though it came in eighth place on the sales by revenue chart, it shot up all the way to second place in the units sold chart, beating Black Ops 7 and Battlefield 6. Red Dead Redemption 2 rounded out the top five units sold list, while on the revenue charts, after Battlefield 6 in third, Pokémon Legends Z-A and NBA 2K26 rounded out the top five in fourth and fifth place, respectively.</p>



<p>None of the entries in the revenue chart or units sold chart were brand new releases, with everyone taking advantage of Black Friday sales to pick up older games they had been eyeing. In fact, the most recent release on both charts was technically Black Ops 7, since it's the only game on either top ten list that released in November 2025.</p>



<p>Here's the list of the top ten best-selling games in the EU by units sold for the week of November 24-30, per The Game Business.</p>



<ol>
<li>EA Sports FC 26</li>



<li>Hogwarts Legacy</li>



<li>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</li>



<li>Battlefield 6</li>



<li>Red Dead Redemption 2</li>



<li>It Takes Two</li>



<li>Grand Theft Auto V</li>



<li>Pokemon Legends Z-A</li>



<li>NBA 2K26</li>



<li>F1 25</li>
</ol>



<p>Here's the list of the top ten best-selling games in the EU by revenue for the week of November 24-30, per The Game Business.</p>

<li>Ghost of Yotei</li>



<li>Hogwarts Legacy</li>



<li>Marvel's Spider-Man 2</li>



<li>Super Mario Galaxy 1 + 2</li>
</ol>



<p>Elsewhere in The Game Business' report, on the hardware side of things per NielsenIQ, it was the PlayStation 5, not the Nintendo Switch 2, that was the hottest hardware item of the week. Not that the Switch 2 was a slouch, but significant discounts <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-available-at-lowest-price-of-648-99-on-amazon-despite-sale-period-ended/">on the PS5 Pro</a> and<a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-takes-100-off-ps5-for-black-friday-sales/"> base PS5 models</a> helped push it to be, according to The Game Business, the only console to actually improve on its sales numbers compared to last year.</p>



<p>Overall, not the most surprising Black Friday sales charts. Popular sports games and first-person shooters are at the top of the charts, with the rest of the list filled up by regulars on the charts like Rockstar's Grand Theft Auto V and Red Dead Redemption 2. </p>



<p>Though you do wonder if Microsoft continues to change how it delivers its games, <a href="https://wccftech.com/former-xbox-exec-says-microsoft-would-be-delighted-to-avoid-making-hardware-and-delivering-games-netflix-style/">particularly if it goes full-on into the Netflix-style distribution as former executive Peter Moore suggested</a>, will Call of Duty or any other Microsoft-owned game still make these charts, or will the subscription-based focus leave a gap for other games to claim a spot as one of the regularly best-selling games week-to-week?</p>

            <p>The modders behind <a href="https://beyondskyrim.org/project/cyrodiil">Beyond Skyrim: Cyrodiil</a>, the massive <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-skyrim-mods">modding</a> project aiming to add a post-Oblivion-crisis version of the Imperial province to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</a>'s map, have given a lengthy tour of the latest city they've whipped into shape. As <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/beyond-skyrim-cyrodiil-the-full-imperial-expansion-from-the-devs-of-skyrims-massive-bruma-mod-gets-a-bird-chatter-heavy-teaser">teased the other week</a>, that city is Anvil, and it's certainly home to some quirky folks.</p>
<p>Just in case of confusion, what makes Beyond Skyrim different to both Bethesda's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">Oblivion Remastered</a> and recently delayed Oblivion remake mod <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skyblivion">Skyblivion</a> is that it'll be introducing a fresh cast of characters and stories to familiar locations from the fourth Elder Scrolls game. After all, by the time of Skyrim, Martin Septim and his contemporaries are long gone.</p>

<p>Aside from the fact that existing Skyrim map expansion <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/skyrim-beyond-bruma-mod-released">Beyond Skyrim: Bruma</a> offers a great early taste of what this group of modders can pull off, what's intrigued me most so far is the project's mission to wind forward time and tell new tales. After all, Oblivion's a nice game to retread, but I've seen the narrative it has to offer plenty of times at this point.</p><p>However, having watched a good chunk of that livestream embedded above, where the Beyond Skyrim team show off some of the stories and characters they've worked into Anvil, my feelings are a bit mixed. The city itself looks brilliant, having been expanded and given an architectural feel which blends Cyrodiilic vibes with the deserty aesthetic of neighbouring province Hammerfell.</p>
<p>The layout still invokes plenty of nostalgia, while Beyond Skyrim's team look to have arguably leant more towards zany comedy with the side characters and quests who pop up to newcomers than the notoriously eccentric Oblivion did. Upon first entering the city, you come across and encounter with two drunken sailors swimming in the town's pod. A guard jumps in to arrest them, and these two loinclothed lads sprint off through the city; according to the devs, the idea is that you might pursue their nearly-bare bottoms and do some sightseeing. Or, maybe you'll move on and talk to an Argonian named Left-Hand who randomly demands you tell him what 4833 x 76 is.</p>
<p>Maelorn, an older version of one of the two elven twins you might remember from Oblivion, is less on the weird side, since he just asks you a riddle and then reminisces about his life since the days of The Elder Scrolls 4.</p>
<p>Anyway, what grabbed my attention the most was a quest involving a kid called Jinol, which kicks off in Anvil bazaar about half an hour in. It's simply called Child Labour, and is about, er, that. Jinol wants your help setting up a business selling saltwater from the docks door-to-door, so you recruit other kids to act as runners. So far, so quirky little quest in terms of premise. The idea's that you gradually realise that you maybe shouldn't just be going along with trying to make a buck off some kids doing work an adult should be doing, at least if the Elder Scrolls' world is being kept a bit more on the 'fantasy' side of the 'medieval fantasy' coin.</p><p>There is one character, a merchant named Pavia Tara, who calls you out and asks if you've considered the ethics of your actions. However, at the moment the modders seem to have reduced her to being a one-dimensional scolding Karen, even if she does weave a bit of small business vs big business chatter into her rant, mirroring the city's wider themes.</p>
<p>There's a spot of tonal whiplash there, alongside the quest's very on-the-nose name. Then, we meet Franny. Basically, you and Jinol go and meet the owner of a big fishing company, Francis of Anvil. He lives with multiple wives in a house the devs say was at least in part inspired by the Playboy mansion. Franny literally goes "Child labour, why didn't I think of that", and offers to buy out Jinol's business. You help the kid decide whether or not this grown, multiple-wife guy gets to save money by relying on child labour.</p>
<p>The quest is mostly played for laughs, and I certainly don't think the goal is to make light of what remains <a href="https://www.unicef.org/protection/child-labour">a real issue</a> in our own world. Plus, the modders have aimed to make the kids essentially act like mini-adults. However, I'm not sure the quest strikes an effective balance between wacky/edgy humour, and making the player confront the morals behind what starts out as innocent fun.</p>
<p>As things go, it hasn't put me off Beyond Skyrim: Cyrodiil entirely – I’m still keen to see what other sorts of tales the modders have weaved into their work. But it wouldn’t be the first time a mod has mishandled controversial or delicate themes in an attempt at crafting fresh narratives, and while Jinol’s water distribution service isn’t anywhere near the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-the-frontier-goes-offline-after-modder-accused-of-sharing-animated-paedophilic-content">worst examples</a>, it is something I hope gets revisited. Maybe when they go back to swap all the placeholder AI voices for real ones.</p>

            <guid>1376188</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A holiday splurge is a good thing. A holiday splurge also does not mean paying full price for a bit of indulgence. That’s why we’re giving a hearty thumbs up to <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6278/">this Amazon deal that cuts 35% off the price of the truly jawdropping Samsung Odyssey Neo G9 curved gaming monito</a>r, a 57-inch giant with 4K UHD resolution and elite-level speed and refresh rate. The Odyssey Neo G9 is one of the absolute best gaming monitors available anywhere, and with this $800+ price plunge, it can and should be your 2025 holiday splurge at just $1,500.</p>
<p>Samsung’s established itself as the best monitor brand in the U.S., earning that title and best gaming monitor brand in the U.S. for two years running. The Odyssey Neo G9 is the best evidence of why — it’s truly huge, and the curved effect and flawless performance create one of the most immersive gaming experiences ever.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6278/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>The World’s First Dual UHD Monitor</h2>
<p>Talk about unique — the Samsung Odyssey Neo G9 is the first dual UHD monitor ever. The 57-inch display is as wide as two UHD monitors and brings every bit of the mindblowing detail and sharpness across the entire field of view. The action literally wraps around you as you play, giving you as deeply immersive an experience as you can get without using VR goggles.</p>
<p>The 240Hz refresh rate is a lock-solid lag killer, and the 1ms response time ensures that you are on top of your game, every time, with every move. This is the kind of speed that pro gamers use in competition, but at a far smaller price during this Amazon deal. The Odyssey Neo G9 also supports DisplayPort 2.1 for the latest and best connection.</p>
<p>AMD FreeSync Premium Pro technology is built into the monitor to create absolute sync between the Odyssey Neo G9 and the graphics processor of your console or PC, eliminating stutter, tearing, and other game-killing flaws.</p>



<h2>Outrageous Detail</h2>
<p>Samsung’s Quantum Matrix Technology with Quantum Mini LEDs creates some of the best brightness and contrast of any monitor anywhere. There are 2,392 separate dimming zones across the massive screen that combined with outstanding 12-bit black levels to create astoundingly accurate picture quality. The contrast ratio of 1 million to 1, spread over 57 inches of gaming space, will make you unbeatable.</p>
<p>The CoreSync and Core Lighting Plus won’t enhance your gaming, but they will greatly enhance your gaming space and save you the cost of buying gaming lights separately. The CoreSync tech projects your on-screen colors into the room behind you, with the gaming action and the lighting effects in perfect sync.</p>
<p>The Samsung Odyssey Neo G9 gaming monitor — 57 inches of brilliant 4K UHD resolution and blazing speed and refresh rate — is a truly elite device that’s just come way, way down from its elite price. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6278/">It’s $800 off at Amazon right now, but only for a limited time, so don’t miss out on your chance to splurge on yourself.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-season-5-ghosts-n-goblins-nes-arcade-error-2000649178"><i><span>Stranger Things</span></i><span>’ fifth and final season</span></a><span> is rolling out on </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-warner-bros-deal-batman-hbo-max-2000650875"><span>Netflix</span></a><span>, and it’s true, something certainly seems stranger than in previous seasons this time around. Viewers of the long-running supernatural coming-of-age drama are arguing that the show’s writing has taken a massive nosedive, and even as someone who isn’t actively watching the series, I feel like some of the clips popping up on my social media feeds are not flattering. Fans think a Netflix initiative might be to blame.</span></p> <p><span>Take, for example, these two clips of Noah Schnapp and Finn Wolfhard delivering extremely simple, flavorless dialogue with a seriousness and gravitas the language doesn’t earn. Some folks attribute the awkwardness of these scenes to the actors’ performances, but others point out that it’s not just the self-serious delivery that’s the problem; it’s that it’s mixed with dialogue so straightforward that it reads like a mandated plot summary for those who haven’t been paying attention.&nbsp;</span></p>

   <p><span>This dumbing down of dialogue is just one part of the issue; some are also criticizing the uptick in obnoxious quip-driven writing. Some fans are quick to point out that teenagers might believably say cheesy stuff like the kids do in </span><i><span>Stranger Things</span></i><span>, however, so that’s more of an ongoing debate. The pushback hasn’t stopped people from making parodies of the latest season, likening its banter to cringe TikTok speak or MCUisms.</span></p>

In January, </span><a href="https://www.nplusonemag.com/issue-49/essays/casual-viewing/"><i><span>N+1</span></i></a> <span>ran a story that detailed initiatives within the streaming company which told creatives to essentially treat the service’s original programming as if viewers are going to be on their phones scrolling through social media as they watch it. This means dialogue is dumbed down, basic plot points are repeated unnaturally in spoken exchanges, and ideally someone can follow what’s going on, even if the show doesn’t have their undivided attention.</span></p> <p><span>It’s a real shame that </span><i><span>Stranger Things </span></i><span>might be falling into this trap in its final season, as fans have been waiting nearly a decade for this show to wrap up. Hopefully, the second set of episodes and the eventual finale will fare better when they’re released on Christmas and New Year’s Eve. Also, let’s hope that this doesn’t end up bleeding into all of the upcoming Warner Bros. projects if Netflix’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-wb-batman-arkham-hogwarts-legacy-mortal-kombat-2000650918"><span>merger goes through</span></a><span>.</span></p>

<p>The Fortnite OG Chapter 1 Season 7 release date carries on Epic’s new mission to let everyone relive the early years by experiencing older content again from top to bottom. Key content for Fortnite OG Chapter 1 Season 7 has been revealed, showing you what you can look forward to for several weeks.</p>



<p>Fortnite OG Chapter 1 Season 7 celebrates the battle royale’s Christmas period from SEVEN years ago. The game has changed dramatically over the last seven years, and while <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-dark-voyager-quest-rewards-chapter-7-season-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1</a> begins the next significant milestone in the game’s history, it’s time for a Holiday throwback.</p>



<p>OG Chapter 1 Season 7 brings back some banging skins and some beloved POIs and weapons.</p>

<p><strong>Fortnite OG Chapter 1 Season 7 releases on December 11, exactly two weeks out from Christmas Day!</strong></p>



<p>It’s time to put in some real work. Alongside Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1 is OG Chapter 1 Season 7. It’s a testament to Epic to keep so many areas of the game in operation at once. But the nostalgic return to bygone Fortnite eras has been a huge dub in the community.</p>



<p>The OG Chapter 1 Season 7’s tagline was “You Better Watch Out,” and Insider Gaming will tell you why.</p>

<p><strong>Alongside returning Xmas-themed POIs and a new OG Battle Pass, you can look forward to the Boom Box, Stink Bombs, a Scoped Revolver, and much more in Fortnite OG Chapter 1 Season 7.</strong></p>



<p>Here’s a quick summary of every item outed by Epic Games ahead of Fortnite OG Chapter 1 Season 7 so far:</p>



<ul>
<li>Balloons</li>



<li>Boom Box</li>



<li>Dual Pistols</li>



<li>Glider Redeploy</li>



<li>Infinity Blade (In-Season)</li>



<li>New Battle Pass</li>



<li>New POIs
<ul>
<li>Polar Peak</li>



<li>Happy Hamlet</li>



<li>Frosty Flights</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Scoped AR</li>



<li>Scoped Revolver</li>



<li>Stink Bombs</li>



<li>Suppressed Sniper Rifle</li>



<li>X-4 Stormwing</li>
</ul>



<p>Chapter 7’s storyline was a fairly new narrative more in keeping with the theme of Christmas. You too can experience this all for yourself when Fortnite OG Chapter 1 Season 7 drops a few days from now.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/first-player-escape-tarkov-streamer-item/</link>
            <guid>1376179</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Tigz, who was documented last week as being the first person in the world to successfully escape from Tarkov, has been awarded a unique streamer item by Battlestate Games. These items are used to represent the respect that Battlestate Games has for the content creators who pour their lives into pulling Escape from Tarkov into the limelight time and again.</p>



<p>There are dozens of streamer items in the game, but the latest one belongs to Tigz, and it’s a tongue-in-cheek reference to the failed runs that prevented him from getting out of Tarkov without too many issues.</p>



<h2 id="h-tigz-has-a-streamer-item">Tigz Has a Streamer Item</h2>



<p>Tigz has a unique streamer item that’s reminiscent of his time spent <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/someone-finally-escaped-from-tarkov/">escaping through Terminal</a>, the final map in Battlestate Games’ tough extraction shooter. In his first attempt, which was watched by tens of thousands of people, Tigz fell short of the ending after failing to find a splint to patch an injury that ultimately led to his death.</p>



<p>That forced him to try again, numerous times.</p>



<p>To honor and recognize that moment, Battlestate Games created a unique <strong>splint </strong>for Tigz’s streamer item – <strong>Tigzresq</strong>. It’s a <strong>67-inch </strong>splint in a red and black design that may or may not be practical. <span>Streamer items&nbsp;<strong>are rarely</strong></span><strong> </strong>practical, but if any will have an honest, in-game use, it’s the Tigzresq.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Another streamer item with a practical use is Gingy’s keychain, which does what you’d imagine and holds keys. There’s also WillerZ’s wallet, the RatCola, sprats, and a jar of mayo, amongst other things.</p>



<p>Whenever someone becomes big for streaming Escape from Tarkov, their streamer item is never too far behind. Fans of TheBurntPeanut, who recently won awards at The Streamer Awards, are clamouring for a unique item in Escape from Tarkov, given the amount of time the VTuber (sorry, PTuber) has spent in the game in recent years.</p>



<p>If you had a streamer item in Escape from Tarkov, what would it be? Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

<p>The end result, rather sadly, is that younger Pokémon fans are being denied the chance to grab cards for themselves.</p>
<p>British news outlet <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/dec/08/how-pokemon-cards-became-a-stock-market-for-millennials">The Guardian</a> has been speaking to retailers and fans to get their take on the current state of the Pokémon Trading Card Game in the UK, and it's not particularly pleasant reading.</p>
<p>Ben Thyer, the owner of the independent store BathTCG, says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"My staff have had customers threatening to come back and rip their heads off. It’s become quite unpleasant at times. I’ve heard of other stores where people have been attacked or there have been robberies. We’ve even seen people who buy our products and list them immediately on Facebook, while still in our carrier bags, or sell it right outside the shop. We’re even anxious to put stuff on the shelf for the public because we just don’t want to entice that sort of behaviour. We used to sell whole boxes of booster packs but now we’ve had to stop doing that, and even place limits on the individual packs."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Demand has consistently outstripped supply in the world of Pokémon TCG for a few years now, but Thyer thinks a correction is perhaps on the way – although it may not last for very long:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"There are signs of the market cracking – prices of singles are coming down, sealed products are coming down. People aren’t as ferocious as they once were. There’s also a lot of people now thinking, ‘Christmas is soon and I need some money because I’ve not made what I was hoping for [from reselling cards]’. So we’ll see it dip, but then early 2026 brings Pokémon’s 30th anniversary, so I think we’ll see another crazy period."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Hideo Kojima is no stranger to creating unique experiences that challenge established gameplay formulas. With the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/death-stranding-pc-uniting-world/">Death Stranding series</a></strong>, the legendary creator of the Metal Gear Solid series has created open-world experiences that are markedly different from anything else on the market, transforming a desolate post-apocalyptic world into the perfect setting for players to form meaningful bonds through gameplay. With the horror game OD, however, it sounds like the legendary creator will push video game boundaries even further, as he isn't sure the experience will work out in the end.</p>



<p>As translated by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/hideo-kojima-says-od-is-something-completely-different-from-a-standard-horror-game-we-still-dont-know-if-it-will-work-out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Automaton</strong></a>, Kojima-san recently talked about OD and the challenges the game will face in a new interview with <a href="https://ananweb.jp/categories/entertainment/74735" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>ananweb</strong></a>. <em>"I can’t say exactly what it is yet, nor do I know if it will work out. We’ve created stealth games and delivery games which were unlike anything before, but system-wise, they were similar to other games. This time, we’re trying to change the service model from the ground up, so it should be quite challenging,"</em> Kojima-san said.</p>



<p>While we still don't know exactly how OD will play, according to Hideo Kojima, there's already a way to understand the experience better. <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"We’ve packed <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" href="https://wccftech.com/od-hideo-kojima-horror-game-xbox-revealed-jordan-peele/">the trailer</a></strong> full of hints, so if you keep thinking about it, you might figure it out."</em> </p>



<p>I, for one, am not ashamed to admit I haven't any clue about the game as much as anyone else. However, <a href="https://wccftech.com/hideo-kojima-disappointed-industry/"><strong>OD being so different from anything else</strong></a> is making me quite excited about what it will offer over traditional horror games, which deserve a major shake-up since they haven't really moved past the experience established by the Resident Evil series in any significant way.</p>



<p>As for when we will be able to understand more about OD, no one can say. With Hideo Kojima having released Death Stranding 2: On the Beach this year (and with <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-pc-version-rated-esrb-published-by-sony/">a PC port</a></strong> likely getting announced during this year's <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-where-to-watch-all-nominations-what-to-expect/"><strong>The Game Awards</strong></a>), it may be a while until the studio is ready to unveil a project that sounds more promising by the day.</p>

            <guid>1376140</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Dell makes some of our favorite laptops out there, and if you’re a student or a work professional looking to grab a solid option without shelling out big bucks, Amazon is making that possible today.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6277/">The 15-inch Dell Inspiron laptop, which typically sits at a not-so-friendly price of $2,400, is sitting at just $760 at the retailer, after a massive 68% discount – the lowest we have seen it drop to in 30 days.</a> You’re even getting a whole bunch of useful accessories, plus Windows 11 Pro pre-installed with your purchase, for absolutely nothing to sweeten the deal even more. We’re expecting it to be a popular pick this holiday season, so you might want to grab it before the stock starts thinning out.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6277/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Massive Memory, Spacious Storage</h2>
<p>For under $800, you’re getting a 15.6-inch Full HD IPS touchscreen that delivers vibrant, immersive, true-to-life visuals consistently, whether you’re catching up on the latest episode of your favorite show or creating a work presentation. The anti-glare panel helps you fight reflections in brighter settings, while the Dell ComfortView software actively reduces harmful blue light to minimize eye strain during those all-nighters. Touch support makes navigation a breeze by letting you use just your fingers to pinch, scroll, swipe, zoom, and more directly on the screen. It comes in handy when you’re working through longer documents and don’t want to rely on the trackpad or the mouse to scroll, or when sharing the laptop with a friend and both of you need to access the screen or work on something together. Note that the screen does not fold all the way back as it does in 2-in-1 laptops, so this doesn’t exactly give you that tablet-like functionality.</p>
<p>The screen is paired with a full-sized keyboard that features a lift hinge design to keep your wrists comfortable while typing. Video calls are made easy with the built-in HD webcam that offers noise reduction for a clearer picture, even in low-light settings.</p>



<p>For power, Dell offers an Intel 13th Gen Core i5-1334U processor with 10 cores, 12 threads, and intelligent boost speeds up to 4.6 GHz. It’s more than capable of handling all your everyday work and play tasks, plus some resource-intensive creative projects with ease. The massive <strong>32GB of DDR4 RAM</strong> keeps the system running fast and smoothly, even when you’re trying to do multiple jobs at the same time. It’s excellent for demanding tasks like 4K video editing, running virtual machines, and even gaming with some apps running in the background.</p>
<p>Creatives and work professionals will also appreciate the<strong> 1 TB PCIe NVMe SSD</strong> that not just offers sufficient space to house all your data, but also ensures better boot times, quick file access, and faster file transfers. Basically, the processor, memory, and SSD come together to ensure a lag-free, smooth experience during both regular and demanding days. Connectivity-wise, you’re covered with the ultra-fast WiFi 6, Bluetooth, plus a wide range of ports like USB-C, USB 3.2, HDMI, and an SD card reader.</p>
<p><strong>The freebies include Windows 11 Pro pre-installed, a mouse, a 7-in-1 cleaning kit, a 128GB UFD, and a docking station</strong>. That’s everything you need to get started with work or play right away. Just note that drops this massive are only around for a short period of time before the stock runs out or the deal expires. If you’ve been after a reliable laptop that doesn’t blow your budget, this is it.</p>

              <p>We knew Paramount Skydance wanted to buy Warner Bros. Discovery. We knew that they company was pretty pissed when Warner CEO <a href="https://kotaku.com/holy-monopoly-batman-warner-bros-reportedly-reject-a-buyout-bid-from-paramount-2000634581">David Zaslav turned down the offer for $20 a share for the entire company</a>. And we knew that this became a fury when <a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-warner-bros-deal-batman-hbo-max-2000650875">Netflix and Warner agreed to a deal at $27.5 per share last week</a>. Now Paramount has reacted, and reacted&nbsp;<em>big</em>. The company has launched a hostile takeover bid, swooping in with a $30 per share offer, which works out to over $108 billion, $25 billion more than Netflix is paying.</p> <p>It was rumored earlier this year, while Zaslav was making it clear how much he wanted to sell Warner Discovery, that he was looking for $30 per share—a <em>massive</em> over-valuation of the company, but one he was looking to justify <a href="https://www.wbd.com/news/warner-bros-discovery-separate-two-leading-media-companies">by splitting the company</a>, severing off the “Discovery” parts and its loss-making cable networks, and loading that doomed company with all of Warner’s debts. Paramount’s opening bid at $20, however, was for the whole shebang. Netflix, however, outbid everyone by agreeing to $27.5 per share&nbsp;<em>after</em> the split, which is due to happen in the second half of 2026.</p>

 <p>Now, Paramount is going hard in its efforts to prevent this, increasing its previous offer by an enormous 50 percent, and again for the whole company and all its debt. The <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cj69xzpzrdyo"><em>BBC</em> reports that</a> the company, backed by the billionaire Ellison family, called this bid a “superior alternative,” and clearly one designed to make shareholders revolt if Warner sticks with Netflix’s lower offer.</p>

 <p>This was never likely to go smoothly. If the Netflix deal goes through, it would make the streamer one of the most powerful players in Hollywood, and with the absorption of HBO Max an even more dominant force in streaming. Regulators were absolutely going to be scrutinizing this, and in a time when such bodies are now fully under the control of president Donald Trump’s mercurial (and self-interested) whims, that could go in any direction. Things were looking positive for Netflix in this regard, after its CEO Ted Sarandos had recently been to the Oval Office, likely to play on the president’s infantile habit of agreeing with the last confident voice that spoke to him. However, Sunday night Trump gave hints that he was going to be a wrench in the works, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-netflix-warner-bros-merger-problem-f3e317b61899d34ce507ba38af4a2934">saying the deal “could be a problem.”</a></p>

 <p>It’s also worth noting that the recent Paramount and Skydance merger only took place after the company, er, “settled” a legal dispute with Trump <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/07/trump-paramount-settlement-skydance-1236465383/">by giving him $16 million</a>.</p> <p>Paramount’s offer would work out to $108.4 billion for the whole company, including its cable networks, dwarfing Netflix’s post-debt removal offer of $83 billion. Warner Bros. Discovery isn’t worth close to either figure—optimistically valued at around $10 a share six months ago, and Paramount itself is only worth $11 billion in its own right. Larry Ellison, who backs the company, is said to be worth nearly $270 billion, so could certainly afford it, but it’d still be the most extraordinary outlay were there to be no external investors involved. As more details come to light from <em>Axios</em> reporter Sara Fischer, it seems that—inevitably—a lot of the money will come from wealth funds including Saudi Arabia’s, Qatar’s and the UAE’s, among others.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">🚨🚨 WOW. Paramount's initial press statement didn't include a mention of sov wealth funds, but sep SEC filing said other outside financing partners include funds from Saudis, Qataris, Emirates as well as Jared Kushner's Affinity Partners (!)<br>Those funders, "have agreed to forgo… <a href="https://t.co/5kkhRQWHx4">https://t.co/5kkhRQWHx4</a></p> <p>— Sara Fischer (@sarafischer) <a href="https://twitter.com/sarafischer/status/1998042711698378973?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 8, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The&nbsp;<em>New York Times</em>‘ Lauren Hirsch further details the figures, stating that $24 billion of the total will be sourced this way, with a further billion from Tencent, and then a bunch from RedBird Capital Partners and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner’s Affinity Partners. Kushner’s involvement could explain Trump’s intervention over the weekend.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Paramount’s bid for WBD is backed in part by <br>– $24bn from Middle Eastern sovereign wealth funds <br>– $1bn from China’s Tencent<br>– Jared Kushner’s private equity firm <a href="https://t.co/Kdt94WevPc">pic.twitter.com/Kdt94WevPc</a></p> <p>— Lauren Hirsch (@LaurenSHirsch) <a href="https://twitter.com/LaurenSHirsch/status/1998050914674811068?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 8, 2025</a></p></blockquote>   <p>So, there we are, more excitement in the world of billionaires buying up everything to feed us their homogenized sludge.</p> <p><em><strong>Updated: 12/08/2025, 11:17 a.m. ET:</strong> Updated the post to add details about Paramount’s potential investors in the deal.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Saros rating has appeared in Taiwan for the title’s standard and deluxe editions, suggesting pre-orders are imminent. </p>



<p>Housemarque’s Saros is one of the most anticipated titles of 2026 and also the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/saros-is-the-next-game-from-housemarque/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">next PlayStation exclusive</a> from the studio after Returnal. We have already seen some gameplay and have a release date for Saros as well; all players are waiting for now is for pre-orders to open. </p>







<h2 id="h-saros-rating-appears-in-taiwan">Saros Rating Appears in Taiwan</h2>



<p>Spotted by Gematsu on <a href="https://x.com/gematsu/status/1997915897218961521" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), Saros’s standard and digital deluxe editions have been rated in Taiwan. Both versions have been rated ‘PG-15’ and contain violence and shooting according to the rating. Many players think that with the game’s rating surfacing now, a pre-order announcement could arrive soon; however, there is no official word from the developers. Interestingly, the rating has appeared very close to The Game Awards 2025, so could we expect an announcement there? Also, could Saros be the game behind the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-mystery-statue-new-mexico-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mysterious statue</a>?</p>



<p>For those unaware, Saros is an upcoming sci-fi adventure that has players taking on the role of Arjun Devraj, a Soltari enforcer who will stop at nothing to pursue answers on the shape-shifting world of Carcosa. The title features a constantly evolving world, and you will need to find permanent resources to ensure it yields for you. It also features a high-tech arsenal of weapons, which has players dodging, shielding, and parrying enemy attacks in a “fluid, flow-state-inducing dance.”</p>







<p>In other news, check out Saros’s latest <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/saros-gameplay-release-trailer-state-of-play-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gameplay trailer</a>, revealed during September’s State of Play event.

            <title><![CDATA[Paramount Reveals Hostile Offer for Warner Bros Worth $18 Billion More]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/paramount-hostile-bid-for-warner-bros-billions/</link>
            <guid>1376131</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Last week, Netflix revealed an $82.7 billion deal to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery and carve out a monumental corner of the media streaming empire. Now, Paramount has clapped back with a hostile bid, slamming Netflix and claiming that it had offered an ‘inferior proposal’ for WBD.</p>



<p>Paramount’s representatives have promised a tender offer of $30 per share, compared to Netflix’s $27.75 offer. It’s also a bid to avoid splitting up Warner Bros. Discovery, which is what the Netflix acquisition would do. If Paramount is successful, it’ll acquire WBD in its entirety.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-paramount-or-netflix-buy-warner-bros-discovery">Will Paramount or Netflix Buy Warner Bros. Discovery?</h2>



<p>In a post from <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/paramount-launches-hostile-bid-for-warner-bros-1236444601/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, it was confirmed that Paramount had filed a hostile proposal in the wake of Netflix’s revelation in the WBD arena. In a statement, David Ellison, the CEO of Paramount, explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>WBD shareholders deserve an opportunity to consider our superior all-cash offer for their shares in the entire company.</p>



<p>Our public offer, which is on the same terms we provided to the Warner Bros. Discovery Board of Directors in private, provides superior value, and a more certain and quicker path to completion. We believe the WBD Board of Directors is pursuing an inferior proposal which exposes shareholders to a mix of cash and stock, an uncertain future trading value of the Global Networks linear cable business and a challenging regulatory approval process. </p>



<p>We are taking our offer directly to shareholders to give them the opportunity to act in their own best interests and maximize the value of their shares.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The Hollywood Reporter anticipates a lengthy process to follow, with Paramount and Netflix lobbying and counter-lobbying for the acquisition rights of Warner Bros. Discovery. </p>



<p>In a strange twist, it was later revealed that Paramount published a website dubbed ‘StrongerHollywood’, aimed at rubbing Netflix the wrong way and proving that Paramount’s offer is much more worthwhile for the wider industry.</p>



<p>Whichever media titan is successful, they’ll gain ownership of Warner Bros.’ <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/every-studio-affected-by-warner-bros-netflix-merger/">gaming studios</a>, including the likes of Avalanche, NetherRealm, Rocksteady, and TT Games, as well as the WB Games branches.</p>

<p>A fascinating interview with Assassin’s Creed game director Simon Lemay-Comtois has revealed that the team is eager to learn from past mistakes and oversights for future Assassin’s Creed games, such as a lack of parkour focus.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-x-attack-on-titan-crossover-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a> was a financial and critical success. It may not go down as peak AC, but it’s a solid return to form. Shadows, in particular, and its post-launch content are looking to bring back a classic gameplay tradition, and have spoken about the use of dual-player mechanics in additional releases down the line.</p>

<p>An Insider Gaming exclusive revealed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-further-details-on-the-assassins-creed-roadmap-and-what-games-to-expect/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">further details on the Assassin’s Creed Roadmap and what games to expect</a>. There is clearly a long road ahead for the franchise, and Shadows was the latest mainline release.</p>







<p>Shadows game director Simon Lemay-Comtois told <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/assassin-s-creed/we-are-hard-to-beat-9-months-since-assassins-creed-shadows-its-associate-director-looks-back-on-what-makes-this-rpg-the-best-in-series-history/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a> that the current release and future AC games should focus on one gameplay mechanic that’s been missing:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Pay more attention to parkour in future games as its own pillar. We’re trying to rectify that in post-launch with Shadows and push that narrative internally to say, parkour matters. Let’s really push parkour forward.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Old-school AC fans will remember scaling towns and cities across Italy, whereas recent games have placed less emphasis on verticality in favor of grander open-world design and combat.</p>



<p>There’s still an inherent desire for the basics of Assassin’s Creed roots. Speaking of which, another newer addition (opposing convention) in the last few years has been the incorporation of dual-player stories.</p>



<p>Lemay-Comtois has indicated that the system won’t be going away if it makes sense for the project:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Dual protagonists can be divisive along very strange lines, right? It’s not just a ‘well, I prefer a war, therefore I prefer Yasuke.’ Some people just don’t like one character over the other, and they don’t like to spend time with one. It was true with Evie and Jacob, but with Naoe and Yasuke it’s more divisive. And we knew this. We knew going into it, but I think it can split our fan base a little too.</p>



<p>I think the learning for us is that, yes, we could do more dual-protagonist games in the future –&nbsp;<em>if&nbsp;</em>we have a good reason to do it narratively and for the setting.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We know that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-black-flag-remake-set-to-launch-before-march/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag Remake</a> won’t be using two-player mechanics, and parkour will be very much part of its DNA.

                <p>If you saw the Shenmue 4 trailer that went viral recently and were hoping it was leading to an announcement, then you're going to be disappointed. Ys Net, the studio founded by Shenmue creator Yu Suzuki, has issued a statement condemning the trailer as a fake while also hinting that it may take legal action against the trailer's creator.</p><p>In a post on social media, Ys Net said the fake Shenmue 4 trailer "uses our company logo without permission, falsely giving the impression that is an official Shenmue 4 related video produced by us." The statement adds that there have been no official Shenmue 4 materials released, and that the studio is "currently working with relevant parties and preparing appropriate measures, including potential legal action" against the creator of the trailer.</p><p>The original Shenmue was released in 1999 on Sega Dreamcast, and it cast players as a young man, Ryo Hazuki, as he sought to avenge his father's death. The game had innovative takes on open-world gameplay and quicktime events that proved to be very influential in the video game industry. Shenmue 2 followed in 2001, but the franchise went on hiatus due to low sales.</p><p>Following Suzuki's departure from Sega, Shenmue 3 was successfully crowdfunded and released in 2019. Earlier this year, Inin Games and Suzuki announced that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/shenmue-3-enhanced-announced-and-coming-to-xbox-and-nintendo-consoles-for-the-first-time/1100-6534028/" data-ref-id="1100-6534028">Shenmue 3 Enhanced</a> will be coming to PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S and Nintendo consoles. That version of the game will feature numerous visual upgrades including 4K texture uplift for the environments and characters. It will also feature increased density of NPC characters in the streets to make the game world feel more alive.</p><p>Last year, a group of dedicated Shenmue fans <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fans-campaign-for-shenmue-4-with-times-square-ad-in-new-york/1100-6523961/" data-ref-id="1100-6523961">launched a campaign for Shenmue 4</a> by purchasing a Times Square ad in New York. It remains to be seen if that campaign will ultimately lead to the franchise getting a new sequel.</p>

<p>"We hoped it would find its audience, the players who would love the freedom and mystery we tried to create," Lyu said. "But [nine] million players in two weeks … that number has honestly blown all our internal expectations out of the water. The mood in the studio is hard to put into words. There's definitely pride and excitement--seeing years of hard work resonate with so many people is a feeling like no other. But what really hits us, more than anything, is the sense of responsibility."</p><p>Lyu continued, saying the nine million players exploring Everstone Studio's fictionalized 10th-century China aren't "just a metric" but "nine million individual journeys." Looking at the player count that way, he told FRVR that it's "incredibly motivating and incredibly humbling" for Where Winds Meet to be this popular.</p><p>"To put it simply, the overwhelming feeling is one of deep gratitude and a focused determination," Lyu said. "This incredible show of trust isn't the end goal; it's the fuel. It's what pushes us to keep improving and expanding this world for everyone. The journey has really just begun, and we're so grateful to have this amazing community with us."</p><p>Lyu also said that although Where Winds Meet's monetization may be somewhat ridiculous, the game will not become pay-to-win, and the team has no plans to pursue any other "aggressive" forms of monetization. The only things you can buy will forever be cosmetics, something Lyu believes gives Everstone Studio an advantage over other free-to-play games on the market.</p><p>“We must protect our greatest commercial advantage--which is offering an experience free from the constraints of pay-to-win mechanics," Lyu said."Therefore, with that as our guiding principle, we see no need to become aggressive or introduce statistical advantages in the future."</p><p>Where Winds Meet is still sitting comfortably on Steam's <a href="https://steamdb.info/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">most-played games list</a> as of this writing, trailing just behind <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a>. With hundreds of thousands of players logging on at any time, Everstone Studio made it clear that if you cheat, you will get suspended; the developer <a href="https://x.com/WhereWindsMeet_/status/1997271025432834108" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">already took action against 5,000 accounts </a>for using software such as macros and speed hacking.

            <p>Hollywood studio Paramount isn't going to let <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-acquires-warner-bros-in-827bn-deal-including-studios-behind-mortal-kombat-and-hogwarts-legacy">Netflix's Warner Bros. acquisition</a> go ahead without a bidding war. The historic filmmaking company announced an offer of its own for Warner Bros. today, which is even bigger than Netflix's "inferior" proposal.</p>
<p>Paramount is offering $18bn more in cash than Netflix, <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/paramount-launches-all-cash-tender-offer-to-acquire-warner-bros-discovery-for-30-per-share-302635412.html#:~:text=Paramount's%20strategically%20and%20financially%20compelling,process%20with%20an%20uncertain%20outcome">according to a press release</a>, and $30 a share rather than Netflix's $27.5, and it's bidding for the entire Warner Bros. company, including the Global Networks segment, which includes sports and news TV brands like CNN and TNT Sports. Netflix only wants the Streaming &amp; Studios part, which includes Warner Bros. Motion Picture Group, DC Studios, and HBO, among others.</p>
<p>Paramount chairman and CEO David Ellison commented: "[Warner Bros.] shareholders deserve an opportunity to consider our superior all-cash offer for their shares in the entire company. Our public offer, which is on the same terms we provided to the Warner Bros. Discovery Board of Directors in private, provides superior value, and a more certain and quicker path to completion."</p>
<p>The press release revealed that Paramount had submitted six buyout proposals to Warner Bros. over the course of 12 weeks, but apparently Warner Bros. "never engaged meaningfully with these proposals". So Paramount has now taken its offer directly to shareholders and the board of directors "to pursue this clearly superior alternative".</p><p>Paramount said it was "highly confident" in achieving regulatory clearance for its offer, too, which it described as "pro-consumer".  Paramount believes Netflix's offer might stumble because of perceived video streaming monopoly. "The Netflix transaction creates a clear risk of higher prices for consumers, lower pay for content creators and talent and the destruction of American and international theatrical exhibitors," Paramount said.</p>
<p>"We believe our offer will create a stronger Hollywood," Paramount's Ellison concluded. "It is in the best interests of the creative community, consumers and the movie theatre industry. We believe they will benefit from the enhanced competition, higher content spend and theatrical release output, and a greater number of movies in theaters as a result of our proposed transaction. We look forward to working to expeditiously deliver this opportunity so that all stakeholders can begin to capitalise on the benefits of the combined company."</p>
<p>Netflix announced an $87.2bn deal to acquire Warner Bros. on Friday, which would see it also take charge of games studios such as Rocksteady, famed for the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/batman-arkham-games-order">Batman Arkham series</a>; NetherRealm, which makes Mortal Kombat; and Avalanche, which most recently made <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hogwarts-legacy">Hogwarts Legacy</a>. Will the price tag now rise?</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/tp-link-deco-wifi-7-mesh-system-3-pack-falls-to-an-all-time-low-cheaper-than-budget-wifi-6-routers-2000651219</link>
            <guid>1376095</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you’re paying for high-speed internet but dealing with dead zones and slow performance in certain areas of your house, your router could be the culprit. An easy solution to actually enjoy the performance promised by your ISP is by investing in a solid mesh system. It works by using the interconnected devices to create a strong network that delivers consistent signals across your entire place.</p>
<p>Now is a great time to pick one up, as<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6276/"> Amazon is currently offering a sweet 29% discount on the TP-Link Deco BE23 dual-band WiFi 7 mesh system (3-pack), which brings its price down to $178.</a> You can also enjoy free shipping on your purchase if you grab it quick, but the deal is selling out fast. That means you don’t have a lot of time left to bag these savings. It’s better to act sooner rather than later if you want to score the discount before it’s too late.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6276/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Better Coverage Throughout the House</h2>
<p>Deco BE23 uses Wi-Fi 7 technology, paired with Multi-Link Operation (MLO), Multi-RUs, and 4K-QAM to deliver full speeds of up to 2882 Mbps on the 5GHz band and 688 Mbps on the 2.4GHz band with 4 streams. The 3-pack bundle blankets up to 6,500 sq. ft, while the 4x high-gain antennas per node and 4x high-power FEMs push more reliable signals across your home. You can connect up to 150 devices at the same time without compromising on the speeds. Translation? The mesh system is more than capable of delivering the signals you’re paying for in every room and corner around the house – think under the stairs, in the closet, near the balcony, etc. Everyone in the house can connect all their devices, from laptops to smartphones, PC, consoles, tablets, TVs, and more, which is especially great for remote workers and creatives who rely on a bunch of different devices to get through their days. You also won’t have to sit right next to the router to catch signals; the mesh system offers the same performance all around.</p>



<p>Those who need even better performance when working on an important task or gaming with friends can make use of the two 2.5 Gbps WAN/LAN ports that come built right into each Deco unit. This lets you create a multi-gig pipeline from the internet to your devices. Best of all, the system uses AI-Roaming technology to deliver optimal speeds. It continuously adapts through advanced algorithms and learns your patterns over time as you move around. The system also plays nicely with a range of providers, but you might need to purchase a modem to get started. It’s backward compatible with all WiFi generations, so can fit into any existing system nicely.</p>
<p>TP-Link takes security seriously, as the Decos are designed, built, and maintained with advanced security as a core requirement. TP-Link HomeShield offers home network protection, plus access to handy parental controls for a safer internet experience. VPN clients and servers are supported, making it easy to access remote VPN servers without installing VPN software on each device. Setting everything up is quite straightforward, even if it’s your first time putting a mesh system up. It should be up and running in no time.</p>
<p>In short, if you’re done dealing with painfully slow speeds and terrible coverage of your router, now is a great time to upgrade the internet situation in your home. This deal lets you do it without shelling out big bucks.</p>

<p>Final Fantasy 7 Remake Part 3 is the next big instalment to the series, but the details about this game have been scarce, with players only knowing that the title already has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-already-has-a-lot-of-playable-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“a lot” of playable content</a>. Now, the developers have revealed even more details, including an important keyword to look out for in FF7 Remake Part 3. </p>

Square Enix is “almost at a point where they can share some more information.”</p>



<p>Naoki Hamaguchi revealed even more details about FF7 Remake Part 3 during the same interview. He first stated that he and Tetsuya Nomura are closing in on the name for the upcoming title, narrowing it down to only two options. The title should be decided within this year.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Hideo Kojima recently spoke about his upcoming title, OD, stating that even he can’t say exactly what it is or whether it will work out. </p>



<p>The next Xbox Game Studios title by Hideo Kojima and Kojima Productions, OD, is already in the works, and we received a glimpse of the title earlier this year through its ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/od-gameplay-reveal-kojima/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Knock</a>‘ trailer. We have also heard Kojima say that he wants to scan ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hideo-kojima-wishes-to-scan-real-ghosts-for-od/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">real ghosts</a>‘ for his upcoming title. Now, he has revealed more details on the challenges he is facing with OD. </p>







<h2 id="h-hideo-kojima-can-t-say-what-od-exactly-is-but-there-are-hints-in-the-trailer">Hideo Kojima Can’t Say What OD Exactly Is, But There Are Hints in the Trailer</h2>



<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://ananweb.jp/categories/entertainment/74735" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ananweb</a> (via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/hideo-kojima-says-od-is-something-completely-different-from-a-standard-horror-game-we-still-dont-know-if-it-will-work-out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Automaton</a>), Hideo Kojima spoke about the challenges he is facing while developing OD. He stated, “I can’t say exactly what it is yet, nor do I know if it will&nbsp;work out.” Kojima added that they have created stealth and delivery games “which were unlike anything before”. However, even those games had systems similar to other titles, which made the process a bit easier. </p>



<p>In the case of OD, Kojima and team are “trying to change the service model from the ground up,” which has proven to be “quite challenging.” At the same time, the recently released trailer is “full of hints,” so the highly passionate players might be able to figure it out if they spend enough time on it. </p>







<p>In other news, Insider Gaming’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/eidos-montreal-move-to-japan-kojima/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exclusive report</a> reveals that Eidos Montreal’s employees were working on OD before being asked to move to Japan. Additionally, the popular game director <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hideo-kojima-zootopia-2-cameo-cast/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">joined Zootopia 2’s cast</a> just days before release.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Longtime Tekken director and series producer Katsuhiro Harada has revealed he will leave Bandai Namco at the end of 2025. Harada, whose credits include not only Tekken but the SoulCalibur series, Pokkén Tournament, and more, said he wanted to reach the Tekken series' 30th Anniversary, which happened last December, as a major career milestone and is ready to move on.&nbsp;</p><p>He says he will leave Bandai Namco at the end of the year, but has been asked by the publisher to appear at the Tekken World Tour Finals at the end of January, and he will be attending as a guest. Alongside this news, Harada has released <a href="https://soundcloud.com/katsuhiro-harada-1/tekken-a-30-year-journey-haradas-final-mix?si=a5c6ead3a5f64c4c9ac47330a8e3f4ed&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=social_sharing">"TEKKEN: A 30-Year Journey – Harada's Final Mix" on SoundCloud,</a> as he has always wanted to perform as a DJ at a tournament but never had the chance.&nbsp;</p><p>"So instead, I will be releasing – for the first and last time – a 60-minute Tekken DJ-style nonstop mix (DJ mix), personally edited by myself, together with this announcement," Harada writes in his announcement <a href="https://x.com/Harada_TEKKEN/status/1997952347709034747?s=20">post</a> on X. "Listening to it brings back many memories. Thank you again, sincerely, for all these years."&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-z3ClbC1zKo"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-z3ClbC1zKo" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>In Harada's announcement post, he talks about his love of arcade fighting games, his journey with Tekken and game development, and how he sought the advice of longtime mentor Ken Kutaragi, former CEO of Sony Computer Entertainment, commonly referred to as "The Father of PlayStation," and "received invaluable encouragement and guidance," noting that "his words quietely supported me in making this decision."&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Alongside news of Harada's departure, the Tekken X account released a </strong><a href="https://x.com/TEKKEN/status/1997954347347620178?s=20"><strong>statement</strong></a><strong> that says the following regarding Harada's upcoming leave:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>"Katsuhiro Harada, who has long led numerous projects including the Tekken series, will be leaving Bandai Namco. This comes as the Tekken series finishes celebrating its 30th anniversary, a milestone he deeply contributed to as executive director and executive producer on the franchise. Harada-san is making an appearance and meeting with the Tekken community at the 'Tekken World Tour 2025 Global Finals' Last Chance Qualifier (LCQ) and Top 20 finals, held in Malmo, Sweden, on January 31 and February 1, 2026."&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The statement also includes words regarding the future of the Tekken series, and they read as follows:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>"To our fans, rest assured that we are fully committed to future development and content plans for Tekken 8. We will continue to take community feedback on the game and its content to heart to ensure that we uphold the vision and spirit built by Harada-san, dedicating our utmost efforts to ensure the legacy of the Tekken series continues as a fighting game franchise beloved worldwide. We express our deepest gratitude for Harada-san for providing us with vision and continued success over the years."&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U0iCQ-vCJww"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U0iCQ-vCJww" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>On that note, Harada mentions in his announcement that, "Over the past four to five years, I've gradually handed over all of my responsibilities, as well as the stories and worldbuilding I oversaw, to the team, bringing me to the present day," so it sounds like the Tekken series is in good hands.&nbsp;</p><p>Harada's Tekken journey goes all the way back to the beginning, where he was a voice actor for Marshall Law, Yoshimitsu, and Kunimitsu in the first Tekken. In Tekken 2, he voiced Marshall Law and Yoshimitsu once more. With Tekken 3 in 1997, not only did Harada voice Yoshimitsu and newcomer Forest Law, but he also directed the game. Since then, he's been a creative lead on the series through 2024's Tekken 8.</p><p>You can <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/tekken-8/aggressively-absurd">read <em>Game Informer's </em>Tekken 8 review here</a>.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em>Do you have any favorite Harada memories?

<p>But it's not who you think it is</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="1e3b54a528e26"><a title="Requiem" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1e3b54a528e26/requiem.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure><p>Although Capcom has remained tightlipped on the prospect of Leon Kennedy cropping up in the upcoming <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a>, a good number of fans are adamant that the veteran character will indeed appear.</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=I23MxTm2ku4&amp;mid=24348&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fpc-gaming%2Fpc-games%2Fproducts%2Fresident-evil-requiem-deluxe---pc%2F20023062-2a094304.html" rel="sponsored noopener">a new listing</a> over on GameStop drops some new information regarding the Deluxe Edition of the game which, if accurate, seems to hint at a completely different playable character: Rosemary Winters (thanks, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-gamestop-listing-leaves-fans-bewildered-by-mentioning-a-shock-second-character-and-its-not-leon">IGN</a>).</p>
<p>Rose Winters is, if you remember, the protagonist in the <strong>Shadows of Rose</strong> DLC for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-village-gold-edition">Resident Evil: Village</a>, having previously appeared in the main game as, uh... a bunch of dismembered limbs. Look, it's a pretty wild story.</p>
<p>The listing from GameStop specifically mentioned some cosmetic items for Rose, including the 'Morphic Visor' and 'Shadow Walker' costume pack.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Deluxe Edition includes the PC Steam Digital Code, a SteelBook Case, and the following digital content:</p>
<p><strong>"The Sanctuary" Expansion Pass:</strong> Includes 2 new story scenarios and a major Mercenaries mode update.<br>
<strong>"Morphic Visor" Cosmetic Filter:</strong> A unique cosmetic look for Rose's visor.<br>
<strong>"Shadow Walker" Costume Pack:</strong> 3 exclusive outfits for Rosemary Winters.<br>
<strong>Digital Artbook &amp; Official Soundtrack</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is all very bizarre indeed, not least because of how old Rose would be in Requiem's story. The new game is said to take place in 2028, which would essentially make her seven or eight years old. The Shadows of Rose DLC shot the story forward to the year 2037 in which she was portrayed as a teenager.</p>
<p>So if Rose does indeed appear as a child, would she really wear a visor of some sort? Would she wear a 'Shadow Walker' costume set? We're not so sure. Either way, the listing from GameStop is still up at the time of writing, so there seems to be at least some modicum of accuracy to it.</p>
<p>The listing also seems to imply that the popular Mercenaries Mode will also make a return in Requiem, while two new story scenarios are also being planned for the future.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Lunar Software's long-awaited horror game ROUTINE is finally out and on PC, Xbox Series X/S, and Xbox One devices, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/routine-comes-back-from-a-ten-year-slumber-with-a-new-trailer/">even for a game that was announced more than a decade ago</a>, it has the sensibilities of a game older than that. Needless to say, there are a few things you'll want to know when jumping into it yourself.</p>



<p>This guide will take you through a few essential tips and tricks to ensure you can see everything ROUTINE has to offer, without getting terribly lost.</p>



<h2 id="h-routine-tips-and-tricks-guide">ROUTINE Tips and Tricks Guide</h2>



<h3 id="h-have-a-notebook-ready">Have a notebook ready</h3>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Wingdk-Screenshot-2025.11.27-23.07.22.86.png"></a><figcaption><em>Just like any good astronaut, you'll want to keep a record of what happens on the moon in ROUTINE.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>ROUTINE doesn't give you waypoints, map markers, or a compass to tell you which direction you're going in. It doesn't even give you a map to look at. After <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hell-is-us-review/">Hell is Us</a>, it's the second game in 2025 to make getting around its environment and figuring out where to go next is a constant puzzle, which is part of the game's draw, as you're constantly building a mental map of each area.</p>



<p>You can do that, or you can draw a map of the space in a notebook to help you get around. That could be reason enough to have a notebook ready, but the better reason to have a notebook and pen beside you - or something to take notes with at least - is all the code puzzles you'll need to solve.</p>



<p>Having a notebook to write down every code you uncover is probably the best thing you can do to make sure you have a smooth time with ROUTINE. Instead of risking a moment where you've successfully made it to where you need to enter the code you just solved, and you have to backtrack to where you solved it because you can't remember the code.</p>



<h3 id="h-your-c-a-t-is-everything-but-it-s-got-nothing-on-plain-old-hiding">Your C.A.T. is everything, but it's got nothing on plain-old hiding</h3>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ROUTINE_SS_005_August.png"></a><figcaption><em>Your C.A.T. is useful, but it can't do everything.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Your only tool and the one thing that lets you communicate with the abandoned lunar base, your C.A.T. (Cosmonaut Assistance Tool), is pretty much your everything in ROUTINE. It's how you save when you find a save point; it's how you scan your environment for otherwise invisible writings that reveal secrets and help you solve puzzles, and it's how you fight back against the robots trying to kill you.</p>



<p>But fighting back will only get you so far. Whoever made these robots made them to last, and while two electric shots from your C.A.T. directly into a robot's chest in short succession can stun them, no amount of shots will actually take them down. Stunning them can give you a window to run and hide, but running and hiding is always going to be what actually gets them off your back, and the chance to progress further in the story.</p>



<h3 id="h-not-every-robot-is-trying-to-kill-you-at-the-same-time">Not every robot is trying to kill you - at the same time</h3>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ROUTINE_SS_004_August.png"></a><figcaption><em>ROUTINE. Image credit: Lunar Software</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>One of the many things not directly explained to you in ROUTINE is that while you'll see plenty of killer robots on the base, they aren't all trying to kill you - at the same time. No more than one robot is activated at any time, so as you start learning where the robots are in the rooms you're exploring, if you know which one is active, you can walk right by another with no fear.</p>



<p>Unless, of course, it activates right in front of you. In that case, you might be screwed if you can't run away in time.</p>



<h3 id="h-there-are-safe-rooms-but-no-safe-pausing">There are safe rooms, but no safe pausing</h3>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Wingdk-Screenshot-2025.12.02-02.47.05.85.png"></a><figcaption><em>Sometimes, these access points that allow you to save are in 'safe rooms,' but not all the time.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-finally-gets-first-combat-footage-but-leon-is-nowhere-to-be-seen/">Capcom's Resident Evil series</a> is known for its safe rooms, the areas you reach where any of the horrors you're shooting at can't get to you. They're accompanied by their own music and a few repeating hallmarks so that when you find one, you know you can breathe a sigh of relief.</p>



<p>ROUTINE doesn't have safe rooms in the same way Resident Evil has safe rooms, but they are there. You just have to look closely. What you can't do is pause the game and think you're safe.</p>



<p>All pressing the pause button does is bring up the game's menu; you can still die if you pause and leave yourself directly in the patrol path of a robot. So if you do need to adjust something in the menu, or step away for a moment, make sure you're actually safe before doing so.</p>



<h3 id="h-really-look-around-and-then-look-again">Really look around, and then look again</h3>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Wingdk-Screenshot-2025.12.01-02.16.42.25.png"></a><figcaption><em>ROUTINE forces you to slow down and pay attention to your environment, so don't start to panic if you're having trouble finding your way.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>As stated earlier, ROUTINE doesn't include any of the modern gaming comforts, like an in-game map. Figuring out where to go means you have to look around you and see what the environment is telling you.</p>



<p>That setup can, and probably will, make it easy for you to feel like you're lost. But Lunar Software's limitations on what kind of assistance you get means that you only have to look in a few places to figure out where to go next.</p>



<p>While some chapters include bouncing between different areas on different floors, most of ROUTINE will involve you navigating a large section of the base connected with hallways and, in some cases, through vents and backdoor entrances. If you really feel lost, keep looking around and zoom in on everything you see. Taking your time to do this will likely result in you figuring out where to go faster than if you tried to speed to the answer.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Bose Extends Its Clearance Push From Headphones to Home Speakers, Leaving Zero Margin Behind]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/bose-extends-its-clearance-push-from-headphones-to-home-speakers-leaving-zero-margin-behind-2000651213</link>
            <guid>1376065</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you’re planning to bring family and friends together this holiday season for hearty meals and some much-needed bonding, good music can lift the mood and make your gathering even more enjoyable. Imagine having soft tunes playing in the background as you catch up with your loved ones on Christmas Eve; wholesome.</p>
<p>You just need a good speaker to make this happen, and Amazon is making it easier than ever to pick one. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6275/">The retailer just slashed the Bose SoundLink home speaker by 18%, dropping the price down to $179</a>. The deal applies to both silver and grey color options, so you can pick whichever would fit within the aesthetics of your place the best.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6275/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Bold Sound In a Minimal Design</h2>
<p>Bose has paid attention to the looks with this one. The anodized aluminum paired with a high-quality fabric grille gives off a premium look, while the overall minimal design makes it easy for the speaker to blend into any setup without drawing too much attention to itself. You’ll find all the controls right at the top; no need to go on a scavenger hunt for your phone every time you need to tweak the volume.</p>
<p>The speaker punches well above its weight by delivering crisp, clear sound for all your tracks. It captures all the highs and lows within tunes, and pushes deep bass that can fill any room with good vibes. This makes it not just great for music, but also for your streaming sessions where you don’t want to rely on your laptop or TV’s audio. Dialogues sound clearer than ever, and your favorite songs can be enjoyed to their fullest. Catch up on your favorite podcast in the morning, play the latest Maroon 5 album in the evening, and end the night with an episode of Stranger Things; it takes care of all your audio needs like a pro.</p>



<p>Advanced Bluetooth 5.3 offers solid connection stability and reduced latency. For instance, when the speaker is paired with your phone, you’ll be able to roam around the house comfortably without worrying about audio dropouts, even when things get crowded. Reliability comes from its 9 hours of battery life, which keeps the good vibes going all night long. Best of all, it supports wired connection, too, so you can plug your device in using a USB-C cord when it’s running low; no need to pause the music. There’s also a microphone built right in, which makes it easy to take quick calls right from the speaker or access voice assistants like Alexa.</p>
<p>The sound this speaker delivers is solid on its own, but you can also pair two of these together for a bigger setup, which can be great for entertaining a larger crowd. Linking them together hardly takes a few seconds, and you don’t even need an app to do it.</p>
<p>There’s a lot more to like about this minimal, no-fuss, but efficient speaker. It’s now down to $179, which is still a bit of an investment, but definitely one that’s going to be worth it. To recap, this speaker offers clear sound, deep bass (even at higher volumes), an exceptional battery life, as well as plug-and-play functionality when needed. Place it anywhere you like, and get the part started. We highly recommend grabbing it quick, before the price goes back up to $219.</p>
