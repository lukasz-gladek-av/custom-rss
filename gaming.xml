            <p>The movie adaptation of Supermassive's Until Dawn horror has wrapped filming.</p>
<p>Director David F. Sandberg shared the news on his <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DAupl0Oo9Su/">Instagram</a> account, saying "we made it until dawn! That’s a wrap on #UntilDawnMovie".</p>

<p>The comment was accompanied by a delightfully gruesome photo of a blood splattered mirror or window and a clapperboard. On the slate is the name Until Dawn and the date filming ended: 4th October 2024.</p>
<p>Until Dawn stars Ella Rubin (The Idea of You), Michael Cimino (Love Victor), Ji-young Yoo (Expats), and Odessa A’zion (Hellraiser), although we still don't know what roles they'll play, or if any of the original star is set to return. The script has been written by Blair Butler and Annabelle and The Nun writer, Gary Dauberman.</p><div>

<p>We learned that Supermassive's acclaimed PS4 cinematic horror game Until Dawn was being turned into a movie by the writer and director of 2017 horror hit Annabelle: Creation earlier this year. It's described as a "R-rated love letter to the horror genre", suggesting it'll retain some of the meta elements of its inspiration.</p>

<p>As the qualifying rounds for the upcoming BLAST R6 Major Montreal open up, some of the best Rainbow Six teams in the world are earning their spots in the running. Between November 7 and 17, this $750,000 tournament will play out in Montreal, with 20 of the top teams making their way toward a grand stage at the Verdun Auditorium.</p>



<p>Presently, all but one team in Phase 2 of the qualifying structure has been confirmed – but in just a few days, we’ll have these last few teams listed and ready to go.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-making-it-to-montreal">Making it to Montreal</h2>



<p>In the last couple of days, the following teams have secured their spot at the BLAST R6 Major Montreal:</p>



<ul>
<li>DPlus</li>



<li>Team Liquid</li>



<li>FaZe Clan</li>



<li>Soniqs</li>



<li>DarkZero</li>
</ul>



<p>They join a lineup made up of the likes of Soniqs, Virtus, Team Secret, Team BDS, Wolves, Spacestation M80, w7m, Elevate, FURIA, KINOTROPE, and Team Falcons. Some of the boldest and most recognisable organisations in esports are being represented on the stage in Canada next month.</p>



<p>This is the final BLAST R6 event of the year and the last major Rainbow Six Siege tournament of 2024. It follows the BLAST R6 Manchester Major that took place in May 2024, and ultimately it’ll lead into February’s Six Invitational in North America. </p>



<p>For years, Rainbow Six has been building a solid esports ecosystem that has blown up in the last twelve months or so, and events like these typically sit near the top of the table where the industry is concerned.</p>



<p>Going into the BLAST R6 Major Montreal, the deck is stacked and there are plenty of teams with the capability to secure the top spot. Earlier this year, Team BDS won the Esports World Cup in the Rainbow Six Siege category, and the team also wound up in second place at the Manchester Major – could another win be in store for the squad?</p>



<p>Behind Team BDS, the next odds-on favourite is w7m Esports.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/league-of-legends-has-the-smartest-fans-in-the-industry-study-reveals.1001910/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/league-of-legends-smartest-fans-in-gaming/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In a recent study that surveyed more than 1,000 gamers, it was revealed that League of Legends has the most intelligent fans in the gaming world. The study, which was completed by WhichBingo and backed up by ‘a team of psychologists’, featured an intelligence test designed to rank the IQ of gamers – and the results were pretty entertaining.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-sorry-rocket-league-fans">Sorry, Rocket League fans</h2>



<p>The WhichBingo study, which was dug up recently by <a href="https://esports-news.co.uk/2024/10/05/league-legends-players-smartest-iq/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">EsportsNewsUK</a>, suggests that League of Legends has the most intelligent players in the world. I can believe that — I can’t even <strong>nearly </strong>understand how that game works, and the more competitive League of Legends players blow my mind.</p>



<p>At the other end of the scale sits FC 24 and Rocket League. It was assessed that the player bases for these games boast an IQ hovering around the 90 mark, while League of Legends gamers boast an average IQ of 120.4.</p>



<p>In second place sits Black Myth: Wukong, whose players have an average IQ of 119.8 – so it’s a close finish. Baldur’s Gate 3 is in third place at 117.9 IQ, and then making up the rest of the top five are Counter-Strike and Elden Ring players.</p>



<p>The middle of the table is made up of a wide variety of games, ranging from Battlefield 2042 (105.8 IQ) and Escape from Tarkov (104.2 IQ) to Deadlock (108.7 IQ) and Genshin Impact (106.8 IQ).</p>



<p>Call of Duty populates the spot above Rocket League in eighteenth place, with Warzone and Modern Warfare 3 players boasting an average IQ of just 95.3. </p>



<p>There’s a trend here – the more complex the game, the higher the average IQ of the player base. If a title has a mixy competitive meta and more intricate mechanics, it requires a stronger brain to play it and, most importantly, enjoy it. That’s why the jet-powered car soccer game and one of the most arcade-based shooter franchises on the market occupy the bottom spots.</p>

<p>In the highest peak player count moment since December 2023, 5.6 million users concurrently fought Doctor Doom in the latest Fortnite live event. It was the grand finale of the Marvel-focused season that saw Doctor Doom burst onto the map with an impressive stature, seeking to do battle with quite literally <strong>every Fortnite player </strong>on the game.</p>



<p>Per the numbers, a whopping 5.6 million users concurrently fought Doctor Doom, hacking away at a global health pool that took around an hour to deplete.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-big-numbers">Big Numbers</h2>



<p>Fortnite’s ongoing success is nothing short of effortless, with Epic Games pumping content into the popular battle royale game that’s lapped up eagerly by hundreds of millions of fans worldwide.</p>



<p>This latest event was a boon, drawing in more than five million players at the same time. They were all focused on taking down Doctor Doom, one of Marvel’s most recognisable bad guys, as he tried to destroy the Fortnite island. After a heroic cutscene that saw Hope open up a chink in Doctor Doom’s armour, millions of players set about taking down the gigantic boss character.</p>



<p>On content and streaming platforms, videos and broadcasts of the event went crazy, which is typical for the Fortnite ecosystem. Those who couldn’t take part were happy enough consuming the event by proxy.</p>



<p>Now, attention turns to whatever is coming for the Halloween season in the Fortnitemares updates. It’s nothing short of impressive that Fortnite still has the legs that it does after all these years at the top, but these events are a testament to the game’s staying power – it’s going nowhere anytime soon.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Foamstars Is Now Free to Play on PlayStation 4 and 5]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/foamstars-free-to-play-on-playstation/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/foamstars-is-now-free-to-play-on-playstation-4-and-5.1001895/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/foamstars-free-to-play-on-playstation/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Foamstars was released back in February to something of a lukewarm reception, and a lot of that was centered around the game boasting a price tag. In a world driven by free-to-play games, a title like Foamstars costing real money was an issue with gamers everywhere, but Square Enix has rectified that misstep.</p>



<p>From now on, Foamstars is officially free to play on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5. The previous price tag has been obliterated in the hope of bringing thousands of players onto the platform.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-way-to-go">The Way to Go</h2>



<p>If you’re an old-school gamer, you might not appreciate this trend, but it’s the way the world works. Almost every single game at the top of the charts is free to play and reliant on microtransactions to succeed. From League of Legends to Fortnite, from Warzone to Rocket League, and from PUBG to Counter-Strike, some of the most popular games in the world have adopted this model.</p>



<p>In 2022, PUBG went free to play and broke concurrent player records on Steam. In 2020, Rocket League went free to play and the game became more successful than ever. In the Call of Duty world, free shooters like COD Warzone and COD Mobile garnered hundreds of millions of downloads.</p>



<p>Foamstars is the latest title to go free to play, and that’s certainly not a bad thing. It hasn’t done too well since being released in February 2024, and typically, a free-to-play pivot is an effortless way to boost a game’s audience, even if for a short time.</p>



<p>Square Enix has published Diamond Jam alongside the free-to-play transition, offering players another season packed with new maps, boss battles, and exclusive events. When players enter the fray for the first time, they’ll be doing so hand-in-hand with a fair injection of content that’s being aligned with a premium season pass.</p>



<p>Admittedly, Square Enix is pivoting to do the live service thing the right way – the premium season pass for Foamstars is only $5.99, which isn’t too bad at all.</p>



<p>Are you excited that Foamstars might get a second lease of life? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ultimate-freyna-skin-nexon-the-first-descendent/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nexon-doubles-down-on-first-descendant-smut-value-with-new-ultimate-freyna-skin.1001886/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ultimate-freyna-skin-nexon-the-first-descendent/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It has been a few months since The First Descendent, a free-to-play MMO, was released by Nexon. It’s a relatively enjoyable shooter with a solid enough audience, but like several games of its kind to be released in recent years, much of the attention on the title has been focused on the lascivious female playable characters.</p>



<p>Nexon, a Korean studio, has toyed with increasingly revealing outfits since the game dropped, taking the time to produce a swimsuit skin pack earlier this year in celebration of summer. Now, the studio has doubled down on the smut value in The First Descendant with Ultimate Freyna’s newest skins.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-let-s-not-pretend-to-not-know-what-sells">Let’s Not Pretend to Not Know What Sells</h2>



<p>The First Descendent has a wild array of playable characters with unique abilities and skins, and of course, the female characters can variants that can often be wearing outfits that leave nothing to the imagination. First, everyone was going wild about Ultimate Bunny, but now it’s time for Freyna to take the spotlight.</p>



<p>Recently, Nexon started teasing an upcoming update that will pull in various content drops, such as Halloween skins and gear, a new boss battle, and of course, Ultimate Freyna.</p>



<p>That’s where it all began.</p>



<p>The first trailer for the update revealed Halloween costumes that would be perfectly in place in a stripper’s wardrobe, and we got a glimpse at Ultimate Freyna that set people about frothing at the bit for more. </p>



<p>And Nexon delivered:</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">To match her fierce attitude, Ultimate Freyna’s skin takes it to the next level! 🔥 <br>Which version will you choose? Coming 10/10! ⚔️ <a href="https://t.co/i4RMppPQLO">pic.twitter.com/i4RMppPQLO</a></p>— The First Descendant Official (@FirstDescendant) <a href="https://twitter.com/FirstDescendant/status/1841843311298130353?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 3, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>







<p>Ultimate Freyna is mad cheeked up, and Nexon has wasted no time in making the revealing nature of this character’s Ultimate variant known. With half her body being covered by nothing but fishnet tights, fans of The First Descendent were quick to jump on social media  and express their opinions:</p>



<ul>
<li>‘Give the marketing team a raise’ – Crimson140</li>



<li>‘I’m buying that spicy stuff straight away’ – RealAsianRobot</li>



<li>‘Not going to lie I may have watched this like 20 times’ – FervorGamingYT</li>



<li>‘This is how you sell your game’ – Nameless_Comedy</li>
</ul>



<p>It seems that Ultimate Freyna, who will be available in the game come October 10, is a monumental hit. Are you telling me that the player count might be boosted simply because of a skimpy-clothed new character skin?</p>



<p>Let us know on the Insider Gaming forum if you’re investing in Ultimate Freyna.</p>

<p>Starfield has been a topic of much contention in recent days. Following the release of Shattered Space, the game’s first major expansion, many fans were disappointed with an underwhelming piece of DLC that has failed to warrant such a long wait and a premium price point. That’s just the tip of the iceberg, though.</p>



<p>Many are still rueing Starfield’s rapid downfall, which was kickstarted not long after the game was released in September 2023. Recently, Emil Pagliarulo, a design director at Bethesda Game Studios, defended the space-faring RPG, aligning it closely with Fallout and The Elder Scrolls, two of the most legendary franchises in gaming history.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-perhaps-not">Perhaps Not</h2>



<p>In a sitdown <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/the-elder-scrolls/bethesda-game-studios-big-3-rpgs-are-now-fallout-elder-scrolls-and-starfield-studio-veteran-says-starfield-is-simply-developing-its-own-unique-fanbase/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">with GamesRadar</a>, Emil Pagliarulo, whose work has spanned all three major franchises, said that Starfield ‘sits right next to’ Fallout and The Elder Scrolls as a series.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It exists in a unique space. It might not be everyone’s cup of tea. What is? We created a new IP, from the ground up, and an experience that is absolutely unique on consoles. </p>



<p>And I’m not saying Starfield is better or worse than any other game – just different in what we offer: that weird Bethesda blend of immersion, action, and RPG.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He used the word ‘unique’ a few times, suggesting that Starfield is building an entirely new fanbase that might not necessarily connect as easily with The Elder Scrolls or Fallout. That’s one of the things that has harmed Starfield since the moment the game dropped a year ago – the <strong>comparisons </strong>between Starfield and the decades-old series that preceded it.</p>



<p>Pagliarulo said that Starfield is now part of Bethesda Game Studios’ ‘Big Three’ games. Once upon a time, the developer said that it’s probably the best game Bethesda has ever made, but many would disagree. It has only been a year since Starfield was released after almost a decade of hype, but the player count has already dwindled outside of Game Pass.</p>



<p>Shattered Space pulled in mediocre reviews, games like Skyrim and Fallout 4 are outpacing Starfield on some platforms, and on content and streaming sites, Starfield is withering to nothing. Bethesda’s Todd Howard promised annual expansions for the title, but even Shattered Space wasn’t well anticipated – in another year, Bethesda might be delivering a DLC to a zeroed audience.</p>



<p>People defending Starfield might lean on the ’15 million players’ figure, but as of December 2023, the game had sold 13 million copies (including Game Pass, it’s thought), and how many of those gamers are still engaged today?</p>

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> brought the storyline of its current Marvel season to a head tonight in a climactic battle with Doctor Doom that attracted a concurrent peak of 5.6 million players.
</p>
<p>
Over the course of an hour, players worked together to tackle an enormous, rampaging version of the classic Marvel villain, until finally his armour cracked, his health bar was depleted, and he was sucked back into whatever corner of the Marvel multiverse he'd sprung from.
</p>
<p>
Fortnite's own stats show an overall total of 5.6 million players in-game just after 7pm UK time tonight, when this evening's live event began. This is the game's highest concurrent total since last December, when 11.6 million players turned up for  <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnites-the-big-bang-event-was-a-blast-of-marketing-for-the-games-multi-genre-future">the Big Bang live event, which featured a performance by Eminem and teased the arrival of Lego Fortnite, racing and music modes</a>.

<p>
Tonight's big fight against Doctor Doom played out a little differently to other in-game events in the past, making for a memorable - if mechanically fairly straightforward - Fortnite live experience.
</p>
<p>
At 7pm UK time tonight, players gathered to watch Fortnite's heroes block the arrival of Doctor Doom, only for the masked villain to turn up anyway. As Doom forced his way onto the Island, the event switched to a rare in-game cutscene which showed fan-favourite characters getting picked off, and even mascot Jonesy put in peril - until this chapter's heroine Hope stepped up, cracking Doom's mask with Captain America's shield.
</p><p>
The event then moved into its main phase - a lengthy boss battle against a towering Doctor Doom with a sizable health bar that didn't look like it was going to be depleted anytime soon. Instead, players found that beating Doom would take multiple matches, as the game's global community worked together to whittle down his health instead of fighting one another. 
</p>
<p>
Whether through some live tweaks by Epic Games or a sudden updraft in damage done, Doom's health bar seemed to decrease quicker as the hour-long fight continued. After three or four matches - Doom still rampaging around throughout, health bar slowly lowering - damage was visible on the armour he had forged from this chapter's macguffin - Pandora's Box - and Hope's voice could be heard once again, signalling the fight was at a close.
</p>

<p>
As Doom's health was finally depleted, the heroes' plan succeeded: Doctor Doom was rifted out of existence, dropping his cracked mask as he left the Island - now a permanent reminder of the battle. (I had to laugh when I saw every player in my game immediately run over when the battle was done and begin hitting his mask with their pickaxes.)

<p>
As Fortnite events go, this was one of the most memorable for some time. Sure, this did not have the same elaborate gameplay as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnites-showstopping-marvel-finale-drops-a-huge-cliffhanger">the Galactus event</a>, or the storytelling shocks as The Device. But after a slow return to live goings-on this year, the brief cutscene brought a great, triumphant moment for Hope, whose storyline has been centre stage this season, while the elongated nature of the fight brought a real sense that this was a battle against something truly powerful. That it lasted just under an hour ultimately felt about right - long enough that players could share news of the event with friends and get others to join in, and not too long that you'd wander off and let other players chip away at Doom's health for you.
</p><p>
Fortnite is already teasing what's next for the game - its annual Halloween celebration, Fortnitemares - and beyond that, well... With Doom defeated already, a month in advance of this season's end date on 2nd November, players have been left to ponder what exactly will happen next. Fortnite has switched its in-game maps on an annual basis each of the last three years, and the expectation is we're on the cusp of another such change. But after the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-smashes-concurrent-user-records-as-over-6m-players-log-on-this-weekend">huge success of last year's OG Season</a>, now would certainly be a good time for Epic Games to squeeze in another one of those, too.

<p>While Horizon Zero Dawn Complete Edition's Steam page is still live, it is not available to buy anymore after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-quietly-raises-horizon-zero-dawn-ps4-price-following-remaster-announcement">Horizon Zero Dawn Complete Edition was quietly delisted from Steam and the Epic Games Store at the end of September</a>.</p>
<p>That means there is now no legal way to play Horizon Zero Dawn on Steam without purchasing the remaster bundle… which controversially requires a PSN account.</p>
<p>Unhappy Steam players have already taken to the game's <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2561580/discussions/">Steam discussions</a> hub to voice their dismay, with one entitling their thread: "Recquires [sic] PSN account - Insta ignored".</p>
<p>"So you want me to give you money - to give you my information... for what a tiny bit of updated graphics," <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2561580/discussions/0/4852156431485482370/">added</a> another. "You can keep your remaster."</p>
<p>This all stems back to the beginning of the summer with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-steam-players-will-soon-need-to-link-a-psn-account-and-they-arent-happy">Helldivers' PC PSN log-in requirement</a>. There was such a vitriolic backlash that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-overturns-helldivers-2-psn-requirement-following-backlash">Sony backtracked on its original plans</a> and then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut-pc-players-are-getting-auto-refunds-if-they-cannot-legally-sign-up-for-psn">auto-refunded players who bought Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut in countries where PSN isn't available</a>. </p>
<p>Games like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-has-been-pulled-from-sale-in-177-countries-as-its-psn-linking-requirement-rolls-out">Helldivers 2 were then pulled from sale in 177 countries</a> following the disastrous rollout of mandatory PSN linking, causing a huge backlash and considerable <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/god-of-war-ragnarok-is-being-review-bombed-on-steam">review-bombing</a>.</p>
<p>The removal from the PC storefront came less than a fortnight after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-zero-dawns-remaster-arrives-in-october-and-itll-cost-10-to-upgrade">Sony announced a remastered version of Horizon Zero Dawn</a> would be released on 31st October, across PlayStation 5 and PC.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>That's according to producer Takashi Iizuka, who said in an interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-sonic-ps5-pro-support">IGN</a> that he wants "as many people as possible to play" Sonic games, even though later, more advanced systems enable "newer Sonic games [to] express the speed of Sonic".</p>

<p>"As a market, we have the high-end machines, high-end consoles," Iizuka said.</p>
<p>"Coming out with those consoles, we feel that we can make newer Sonic games that can express the speed of Sonic and with much better gaming UI as well.</p>
<p>"However, we want to support the lower spec cons[oles] as well," he added. "So even though the PS5 Pro is coming out, or new innovations or technology are coming out, we feel that it is important to support with the lower spec consoles and let many of the users keep playing Sonic."</p><p>Despite that, Iizuka intimated that whilst the newly unveiled PS5 Pro is considered by some players to be prohibitively expensive, "[for] the quality that they are providing, it's not that expensive...

<p>ICYMI, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-quietly-raises-horizon-zero-dawn-ps4-price-following-remaster-announcement">Sega recently announced the Sonic the Hedgehog 3 Movie Pack will be coming to Sonic x Shadow Generations as DLC</a> just ahead of the film's release, starring Keanu Reeves as the voice of Shadow.</p>

					<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-the-elder-space-scrolls/">Starfield</a> is, without a doubt, one of the most controversial games ever made by Bethesda. While it is undoubtedly a solid role-playing game that offers a vast world to explore and some gripping stories, it suffers from a certain lack of focus, evident in some of its elements, such as subpar exploration and traversal, the procedurally generated elements which end up being very repetitive, and a generally dated feel mostly represented by the loading screens that separate different areas.</p>
<p>While I still generally enjoy the experience, my opinion of Starfield has soured a bit in the past year or so. After re-experiencing Cyberpunk 2077 with the 2.0 update and the Phantom Liberty expansion, it has become difficult to look past some of the game's archaisms, the lack of engaging activities, average quest design, combat, and progression systems with very limited options. All these issues are, in my opinion, exacerbated by the Shattered Space expansion, which offers, for better or worse, more Starfield while also taking somewhat of a step back in regards to what sets the game apart from every other RPG developed by Bethesda.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20241001141402_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>When it comes to story, the Starfield Shattered Space expansion, at least, doesn't fail to deliver. After receiving a distress call from a space station and exploring its eery interiors, players are transported to Va'Ruun'kai, the world of House Va'Ruun, a theocracy built around the cult of the Great Serpent that has a minor role in the base game. The whole planet is in disarray following an experiment gone wrong, and it will be up to the player to solve the issue and help this faction. Things, however, won't be easy, as navigating the political landscape of Va'Ruun'kai will prove to be just as dangerous as entering the Citadel and solving this crisis. Every major player involved could either be the greatest of allies or the most dangerous of enemies, and it will be the player's choices that shape the adventure and its final outcome.</p>
<p>Doing away with space exploration and focusing on a single planet has done wonders for the Shattered Space expansion, as the new questline is among the most interesting in the entire game. The focus on a single planet also allowed for a deeper development of the lore of House Va'Ruun, in turn making the whole experience more engaging. The characters that accompany the player as needed, who are made more memorable by the vastly improved facial animations, not only improve the experience but also make making some choices quite impactful, although there are times when the available choices don't allow for great role-playing, giving the players the chance of either being a hero or a despicable person. The short length of the main quest, around 5 hours or so, is definitely disappointing, but it also makes sure the whole adventure stays interesting from beginning to end, as there are way too many elements that can quickly make it feel like a slog.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20241001174750_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Not counting the new story, the Starfield Shattered Space expansion offers no new feature or gameplay mechanic. On the contrary, it feels like it offers less than the base game. As the whole adventure is set on Va'Ruun'kai, space exploration is non-existent, and there wasn't much of it in the base game to begin with. The planet does have an interesting visual design that makes it very personable with a great atmosphere, but in terms of gameplay design, it is rather bad and does not entice exploration at all. This isn't caused by the lack of points of interest, of which there are a few, but by the fact that it is designed in a way that makes traversal with the land vehicle cumbersome and frustrating. Too many times, I felt that leaving it behind was the best choice, a choice that, however, hurt exploration pacing way too much.</p>
<p>Things don't fare much better with quests and combat. While there are some interesting stories found throughout the side content, the quest design is rather average, relying on the fetch quest archetype way too much. Combat is possibly even worse. The new weapons are essentially reskins of base game weapons, and the added effects of certain melee weapons, while interesting on paper, fall flat in execution, as Starfield's melee combat leaves a lot to be desired. The new enemies are also nothing to write home about, feeling, for the most part, like reskins of the base game's enemies. There are some new ones, to be sure, but none that truly stand out. Ultimately, all this makes the Shattered Space expansion feel boring even after just a few hours. The fact that companions that would have quite a bit to contribute while exploring Va'Ruun'kai, such as Andreja, interact very little with the environment or the planet's inhabitants only makes matters worse.</p>

<p>While Starfield's first expansion fails to deliver compelling gameplay, it does, at least, deliver great visuals. Va'Ruun'kai is among the best-looking planets in the entire game, featuring a very peculiar atmosphere that briefly borders into space horror. The dominant purple color, however, gets a little tiring over time, and a more varied visual design would have been welcome. As already mentioned, the expansion introduces some improved facial animations that help immersion quite a bit, although other elements, such as the aforementioned issues with Andreja, have a rather big negative impact on it. Breaking immersion, and sometimes even the expansion itself, are a variety of bugs, ranging from the innocuous physics bug to progression blockers. I did not run into any of the latter, but they have been widely reported, so beware.</p>
<p>The Starfield: Shattered Space expansion offers an engaging new story but adds little beyond that. Fans of the game's universe will appreciate spending more time in it and discovering a faction more complex than it appeared in the base game, but those who didn't enjoy Starfield or were primarily interested in its space exploration mechanics won't change their opinion with the expansion, as it doesn't address the vast majority of the issues that still plague the experience.</p>

<p>The Starfield Shattered Space expansion leaves a lot to be desired. While it introduces a more focused and engaging story compared to the base game, the average map and quest design, along with the lack of new features, turn the adventure in Va'Ruun'kai into a bit of a slog rather quickly. Although the tighter focus is welcome, the Starfield experience as a whole needs something more substantial to reach its full potential.</p>

<p>Developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/343-industries">343 Industries</a> confirmed the "new way to play" at this weekend's 2024 <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/halo">Halo</a> Championships and then again in a brief post to X/Twitter.</p>

<p>Spartans won't be able to slide from first-person view to third-person on the fly in-game, but will instead get a new dedicated firefight mode in which all players have a third-person perspective.</p>
<p>It marks the very first time a third-person point of view has ever been formally available in a Halo game in the franchise's storied history.</p> <div>

<p>"It's a fun way to play, you have more awareness," senior community manager, John "Unyshek" Junyszek, said (thanks, <a href="https://www.vgchartz.com/article/462653/halo-infinite-adding-third-person-mode-in-november/">VGChartz</a>).</p>
<p>"You get to see your Spartan. It's super cool. Internally people have been loving it, and I'm excited for everyone to get their hands on it later this year."</p>
<p>Forge creators, too, can make use of third-person POV in their own creations.</p>
<p>343i stopped short of revealing a precise release date for the new mode, but we'll keep you posted.</p>
<p>Season 1 of Paramount+'s Halo series aired back in 2022, nearly a decade after the project was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spielberg-to-produce-a-halo-tv-show">first announced</a>. It launched to a mixed reception, however, and was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paramounts-divisive-halo-tv-series-cancelled-after-two-seasons">cancelled after its second season</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
