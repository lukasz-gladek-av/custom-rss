            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>New details have emerged regarding The Initiative's canceled&nbsp;<em>Perfect Dark&nbsp;</em>reboot, including some of the locales the game would have taken you to and what kind of gameplay systems it would have offered.</p>

<p>Back in July, as part of a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/latest-microsoft-layoff-wave-king-zenimax" rel="nofollow">wider Microsoft layoff wave</a>,&nbsp;<em>Perfect Dark&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shut-down" rel="nofollow">was canceled</a>, and developer The Initiative's doors were closed for good (and that game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/everwild-canceled-rare-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">wasn't the only casualty</a> of those layoffs either).</p>

<p>Now, a new report from <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/gameplay-details-concept-screens-cancelled-perfect-dark-reboot" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">MP1st</a>&nbsp;details what kind of game The Initiative was working on, and it turns out that the studio was looking to fill a niche left open by the absence of newer&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>007&nbsp;</em>games. As MP1st points out, it's a little ironic that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-1m-sales" rel="nofollow">both</a> of those franchises are now <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/007-first-light-release-date" rel="nofollow">active</a> and&nbsp;<em>Perfect Dark&nbsp;</em>isn't.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-scanning.jpg?itok=2PdYYkAJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-scanning.jpg?itok=ws5FK6Qf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>No, that 2024 Xbox&nbsp;<em>Perfect Dark&nbsp;</em>trailer wasn't fake...mostly.</figcaption></figure><p>The report, which uses material obtained from "a former developer" on the project, also clarifies that contrary to rumor, the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/every-xbox-showcase-2024-announcement" rel="nofollow">2024 Xbox showcase</a> trailer for&nbsp;<em>Perfect Dark&nbsp;</em>wasn't fake. Despite containing "fake stuff", the trailer did show a demo that was internally playable.</p>

<p>According to MP1st's report,&nbsp;<em>Perfect Dark&nbsp;</em>would have taken place in a variety of locales around the world, including the likes of Cairo. They'd have been depicted in an aesthetic internally referred to as "eco sci-fi", marrying futuristic visuals with green tech.</p>

<p>Additionally, one major gameplay system, the Adrenaline System, is detailed in the report. Apparently, Adrenaline would have been a resource that players built up over time, allowing access to skills like healing, reducing incoming damage, and more.</p>

<p>The report claims that the material featured within was intended to be part of&nbsp;<em>Perfect Dark</em>'s "Season 1", which, as MP1st points out, could well lend credence to the idea that the game was intended to be episodic at one point.</p>




<p>Of course, all of this is moot given that&nbsp;<em>Perfect Dark&nbsp;</em>was canceled earlier this year, but who knows? Maybe some of the material in this report will make its way into another Xbox project somewhere down the line. Stay tuned for more.</p>

                <p>For the better part of a decade, French gaming developers Laurent Lechat and Boris Marmontel had their game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/planet-centauri/" data-ref-id="5000-453058">Planet Centauri </a>in early access on Steam. However, the game's 1.0 launch arrived last year with a resounding thud, and Valve is accepting the blame for not notifying the 100,000-plus players who had wishlisted it on Steam.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBf5mZFUbpU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hBf5mZFUbpU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In a recent post on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1nfd2ji/this_is_how_steam_can_ruin_more_than_10_years_of/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit</a> (via <a href="https://www.polygon.com/valve-steam-alpha-centauri-launch-bug-daily-deal-terraria/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Polygon</a>), Lechat shared excerpts from an email sent out by Valve that explained why Planet Centauri's launch failed to get much traction.</p><p>"We found a bug that impacted a very small number of game releases (less than 100 since 2015) where wishlist email notifications for the launch of a game were not sent," wrote a Valve spokesperson. "Unfortunately, your game Planet Centauri was among those included. We intend for this feature to work for every game and we're inviting you to a Daily Deal as a way to help make up for lost visibility from your launch day."</p><p>Lechat explained at length how the dismal response to Planet Centauri disheartened himself and Marmontel. He also seemed wary about Valve's offer before other users on Reddit urged them to accept the added visibility of a Daily Deal on Steam's homepage.</p><p>Since Planet Centauri's story has been making the rounds, there has been a small uptick of <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/385380/charts/#max" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">concurrent players to 105</a>. That's not a huge number, but some players have given the game a shot and shared largely positive reviews. Although some of the other reviews on Steam have noted that <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/twilightdusk/recommended/385380/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Planet Centauri has noticeable flaws</a> and still feels like an early-access release.</p><p>Lechat and Marmontel are currently working on a new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-roguelike-games/2900-6522/" data-ref-id="2900-6522">roguelike game</a> that uses the engine they built for Planet Centauri. The duo said that they have a financial obligation to finish that game before they'll be free to work on future patches for Planet Centauri.</p>

                <p>Earlier this year, Team Ninja <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nioh-3-revealed-at-state-of-play-free-demo-out-today/1100-6532108/" data-ref-id="1100-6532108">debuted the first look</a> at a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/nioh-3/" data-ref-id="5000-680916">Nioh 3</a>, the latest game in the action-RPG series. Players will assume control of a fictionalized version of Japan's first shogun, Tokugawa Takechiyo, as he rises to power by taking on supernatural threats. In a departure for the series, Tokugawa can switch back and forth between samurai and ninja fighting styles. Now, Team Ninja has explained how its Ninja Gaiden games inspired this shift in Nioh 3's gameplay.</p><p>"We wanted to create a new kind of action that would act as a major centerpiece, making players feel that the game has taken a step forward," said Nioh 3 general producer Fumihiko Yasuda during an interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-nioh-3-is-changing-the-game-with-ninja-style-and-the-distinctive-mist-system-ign-first" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>. "Team Ninja also has the experience of creating the Ninja Gaiden series. In other words, we have just about as much experience and knowhow when it comes to creating ninja action as we do with Nioh's samurai action. Ninja are very popular overseas, and we thought that this would excite those players as well. Nioh's Japanese world and setting is also something we value, which made ninja seem like the best possible answer."</p><p>Yasuda noted that previous Nioh games have already referenced the Ninja Gaiden games in the DLC, but added that Team Ninja is looking "into creating the sort of action that fans of both series will enjoy."</p><p>Players will can favor one fighting style over another, although there will be key differences between them. Samurai style will allow players to use Ki Pulse after attacking to recover their stamina. However, that ability won't be available to players using ninja style. Instead, ninja style players can use the mist ability to temporarily create a duplicate of themselves to better strike at their enemies. </p><p>Nioh 3 is currently expected to hit PlayStation 5 and PC in early 2026. In the meantime, Team Ninja's next game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ninja-gaiden-4/" data-ref-id="5000-659496">Ninja Gaiden 4</a>, is coming on October 21 for Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC. That sequel was also co-developed by Platinum Games.</p>

<figure><a title="Donkey Kong Bananza / Mario Odyssey Pauline" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d91b0cb478cbd/donkey-kong-bananza-mario-odyssey-pauline.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>From the second Nintendo revealed Pauline was in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, a timeline theory began to take shape in our heads. But then we wrapped the game up, and our prequel presumptions weren't as nailed on as we'd expected.</p>
<p>We still don't have an official answer for how Bananza Pauline is related to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Odyssey</a> Pauline, and according to producer Kenta Motokura, we ain't going to get one any time soon.</p>
<p>This stems from a recent <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202509/50508">Famitsu</a> interview (thanks for the heads up, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/stealth40k.bsky.social/post/3lzbwv3as5c2w">@Stealth40K</a>), in which some of Bananza's key creatives sat down to chat all things DK. The answers cover many of the same topics we saw in the game's Ask the Developer series, but the question of Pauline's timeline is a newbie — albeit one that was somewhat brushed aside.</p><div><figure data-videoid="fMx2XNyAq4E" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5d98e4hjixsy&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMx2XNyAq4E" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>When asked about Bananza Pauline's connection to Odyssey's New Donk City mayor, Motokura deftly dodged the topic, saying (via Google Translate), "That's... Of course, the developers have a plan for it, but I'm sorry, but I'd like you to use your imagination". <em>Gah</em>! And there we were, thinking an answer was on the horizon.</p>
<p>And what about that Grandma that 13-year-old Pauline brings up so often in Bananza's Getaway naps? There must be a connection there, right? "Sorry, this too", said Motokura. <em>Double gah</em>!</p>
<p>Now, that little tease of the developers having "a plan" for Pauline's heritage has us wondering if we're going to return to this timeline topic again in the future — we'd be amazed if we don't get another 3D DK game somewhere down the line. Alternatively, of course, Motokura could just be implying that the dev team has their theories, just like we all do, but we're never going to hear 'em. The latter seems all the more realistic, knowing Nintendo.</p>
<p>Okay, so Nintendo isn't going to spill the beans on this one just yet, but that doesn't mean we can't keep on theorising. Don't worry, we won't spoil the end of Bananza here, but if you want to read all about the game's finale and how we reckon it may/may not tie into Odyssey, you can find a full rundown in the guide below.</p>

</header>
  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>'s hitherto <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksongs-second-patch-is-live-in-steam-beta-includes-fix-for-bug-caused-by-dying-to-bosses-while-killing-them">beta-only update 1.0.28650</a> is now a fully public release that any dang fool can download without switching to a Steam playtest branch. I'm still noodling my way through the lower levels of Team Cherry's new metroidvania, blissfully unbothered by any pressure to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-review">review it</a> or write <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-walkthrough">Silksong walkthroughs</a>. As such, I asked our reviewer James to have a look at the patch notes and pluck out any important changes, based on his many, many hours in Pharloom. 
</p>
<p>
A shadow glided over James's face, then returned and took up residence in one earhole. Wordlessly he outstretched a gnarled finger towards item 3 on the list: "Fixed Savage Beastfly in Far Fields sometimes remaining below the lava."
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Thus my introduction to the Savage Beastfly, an optional <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-bosses">Silksong boss</a> that has two iterations. I've now done some background reading on Savage Beastfly and - inasmuch as it's safe to extrapolate from all-caps forum posts - it appears to be Silksong's most-hated NPC. Not simply a challenging fight but a crushingly unfair and unpredictable one, in the eyes of many players, with complaints lodged against everything from the inconsistency of the creature's hitbox, its two-mask damage output, its habit of summoning minions, and the whiteknuckle RNG effect of mixing all these things together.</p>
<p>It doesn't even look that good, the detractors howl. It's not like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-malenia-walkthrough">Malenia</a> in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a>. It's just a mallet with wings. Nobody wants to Rule 34 that thing. Well, some people probably do, because that's the point of Rule 34, but this particular intersection of masochism and formicophilia seems like a rare gift, indeed.
</p><p>
And all of this merely describes the first iteration of the boss. The second introduces lava and destructible platforms, just for funsies. As such, the now-fixed technical issue above with the Savage Beastfly diving into lava and never returning could be styled a positive. Let the bastard stay in the magma, if it loves magma so much. Let it burn forever in a hell of its own creation.
</p>
<p>
The loathing is so extreme that there is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/fucksavagebeastfly/">a whole subreddit dedicated to Savage Beastfly</a> and all its works, with 34,000 weekly visitors. Be warned that the subreddit contains a lot of fake reporting about undiscovered, even tougher Savage Beastfly variants, because if there's one thing Silksong players like doing, it's rustling each other's jimmies.
</p>
<p>
While the Savage Beastfly does appear to savagely beastfly in the face of sporting boss design, I do inevitably wonder whether a piss-boiling abomination like this is a marketing asset for a game such as Silksong. Bosses that are merely 'good' and 'well-designed' don't tend to attract dedicated subreddits. Malenia doesn't have one, as far as I can tell. Nor do Giygas, Psycho Mantis or Sephiroth. I'm surprised I haven't seen Savage Beastfly cited more in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/yes-hollow-knight-silksong-has-some-moments-of-steep-difficulty-team-cherry-admit-but-have-you-considered-going-for-a-pre-boss-walk">the on-going discussion</a> of whether Silksong's overall difficulty is key to the mood, or just contrived.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, the full patch notes are below. They are essentially unchanged from the beta test last week.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Added Dithering effect option in Advanced video settings. Reduces colour banding but can slightly soften the appearance of foreground assets. Defaults to 'Off'.</li>
<li>Updated Herald's Wish achievement description to clarify that players must both complete the wish and finish the game.</li>
<li>Fixed Savage Beastfly in Far Fields sometimes remaining below the lava.</li>
<li>Fixed rare cases of Shrine Guardian Seth getting out of bounds during battle.</li>
<li>Fixed rare case of Second Sentinel knocking the player out of bounds during battle.</li>
<li>Added catch to prevent Lugoli sometimes flying off screen and not returning during battle.</li>
<li>Further reduced chance of Silk Snippers getting stuck out of bounds in Chapel of the Reaper battle.</li>
<li>Fixed various instances of dying to bosses while killing them causing death sequences to play messily or out of sync.</li>
<li>Fixed Shaman Binding into a bottom transition causing a softlock.</li>
<li>Cocoon positions in some locations updated to prevent it spawning in inaccessible areas.</li>
<li>Fixed Liquid Lacquer courier delivery not being accessible in Steel Soul mode.</li>
<li>Fixed some NPCs not correctly playing cursed hint dialogues in certain instances.</li>
<li>Fixed Pondcatcher Reed not being able to fly away after singing.</li>
<li>Fixed Verdania memory orbs sometimes replaying layered screen-edge burst effects.</li>
<li>Fixed the break counter not working for certain multihitter tools eg Conchcutter.</li>
<li>Fixed Volt Filament damage multiplier not applying for certain Silk Skills.</li>
<li>Fixed Cogflies and Wisps inappropriately targeting Skullwings.</li>
<li>Fixed Cogflies incorrectly resetting their HP to full on scene change.</li>
<li>Fixed Curveclaw always breaking on the first hit after being deflected.</li>
<li>Fixed Plasmium Phial and Flea Brew sometimes not restoring as intended at benches.</li>
<li>Various other smaller tweaks and fixes. </li>
</ul>

            <p>The now-cancelled Perfect Dark reboot had an "eco sci-fi" aesthetic, an Adrenaline System, and may have been released episodically.</p>
<p>That's according to internal documentation from a former developer on the project at The Initiative shared with <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/gameplay-details-concept-screens-cancelled-perfect-dark-reboot">mp1st</a>, revealing new artwork and gameplay details.</p>
<p>The document highlighted an opportunity to capitalise on the secret agent genre, due to the absence of Metal Gear Solid and James Bond 007 during development. Ironically enough, both franchises have since returned.</p>

<p>This may somewhat point to why <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/perfect-dark-reboot-and-new-zenimax-mmorpg-reportedly-cancelled-as-part-of-latest-microsoft-cuts">Perfect Dark was ultimately cancelled</a> - perhaps this reboot of the N64 classic from Rare wasn't able to differentiate itself enough.</p>
<p>Still, this newly unearthed documentation - which dates back to a period close to the game's cancellation this year - hints as to what players could have expected. The creative vision for the reboot aimed to reimagine the franchise while retaining the core DNA of the N64 original, with the HBO series Westworld providing inspiration for giving a classic property fresh themes and concepts.</p><p>While several systems are briefly mentioned, only the Adrenaline System is detailed. This would've been a resource regenerated over time to provide various abilities like healing and increasing damage dealt, as well as slowing time to aim with precision. Killing multiple enemies in quick succession would have extended this effect.</p>
<p>Until April of this year, the studio was working on a vertical slice (a playable proof-of-concept) that belonged to "Season 1", suggesting the game would have been released episodically.</p>
<p>Perfect Dark was properly revealed at last year's Xbox Games Showcase, with in-game footage of protagonist Joanna Dark exploring a futuristic Cairo (above). Later,<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ethangach.bsky.social/post/3lsypye2edk2v"> reports suggested this gameplay was fake</a>, though a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/adammcdlt.bsky.social/post/3lt23bz2dwk2z">designer on the game responded</a> it was in-engine despite "some fake stuff in it".</p>
<p>The new documentation includes further artwork for the game, including an alternate design for Joanna, as well as various futuristic environments to show off its "eco sci-fi" aesthetic.</p>
<p>Perfect Dark was cancelled back in July, following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-begins-substantial-layoff-process-across-gaming-division-king-and-zenimax-impacted">layoffs across Microsoft</a>. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rares-everwild-reportedly-cancelled-following-xbox-job-cuts">Rare's Everwild was also cancelled</a>.</p>

<p>Dropping two days earlier on other platforms</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Windwalk Games and Team17 have announced that the release date for their upcoming co-op roguelike, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/sworn">Sworn</a>, has been shifted from 25th September, a.k.a. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hades-ii-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hades 2</a> Day™, to 23rd September on PC and (other) consoles, with a Switch version due to arrive at "a later date."</p>
<p>This colourful roguelike from "a team of veteran developers from Riot Games, Niantic, and Blizzard" takes inspiration from the art of the legendary Mike Mignola, has been available on PC in early access since February, where it's gone down very well, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1763250/SWORN/">sat as it is on a very positive rating</a>.</p>
<p>At first glance, it's a <em>very</em> similar-looking affair to Hades 2 , so we can't really blame Team17 for shifting the launch date to give version 1.0 a little breathing room. But Sworn also offers something of its own, with up to four-player co-op available for you and your pals to dig into while exploring a cursed Camelot.</p>

<p>Here's some official info about the game, and we'll be sure to let you know when the Switch date is set in stone. Like a big sword.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Choose to play solo or with friends, summoning the blessings of the Fae Lords in this action rogue-like set in a cursed Avalon. Only through your mastery of unique weapons, many ability options and the help of powerful allies such as Merlin can there be hope for realm. Coinigh dó neart leat! Sworn encourages players to be versatile in the ever-changing battlegrounds of Camelot and to do whatever it takes to halt the grim plans of Arthur and his dishonourable Knights. <strong><br></strong><strong><br></strong><strong>Solo and Co-op<br></strong>Play solo or unite with up to 4 friends to stand off against the Knights of the Round Table. Choose from 4 characters: Vigilante, Rook, Spectre, and Monk and combine the strengths of each character in surprising ways and master abilities to become knights worthy of standing off against Arthur himself.</p>
<p><strong>Explore a foredoomed Avalon</strong><br>
Meet familiar friends and foes inspired by myths and Legends, in this beautifully crafted comic world, inspired by the work of American artist Mike Mignola.</p>
<p><strong>Power divine from the Fae</strong><br>
Swear fealty to the Fae Lords and choose from over 200 unique blessings to unleash your full potential. Will you avail of King Oberon you fury bonuses and damaging whirlwinds or perhaps Banshee Cliona’s aid of soul missiles.</p>
<p><strong>Creatively conquer Camelot</strong><br>
Combine your blessings with unique character, weapon, and ability selections. Test thousands of unique builds as you become a seasoned knight.</p>
<p><strong>Become worthy</strong><br>
Upgrades from the Beacon of Avalore will forge your squire into a worthy champion over time. However, if you believe you are already worthy of facing Arthur, get ready for a challenge that will put your skills to the test.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As covered by <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2025/09/two-games-are-available-early-this-week-with-xbox-game-pass-september-22-23#sworn-series-xs-pc-cloud-september-23">our sister site Pure Xbox</a>, Sworn is dropping on Game Pass Ultimate tomorrow, too — another place to check it out if you can't wait for that 'TBA' Switch date. Team17 is putting the game out physically on Switch, so watch this space.</p>

In the Natural History Museum, no less!</p>
<p>From <strong>26th January to 22nd March 2026</strong>, the museum's Cranbourne Boutique shop will be getting a Pokémon twist, stocking exclusive collaboration products including clothing, plushies, accessories and more. Many of these products have been made specifically for the collaboration, so expect to see more than a little historical flair in their designs.</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fozvirw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLc1VHm8D80" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Of course, this is a Pokémon pop-up that we're talking about here, so the event will be ticketed. You'll be able to pick up a <em>free</em> ticket to the shop from the <a href="https://www.nhm.ac.uk/events/pokemon-pop-up-shop.html?utm_source=pokemon-press-announcement-20250922-hp&amp;utm_medium=nhm-press&amp;utm_campaign=retail">Natural History Museum website</a> from <strong>1st October</strong>, and you can register for the priority list right now.</p>
<p>Products from the Pokémon x NHM collection will also be available via the museum's online store, and a selection will be added to the official Pokémon Center UK website in January.</p>
<p>It may not be a Pokémon <em>Center</em>, as such, but we're always excited to see more Pokémon shopping opportunities come to Europe. Let's just hope that things go a little smoother than they did in the Louvre back in 2023.</p>

            <p>Hello reader who is also a player! Once again I have failed in my fervent efforts to meddle with the Earth's rotation so as to suspend time exactly at 11.30am, Saturday morning. I fear that another week is upon us. Fortunately, it contains some new PC games, spanning full releases and early access launches. Some of those new PC games may even be worth a modest portion of your lifespan and personal capital. Here's a list of the ones I find most appealing or notable.

<p>Aside from the above new PC games, this week will contain a non-zero quantity of games so new they aren't even released yet. We'll hear about a few of them at the latest Tokyo Game Show, which runs 25th-28th September. As I write this I am looking at a spreadsheet of embargoed announcements. The temptation to just paste the whole thing below and take the week off is fierce, but I am absurdly professional and will resist. Pretty sure none of you care about <span tabindex="0">made you look!</span> anyway.</p>

<p>The Switch 2 launch title hit a speed boost this week and cruised past former champion <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> to take the top spot. It was a short-lived triumph for Gearbox's latest, but we're sure the Nintendo release in a couple of weeks will help bolster the numbers</p>
<p>Elsewhere, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> sticks around in third, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_kart_8_deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a> is <em>somehow</em> the fifth best-seller, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/trails_in_the_sky_1st_chapter">Trails in the Sky: 1st Chapter</a> makes its chart debut at 19th, with 34% of sales coming from the Switch release.</p>
<p>But that's quite enough waffling, here's the full top 40, with platform breakdowns for games available on Switch, Switch 2, and other consoles:</p>

            <p>The Pokémon Company is once again risking a poké-palava at a museum, with the announcement of a pop-up store at London's Natural History Museum selling exclusive items.</p>
<p>Back in 2023, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-van-gogh-exhibit-includes-exclusive-pikachu-trading-card">Pokémon collaboration was launched with Amsterdam's Van Gogh Museum</a> featuring six Pokémon paintings and a store selling an exclusive Pikachu trading card. Yet scalpers descended on the museum, eventually leading to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/four-van-gogh-museum-employees-suspended-after-pokemon-exhibit-chaos">four employees being suspended</a> - one allegedly embezzled a box of cards.</p>
<p>Now The Pokémon Company is moving to London for its first pop-up in a UK museum, and it's all about evolution - and Pokémon's 30th anniversary.</p>

<p>"There is such a wonderful alignment between Pokémon and the Natural History Museum - we're obviously both big fans of the natural world and its evolution and diversity," said Adam Farrar, director of commercial and visitor experience for the museum. "We hope this collaboration will spark joy and curiosity in the creatures around us, both in the world of Pokémon and Earth."</p>
<p>The store will sell clothing, stationary, accessories, prints, and a brand-new exclusive plushie toy - it's a Pikachu hugging the museum, as below.</p>

<p>"Design inspiration has been drawn directly from the Natural History Museum's iconic building and architecture, as well as the beautiful naturalist sketches that fill the Museum's archives," said Mathieu Galante, senior director of licensing for Pokémon Europe. "We are excited to be working with the Natural History Museum to create this fun pop-up store for fans of all ages."</p>
<p>Note, however, the pop-up is not a Pokémon Centre.</p>
<p>What's more, in an attempt to prevent scalping, free tickets will be required to attend the store. These will be available online from 1st October, but you can <a href="https://www.nhm.ac.uk/events/pokemon-pop-up-shop.html?utm_source=pokemon-press-announcement-20250922-hp&amp;utm_medium=nhm-press&amp;utm_campaign=retail">sign up to be the first to hear</a>.</p>
<p>The pop-up will run from 26th January to 22nd March next year, with the product range also available to buy <a href="https://www.nhmshop.co.uk/?srsltid=AfmBOorBseC_DhtYXMqRbGzy3Zxn6ye5OvDqVzxM9dHraX54OsyrcOM7">online from the Natural History Museum shop</a> from January - all purchases will support the museum's charitable mission of supporting scientific research into the planetary emergency.</p>
<p>Some products will additionally be available to buy from the <a href="https://www.pokemoncenter.com/en-gb/">Pokémon Centre UK official online store</a>.</p>
<p>Let's hope it doesn't cause another chaotic fiasco over exclusive items, for which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-pokemon-company-apologises-for-the-disappointment-caused-by-scalpers-buying-up-all-of-its-van-gogh-items">The Pokémon Company has to apologise</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Silent Hill f Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-f-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/silent-hill-f-review.1304085/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">There are few who would dispute that last year’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/silent-hill-2-remake">Silent Hill 2</a> was a supremely well-executed remake of the 2001 original, but you could also argue in retrospect that developer Bloober Team’s modernising of a survival horror masterpiece was a pretty safe bet. Silent Hill f, from developer Neobards Entertainment, is a much bolder undertaking by comparison. It offers an entirely new story in a completely foreign setting, with a captivating protagonist who bucks the series’ trend of featuring predominately morose, middle-aged men, and keeps its handguns holstered in favour of a strictly melee-focussed fighting system. Although the cumbersome and inconsistent nature of its pipe-swinging combat made it something I had to grin and bear rather than rip and tear, Silent Hill f is a success in almost every other way and is certainly one of the strongest new games in the series since the PlayStation 2 era.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In case it wasn’t clear, Silent Hill f is a Silent Hill story that doesn’t in any way feature the well-trodden town of its namesake. In fact, it’s the first mainline entry in the iconic Japanese survival horror series that’s actually set in Japan – in this case the fictional village of Ebisugaoka in the 1960s – and it provides a backdrop rich with carefully crafted cultural touches that make it one of the series’ most intriguing locations to explore. Every little detail combines to evoke a strong sense of place, from the muddy rice fields to slosh through to the ramune soda bottles to gulp down and the puzzles inspired by local folklore to solve, some of which proved to be seriously challenging for my ignorant Australian brain. (I’ve tracked down plenty of keys and crests in the survival horror genre over the years, but I’ve never needed to put my controller down and Google what a kudzu plant looks like before.)   </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Silent Hill f - Review Screens</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s also the first time in a long time that a mainline Silent Hill story has allowed us to take control of a lead character with any sort of meaningful depth, in this case high school student Hinako Shimizu. The black sheep of her family, Hinako is clearly the victim of an abusive, alcoholic father and her subservient enabler of a mother. In typical Silent Hill fashion, her many psychological scars manifest themselves into menacing physical threats as her sleepy village adopts an increasingly creepy visage, forcing Hinako to become a doggedly determined agent of her own destiny rather than a mere damsel in distress. From there, Silent Hill f’s story confidently explores the complex themes of gender discrimination, child abuse, and drug dependency – among many other horrific human afflictions – gradually teasing out the root causes of Hinako’s torment through the uncovering of private letters from her school friends and increasingly frequent encounters with malevolent visual metaphors.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There’s one particularly grisly moment in here that makes Heavy Rain’s infamous pinky-severing scene seem like little more than a paper cut.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">What unfolds is an utterly absorbing adventure, tautly paced and packed with surprises including some moments of genuinely unsettling body horror and torture – seriously, there’s one particularly grisly moment in here that makes <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/heavy-rain">Heavy Rain’s</a> infamous pinky-severing scene seem like little more than a paper cut. It all builds to a thoroughly harrowing conclusion at the end of Hinako’s nine-hour journey that left me with plenty of disturbing thoughts to process, as well as a strong urge to head back into New Game+ to explore Hinako’s other potential fates further via the four additional endings to unlock.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Soup Foggy Slog</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">As a fog descends on Ebisugaoka and blood-red flowers and veiny tendrils start to entangle its mysteriously abandoned streets, so begins the emergence of various nightmarish creatures that hound Hinako at every turn. Some of the neighbourhood nasties seem pretty <em>fog </em>standard for a Silent Hill campaign, like the mannequin-esque dolls that go for your throat with kitchen knives from around unchecked corners. However, there are a decent number of inspired new creature creations too, such as the twisted scarecrows modelled on Hinako’s schoolmates that shift from contorted stationary poses to startling lunges whenever you turn your back to them, like they’re playing a more stab-happy game of schoolyard statues. Later there are some truly disgusting, slack-mawed beasts covered in bulbous bellies like an enormous cluster of rotting flesh grapes, that give birth to howling demon types in an attempt to overwhelm you. There’s no doubt that Silent Hill f took one look at the series’ dedication to conjuring up the most repulsive monstrosities possible, and asked someone to hold its can of Asahi. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I just wish I had as much fun fighting these magnificent monsters as I did marveling at their exceptionally ghastly forms, because actually taking them on usually isn’t fun and it isn’t particularly frightening. It’s just annoying – and this doesn’t seem like the type of survival horror where you’re supposed to feel outmatched and avoid combat whenever possible, at least not beyond its opening hours. Unlike many previous Silent Hill stories, there isn’t a single shotgun or pistol to be found in Silent Hill f to battle these beasts with. Instead Hinako is only capable of carrying up to three breakable melee weapons like crowbars and baseball bats that she finds in her surroundings – which makes sense in context, since you’d assume that firearms would be harder to stumble upon in a mountainside village in Japan than they would be in the series’ usual home in the United States. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As a result, the strictly close-quarters combat encounters largely involve delivering a mix of light and heavy attacks as well as performing dashes and dodges to evade incoming blows, all of which sap Hinako’s aggravatingly stingy stamina bar and momentarily curb her ability to perform any of these actions should you allow it to deplete. There is also a focus ability that allows you to pull off special charged-up hits and easier counters, and even blocks if you're holding a heavy weapon like the sledgehammer, but this too comes at a cost – draining your sanity meter which, once emptied, makes Hinako’s health bar vulnerable to both physical and shrieking psychological attacks.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Having to constantly keep tabs on your health, stamina, sanity, and the state of your weapons, all felt like a bit too much to balance for my tastes – certainly off the back of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/silent-hill-2-remake">Silent Hill 2’s</a> fear and instinct-driven point-and-shoot simplicity – and I never really settled into an enjoyable groove with Silent Hill f’s comparatively stilted and repetitive combat as a result. These attributes can admittedly be enhanced slightly over time with buffs and consumables you collect, and nailing a perfect dodge does reward you with a handy stamina boost, but more often than I’d have liked Hinako would run out of puff faster than an asthmatic in a smoker’s lounge and I’d be forced to sort of awkwardly shuffle backwards away from a snarling enemy while I waited for her to remember how her arms worked. Even when there was still plenty of stamina up her school uniform’s sleeve, there were countless times where Hinako would just stubbornly pause between strikes for extended periods while I furiously pumped the attack button in vain.     </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Coping with the restrictive nature of the stamina bar wasn’t my main problem with Silent Hill f’s melee combat, though. Nor was it that my slow and energy-sapping swings would often clang harmlessly into nearby walls despite the fact enemies were often somehow able to hit me directly through scenery. It also wasn’t the way the lock-on target switching seemed frustratingly unreliable when the campaign’s second half puts you up against enemy groups in greater numbers, or how monsters would occasionally hack chunks off my health bar when I was defenselessly trapped in animations like entering a doorway. No, my biggest gripe with Silent Hill f’s fighting is that it’s all risk and no reward. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unlike, say, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a>, where you earn XP from killing enemies in order to level up your character, or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-4">Resident Evil 4</a> where freshly dispatched foes will often drop vital ammo boxes or healing herbs, winning a battle in Silent Hill f means <em>likely </em>losing some of your health bar and <em>definitely </em>doing some damage to your annoyingly brittle weapons. (Hinako is unable to fight with her bare hands.) This was also true of last year’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/silent-hill-2-remake">Silent Hill 2</a> remake – if you substitute a loss of ammo in place of wear and tear on your breakable bats and sickles, that is – but the major difference is that I found the breathless and intuitive thrills of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/silent-hill-2-remake">Silent Hill 2</a>’s shotgun-toting scraps to be its own reward. Since I didn’t find Silent Hill f’s fighting to be anywhere near as urgent or exciting, I opted to just straight-up avoid enemy encounters wherever I could – especially the more heavy-set foes that can absorb half a lead pipe’s worth of overhead swings before they expired. (Seriously, if I have to use a big stick to violently smack something eight or nine times before it caves in, I’d at least expect it to suddenly spill packets of Skittles all over the floor at a birthday party.)</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>My biggest gripe with Silent Hill f’s fighting is that it’s all risk and no reward.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Surprisingly, this wasn’t too hard to do for the most part given that most enemies can be comfortably juked around with the dodge button, and many of these easily distracted demons give up the chase the instant you slip around a corner and break the line of sight, as though they’re hellborn babies who’re yet to fully comprehend object permanence. I quickly started skipping combat wherever possible by just running past each ghoul on the way to my next story objective, or ducking into a side street to search for supplies before hoofing it right back.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This passive strategy of exploiting the enemies’ weak AI only worked for so long, and indeed in the story’s final hours there are an increasing amount of repetitive gauntlet-run slogs where the path forward is fully blocked until you kill every creature in the vicinity, but there were lengthy stretches in the first half where I was hustling along a sped-up run-through of Ebisugaoka that seemed more Benny Hill than Silent Hill. That made it tough for the town’s increasingly bleak atmosphere to completely work its way under my skin, no matter how insistent its genuinely ominous ambient audio became, but at least I was having fun rather than feeling frustrated.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Phantasmic Mr. Fox</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, the Torii gate and lantern-lined shrine realm that Hinako drifts in and out of over the course of her journey does mitigate some of these combat issues, but it also gradually empowers her to a point where fighting becomes arguably too easy at times. Visits to this ethereal otherworld, which provides a sinister yet strangely beautiful contrast to the village’s increasingly festering streets, sees Hinako slowly slip under the spell of a morally ambiguous mystery man wearing a fox mask, who’s given the decidedly Kojima-esque name of ‘Fox Mask’. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Early on, Hinako is given an indestructible dagger and polearm in these sections, allowing her to tackle the same monster mobs from the real world minus the risk of each weapon splintering to bits in her hands mid-scrap. However, by the story’s midpoint she’s gained the supernatural ability to siphon the soul power from each enemy she kills and channel it into a sort of beast mode that makes her overpowered and invulnerable for short bursts at a time. To be fair, Hinako’s otherworld evolution does make sense thematically, but her newfound, fox-powered fighting ability is kind of at odds with the fundamentals of survival horror, since unleashing it made me feel less like a vulnerable little red riding hood and more like the big bad wolf. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>[I felt] less like a vulnerable little red riding hood and more like the big bad wolf.&nbsp;</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The shrine realm also brought some frustrations with Silent Hill f’s inventory system to the surface. Having limited pocket space in a survival horror adventure is a given, but I wish that there had been an item storage box of some sort at each Shinto shrine save point so that I could carry consumables that made more sense in the ornate otherworld than they did in the village. For example, I tended to stockpile the toolkits required to repair weapons out in Hinako’s hometown, but since they were useless in the shrine realm I was forced to either offload them completely or sacrifice some precious inventory slots to hold onto them until Hinako returned to the real world. I mean, her collection of earthbound weapons are there waiting for her upon her reemergence from the shrine realm, why not the toolkits too?</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Tristan's Favourite Horror Games</h3><p>Intensity in ten entries.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Having said that, Silent Hill f’s otherworld does at least play host to the bulk of its boss fights, which offer bursts of flashy spectacle on par with other melee-focussed adventures like Elden Ring or Lies of P, but thankfully without being nearly as punishing to overcome – at least, not on the standard combat difficulty setting. Again, there are some really striking character designs on display here, such as the aggressive apparition that shrouds the arena with a red mist to mask its sneaky teleportations, attacks from long distance with a spiked flail, and wraps Hinako in a bear hug to gnaw on her face if you get too close. While these battles still rely on the same sluggish slashing and dodging as every other enemy encounter, they at least provide a bit more in the way of strategic depth.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">More importantly, the bulk of the shrine realm’s levels are structured as elaborate puzzle boxes that are consistently satisfying to solve, from disorientating switch-based mazes to confoundingly cryptic treasure hunts. In fact, in general the puzzles in Silent Hill f do an excellent job of momentarily sidelining combat for a more cerebral challenge, and also serving as crucial storytelling devices. Playing on the hard puzzle difficulty setting, I was regularly forced to pore over every scrap of information in Hinako’s journal for clues, and there are some really clever puzzle sequences to explore here, such as collecting scattered calendar pages in Hinako’s family home and then using them to jump through different time periods to hunt down the disturbing ghosts from her past. If the next Silent Hill focuses more on this sort of thing than on aggravating combat, it will really be onto something. </p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-f-review]]></content:encoded>

<p>Released in 1987, Zelda II is often cited as one of the most divisive entries in the series thanks to its side-scrolling combat sections. It was a drastic shift away from the original game's approach, and Nintendo soon course-corrected with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/legend_of_zelda_a_link_to_the_past">A Link to the Past</a> in 1991.</p>

			<p>Yes, people are very much still modding The Witcher III: Wild Hunt, even more so after CD Projekt RED <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-3-redkit-q-further-improvements-planned/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released</a> the REDkit mod tool last year. On the visual side, HalkHogan's <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-3-hd-reworked-project-nextgen-edition-is-finally-out-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Witcher 3 HD Reworked Project NextGen Edition</a> is pretty much a must, but even the experienced modder's latest release does not overhaul every single item in the big open world roleplaying game.</p>



<p>So, as is often the case, fellow modder kwest0rek stepped in to create '<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/11259?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Witcher III: Wild Hunt Remastered - NextGen</a>', which specifically targets 41 models that were untouched by HalkHogan's work, replacing them with completely new ones that also feature higher resolution textures. Here's a list of what's been retouched so far:</p>



<ul>
<li>Apple (whole, bitten, and piles of apples)</li>



<li>Loaf of bread</li>



<li>Cabbage (fresh and rotten)</li>



<li>New fruits (green and red grapes, watermelon)</li>



<li>Various herb bags and a jug of herbs (open and closed)</li>



<li>Meats and dishes (bone with leftover meat, baked pig, roasted chicken)</li>



<li>New types of bread (round loaf, baguette)</li>



<li>Various vegetables (carrots, garlic, whole and half onions, potatoes, pumpkin)</li>



<li>Decorative and utility items (metal mug, wooden cup, ceiling wine rack)</li>



<li>Large pile of garlic</li>



<li>Small pile of garlic</li>



<li>Oranges</li>



<li>Large pile of potatoes</li>
</ul>



<p>As you can see below, the improvement is rather noticeable. </p>



<figure></figure>



<figure></figure>



<p>In the comments section of the mod page, the modder said they'd focus on finishing the food models and then move on to remake models of dead NPCs and animals, which could also use some upgrading in The Witcher III: Wild Hunt, even in the Next-Gen Edition.</p>



<p>In other The Witcher news, CD Projekt RED recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-take-some-cues-sapkowski-latest-book/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hinted</a> that the highly anticipated fourth mainline installment will take some cues from author Andrzej Sapkowski's latest novel, Crossroads of Ravens, which has just launched in its English translation. Meanwhile, the fourth season of the Netflix adaptation <a href="https://wccftech.com/netflix-the-witcher-season-4-liam-hemsworth/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will start airing in October</a>.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/22/silent-hill-f-review/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/silent-hill-f-review-%E2%80%93-flawless-fear.1304061/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Last year, Konami took a big risk with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/14/silent-hill-2-2024-review/">Silent Hill 2</a>. Not only were they remaking the most beloved game in the franchise, they handed the reins over to Bloober Team, entrusting them with their biggest game to date. That risk paid off, and Silent Hill 2 was a massive success. But where next for this beloved horror franchise? There hadn’t been a new mainline game in many years, and the last two were… well… questionable. Cue Silent Hill f.</p>
<p><iframe title="Silent Hill f - Story Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KWKLv3osnsA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Silent Hill f’s announcement left fans with a lot of questions about its direction. Konami stepped away from the Western setting, embracing Japanese Horror, setting the game in the 1960s, and jumping from Silent Hill to the fictional town of Ebisugaoka.</p>


<p>You take on the role of Hinako Shimizu, a high school student who takes a stroll into town to meet her friends. When she arrives, in typical Silent Hill fashion, everything is not as it seems, a mysterious fog descends upon her friends group, covering the immediate area with beautifully grotesque flora which consumes anything it touches. After Hinako escapes, she realises everyone has disappeared, and proceeds to try and track down her friends and find out what the hell is going on.</p>
<p>Silent Hill 2 remains the benchmark for this series, and Silent Hill f seems to have gone back to its style of storytelling,&nbsp;giving us a tale that slowly unfolds over the course of the game, introducing new details and keeping us guessing right till the very end. It helps that they got Ryukishi07 (of Higurashi When They Cry fame) onboard to write the story, and his DNA is definitely present here.</p>


<p>A lot of the fun is in discovering what’s actually happening to Hinako, although the game does thematically lean towards making your own choices and being your own person. The messaging is powerful, and like Silent Hill 2, will have you emotionally charged throughout. There are a couple of symbolic scenes in the game that had my jaw on the floor, and when I fully understood what those scenes meant, left me feeling morose, and needing time to contemplate what I had just seen. There’s some really powerful imagery that, while initially a little confusing, has more meaning as you discover the secrets of each character.</p>
<p>It leads to a prescribed ending on your first playthrough that, in all honest, doesn’t feel like a great outcome for our protagonist, though you will realise that certain actions have had an impact on the outcome. My mind was blown and I was taken back to Silent Hill 2, and how what you do on your playthrough affects the kind of ending you get. Yes, this is just what I wanted. The game then gives you clear guidelines for what you need to do to see the other endings, so you can reach a better outcome for our heroine.</p>
<p>Now, what <em>really</em> got me, was that New Game+ brought new cutscenes and lore to be discovered, adding proper flavour to what we knew already, in some cases, adding slightly new mechanics as well. I felt like I was playing a new game, and seeing things through a new lens, which I think is the point.</p>

<p>Silent Hill f feels like a traditional Silent Hill experience, going back to the classic third-person view of the original games, instead of the tighter over-the-shoulder style made popular by Resident Evil 4. The action introduces something a little new in the form of dodges and counters, which I quickly fell in love with it. When the horrible beasties come at you, some of their attacks will have a momentary pause, outlining them in a shimmer. Attacking during this time will net you a power blow, sending them reeling and, in some cases, stunning the monster. If you’re quick enough, you can always dodge the attack, with a perfect dodge completely refilling your stamina bar. You can’t just go swinging wildly and hoping for the best; running out of stamina is dangerous, leaving you incapable of attacking or running away.</p>
<p>Along with the stamina bar is the sanity meter, which comes into play when you do focus attacks or when the enemies psychologically attack you. The sanity meter will drain but when the focus meter is full, you can unleash a devastating attack on enemies. If you are interrupted while doing this, it will reduce your max sanity until you can refill it with items. While it’s a great tool for dealing damage, having no sanity means any psychological attacks on you will drain your health, so play around with it carefully.</p>

<p>Of course, you’ll be defending yourself with the many weapons you’ll find lying around. You can carry up to three weapons and they will break after too much use, so you either need to find more or use a repair kit. I’m not normally a fan of weapon degradation, but Silent Hill f strikes a nice balance to make it less of a chore.</p>
<p>You can also upgrade your stats, increasing things like sanity, health, stamina by way of Faith, a currency earned by making offerings at the Hokora save points. Some items you pick up just give big Faith bonuses, but you can trade some health items in as well. You can also increase the amount of Omamori slots you have, equipping these charms to give various bonuses, such as decreased charge time for focus attacks, or just flat stat increases. It would normally feel out of place in a Silent Hill game, but it felt natural here. Thankfully, these upgrades accumulate across multiple playthroughs as it’s impossible to do it all in one run.</p>
<p>There’s a nice variety of enemies on offer, each one terrifying to look at and erratic to fight. The symbolism in enemies has seemingly returned in Silent Hill f, with each creature having a detailed explanation in Hinako’s journal. This is one of the best inclusions because it doesn’t feel like some tacked-on menu item, but more of a look inside Hinako’s mind. As you discover things in game, Hinako will write about it in her book, drawing pictures to supplement the words on paper. It’s really neat and gives you an idea about not only what some of these monsters mean, but also her thought process and logic when it comes to puzzles and local lore.</p>
<p>And you want to read everything. Taking a leaf out of Soulsborne games, there’s a lot to be discovered in the written word of others and Hinako’s journal, so I made sure I searched every nook and cranny to find every piece of obscure information that might help unravel the mystery.</p>

<p>In traditional Silent Hill fashion, there’s an abundance of puzzles to solve, ranging from easy logic to difficult brain destroyers. One puzzle you come across later requires using a cipher to work out code, which my tired brain couldn’t quite figure out. Of course I got it in the end but, for I thought that was me done for a moment! What didn’t help, is that I’d missed a random note, which had another part of the cipher, reinforcing the fact that you want to search everywhere. Credit to the team for actually making the puzzles a challenge.</p>
<p>Design wise, Silent Hill f is absolutely stunning. Even running the game on a lower setting, I was still blown away with how gorgeous it looks. The visuals are beautiful yet terrifying. You want to see everything yet it’s haunting and unsettling. The details on characters’ faces are also very impressive, with each character’s emotions unquestionably represented in Unreal Engine 5. NeoBards really did a sterling job.</p>
<p>The music was composed by series’ veteran Akira Yamaoka and Kensuke Inage who is known for his work on games such as Tekken 8 and Samurai Showdown. Yamaoka’s eerily subtle work can be heard in the Fog World, while Inage provides the sounds for the Otherworld – two contrasting tones, masterfully provided by two titans in the industry. The soundtrack is just perfection and provides added tension to already tense situations, but also serenity when needed.</p>

<p>In past games, there has always been a massive distinction between The Fog World and the Otherworld, and one of the most interesting things about Silent Hill f is just how different those two worlds are. In previous games, Otherworlds are generally grotesque versions of the real world, but this game takes you somewhere completely different. It actually makes a lot of sense from a story perspective, and I can’t wait to see players crack open the symbolic meaning behind all of it.</p>
<p>The core questions the game leaves us with is who are you really? Should you submit to the will of another? Abandon everything you know and love? It’s these mysteries and more that keep me wanting to play Silent Hill f over and over again, because like Silent Hill 2, there’s a lot to unpack, and it’s incredibly well done.</p>

			<p>At a time when the horror genre was thriving, KONAMI’s continued neglect of the Silent Hill series was baffling. While Resident Evil reclaimed its place as one of the greatest survival-horror franchises with its <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/resident-evil-7-survival-horror-king/">seventh entry</a> and successful <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/resident-evil-2-remake/">remakes</a>, and new IPs blossomed, one of the genre’s cornerstones remained dormant. With KONAMI showing little interest in reviving its legacy franchises, it often felt like we’d never return to that fog-shrouded town. Thankfully, that wasn’t the case: last year, Bloober Team’s excellent <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-2-restless-dreams-town/">Silent Hill 2 remake</a> brought the series back to life.</p>



<p>Besides remaking older entries in the series, KONAMI's plans regarding Silent Hill's revival include the development of new games, and the first one of these new games to launch is Silent Hill f, a survival-horror game that sets itself apart from the rest of the series with its setting, choice of main character, and gameplay features. However, don't let these fool you. Silent Hill f is unmistakably a Silent Hill game through and through, one that balances new features with a very familiar framework to deliver not only a great survival horror experience, but also one of the best in the series to date.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Ebisugaoka is not Silent Hill, but the resemblance is often uncanny.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Set in a small rural Japanese town called Ebisugaoka in the 60s, Silent Hill stars Hinako Shimizu, a young schoolgirl with more than a few troubles fitting into a society that wants her silent, obedient, and complacent. After another heated argument with her parents - her father a drunkard, her mother unable to stand up for herself - Hinako storms out of her home. But right from her first step outside, it's clear that something is terribly amiss. Fog has enveloped the town, and its inhabitants seem to have shut themselves inside their homes, giving the rural village a haunting beauty. After meeting her friend Shu, whom she calls partner, Sakuko, the daughter of the local temple keepers, and Rinko, who clearly harbors feelings for Shu, Hinako realizes her uneasiness is more than justified. A monster born out of the fog attacks the group, forcing them apart, and starting a chain of events that will force Hinako on a journey through all sorts of horrors with some unpredictable consequences.</p>



<p>Written by Ryukishi07, known for the Higurashi and Umineko visual novels, Silent Hill f's story fully delivers on pretty much every front, featuring an engaging dual narrative centered on Hinako, a sort of twisted coming-of-age holding some terrible secrets based on a ritual held in a mysterious temple located in the Otheworld, the dark alternate dimension that debuted with the series back in 1999, where Hinako is guided by yet polite young man wearing a fox mask that provides ample opportunities for some haunting and very disturbing sequences, and for some twisted character development in true series fashion. Saying precisely why the story delivers so much would be going into heavy spoiler territory, but you can rest assured that there are plenty of times when it is difficult to even look at the screen due to some extremely disturbing events, which hold strong symbolic significance that, while a little on the nose, are highly effective. Some unexpected twists, which are properly foreshadowed before their reveal, also contribute to making the experience memorable</p>



<p>Much of the quality of the Silent Hill f story also depends on how it is narrated. Besides regular cutscenes, which use some cinematic camera cuts and Unreal Engine 5's Lumen for greater impact, the game also embraces environmental narration via documents scattered all over Ebisugaoka and some environmental elements that do tell a story if the player is ready to listen. Representing isolation with a lone school desk inside a bigger classroom may be a little too obvious, but it adds a certain depth to the narration and the game as a whole, bridging the disconnect that is too often found in certain games between narrative and gameplay, giving meaning to elements that only look decorative at a glance. A player journal deepens immersion further, offering insights into Hinako’s perceptions of the people closest to her - including her absent sister Junko, whose departure after marriage left a lasting wound - and revealing stark differences between how Hinako sees herself and how others see her.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>The mysterious young man wearing a fox mask is one of the central characters in Silent Hill f</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>While the Silent Hill f story sets the new entry in the series apart from every other game that came before it, the gameplay is possibly an even bigger divergence, but mainly only regarding combat. Regarding traversal and puzzle solving, Silent Hill f is as much an entry in the series as the first two Silent Hill games are, featuring multiple locations with complex designs to explore with the aid of a map, an abundance of locked or blocked doors, plenty of puzzles to complete of varying difficulty, and resources to collect, including the ever important restorative items. The puzzles, in particular, are excellent, and at Hard puzzle difficulty, they really put the player's skills to the test without being overly complicated, though there's a specific puzzle-heavy sequence at the halfway point of the game that feels a little frustrating and impacts an otherwise excellent pacing, which masterfully balances story, traversal, and combat. Thankfully, powering through this sequence is rather rewarding, thanks to the events that take place right after it, which represent one of the highlights of the experience, with some haunting and disturbing sequences that are very hard to forget.</p>



<p>Although different types of restorative items have become the norm in survival horror games, in Silent Hill f they are some of the elements that better represent the bigger divergence the game takes from the established formula. Besides items that restore Hinako's health, you will find items that restore her Stamina and Sanity, two values that power some of the game's core combat mechanics. Unlike other entries in the series, Silent Hill doesn't feature any firearms, and Hinako has to rely on the makeshift weapons she can find all around Ebisugaoka - steel pipes, kitchen knives, sledgehammers, axes, and so on. To preserve the resource management mechanics so central to a survival horror experience, every weapon in the game, with only a few noteworthy exceptions, has a limited durability that can only be partially restored using rare repair kits. As such, you will still have to pick your fights and preserve your most powerful weapons for the forced combat encounters, of which the game has quite a few.</p>



<p>Due to the inclusion of a Stamina gauge, Silent Hill f was <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-f-producer-game-is-not-a-soulslike/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">likened to a soulslike game before release</a>, but the first couple of fights against some rather disturbing doll-like enemies with some great animations show how the similarities are limited to the ability to use light and heavy attacks and a rather effective dodge maneuver, which becomes a Stamina-restoring perfect dodge when timed correctly. These simple action combat mechanics are elevated by the inclusion of a Focus mode powered by the Sanity gauge, which allows Hinako to charge a powerful Focus attack that can briefly stun enemies and slow down time when the enemy is about to launch an attack that can be countered with a Heavy Attack.</p>



<p>Though undoubtedly more mechanically rich than your typical survival-horror combat system, Silent Hill's combat is never truly the focus, as all these mechanics are deeply rooted in the resource management principle at the core of a survival horror experience. Stamina, for example, depletes very quickly, and using all of it up will leave Hinako pretty much defenseless for a few seconds, which is a huge problem at hard combat difficult where enemies hit rather hard; similarly, using all Sanity not only disables Focus mode, but may also cause Hinako to receive additional damage when under psychological stress, something that happens quite often during the game. And while her stats and capabilities can be enhanced by finding empty Ema and spending Faith points at shrines and equipping the Omamori accessories for passive skills, there's never a situation where these mechanics make the schoolgirl capable of easily taking on every enemy without suffering any consequence. </p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Silent Hill f combat system is the game's most significant divergence from the rest of the series.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Striking a balance between more involving combat and retaining that sense of fear and helplessness is very difficult to achieve, but I feel developer NeoBards Entertainment managed to do so in the best way possible, even though it is undeniable that the execution is not always perfect, like with the dodge mechanic, which is, maybe, a little too effective for a survival horror game. The other aspect of the combat system, which sparked the most discussion pre-release, is the excessive reliance on hitstop and the supposed lack of enemy reactions to attacks. On the other hand, this is not as problematic as it looks in promotional footage. While it is true that enemies do not react to light attacks, the game provides a lot of options to stagger enemies, like heavy attacks, Focus attacks and counter attacks, the latter possible even without using Focus mode.</p>



<p>With so many options at Hinako's disposal, enemy design had to take this into account, and thankfully, it does so in a consistent way. Although enemy variety isn't big, there are enough enemies to keep things fresh for the duration of the first playthrough, ranging from the aforementioned doll-like enemies to more deformed monsters who all come with a few attack patterns and unique quirks that players need to memorize to take full advantage of the many combat mechanics the game offers. For example, there's a hulking enemy carrying a giant knife in its right arm that blocks any attack coming from Hinako's left, which forces correct positioning together with proper timing of offense and defense. Though few, there are also boss battles built around unique mechanics that are quite effective. As such, enemy design holds up for a single playthrough, which shouldn't be longer than 12 hours for most players. While this definitely is on the short side, the game sports great replayability with a meaningful New Game Plus and multiple endings, so there's still a lot to be discovered, including answers to some questions left unanswered during the first playthrough, after the credits roll for the first time.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Though different, Silent Hill f's combat system works surprisingly well with the rest of the game.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Before its release, Silent Hill f made a few heads turn for possibly being one of the <span>few games powered by Unreal Engine 5 that wouldn't be impacted by some of the engine's&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-f-unreal-engine-5-stuttering-smooth/" target="_blank">known issues</a>, such as visual noise and stuttering</span>. Regarding the first, that is indeed the case. The new entry in the series looks extremely clean, with great texture work that greatly enhances the traditional Japanese rural feel of Ebisugaoka and its surroundings, and the wise usage of volumetrics and Lumen greatly enhances the series' typical haunting atmosphere. Though far from being the best we have seen in the past few years, character models are also detailed and generally well done, and look quite believable thanks to generally solid animation work, especially for some enemies. Audio production also dramatically enhances the experience with great usage of haunting environmental sounds, and some great music pieces, some created by the series's longtime composer, Akira Yamaoka.</p>



<p>Regarding performance, however, on PC, that's not entirely the case, although the situation is far better than in most other UE5 games. The few minutes of loading that happen the first time the game is launched suggest the game has a shader pre-compilation step, which definitely helps, as I haven't experienced shader stuttering in my time with the game outside of a single significant late-game instance which may have been caused by something else. However, traversal stuttering and some microstuttering issues are present, mostly in the main village area. These stuttering issues are not terribly aggravating, but they are easily noticeable, and they do have an impact, minimal as they may be, on an experience meant to be immersive.</p>

</figure>



<p>Aside from these stuttering issues, which are thankfully limited to a small number of areas, Silent Hill f seems to be optimized well. At 4K resolution with NVIDIA DLSS in Quality mode and the settings above, the game ran at an average of 116 FPS, 59 1% Low on my system (i7-13700F, RTX 4080, 32 GB RAM) in a benchmarking session held in Ebisugaoka at the start of the game, right after the first attack of one of the Fog Monsters, which are, all around, pretty decent results, considering the performance cost Lumen generally has. With the game running as expected on my system, tweaking the settings, especially the lighting setting, the rendering resolution, and the upscaler setting (TSR and FSR are available besides DLSS) should be more than enough for most users with a relatively modern machine to run the game smoothly.</p>



<p>With an engaging story full of haunting, disturbing sequences, a finely tuned balance of everything that makes survival horror great, and combat deeply rooted in resource management, Silent Hill f is a triumphant return for the series after its long hiatus. Its short length and minor PC performance issues may disappoint some, but no fan of the franchise, or the genre, should miss one of the best survival horror releases in years.</p>

			<p>Team Cherry's Hollow Knight: Silksong is a smashing success, as evidenced by the overwhelmingly positive reviews and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-5-million-audience-overlaps-soulslike/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">estimated five million players across all platforms</a>. With that said, there is one thing that the game lacks: multiplayer of any kind.</p>



<p>However, a <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/hollowknightsilksong/mods/90?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mod</a> now seeks to rectify that, at least on PC. Created by XvX, it aims to support basic Player versus Player online multiplayer fights. In the embedded video, we can see that it supports up to 30 players, though such a large number of players inevitably makes it very chaotic. The mod actually also enables co-op, but only for a single boss, Fourth Chorus, which has been modified to receive synchronized damage from all the players. Over time, the goal is to provide a full co-op experience as well.</p>

<p>If you're interested in trying this Hollow Knight: Silksong mod (which only works with the Steam version, at least for now), follow the creator's instructions that we have reported below.</p>



<ol>
<li><em>Unzip to the root directory (don't just dump the folder in with it).</em></li>



<li><em>Once all players have into the main interface, the host clicks "Create Room(创建房间)" and then "Invite Players(邀请玩家)"</em></li>



<li><em>After everyone agrees to the game invitation, enter the game.</em></li>



<li><em>This only works with the official Steam version. </em></li>



<li><em>The PvP configuration file is located in: Hollow Knight Silksong\BepInEx\config\com.XvX.cfg</em></li>
</ol>



<p><em>Version 0.7.1 Warning: This version is of uncertain stability and is for testing purposes only.<br>In order to synchronize Fourth Chorus with this version, all players' save files must not have defeated Fourth Chorus. Everyone except the host must activate the boss first, then the host can activate it. The host's death will cause the boss to become uncontrollable. It is recommended that the host install a cheat. After others have revived, please do not return to the boss scene, as this may cause problems.</em></p>



<p>This is but one of several PC mods created for Hollow Knight: Silksong in the few weeks since its debut. There's the <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-breaks-players-peak-gets-luma-hdr-mod/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Luma HDR mod</a>, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-relaxed-mode-improvements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Relaxed Mode mod</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-mods-enjoyable-challenge/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">others</a> that introduce various quality of life tweaks.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Even suffused in otherworldly fog, <em>Silent Hill F</em>’s picturesque period setting gleams with authenticity. Traditional hardwood buildings line narrow alleyways, while babbling brooks and small footpaths crisscross soaking paddy fields. The ephemera of 1960s everyday life is everywhere: glossy magazines, vintage toasters, exquisite flower arrangements. Yet beyond this moody sense of place, the details that feel most authentic in <em>Silent Hill F</em> are of a kind that video games rarely excel at. It’s the anxiety on the faces of its teen characters as they trade barbed taunts, the outpourings of emotion scribbled onto notes passed around at school.</p><p>We see this finely drawn, and frequently painful, world through the eyes of high school student Hinako Shimizu. She is a “tough girl,” according to her friends. Quickly enough, the series’ iconic mist descends and Hinako is forced to make use of her athletic streak, vaulting over obstacles to flee the malignant haze. She picks up pipes and bludgeons skittering, long-legged monsters; she finds arcane keys to unlock ominously decorated doors. We are yet again exploring a town twisted into grotesquely personal shapes by the intense emotions of our protagonist. The classic ingredients of <em>Silent Hill</em> return, yet there is newfound freshness and vitality here.</p><p>Partly, this is down to ravishing visuals: verging on photorealism yet painterly in their eerie prettiness. Light diffuses naturally down every cold and brooding street, bouncing off Hinako’s prim-and-proper bob and buttoned-up uniform. A carpet of red spider lilies frequently unfurls across the fictional mountain village of Ebisugaoka, transforming the setting into a kind of eco-horror hallucination. In an otherwise artfully desaturated palette, the plants are a vivid, violent interruption.</p><p>Moreover, <em>Silent Hill F</em> feels revitalized thanks to a story penned by renowned Japanese manga author Ryukishi07. Hinako is at a pivotal moment in her life, still at school yet on the cusp of an arranged marriage by her abusive, alcoholic father. She is tormented by social anxieties: the gossiping of friends and absence of her older sister. This plot is revealed patiently through cutscenes and scattered letters. It’s typical video game storytelling, but <em>Silent Hill F</em> offers a beguiling marriage of game space and narrative. The town of Ebisugaoka opens up alongside the mysteries; the streets seem to double back on themselves like this tricksy story.</p><p>You discover further tantalizing tidbits: details about arsenic pollution, toxic gas leaks, and the building of a massive dam. Are these central to the monstrous manifestations Hinako must endure or merely red herrings? I’m still not sure, even having rolled credits around hour 10.</p><p>Think of <em>Silent Hill F</em> as survival horror meets <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/apr/27/honkaku-a-century-of-the-japanese-whodunnits-keeping-readers-guessing">the honkaku mystery fiction of Japan</a>, one whose story continues to be illuminated with each subsequent playthrough (all told through five possible endings). While wandering through creepy woods during my first session, I came across a giant, sacred tree. But I couldn’t interact with it. The tree remained an enigma until I started the game anew, quickly discovering a new puzzle which seemed to center it. More details and cutscenes arrive in subsequent playthroughs (and there is even a feature that distinguishes new cutscenes from old so you can hit the skip button).</p><p>The depth and nuance of the mystery is striking, but so is the lack of genuine scares. <em>Silent Hill F</em> is sinister, tense, melancholic, and, in a handful of scenes, wince-inducingly nasty. But scary? Not very. There’s nothing here that matches the terrifying abyssal descent into the bedrock below town in <em>Silent Hill 2</em>, <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=Z-jvrvNZ2mI&amp;feature=youtu.be"><em>that</em> staircase</a> that seemed to tunnel directly into James’ troubled subconscious. The closest <em>Silent Hill F</em> comes is Hinako’s family home. Doors and rooms multiply; corridors lengthen. The space — endlessly repeating until you complete all its puzzles — bristles with nightmarish logic.</p><p>The lack of frights stems mostly from a tilt toward action. Hinako lands critical hits, executes slo-mo dodges, and even wields a pole weapon with a curved blade called a naginata. She is no action hero at first, straining to lift weapons and sometimes flailing at thin air. But the teenager is committed. “Do not get in my way,” she says at one point, growing ever more assertive.</p><p>During bouts, Hinako consumes whatever remedies she can lay her hands on — kudzu tea, red pills, chocolate — and at shrines, which double as save spots, she can make sacrifices to the gods, thus upgrading her health, stamina, and even sanity. This journey, then, is a test of faith for the youngster who has one foot in tradition and another in modernity (a point reflected in the terrific score, which blends traditional Japanese folk music with ’60s psychedelia).</p><p>“The road twists and turns,” says Hinako in a moment of quiet reflection toward the end of the game. “It’s like I’m walking through my head.” The line is a clunky outlier in a script that typically has the smarts not to spell out its Freudian subtext. Still, the remark begs a question: what lurks in the darkest, most private recesses of Hinako’s mind? Through expressive level design, a deftly told story, and thrashing combat, we find a young woman locked into battle with societal expectations.</p><p><em>Silent Hill F</em> beautifully communicates her emotional arc, from vying desperately for survival to unleashing violent fury. Hinako doesn’t so much blossom as erupt. She becomes a mighty force of nature in her own right.</p><p><sub>Silent Hill F <em>launches on September 25th on the PS5, Xbox, and PC.</em></sub></p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/782012/silent-hill-f-review-ps5-xbox-steam#comments"><span>0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</span></a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6NTQzMA=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Lewis Gordon</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/782012/silent-hill-f-review-ps5-xbox-steam]]></content:encoded>
