            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/jackbox-naughty-pack-review-spicier-but-not-too-crass<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Another year and another <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="b0f7b9d1-a12c-4c8c-835f-34ef4ff66814" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/jackbox-party-pack-10-review-decade-of-brilliance"><em>Jackbox Party Pack</em></a>. This one, <em>The Jackbox Naughty Pack</em>, is a collection of three games specifically designed with an M-rating in mind. This means more crass jokes and more explicit sexual humor. How much does an M-rating really contribute to the tone of a game that is already filled with free-form comedy?</p>
<p><em>The Jackbox Naughty Pack</em> comes with three games, as opposed to the standard five games of a Party Pack. Two games are new editions of previously available titles, <em>Fakin' It All Night Long</em> and <em>Dirty Drawful</em>, and one game is a wholly new addition to the <em>Jackbox </em>stable of games, <em>Let Me Finish</em>.</p>
<p>Each game is intended for 3-8 players (though I don't think I'd ever recommend playing with three) and features using a browser-enabled device (Mobile phone, tablet, laptop, etc) as the controller letting you select prompts, draw silly images, and type in responses.</p>

So much of what makes these games enjoyable is the freedom of having your own screen.</p>
<h2><em>Fakin' It All Night Long</em></h2>
<p><em>Fakin' It All Night Long</em> is a social deduction game where you need to discover who among you is the Faker. Players are given tasks to complete, this might be to raise a number of fingers or point to a specific player, while the Faker is given a slightly different prompt or no prompt at all.</p>
<p>Players might be told to raise as many fingers as they need to unhook a bra, and if you look out across the room and see someone holding up a single finger it might seem suspicious. If the prompt is "Hold up as many fingers as the number of guaranteed booty calls in your phone" and a monogamous couple has a member hold up four fingers eyebrows may raise.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fakin-it-all-night-long-bush-is-back.jpg?itok=zAQzT9gh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fakin-it-all-night-long-bush-is-back.jpg?itok=y_X2vlg2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>How many fingers would you raise?</figcaption></figure><p>The aspect of <em>Fakin' It All Night Long, </em>as well as the original <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="2b4ae760-8c82-49a2-82d4-196d2e479e53" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/jackbox-party-pack-3-review-would-you-like-to-play-game"><em>Fakin' It,</em></a> that makes them my favorite series is that this is a <em>Jackbox </em>game where the game facilitates interactions with one another, and it's not just players all watching what's happening on the screen. The game facilitates prompts and conversations with the players but doesn't get in the way of itself.</p>
<p>A new gameplay mode has been added as one of the sub-categories of games. In this mode, you'll be given a prompt and you'll get to respond with a single emoji. A prompt like "What are you most afraid of" might elicit emoji of skulls to represent death, spiders, or other fears, but if someone posts a raccoon emoji then they might just be your Faker. This is a fun mode, created as internet games like recognizing TV shows and movies based on emoji flood social media.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fakin-it-all-night-emojis.jpg?itok=VlDYHelx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fakin-it-all-night-emojis.jpg?itok=EARpWZ75 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Playing a few rounds of this led to my group learning a lot about each other, for better or worse, and led to some rolling laughter when one person was so obviously the faker with how their responses didn't align with their personalities.</p>
<p>Compared to the original Fakin' It the major difference is just that the topics used end up being that much more personal. You'll definitely learn a lot about people with this game, make sure it's a closer group of friends that you decide to play this with.</p>
<h2><em>Dirty Drawful</em></h2>
<p><em>Dirty Drawful</em> is the least changed of the games in the <em>Jackbox Naughty Pack</em>. It's just like the <em>Drawful </em>you know but now there will be more mature prompts. Some of the prompts I saw across my early games were "Loose Pill Pinata", "Butter Knifed My Damn Dong Off", "European Peen Contemplates Life", or "Baby Working The Mines."</p>

<p>Players get prompted to draw one of these insane ideas, and then others will guess what they are. At the end, all of the fake prompts and the real prompt will get shuffled together and every player needs to guess which one they believe is correct.</p>
<p>The biggest effect that these wilder prompts had on the game was that when a player posted something truly unhinged as one of their guesses there was less reason to doubt it was incorrect. In a normal game of <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="2220d1a6-c9b6-454f-96bb-292cc7ace7d4" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/drawful-2-review-you-dont-know-pablo"><em>Drawful </em></a>you can rule out anything that references genitals or lewd puns but you just can't do that here.</p>
<p>This is an easier game to share with friends who might enjoy sharing off-color jokes, but that you don't want to learn much more about them directly.</p>
<h2><em>Let Me Finish</em></h2>
<p><em>Let Me Finish</em> is the new game in the pack, where players are presented with a stock image and are asked to indicate something on it. You could be shown a series of screwdrivers and asked which one likes to be called daddy?</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/let-me-finish-house-public-hair.jpg?itok=--TtKHYE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/let-me-finish-house-public-hair.jpg?itok=KHDLLUuW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>While every player submits their feedback on the image and prompt it's two players that go head to head presenting their response. Players will have a set amount of time to make a case for their argument, here's where people can let their presentation skills and improv chops fly as they try to convince the other players.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In my conversation with <em>Let Me Finish</em> director Warren Arnold he actually shared that this game was originally called Where's the Butt? after the initial pitch was given of an image of a mailbox with the caption 'Where's the Butt?' prompting wildly different responses from those in the room.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once everyone has presented players will then vote on the best response. At this time other players can even jump in to tell the two players who presented, and whoever else might be around why they're wrong. I enjoyed this feature, but I could also definitely see a scenario where you're playing with someone who always wants their own thoughts heard might abuse it.</p>
<p><em>Let Me Finish</em> does an amazing job highlighting just how differently our minds all function. When presented with the exact same stimulus and criteria the places that we all go in our minds as humans is incredibly different.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/let-me-finish-appliance.jpg?itok=S2ZUV6rT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/let-me-finish-appliance.jpg?itok=e4GUNsm_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>With the aspect of presentation, a lot of the core humor was definitely reliant on those presenting, and how willing everyone was to die on the hill that they had made for themselves. If players are shy, or aren't likely to speak up for their own silly opinion then it might be a bit harder to get this game off the ground.</p>
<h2><em>Jackbox Naughty Pack</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>I was cautious going into this wondering just how well an R-Rated <em>Party Pack</em> would be but with the direct influence of spicier prompts leading to spicier jokes, and the indirect influence of crazier player responses fitting into the theme it's unmistakable that Jackbox Games has absolutely stuck the landing.</p>
<p><em>Fakin' It All Night Long</em> continues to be an incredible way to play a deduction party game against your friends where everyone gets to be a part of the action. <em>Dirty Drawful</em> creates a creative outlet for players to not only draw unhinged creations but also respond to them. <em>Let Me Finish</em> gives players a platform to offer their unrequested opinions on silly ideas and have a way to let out some antagonism in the spirit of good fun.</p>
<p>This might not be the <em>Party Pack</em> to play with your family at <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="f0e3124d-2375-4674-91c2-64f67638d635" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/best-new-board-games-to-play-with-family-this-thanksgiving">Thanksgiving</a>, but it's definitely one to share with your group chat.</p>

These new instanced scenarios, known as Delves, can be quite lucrative if you know how they function and where to look for the best loot after completion. With the help of a seasonal NPC, we can take on several scenarios that give us loot at the end of each Delve, and the end of the week, just as with Raids, Mythic dungeons, and PvP.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197209" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Boys Star Karen Fukuhara On Kimiko’s Character Arc, Karate, And More" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="319" data-playlist="197209,196923,196922" data-current="197209"><div><p>The Boys Star Karen Fukuhara On Kimiko’s Character Arc, Karate, And More</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197209/197209_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197209/197209_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197209/197209_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197209/197209_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22759.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>There are many moving parts to Delves and how they function, so let’s take a look at all you need to know to score big items each week.</p><h2 id="h2752"><a id=""></a><strong>How Delves Work in World of Warcraft</strong></h2><p>Delves function in a similar way to Mythics dungeons—the scenarios are static and do not change by the week, but there can be variations in the hazards that are seen as the underground dwellings are traversed. The objectives, bonuses, and bosses can also switch up on a dime, so we may not always have to run the Delve the same way each time to bag bonus rewards.</p><p>During the Main Story quest line, you’re introduced to Delves and run your first one in the Isle of Dorn. This main quest line shows you the ropes, teaches you how to make your NPC stronger or swap their role, and gives you the nitty gritty on what to expect as you make your way through the other Delves all around the map. There are also Delve Tiers, unlocked once your character has reached level 80.</p><p>One thing worth noting is that there are 11 Tiers total, but you will not have access to tier four or higher Delves until you have reached level 80, have a 548 item-level piece of armor in every slot, and complete the entire Campaign for <em>The War Within. </em>To unlock Tiers higher than four, you will need to complete the previous Tier in its entirety—completing Tier four opens up Tier five, completing Tier five opens up Tier six, etc.</p><h2 id="h2753"><a id=""></a><strong>Delve Rewards And The Great Vault</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="c218a39e5e871176d0e00155bac8b8c7" data-recommend-id="image://c218a39e5e871176d0e00155bac8b8c7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Meeting with a Delve Guide." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Meeting with a Delve Guide." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blizzard / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c218a39e5e871176d0e00155bac8b8c7" data-recommend-id="image://c218a39e5e871176d0e00155bac8b8c7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Meeting with a Delve Guide." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Delves are a great way to score some hefty loot solo, but of course also works well with a party if you would rather bring a few friends. Some rewards can only be earned via achievements by completing multiple Delves, including the mounts Delver’s Dirigible and  the Ivory Goliathus. At the end of each Delve, you will come upon a Treasure room that has trunks containing gear specifically for your class and level, as well as quest items, Resonance Crystals, Undercoins, cosmetics, Companion Upgrades, and more.</p><p>The higher Tier the Delve, the better rewards you can get your hands on, but Tier 11 is just there to boast about to your friends and gain achievements from. There’s also a weekly World Event known as the Delves Bonus Event, that gives better rewards for completing Delves that week.</p><p>As for the Great Vault, <em>The War Within </em>replaces the PvP line in the vault with the World option. Just as with Mythics or Raids, you will need to complete three, six, or 12 Delves to unlock all of the available loot within the Great Vault. The quality and Item Level of the gear within the Great Vault will depend on the difficulty of the Delves completed.</p><p>Delves are a great way to bolster your loot intake in <em>The War Within</em>, and completing weekly events and unlocking slots in the Great Vault can get you some gear equivalent to Heroic Raid gear and Mythic 15+ quality.</p><hr><p>For more information on what’s new in <em>The War Within</em>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/world-of-warcraft-war-within-hero-talents-guide-1851645954&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/world-of-warcraft-war-within-hero-talents-guide-1851645954">check out our guide to the new Talent Tree</a></span>, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/world-of-warcraft-the-war-within-warband-system-guide-1851631239&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/world-of-warcraft-the-war-within-warband-system-guide-1851631239">the Warband System</a></span> to see how you can trade your newly acquired gear to Alt characters to make even more progress!<br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Given the significance of the UK in gaming development it is surprising how rare games set here are. Even those that do exist tend to be either quaint backdrops like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2015/08/12/everybodys-gone-to-the-rapture-review/">Everybody’s Gone to the Rapture</a> or ‘ye olde’ period pieces like Chivalry. Hollowbody breaks this trend by being set in a future dystopian version of an abandoned British city; taking this uncannily familiar location and using it to produce a love letter to classic survival horror. The resulting title is up there with the very best of indie survival horror games and feels like a lost classic from the PS2 era.</p>
<p><iframe title="Hollowbody  - Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M9vRLnwYO14?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>I’ve been following the development of Hollowbody for a couple of years and developer Headware Games has done a great job in chronicling the process of indie game production through their social media presence. I get a real kick out of this kind of information and seeing a game develop from early prototype through pre-release demos and finally the finished build is always a joy. From the very beginning Hollowbody has had a clear vision and a distinctive aesthetic and this has ensured that the final game is successful, both as its own thing and as homage to past greats.</p>


<p>The futuristic setting of Hollowbody feels like a banal Blade Runner – Edge Jogger, maybe? – complete with flying cars and neon skies. Everything feels like the future except, of course, for the exclusion zone, the site of a mysterious outbreak that left a twenty mile area sealed off for the wider population’s protection. The only people to venture into the exclusion area are never heard from again. Until, that is, your partner Sasha heads in to find out what happened and you have to go in to find her. The background takes in equal parts Resident Evil, Contagion, and Escape from New York and immediately established a clear narrative and emotional reason for Mica risking her life and I appreciated the generally understated but drip-fed nature of the story-telling here. No lengthy expositions or overloading but instead notes and uncanny radio interference combine to offer suggestions but not solutions as to what happened.</p>


<p>Visually, Hollowbody is superb. The PS2 era design looks fantastic, especially as you can up the resolution if you wish to achieve the kind of result that is normally only possible when upscaling PS2 titles via emulation. The world-building is similarly great and the early environments you explore felt eerily familiar but with a dark and deadly twist. Sound design is also a highpoint here as the atmospheric audio ensures that you are always on edge and occasional stabs of music at key events jar you into action. The full voice acting is totally off brand with the genre classics though, as it is actually excellent throughout and often gives a real emotional hit.</p>
<p>Streamlining the classic survival horror form, Hollowbody retains the mechanics and feel of the genre, but finetunes some aspects to avoid the usual frustration points. Rather than the limited inventory that is so ubiquitous in the genre (and which affected <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/11/04/signalis-review/">Signalis</a> to such a degree) here you can pick up everything you need and carry it with you. That being said, there is less to collect than in other games as the focus is on exploration and occasional puzzles, rather than overly intricate escape rooms.</p>

<p>Juggling weaponry is less of an issue than normal as you can equip one melee weapon and one firearm and can switch between them through shortcuts similar to those found in third person action combat games. Early on you’ll rely on a pistol and a plank with nails in it, but more powerful weapons are scattered around for you to find. In fact, some firearms are hinted at in the achievements but I didn’t find them in my first playthrough, suggesting areas I missed.</p>
<p>The opening stages of the game take place in the tower block that was featured in the demos, and I initially thought the whole game would involve making my way up to its heights. Fortunately the range of environments is much greater than this. You’ll find yourself exploring the residential areas more generally, a churchyard, and underground areas before you reach the end of the game.</p>

<p>One area with less variety, however, is the enemies you face. Whilst there are the stalwarts of lumbering zombies, horrifying dogs, and the occasional larger foe, the focus is clearly less on these than the narrative and world-building. Combat itself is solid and there is the expected risk and reward in terms of taking on foes or evading them whilst managing limited ammo. Indeed there are very few unavoidable enemies throughout, with only a few set piece moments forcing you to fight.</p>
<p>Puzzles are well designed, but not as constant as in some titles in the genre. The tower block in particular had quite a lot of rooms that had no gameplay purpose, but did add to the feel of dread and tragedy that pervades the game. One general tip for new players is to make sure that you examine and read the descriptions of items in your inventory as an early puzzle took me far too long to solve, as I hadn’t made the lateral connection to an item I was carrying all along. I would also recommend having a paper and pen on hand as there are a couple of moments where you need to collect information, and it is generally useful to make a note of puzzles you haven’t yet solved.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Hollowbody does a great job of capturing the mood and feel of survival horror classics whilst removing some of the genre’s more annoying aspects and sits at the very top of the indie horror tree alongside the likes of Crow Country and Signalis.	</p></div>

			<p>Today, Inflexion Games released a new game overview trailer showcasing the Nightingale: Realms Rebuilt update for the gaslamp-fantasy PVE survival-crafting game. So far, Realms Rebuilt is the biggest update for Nightingale since its release in February 2024. Although the "all reviews" section for the game is tagged as Mixed, recent reviews are Mostly Positive, suggesting good things for those who have begun experimenting with the Realms Rebuilt update.</p>
<p><iframe title="Nightingale: Realms Rebuilt Update 0.5 - Gameplay Overview" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-k91qf7lSEU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Nightingale: Realms Rebuilt update adds a new handcrafted campaign that sends players exploring gravity-torn deserts, corrupted forests and much more, as well as overhauling the crafting and progression system after listening to player feedback. To add more excitement to the game, new dungeons and boss battles have been added, as well as new weapons for players to experiment with and new challenges to overcome.</p>
<p>With the release of this update, Nightingale is currently 40% off on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1928980/Nightingale/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> and the Epic Games Store. The game is still in Early Access on PC, suggesting there is plenty more to come to make Nightingale a fully-fledged product.</p>
<p>"The Realms Rebuilt update is the culmination of all the invaluable feedback we've received from the community over the last several months of Early Access," says Aaryn Flynn, CEO of <a href="https://wccftech.com/nightingale-director-isnt-worried-about-saturation-survival-is-having-a-moment-and-its-great-for-everyone/">Inflexion Games.</a> "We hope that it feels like a whole new Nightingale journey, improved and more immersive, whilst retaining the core elements that the community loves about adventuring through the realms."</p>
<p>To give the game more substance, the Nightingale: Realms Rebuilt update includes a new parametric crafting system so that players can maximize the potential of their equipment, new dungeons and bosses so that players can test and experiment with their Realmwalker skills, as well as an expansive campaign. As explained above, the campaign takes players on a journey to reignite the Crossways to try and unlock the path back to humanity.</p>
<p>For those who haven't seen this game, Nightingale is a PvE survival-crafting game where players have to discover, explore and survive in the Faewilds while working to overcome peculiar challenges set in a Victorian gaslamp fantasy world. The game allows players to play the game solo or team up with friends, allowing for a composition of up to five people. To explore new Realms, players will have to craft Realm Cards, as well as build their own estates to be able to survive in the aggressive world of Nightingale: Realms Rebuilt.</p>

That’s because in the late hours of the night, with a few drinks in everybody, there isn’t anything quite as fun as gathering around the TV and cracking stupid jokes facilitated via the series’ hilarious collection of minigames. Much of that comes down to the <em>Jackbox Party Pack</em>’s ease of use.</p><p>For the uninitiated, <em>Jackbox </em>utilizes the most common device in existence today—our phones. While one person is required to own each pack on a console or PC, which is how you host games, the other players connect and play through their phones. It’s remarkably simple, and makes the mess of collecting enough controllers for a game of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/super-mario-party-the-kotaku-review-1829480351&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/super-mario-party-the-kotaku-review-1829480351"><em>Mario Party</em></a></span> or a match of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/halo-infinite-the-kotaku-review-1848159022&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/halo-infinite-the-kotaku-review-1848159022"><em>Halo</em></a></span><em> </em>a non-issue. The time between someone suggesting that we start a game of <em>Jackbox </em>and actually playing a game is miniscule. And the variety of games on offer means that you never get bored.</p><p>With the release of the <em>Naughty Pack</em>, there are now 11 collections of minigames available for <em>Jackbox</em>. What each minigame has in common is the use of player input, by which I mean that they all revolve around players typing in words, drawing cartoons, or voting in polls to decide the winner. Because of this, every round of a given game is unique, playing up the inside jokes and particular interests of the people playing. For example, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/fibbage&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/fibbage"><em>Fibbage</em></a></span>—perhaps the quintessential <em>Jackbox </em>game—lets every player input a fake answer to a trivia prompt in the hopes of fooling their opponents. And sure, playing it that way can be fun, but it’s more fun to just turn these prompts into big jokes and vote on what is funniest. Playing to the group gets even more fun in <em>Fibbage: Enough About You</em>, which explicitly turns the game into a joke about the people playing.</p><p>If all of that sounds like the perfect recipe for a great party night you’d be right, and you’d be a fool to miss out on the current Steam sale, which ends on September 19. Every party pack is discounted, with some up to fifty percent off. If you just want to buy the whole package, it can be yours for $116.92, which might sound like a lot but is much lower than the usual $279.90 price tag. Trust me, it’s worth it for the hours of fun you and your friends will have. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

A lot of people, myself included, were excited about a potential follow-up that would remake <em>THPS3 </em>and <em>THPS4</em>. However, that never happened, even though Hawk says it was planned at one point. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-call-duty-activision-1851459426&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-call-duty-activision-1851459426">Activision reportedly was more interested in <em>Call of Duty</em></a></span> than skateboarding.

The disc-free system is more powerful than the PS5 and boasts impressive technical specs.

Many were left scratching their heads and wondering: <em>Who is this for?!</em></p><p>According to Circana analyst Mat Piscatella, the console is targeted at the "price-insensitive PlayStation ultra enthusiast." He told GameSpot that, for this audience, the price point is "not a significant barrier" and that the market for the PS5 Pro represents only a "very smell portion" of the total PlayStation fanbase.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> PS5 Pro Everything To Know</p>
      </div>
<p>The people who may be interested in purchasing a PS5 Pro are those who feel they "must have the latest and greatest PlayStation tech." Everyone knows someone who always buys the newest iPhone, after all. As Piscatella reminded us, plenty of people paid $1000+ for a base PS5 model in 2020 when the system came out through third-party sites due to shortages.</p><p>"And, according to Circana's Checkout service, PlayStation 5 already attracts the highest percentage of high-income household purchasers than other console platforms in the US," Piscatella said. "49% of PS5 hardware US buyers in the three-month period ending July 2024 had household incomes over $100k per year, as compared to 43% of Xbox Series buyers and 40% of Switch buyers."</p><p>Piscatella admitted the PS5 Pro price at $700 (and that's before tax and add-ons, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/where-to-buy-a-disc-drive-for-ps5-pro/1100-6526391/" data-ref-id="1100-6526391">like the $80 disc-drive</a>) is "expensive," but, again, it's not aimed at the everyday PlayStation player.</p><p>The analyst didn't have a firm prediction for the number of units the PS5 Pro could sell at launch, noting it would depend in part on the number of units available. That being said, Piscatella said he believes the PS5 Pro could make up 15%-20% of total PS5 consoles sold in the first two months after launch. That percentage should go down in the months after, he said.</p><p>Looking back at the PS4 Pro, Piscatella said the console made up about 13% of total lifetime PS4 unit sales and about 15% of lifetime PS4 dollar sales.</p><p>"I'm estimating PS5 Pro to finish the generation somewhere between 9-15% of total lifetime PS5 units, with a slightly higher percentage in dollars because of its higher price," he said.</p><p>$700 is a lot of money--there is no denying that, so Piscatella said he understands the "mixed" reaction online about the price tag in particular. But he pointed out that the reality of the video game market today demonstrates that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-could-prompt-a-shift-to-more-expensive-games/1100-6526121/" data-ref-id="1100-6526121">people will pay more</a>.</p><p>"The console market is stratifying in many ways. Some games have $249 Collector's Editions, games often offer a few days of early access so long as someone is willing to pay $99.99+ for that game. Premium gamepads and headsets are offered at premium price points... The list goes on," he said.</p><p>There was a time when only one version of a game, one version of a controller, or one version of a console existed--but those days are gone. "Companies are trying to maximize the dollars they can generate from both price-sensitive and price-insensitive consumers. This has been a bit of a painful transition for many console fans. I get it, but it's where we're at, and this trend is not going to slow anytime soon," Piscatella said.</p><p>Piscatella's commentary largely matches up with what Piers Harding-Rolls of Ampere Analysis said earlier this week in an <a href="https://www.ampereanalysis.com/insight/ps5-pro-sony-pulls-its-pro-strategy-lever-to-engage-playstation-enthusiasts" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">open letter.</a> He wrote that the PS5 Pro is aiming at the "enthusiast" audience, along with people who have yet to buy a PS5 at all and want to get the latest and best model.</p><p>Harding-Rolls, too, said he understands the "commentary" surrounding the PS5 Pro's hefty price tag, which is larger than the price gap between the PS4 and PS4 Pro when that system debuted in 2016.</p><p>"PS5 Pro pricing reflects Sony’s adjusted strategy to protect its margin, general supply chain inflation and a lack of direct competitor to its mid-cycle upgrade compared to last generation (where Microsoft was preparing the Xbox One X)," Harding-Rolls said. "The lack of competition means it is an easier decision for Sony to run with a higher price point to protect its existing margins. For most prospective PS5 consumers, the standard edition will represent the value sweet spot."</p><p>Harding-Rolls also talked about how he expects the launch of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">Grand Theft Auto VI in 2025</a> to "drive a wave of upgrades," with a portion of the audience eyeing the PS5 Pro to play the long-awaited Rockstar title. The analyst also went on record in forecasting PS5 Pro sales of 1.3 million units during the launch window, which is less than the 1.7 million PS4 Pro consoles sold at launch in 2016.</p><p>By 2029, the PS5 Pro could sell around 13 million units, Harding-Rolls, and this would put it in line with the <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/hard_soft/index.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Wii U, which achieved that many consoles sold during its lifetime.</a></p><p>In addition to announcing the $700 PS5 Pro, Sony this week <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-controllers-are-now-more-expensive/1100-6526346/" data-ref-id="1100-6526346">raised the price of DualSense controllers by $5.</a></p><p>This news came after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-hardware-sales-are-on-the-decline-but-sony-is-still-looking-healthy/1100-6525590/" data-ref-id="1100-6525590">Sony revealed that PS5 hardware sales were down</a> about 27% year over year for the company's first quarter of fiscal year 2024--April 1 to June 30. Historically, console prices drop over time due to the component costs coming down, but due to the pandemic and other factors, that isn't the case this time around. As mentioned above, PS5 console prices have gone up in Japan and other parts of the world, but not the US. Sony has said its price increases are <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2022/08/25/ps5-price-to-increase-in-select-markets-due-to-global-economic-environment-including-high-inflation-rates/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">related to global economic conditions</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">For its part, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-series-x-consoles-and-xbox-game-pass-subscriptions-are-getting-a-price-increase/1100-6515385/" data-ref-id="1100-6515385">Microsoft has also raised Xbox and Game Pass prices</a>, leaving <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-wont-raise-switch-prices-despite-growing-costs/1100-6506564/" data-ref-id="1100-6506564">Nintendo as the only one of the big three console manufacturers to keep prices steady this generation</a>.</p><p>For more on the PS5 Pro, be sure to check out GameSpot's rundown of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-ps5-pro-enhanced-game/2900-5758/" data-ref-id="2900-5758">all the PS5 Pro-enhanced games so far.</a> The system launches on November 7. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-preorder-guide-price-release-date-amazon-best-buy-walmart/1100-6526406/" data-ref-id="1100-6526406">Preorders for the PS5 Pro open</a> on September 26.</p>

As a discipline, UX ensures that we keep our players at the center of our processes and solutions. We are here to help the team design the whole player experience, which includes—but is not limited to—UIs. This means that we have to approach the game from a holistic perspective, including a wide range of different disciplines in our work.</span></p><p>Image via Paradox Interactive.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Crusader Kings III </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">is a grand strategy game set in the Middle Ages, released in September 2020 and developed by Paradox Development Studio. Unlike many grand strategy games, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Crusader Kings III</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is character-driven, with most game interactions filtered through the lens of a specific character. The game is also succession-based; the character you play as will typically have an heir, who you will play as after your demise. It's a grand strategy game in which you're free to set your own goals, with a world seen through a dynastic lens as opposed to a national one.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">By now, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Crusader Kings III</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is approaching its fourth birthday, a fact plainly visible by the presence of all the additional content that's been released since its launch. With this wealth of additional content adding complexity to the game, it's important for us to ensure that our players can understand how to use the systems we introduce. This isn't something we do by making our game mechanics simpler or easier, but by clearly communicating to the player how they can interact with various aspects of the game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A whole lot of things can happen in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Crusader Kings III</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. This is one of the strengths of the game, but it also creates a whole host of edge cases that can be tricky to deal with. There's only so much control we can exert over the game once we set things in motion, and we want the introduction to the game to feel as genuine as possible, even if we're easing the player into things. For instance, what happens if the player character dies of pneumonia while you were trying to teach them about how they can recover from illnesses?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Once we unpause the game, anything can happen. Because of this, it'd be impossible to try to map out a decision tree of carefully structured tutorial prompts. Instead, we have to approach the game as an open-ended sandbox. We can try to guide the players, but ultimately they're the ones making the decisions, and we have to respect that. Besides, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Crusader Kings III</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is at its best when unexpected things happen.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This article will dive deep into the recent changes to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Crusader Kings III'</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">s main tutorial. What motivated us to try it out, why now, and how did we do it?</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Why make another tutorial?">Why make another tutorial?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As a studio, we always aim to make our players want to play and enjoy the game more, which is a metric we measure through the number of monthly active users our game has. While expanding and updating the game can help us achieve this goal, it has also led to us introducing a number of new mechanics that aren't covered by the in-game tutorial. The telemetry data we gather shows that the tutorial has a significant impact on the retention rates of our players, despite the fact that it doesn't cover all the mechanics you'll need to know to succeed. All of this, coupled with a number of small pet peeves the UX department had with the tutorial as a whole, meant it was a good candidate for an experiment.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Instead of spending a large amount of time ideating and iterating on a perfect new tutorial, we thought a better approach would be to try an experiment in the form of a quicker, more concise tutorial. This way, we can gather data and feedback, which can help us better understand what kind of tutorialization works for our game. The hope is that this kind of initiative will help us understand how best to teach our players about new mechanics in upcoming releases. If the experiment turns out to be a success, that also means we've improved the gameplay experience for our new players, which is a nice added bonus.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While the idea had been brewing for some time, an initiative from our game director and the marketing department focused on new player acquisition: </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/crusader-kings-iii/legends-of-crusader-kings-iii">"Legends of Crusader Kings III</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">", seemed like an excellent opportunity to try it.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="New player experience">New player experience</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Speaking of which, what </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>is </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">the new player experience in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Crusader Kings III</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> like? This is quite the multilayered question, seeing as players come into the game with a variety of experiences. Have they played Paradox games before? Are they completely new to grand strategy games? Generally speaking, it's very easy to get overwhelmed when you start the game for the first time. This is something that we've been aware of for some time and also an aspect we thought we could at least attempt to mitigate through the introduction of a new tutorial.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A key principle that we can utilize here is the idea of progressive disclosure. This is a fairly straightforward concept in interaction design, which posits that one way to make users feel like a complex interaction is easy to interact with is by adding complexity bit by bit. Progressively, if you will. This is something we can introduce into a tutorial by, for instance, only showing parts of the interface when you're first starting out.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The process">The process</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Starting out, it's important to understand what it is we're trying to solve. What are the tutorial's core problems? Why are they problems to begin with? How have we, or other designers, tried to solve these problems in the past? These are the fundamental questions that we try to answer in this phase of the design process.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's important for us to not only tackle these questions through quantitative means, but also qualitatively. The data we gather through telemetry helps us understand where we should focus our efforts, but it's not a crystal ball we can peer into to divine the perfect solution to any problem. In order to deliver a satisfying solution to a problem we discover, we need to consider not only our players but also the greater context in which the problem exists.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A key part of this is analyzing the strengths of tutorials in games in similar spaces to ours. A common theme we discovered in titles such as </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Civilization VI</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Against the Storm</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was the utilization of a narrative to frame the tutorialization. Another source of inspiration that helped us solidify the idea of progressive disclosure was the completely text-based game </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Silent Heaven</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Because design is a highly iterative process, understanding what our peers do well is an important aspect of the problem-solving process.</span></p><p>Tutorials in other games. Image via Paradox Interactive.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">After taking a look at some other games, it was time for some introspection. What does the current, longer tutorial do well? What does it do less well? One part of understanding this came from telemetry data, which we used to measure the impact of the tutorial on new players. Broadly speaking, we found that telemetry data indicated that finishing the tutorial wasn't a major determining factor in whether or not a player decided to keep playing. While this doesn't tell us the whole story, it does indicate that something about the tutorial was lacking.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A particularly intimidating aspect of the tutorial, especially from the perspective of a new player, is its length and information density. It takes a long time to complete, and it presents the player with a lot of information, not all of which is immediately useful. All the tutorial textboxes featured in the full tutorial can be seen in the image below. In total, the full tutorial presents the player with 67 sequential boxes full of explanatory information.</span></p><p>Comparison between old (left) and new (right) tutorial steps. Image via Paradox Interactive. </p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Not only does this take a long time to process and understand, but much of it is also superfluous since many of our players turn to video tutorials or other online resources to better understand the game once they've started playing. This led us to look for a way to craft an introductory experience that respects their time while still introducing them to the complex mechanics that we know our players love.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Once we had a burgeoning understanding of the problem we were trying to solve, it was time to start exploring possible solutions. This started with a few initial whiteboard sessions with relevant stakeholders from various disciplines, allowing us to explore a variety of ideas and possible flows that a new tutorial could follow. Something that was agreed upon fairly quickly was that the new tutorial should be faster to complete than the old one.</span></p><p>Whiteboarding Session. Image via Paradox Interactive.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To figure out what the new, shorter tutorial should contain, we turned to the preexisting one. We wanted to extract all the important parts of it and compress them into something more digestible. The first step of this was to figure out what didn't feel strictly necessary to communicate to the player right away, and remove it. After doing this, we were left with roughly one-third of the 67 messages mentioned prior. These needed rewriting and reformatting to be properly implemented into the game, but they served as a baseline that we could continue to build upon.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While it would have been beneficial to explore other options, there simply wasn't enough time for it. Because of this, we decided to evaluate the proposed flow to get some sense of whether or not it was something that was worth moving forward with. We met with other disciplines to gather initial feedback, leading to further iteration and changes to the tutorial flow itself. Code-wise, this meant cutting the parts of the proposed tutorial that would be a lot of effort to implement without providing much in terms of actual player value, while QA and game design provided us with insights into what we should focus on communicating to the player.</span></p><p>Tutorial Flow. Image via Paradox Interactive.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The time constraints meant we had to carefully consider what kind of prototyping approach to utilize for the project. Ultimately, we settled on using the game itself as the prototyping toolbox. This approach has two primary pros, namely that it minimizes the time it takes to move from prototype to implementation, and that it closely mimics the actual gameplay experience we're trying to achieve. Fortunately, this also served as a good opportunity to iron out a few UI bugs that had been bothering us for some time.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One of these bugs was the fact that the GUI windows we use to display tutorial text didn't dynamically adjust its size. While this was a fairly minor bug, it made the tutorial experience feel unnecessarily cluttered and complex, even when the actual text content was short.</span></p><p>Improperly sized tutorial window. Image via Paradox Interactive.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One important aspect that we focused on was the concept of progressive disclosure—that is, as mentioned before, revealing information gradually to help players better understand the concepts we wanted to cover. One example of this is how we decided to gradually reveal information in the character panel.</span></p><p>Revealing information gradually. Image via Paradox Interactive.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">After the linear part of the tutorial was done, we shifted our focus to a softer onboarding experience for newer players. We focused on creating a handful of events that serve as a form of narrative hook for the player while also gradually introducing them to game mechanics which they'll frequently have to interact with.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">These events illustrate to the player that there are several ways to play and interact with the game and encourage roleplaying by highlighting that certain options are only available because of specific traits tied to the character you're playing. Since events are a core part of the game, we felt it was important to tutorialize them in some way, which led to us adding explanatory text within the tooltips, something we don't typically do for regular events.</span></p><p>Above, a sample tutorial event. Images via Paradox Interactive.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Both of these sections, the linear tutorial and the events onboarding the players, were playtested internally. While we follow heuristics and guidelines when designing, these aren't a substitute for proper user testing. The </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Crusader Kings III</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> development team is a group of lovely, passionate people but we all collectively suffer from the curse of knowledge, meaning our perspective on the game isn't necessarily reflective of our playerbase. Therefore, we made sure to try the tutorial on people who primarily work on other games in the office. This led to another round of changes, which ended up becoming the final iteration of the tutorial, which you can play right now!</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Final words">Final words</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As this was an experiment, we're keeping the old, longer tutorial in the game as well so we can see how the two compare through telemetry. While we hope this new tutorial affects retention positively, there's a silver lining even if it doesn't. Knowing what doesn't work can be valuable, and regardless of what the data tells us, it'll help us make informed decisions in our future onboarding efforts.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I think the primary takeaway we have from this experiment is that you shouldn't be afraid to try things. No result is a bad result as long as you're willing to learn from it. Playtesting is incredibly valuable for this, but we primarily use it to gather qualitative feedback, meaning it's difficult to find quantitative data we can act on without releasing something publicly. So, go out there! Break stuff! Iterate! Make stuff that's better than what came before it!</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>There’s a new PS5 system software update available now that’s bringing some big (and some long overdue) features to the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PlayStation 5</a> console, including a new Welcome hub, party sharing and the wide launch of personalised 3D audio profiles.</p>
<p>The Welcome hub is a new customisable space that is available today for “select players” in the US, and will be rolling out over the next few weeks for the rest of the world. This brings customisable widgets and backgrounds to the PS5 home screen, so you can forefront features like battery monitoring, your personal trophy collection and more whenever you boot up the console. This should make for a much more engaging alternative to the old Explore tab – you’ll also be able to set your own background here, for a much needed personal touch.</p>



<p>Then there’s party sharing, which lets you send out chat links on other platforms and have them bring other people directly into a voice chat, both via their smartphone app and via PS5, and whether they’re in your friends list or not. It’s just another little route for establishing links between people, and will be rolling out gradually over the next few weeks.</p>
<p>And then we have features that were in testing with the most recent beta system update. Personalised 3D audio for headphones and earbuds is the big one here, helping you to tune the 3D spatial audio to your specific hearing. This has been something in the pipeline ever since the PS5 launched, though back then Sony considered taking photos to scan people’s ears – something that Apple and others do for Bluetooth earbuds.</p>

<p>Here’s what it will look like:</p>
<p><iframe title="PS5 UI | Personalised 3D Audio Profile setup" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QhZzPyc-Zas?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>There’s also adaptive controller charging on the PS5 Slim and upcoming <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a>, which is kind of nice, and per-user Remote Play settings.</p>
<p>The update is available to download right now, though as mentioned, some of these features will be rolling out more gradually over the coming weeks.</p>

<p>Ballistic Moon confirmed that Until Dawn will include NVIDIA DLSS 3 and AMD FSR 3. To be more specific, the upscaling components of each technology are updated to version 3.7 and 3.1, respectively. In addition, both will support NVIDIA and AMD Frame Generation techniques to deliver optimal frame rates. By the way, you'll have the option to unlock the frame rate on your PC.</p>
<p>Until Dawn was always meant to be a highly cinematic game, and owners of ultrawide displays will be happy to learn that both 21:9 and 32:9 aspect ratios are fully supported here. The graphics have also been enhanced thanks to ray traced shadows, reflections, and ambient occlusion. Finally, PC users will get the full DualSense experience if they own the PS5 controller: the haptic feedback will let you feel the heartbeat of the characters during the Don’t Move sequences, while Adaptive triggers allow you to feel the weight of your choices and experience more realistic resistance when pulling the trigger of firearms.</p>
<p>Until Dawn is out on October 4.</p>

<p>Per <a href="https://www.planetcoaster.com/news/2024-09-12/planet-coaster-2-coming-pc-and-console-november-6th-2024" rel="noopener" target="_blank">an announcement</a> on the official&nbsp;<em>Planet Coaster&nbsp;</em>website,&nbsp;<em>Planet Coaster 2&nbsp;</em>arrives across PC and consoles on November 6th, and you can pre-order both the Standard Edition and the Deluxe Edition of the game right now as well.</p>
<p>Picking up the Deluxe Edition nets you ten extra rides that Frontier says are "perfect for bestowing a classic theme and feel" upon the parks you create. All pre-orders, whether Standard or Deluxe, will also get three bonus rides as part of their pre-order.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/planet-coaster-2-release-date-water-park.jpg?itok=alPe9V98 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/planet-coaster-2-release-date-water-park.jpg?itok=HIIUwfL9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Planet Coaster 2&nbsp;</em>arrives in November to make you wish it was summer.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Planet Coaster 2&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/planet-coaster-2-announced">originally unveiled in July</a>. As the name suggests, it's the second&nbsp;<em>Planet Coaster&nbsp;</em>game, following on from its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/planet-coaster-has-sold-1-million-copies">very popular</a> predecessor, which was released in late 2016.</p>
<p>As you might imagine,&nbsp;<em>Planet Coaster 2&nbsp;</em>will once again let you manage your very own theme park. You'll be able to design your own rides, set up facilities however you like, and give your guests the theme park experience of their lives.</p>
<p>Naturally, the sequel will also boast a number of new features and improvements over its predecessor. First and foremost among these is the ability to build new water rides, including flumes, swimming pools, and more.</p>
<p>Frontier is also promising "next-level customization" that utilizes brand new building and pathing tools, allowing you to build a park that looks exactly like the one in your head.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Planet Coaster 2&nbsp;</em>will also let you build and work on parks with friends "using a shared cross-platform save", and the Franchise Mode will let you collaborate directly with other players as well.</p>
<p>In short,&nbsp;<em>Planet Coaster 2&nbsp;</em>is angling to be the definitive theme park sim, so you'd better watch out,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/park-beyond"><em>Park Beyond</em></a>.&nbsp;<em>Planet Coaster 2&nbsp;</em>launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2688950/Planet_Coaster_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10009610" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/planet-coaster-2/9PK5WS0HXQKQ" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on November 6th.</p>

This quest will task you with finding all eight ruins before you can report back to the quest giver. Note that this quest is <em>not</em> retroactive. Ruins you passed by before will need to be revisited, and you won’t be able to tell which specific ruins you have or haven’t visited. The quest will only tally how many ruins you’ve visited in total.</p><p>Fortunately, all you have to do is step foot near the ruins and watch the short cutscene play that gives you the name of the location. You don’t actually need to step inside after this point, especially if you don’t want to anger any dangerous enemies. You’ll keep uncovering new ruins after your stay in Illystana, so this isn’t a quest you can complete right away.</p><p>After you complete Traces of the Ancients, you’ll receive the <strong>Nemesis Takedown</strong> quest. This is where things get tricky. You’ll have to go back to each ruin and fight through all the groups of high-level enemies inside. For every group you defeat, a torch will light up, which will eventually unlock a secret area where a Nemesis monster lurks. These Nemeses will have a few lackeys by their side, so make sure you can deal strong single-target and AoE damage. Strategies for each Nemesis will change, but as long as you can exploit elemental weaknesses and use buffs and debuffs to bolster your defenses, you should fare well.</p><p>Defeating each nemesis will unlock one of eight powerful endgame weapons for you to use. These easily rank as some of the best equipment in the entire game, so the reward is well worth the effort. As an aside, <strong>Nemesis Takedown progress <em>is</em> retroactive</strong>.

However, it’s absolutely possible to complete them as low as level 30, even on Hard Mode. If you’re up for the challenge and aren’t afraid to die a few times, here’s the party composition that worked for me.</p><h3 id="h2324"><a id=""></a><strong>Val</strong></h3><p><strong>Edelfrei</strong>. Having a dedicated tank doesn’t <em>seem</em> like it’d help that much at first. However, armed with the <strong>Provoke</strong> Ability Seed, enemies will tend to get confused in their AI and won’t necessarily rush at the rest of your party and pick up quick kills. I like the Dryad-driven Edelfrei class because the healing from the wood elemental vessel gives Val some natural HP regen, assuming he can tank a hit or two. You may also consider the <strong>Paladin</strong> class if you can effectively keep Val shielded, especially if you get the Mortal Twiliance first.</p><h3 id="h2325"><a id=""></a><strong>Careena</strong></h3><p><strong>Divine Fist</strong>. Class strikes are ridiculously powerful in <em>Visions of Mana</em>, and the Divine Fist class ignores a chunk of your enemies’ Defense stat whenever she uses one. This helps out a lot against these otherwise bulky enemies, since even a level 30 Careena with Ability Seeds that amplify class strike damage can take out a massive chunk of these level 50+ enemy health bars.</p><p>What’s more, the class strike gauge fills whenever your party takes damage, even if it’s from a killing blow. If the enemies are one-shotting your party, you’ll quickly have another class strike to use as a counter attack. Remember to bring lots of Cups of Wishes!</p><p>If you need more support, you may consider using <strong>Julei</strong> with the <strong>Hunter</strong> class as your class strike user instead. However, I have not tested the damage potential Julei has here, so your mileage may vary.</p><h3 id="h2326"><a id=""></a><strong>Morley</strong></h3><p><strong>Nightblade</strong>. Just a ridiculously powerful class overall, and probably the best class to play throughout the majority of <em>Visions of Mana</em>. A 20 percent boost to Critical Hit damage and a 70 percent boost to Critical Hit rate is <em>bonkers</em>, especially since you can equip Ability Seeds to further strengthen that damage and make that Crit Rate effectively one hundred percent.</p><p>Morley attacks so fast that he can potentially stunlock enemies, and the Moon elemental vessel gives Morley yet another form of crowd control. Even if he starts out inflicting insignificant damage, the right combination of buffs and debuffs should let Morley inflict damage way above his pay grade.</p><p>From here, you don’t need to make any dramatic changes in terms of battle strategy. Each fight has similar mechanics to any other overworld fight you might encounter, albeit against high level monsters. Some enemies will resist Fire and other elements you may have been banking on, so you’ll either want to swap in different party members or save those fights for last.</p><p>Underleveled players can and will burn through their items during these fights, but Lucre is fortunately abundant enough that this shouldn’t be an issue. Otherwise, just make sure to charge your class strike gauge before each battle so you can inflict a lot of damage right out the gate. Elemental breaks also help a lot too!</p><hr><p>If you are taking these fights on at low levels, note that <strong>you’ll get a lot of experience from each group you clear</strong>. I strongly suggest using any EXP-boosting items as you complete these battles to maximize your gains. Good luck battling these baddies!<br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

We’re working on something,” Hawk said. “That is the first time I’ve said that publicly. </p><p>“It will be something the fans will truly appreciate.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/03/27/hawk-main-1711550956739.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Tony Hawk.

Maybe when the dust settles, we’ll figure it out. You never know. I never would’ve thought we were going to do 1+2, 20 years later.”</p><p>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater released on PSone on September 29, 1999, and went on to sell millions of copies and spawn subsequent sequels. As well as working with Activision on something new video game related, Tony Hawk is making a kids-focused animated TV show called <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tony-hawks-kids-focused-animated-tv-show-is-called-skatebirds">Skatebirds</a>, a title inspired by Hawk’s ‘Birdman’ nickname.</p><p><em>Photo by Sean M.

He went on to say: "I can call Flappy Bird a success of mine. But it also ruins my simple life. So now I hate it."</p><p>Now, Flappy Bird is set to return, with an expanded version aiming for launch by the end of October across multiple platforms including web browsers, and an iOS and Android version planned for release in 2025.

All other images via Omdia.</span></p></div><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">PlayStation 5 Pro will carry a launch price tag coming in just shy of $700, representing a 75% increase on both the nominal price of its last-gen predecessor PS4 Pro, and a 56% premium on the PS5 Digital Edition. By comparison, PS4 Pro launched at the same launch price as PS4.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While this makes PS5 Pro’s pricing unprecedented for Sony, it is not unexpected. Historically, console manufacturers typically release cost-reduced hardware to address more price-sensitive late adopters – such as 2016’s PS4 Slim ($100 cheaper) and 2019’s Switch Lite (also $100 cheaper).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Yet the cost per transistor has not come down on key components such as the CPU this generation. This has had the knock-on impact of 4Q23’s PS5 Slim hardware revision releasing at either the same or a higher price than 2020’s PS5, depending on SKU and territory.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As a result, hardware ASPs this generation to date have tracked above the previous generation (see Figure 1). On top of this, in 2024 Sony has de-emphasized utilizing regular discounting as a means of growing the PS5 installed base in a bid to preserve the profitability of its hardware.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Figure 1: ASP of PS5 hardware has remained notably higher, gen-on-gen, than PS4</span></span></p><p>Source: Omdia Games Hardware Database</p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="PS5 Pro is squarely targeted at PlayStation’s most engaged audience">PS5 Pro is squarely targeted at PlayStation’s most engaged audience</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">PS5 Pro’s $700 price point makes it an aspirational device aimed at players who desire the very best experience. Platform holders have historically catered to this small but highly engaged audience in the past with niche systems that lay adjacent to popular home console platforms, such as 1991’s Neo Geo AES ($649 or $1502 in real terms) and 1993’s 3DO ($699, or $1512 in real terms).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The difference today is that the premium “Pro” consoles are mid-gen refreshes – they are additive to what are existing, thriving console platforms. In the case of PS5 Pro, it will still sit alongside an active installed base of PS4, PS4 Pro, and PS5 players – of which their software and services boast significant interoperability.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Figure 2: Pro consoles accounted for just 13% of combined PS4 and Xbox One installed base by end of 2019</span></span></p><p>Source: Omdia Games Hardware Database</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It’s also not the first of its breed – Sony has already had a run of history with PS4 Pro. Omdia data reveals that just 1.8 million PS4 Pro systems were sold in its launch year, 2016. By the end of its fourth calendar year on the market, 2019, the 13.9m units of PS4 Pro sold accounted for under 15% of the overall PS4 installed base.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Similarly, Omdia’s historical console hardware data reveals that the equivalent Microsoft system, Xbox One X, also only accounted for just over 10% of installed consoles following the same timeframe. Combined, both “Pro” machines only accounted for just over 13% of the installed base of PlayStation 4 and Xbox One consoles (see Figure 2).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Despite PS4 Pro’s comparatively competitive pricing, then, it was always an enthusiast device – a stark contrast to previous mid-generation upgrades such as Game Boy Color, DSi, and New Nintendo 3DS. And Sony has usage data on PS4 and PS5 players that will have pinpointed a large enough highly engaged portion of its audience that would make PS5 Pro a worthwhile endeavor to pursue.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Figure 3: Total addressable market across PlayStation consoles largely static gen-on-gen</span></span></p><p>Source: Omdia Games Addressable Market Metrics Database</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It’s this engagement that is key to understanding Sony’s strategy with PS5 Pro. With the active installed base of PlayStation users remaining static as it transitions between generations (see Figure 3), Sony has focused its attention on increasing lifetime spend per console. This has materialized in the following ways:</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">PS5 Pro is another means for Sony to either target the highly engaged – or allow the highly engaged to self-select themselves into the PlayStation ecosystem.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">And yet despite the above, Omdia does not anticipate PS5 Pro to sell in the same volumes as its predecessor. PS4 Pro not only launched at a comparatively lower price point, but coincided with both the adoption of 4K TVs hitting a critical mass. It also launched simultaneously alongside PlayStation VR, a more compelling platform than current-generation successor PS VR 2.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="PS5 Pro will not be enough to reverse PS5’s sales volume declines in 2024">PS5 Pro will not be enough to reverse PS5’s sales volume declines in 2024</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As PS5 approaches its fifth full year on the market without a single permanent price drop, the absence of key first-party blockbuster games throughout 2024 coupled with a prolonged cross-generation period has led to PS5 entering its decline phase a year earlier than PS4 did in its cycle.</span><br></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Omdia’s preliminary console forecast estimates that even in a best-case scenario, sales volumes for PlayStation 5 would still decline by 17% in 2024, when compared with 2023.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Right now, PlayStation 5 Pro is set to launch alongside the casual-friendly </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Lego Horizon Adventures</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which is currently the only confirmed major first-party title slated for the holiday season. By comparison, PS4 Pro launched in close proximity to fan favorite first-party triple-A games such as </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Uncharted 4, The Last Guardian, </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Gravity Rush 2.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">PS5 Pro is also arriving in a development landscape where the gestation period for triple-A games is longer and more costly than it was in the previous generation. This has materialized as a sustained cross-generation period in the PS5’s cycle, where publishers have only recently begun leaving behind the last-generation systems for their triple-A games. Yet at the same time, 2024 has also been a quiet year for such major releases.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Sony does, however, have an opportunity to ride off the halo effects created by </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Grand Theft Auto 6, </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">which is expected for release in 2025</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>. </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">The game is expected to launch exclusively on console platforms, with a PC release coming at least a year later. This would leave PlayStation 5 Pro as the premier place to experience what is one of the most hotly anticipated games in the modern age. If Sony is smart, it should strike a marketing deal with publisher Take-Two to promote the game alongside its new console.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">PS5 Pro will prove an interesting case study for the console market due to its notable contrast against its predecessor PS4 Pro. That older system was a defense strategy against the moving baseline of PC gaming hardware and an answer to the adoption of 4K TVs.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Meanwhile, PS5 Pro is razor-focused on an audience which wouldn’t think twice about moving to PC. But at its $700 price point, the stakes will be high for PS5 Pro to deliver a tangible benefit to this audience in the three-four years before Sony begins its transition to PS6, especially in a generation that has delivered fewer exclusive blockbuster games than the last.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Analyst, Games, Omdia</p><div data-testid="contributor-summary-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">James is part of Omdia’s games team, specializing in the markets for PC and mobile gaming.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-review">Helldivers 2</a> developer Arrowhead has revealed its next Premium Warbond, known as Chemical Agents.</p>
<p>Chemical Agents comes complete with some "seriously deadly toys", including stratagems, utilities, emotes and more.</p>
<p>On the Warbond's release, players will be able to get their hands on the likes of the TX-41 Sterilizer, the G-4 Gas grenade (which will "cover the whole area in a cloud of noxious fumes") and the new utility P-11 Stim Pistol. You can check out the gas-filled trailer for Chemical Agents below.</p>

<p>If you want to update your overall look, there will also be new armor and capes to adorn your Helldiver with. These include the Standard of Safe Distance cape and the Patient Zero's Remembrance cape. It may be true that not all heroes wear capes, but these ones do!</p>
<p>Emote wise, you are looking at the Natural Gas Extraction emote, which will allow your squad to pull your finger. For those moments of victory, meanwhile, there is an emote simply known as Ew.</p>
<p>Helldivers 2's Chemical Agents Premium Warbond is set to release later this month, on 19th September. Further details can be found on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/12/helldivers-2-the-chemical-agents-warbond-launches-sept-19/">PlayStation Blog</a>. </p>

            <p>Unity has cancelled the controversial Runtime Fee for use of its game engine tools, which charged developers for each game install, with immediate effect.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unity-reveals-plans-to-charge-per-game-install-drawing-criticism-from-development-community">pricing plan was introduced in September</a> last year and was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indie-developers-react-to-astonishing-scumbag-move-of-unitys-new-install-charge">heavily criticised by game developers</a>, calling it an "astonishing scumbag move" among other responses.</p>
<p>Today, in a <a href="https://unity.com/blog/unity-is-canceling-the-runtime-fee">blog post</a> from new president and CEO of Unity Matt Bromberg, the company announced it will revert back to a traditional subscription model "after deep consultation with our community, customers, and partners".</p>

<p>Bromberg described the company's aim of "democratising game development" by allowing games to be built by anyone.</p>
<p>"However, we can’t pursue that mission in conflict with our customers; at its heart, it must be a partnership built on trust," said Bromberg. "I’ve been able to connect with many of you over the last three months, and I’ve heard time and time again that you want a strong Unity, and understand that price increases are a necessary part of what enables us to invest in moving gaming forward. But those increases needn’t come in a novel and controversial new form."</p>
<p>Now, Unity Personal will remain free and the current revenue and funding ceiling will be doubled to $200,000 USD, meaning more developers can use Unity at no cost.</p>
<p>For its Pro and Enterprise packages, Unity will revert to a traditional subscription, with pricing and qualifying annual revenue thresholds increasing from 1st January 2025.</p>
<p>"Cancelling the Runtime Fee for games and instituting these pricing changes will allow us to continue investing to improve game development for everyone while also being better partners," concluded Bromberg.</p>
<p>After announcing the introduction of the Runtime Fee, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unity-reportedly-considering-cap-on-hugely-controversial-per-install-fees">Unity considered adding a cap</a> to the fees and then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unity-announces-significant-changes-to-its-controversial-new-pricing-plan">announced significant changes</a> along with an apology.</p>
<p>A month later, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unity-ceo-john-riccitiello-retiring-from-company-weeks-after-pricing-controversy">CEO John Riccitiello left the company</a> following the pricing controversy. At the start of 2024, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unity-starts-2024-by-laying-off-1800-employees-as-part-of-ongoing-reset">Unity laid off 1,800 employees</a> as part of an ongoing "reset".</p>
<p>That reset continues today with these pricing changes. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unity-appoints-former-ea-and-zynga-exec-as-new-ceo-following-pricing-controversies-and-layoffs">Bromberg was appointed as CEO in May</a> this year, following positions at EA and mobile developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/zynga">Zynga</a></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/unity-runtime-fee-canceled<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Unity has announced that it's canceling its controversial runtime fee policy, reverting instead to a seat-based subscription service while also increasing prices for Pro and Enterprise customers.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://unity.com/blog/unity-is-canceling-the-runtime-fee" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a blog post</a> on the official Unity website, company CEO Matt Bromberg says the decision to cancel the runtime fee was made "after deep consultation with our community, customers, and partners".</p>
<p>Bromberg goes on to say that his company's mission to "democratiz[e] game development" can't be achieved if the company is "in conflict with our customers", and that price increases, while necessary, "needn't come in a novel and controversial new form".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/unity-runtime-fee-canceled-ui.jpg?itok=yOSdLhYX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/unity-runtime-fee-canceled-ui.jpg?itok=MwT-QOpr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Unity is canning its controversial runtime fee policy.</figcaption></figure><p>Unity Personal, the lowest tier of Unity's pricing model, "will remain free", and the revenue and funding ceiling will be doubled from $100,000 to $200,000. Additionally, the Made with Unity splash screen will be optional for games made using Unity 6, which <a href="https://discussions.unity.com/t/introducing-unity-6-the-next-major-release-of-unity/933629" rel="noopener" target="_blank">launches later this year</a>.</p>
<p>Things are a little different for the Pro and Enterprise models, however. Pro subscriptions will jump by 8% to $2,200 per year, effective from January 1st, and if your game has more than $200,000 in revenue and funding, you'll need to use this tier.</p>
<p>The Enterprise tier, meanwhile, is for customers with more than $25 million total revenue and funding. The price of this tier will jump by 25%, but Blomberg says he and his company will contact customers on this tier in the next few days "to discuss customized packages".</p>
<p>Unity says it'll return to this pricing structure every year to decide whether it needs to be increased or not, but that if the Editor changes "in ways that impact you", you can keep using the previous version "as long as you keep using that version".</p>

<p>As you can probably imagine, indie developers reacted with outrage;&nbsp;<em>Garry's Mod&nbsp;</em>developer Garry Newman estimated that he'd have paid the engine "about $410k more" for&nbsp;<em>Rust</em>, for instance, while indie dev legend Rami Ismail said the changes made developing in the ecosystem "a straight-up financial risk" on a number of levels.</p>
<p>Unity quickly <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/unity-apologizes-for-confusion-and-angst-due-to-runtime-fee-policy-promises-changes">apologized for the "confusion and angst"</a> it had caused developers, promising changes to the policy, which it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/unity-announces-revised-pricing-policy-following-massive-backlash-from-developers">announced a few days later</a>. Those changes didn't scrap the runtime fee, but they did make it a little less punitive for smaller developers.</p>
<p>The controversy saw then-CEO John Riccitello <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/unity-ceo-john-riccitiello-retiring-after-runtime-fee-controversy">stepping down from the company</a>, and Unity subsequently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/unity-layoffs-core-business">laid off a huge number of workers</a> in January this year. That move may or may not be related to the runtime fee controversy, but said controversy certainly can't have helped.</p>
<p>We'll have to wait and see if these changes restore trust in Unity among the developer community. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/eu-organization-says-premium-currency-is-purposefully-tricking-gamers.979218/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/eu-organization-premium-currency-complaint<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>An EU consumer watchdog organization has submitted a complaint to EU authorities regarding the use of premium currency in games, which the organization says "maximizes consumers' spending" and constitutes "manipulative spending tactics".</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.beuc.eu/press-releases/consumer-groups-denounce-video-games-manipulative-spending-tactics" rel="noopener" target="_blank">press release summarizing the complaint</a>, BEUC (Bureau Européen des Unions de Consommateurs, otherwise known as the European Consumer Organization) says games like&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>,&nbsp;<em>EA Sports FC</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>engage in "unfair practices" via their premium currency systems.</p>
<p>The group's director general,&nbsp;Agustín Reyna, says the group has "identified numerous cases where gamers are misled into spending money", and that "deceptive practices must be stopped". BEUC is calling on the EU to "ensure that traders play by the rules" and provide safe environments for gamers and children.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/eu-premium-currency-complaint-beuc-minecraft.jpg?itok=EZolaEL6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/eu-premium-currency-complaint-beuc-minecraft.jpg?itok=_440aACX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>is one of the games BEUC says is engaging in unfair practices with regards to spending.</figcaption></figure><p>BEUC says it's identified four main problem areas with regards to premium currency in gaming.</p>
<p>The first is that consumers "cannot see the real cost of digital items" when premium currency is sold in bundles or the price of the currency is not transparent. The group therefore recommends all in-game purchases be displayed in real-money terms.</p>
<p>According to the group, companies that claim players prefer in-game currency "are wrong"; BEUC says its data shows consumers "find this unnecessary step misleading" and would prefer simply to use real money for their purchases.</p>
<p>Third, BEUC says consumers "are often denied their rights" when making premium currency purchases, and that publishers often tie these purchases to "unfair terms favoring game developers".</p>
<p>Finally, the group says children are "even more vulnerable" to the unfair practices it's complaining about. It points to data showing that children in Europe make around&nbsp;€39 worth of purchases per month in games (that's about $43).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fortnite-eu-complaint-premium-currency-beuc.jpg?itok=n6j5dFz6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fortnite-eu-complaint-premium-currency-beuc.jpg?itok=PFHBEn7X 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Sorry,&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>, but you're in BEUC's crosshairs as well.</figcaption></figure><p>BEUC's full report makes a number of recommendations to combat this problem, including assessing a potential ban on premium currency sale for in-game and in-app purchases, as well as "stricter transparency requirements" in EU consumer law and "stronger consumer protection and regulation".</p>
<p>If this seems like a waltz we've danced before, that's because it is, specifically with regards to predatory practices implemented with systems like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/uk-asa-loot-boxes-ea-jagex-miniclip">loot boxes</a>, microtransactions, and battle passes.</p>
<p>In-game monetization, especially in single-player games, is becoming a dirty term among players, leading to games like&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k: Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/space-marine-2-no-microtransactions">pledging not to include any</a>&nbsp;(although that doesn't stop games like&nbsp;<em>Dragon's Dogma 2&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragons-dogma-2-capcom-statement">locking features behind microtransactions</a>, bizarrely).</p>
<p>If you'd like to, you can read BEUC's <a href="https://www.beuc.eu/sites/default/files/publications/BEUC-X-2024-061_Monetising_play_Regulating_in_game_and_in_app_premium_currencies.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">full report here</a>. Of course, it's not legally binding right now; it remains to be seen whether EU authorities will make changes based on this report or not, but its conclusions are pretty compelling.
