            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-killzone-crossover<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Arrowhead Game Studios has announced the very first&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>crossover, and it's with a classic Sony first-person shooter franchise we haven't heard from in some time.</p>

<p>As revealed in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/516322672418750491" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam news post</a> earlier today,&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em>'s first ever collaboration is with none other than&nbsp;<em>Killzone</em>. More specifically, the crossover introduces items inspired by&nbsp;<em>Killzone 2&nbsp;</em>to the&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>arsenal.</p>

<p>Arrowhead says that this crossover represents the first foray into a "new tier of special Premium content reserved for collaborations and other uniquely-themed work", so it sounds like we'll be getting more crossovers later down the line.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/helldivers-2-killzone-crossover-store.jpg?itok=HHrzynCK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/helldivers-2-killzone-crossover-store.jpg?itok=JeIrzW0j 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Helldivers 2</em>'s first crossover is with none other than&nbsp;<em>Killzone</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>This new&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2 Killzone&nbsp;</em>crossover doesn't take the form of a Warbond along the lines of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-truth-enforcers-warbond" rel="nofollow">Truth Enforcers</a>&nbsp;or <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-chemical-agents-warbond" rel="nofollow">Chemical Agents</a>. Rather, it's a set of new gear and other goodies you can buy from the game's Superstore, which offers individual items for in-game Super Credits.</p>

<p>Given&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em>'s theming, it'll probably come as no surprise that this crossover revolves heavily around&nbsp;<em>Killzone</em>'s fascist Helghast, with an armor set, a cape, and other liveries available that echo the logos and visual aesthetic of the Helghan Empire.</p>

<p>Of course, the tones of&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Killzone&nbsp;</em>are somewhat at odds.&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>takes a more&nbsp;<em>Starship Troopers</em>-esque satirical view of fascism, while&nbsp;<em>Killzone&nbsp;</em>plays things more seriously.</p>

<p>Still, it's interesting to see&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em>'s first crossover emerge in this way. Could this also be Sony's stealthy way of trying to gauge interest for a potential&nbsp;<em>Killzone&nbsp;</em>revival? We will have to wait and see.</p>




<p>This crossover comes shortly after the release of&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em>'s new Omens of Tyranny update, which introduces the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-cloaked-ships-rumor-update" rel="nofollow">long-awaited</a> (and apparently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-blue-beam-attacks-the-illuminate" rel="nofollow">previously-teased</a>) Illuminate faction into the mix.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/553850/HELLDIVERS_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/helldivers-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>. The first part of the game's&nbsp;<em>Killzone&nbsp;</em>crossover is live now, and a second part is apparently on its way on December 23rd.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24305570/steam-deck-best-games-2024-verified-playable-valve<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>The Steam Deck gets better every year, and 2024 was no exception. It’s been my primary gaming device ever since I became a parent, and I love being able to access the humongous library of games available on Steam from wherever I want, whether it’s at home or while the baby is taking a nap at grandma’s house. Valve keeps adding great features via software updates, too, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/5/24289138/steam-game-recording-now-available-all-users">like game recording</a>.</p><p>If you’re just setting up a Steam Deck for the first time — perhaps you’re lucky enough to get one of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/11/24294106/valve-white-steam-deck">limited-edition white models</a> — or you’re dusting off your Deck after a little break, I’ve put together some recommendations of great games from this year, along with one update to a classic.</p><p><h3><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F2379780%2FBalatro%2F"><em>Balatro</em></a></h3></p><p>Move over, <em>Slay the Spire</em> — there’s a new card-based roguelike king in town. Well, maybe a joker. In <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24082252/balatro-review-poker-roguelike-videogame"><em>Balatro</em></a>, the goal is to make familiar poker hands to earn increasingly higher amounts of chips. But between rounds, you’ll get to shop for new cards that make you more powerful, including jokers that can stack up to earn you mind-bogglingly high amounts of chips. When you get a good round going in <em>Balatro</em>, it’s a thrilling mix of planning, gambling, and watching numbers go up — and when your luck eventually runs out, it’s all too easy to hop back in for just one more round.</p><p><h3><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F1845910%2FDragon_Age_The_Veilguard%2F"><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em></a></h3></p><p>BioWare’s latest fantasy RPG is an epic quest that’s especially well suited to the Steam Deck. It’s got all of the hallmarks of what’s expected from BioWare — dialogue trees, fun companions, and lots of ways to build your characters — and the game’s expansive story is broken up into several smaller quests, making it easy to take care of one in a short session before bed. While the game is verified for Steam Deck, you’ll have to tweak your graphics settings to make it run well. But I’ll take the imperfect performance to be able to play <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24281631/dragon-age-the-veilguard-early-review-ps5-xbox-pc"><em>The Veilguard</em></a> wherever I want.</p><p><h3><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F1145350%2FHades_II%2F"><em>Hades II</em></a></h3></p><p>I wasn’t going to include early access games on this list, but I had to break my rule for <em>Hades II</em>. Even though it isn’t complete yet, it’s better than most of the games I’ve played this year. Supergiant’s sequel smartly builds upon the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22159911/hades-best-game-2020-nintendo-switch-supergiant-pc">action roguelike formula of the first game</a> with new weapons, <em>two</em> different routes to tackle (though one is unfinished), and a great new cast of hotties to hang out with (and some old ones returning). I’ve had to actually stop myself from playing this game as much as I want to — I don’t want to get tired of the game before its eventual 1.0 launch. And as my colleague Ash Parrish has already said, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24152085/hades-2-steam-deck-performance">it’s the perfect Steam Deck game</a>.</p><p><h3><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F2679460%2FMetaphor_ReFantazio%2F"><em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em></a></h3></p><p>I’ve already written an entire article about how <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24268103/metaphor-refantazio-review-atlus-xbox-persona"><em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em></a>, the newest RPG from Atlus, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/10/24266327/metaphor-refantazio-persona-handheld-heritage">continues <em>Persona</em>’s great handheld heritage</a>: battles are turn-based but quick; the game is broken down into easily digestible days; and it runs well enough on Steam Deck with some tweaking. It’s a huge game that I still haven’t finished, but because I have it on a portable device, I’m looking forward to chipping away at it when I get spare moments here and there.</p><p><h3><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F2420660%2FNeva%2F"><em>Neva</em></a></h3></p><p><em>Neva</em> is a jaw-droppingly gorgeous game about a young woman and the fox that she cares for. There’s some combat, but much of the game is about solving light platforming puzzles and taking in the absolutely stunning art and music. (I can attest that it looks really good on a Steam Deck OLED.) The game tells a powerful story about <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24267805/neva-nomada-studio-interview-gris-devolver">love and loss</a> that takes just a few hours to beat — it’s the perfect game to play over a couple of evenings on the couch next to a warm fire.</p><div><p><cite>Image: Playstack / Color Gray Games</cite></p></div><p><h3><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F2716400%2FThe_Rise_of_the_Golden_Idol%2F"><em>The Rise of the Golden Idol</em></a></h3></p><p>If you’re looking to solve some murder mysteries, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24295956/the-rise-of-the-golden-idol-review-pc-playstation-xbox-netflix-mobile"><em>The Rise of the Golden Idol</em></a><em> </em>will probably cast its magic on you. The game is loaded with 20 point-and-click mysteries to solve by investigating scenes and people and figuring out the right words to explain exactly what’s going on. The game is a little grotesque, but that’s part of the fun — why are you playing a murder mystery if you’re not willing to see some dead bodies with weird red eyes?</p><p><h3><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F413150%2FStardew_Valley%2F"><em>Stardew Valley</em>’s 1.6 update</a></h3></p><p><em>Stardew Valley</em> is one of the most-played games on the Steam Deck, and with good reason: the game’s farming simulation and delightful characters are easy to spend time with for five minutes or five hours. Earlier this year, the game got a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/27/24084461/stardew-valley-game-1-6-update-release-date-pc-mac-console">massive 1.6 content update</a> with new festivals, a new farm type, and more late-game content, meaning there’s a lot to dig into, whether you’re a <em>Stardew Valley</em> veteran or starting a farm for the first time.</p><p><h3><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F2366980%2FThank_Goodness_Youre_Here%2F"><em>Thank Goodness You’re Here!</em></a></h3></p><p>In <em>Thank Goodness You’re Here!</em>, you play as a little man bopping around a quaint English village, interacting with the many quirky townspeople, and, uh, slapping stuff. The writing is hilarious and the absurd accents are even funnier. Best of all? You can finish the whole game in about three hours. It’s delightful.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

However, that’s on default settings, and there’s a way to fix it—by disabling the AI-driven Game Filters setting.</p><p>The term “AI” now means so many different things, even just within the field of gaming, that it’s deeply unhelpful. It’s used to describe the programmed behavior of in-game characters and systems. It’s the name given to large language models that scrape other people’s work to generate derivative, plagiarized work. And it’s used to define any “learning” program that adapts itself based on experience. It’s the latter that’s relevant here, what Nvidia describes as “game enhancing filters, including innovative new AI-powered filters for RTX users.” It seems that, since the switch from GeForce Experience, it’s this feature that’s causing some serious issues.</p><p>Game Filters aren’t new—they were a feature in GeForce Experience and known as Nvidia Freestyle, and by all accounts <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pcmag.com/how-to/how-to-improve-pc-graphics-and-add-filters-with-nvidia-freestyle&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pcmag.com/how-to/how-to-improve-pc-graphics-and-add-filters-with-nvidia-freestyle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">it was a suite of settings worth fiddling with</a></span> to get the most out of specific games. It’s just, with the new Nvidia App, the setting is set to on by default, and whatever fancy new “AI-powered” elements it includes are causing these significant hits to performance, even when it’s sitting idly in the background. Nvidia told <em>Tom’s Hardware</em> that they’re now aware of the issue, and in the meantime explain how to switch it off:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p> You can turn off Game Filters from the NVIDIA App Settings &gt; Features &gt; Overlay &gt; Game Filters and Photo Mode, and then relaunch your game.</p></blockquote><p>Of course, there’s an even more effective means of avoiding the issues: you can just uninstall the app altogether. As someone who has become lazily reliant on GeForce Experience/Nvidia App to notify me when a new Nvidia driver is available (something you really do need to stay on top of if you want to avoid issues with the latest games), it’s become a default application on my PC. It’s a useful reminder that you don’t actually <em>need</em> it—<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/geforce/drivers/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/geforce/drivers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">you can just visit Nvidia’s driver page</a></span> and download the latest drivers whenever you fancy. Like we all did in the Olden Days.</p><p>(Nvidia, despite wholly retiring Experience with the latest driver release, still hasn’t updated many of its web pages to acknowledge this, the driver site still suggesting you install it, while explanatory pages about the Game Filters all list it as an Experience feature.)</p><p>A 15-percent increase in dropped framerates is more significant than it might first sound. As <em>Tom’s Hardware </em>usefully explains, the difference in performance between the super-fancy RTX 4060 Ti and the $100-cheaper RTX 4060 is 18 percent.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

From irritating bugs, to poor matchmaking, to kernel-level anti-cheat issues, there’s something for everyone to gripe about!</p><p>But first, let’s quickly review the many positive reviews users have left on Steam. Perhaps the biggest boon <em>Delta Force</em> offers is allowing those who feel disassociated with the <em>Battlefield </em>franchise a chance at rekindling their love for large-scale first-person shooters. The game offers up a lot of freedom: Want to jump from a helicopter while firing a rocket launcher at ground troops? . <em>Delta Force</em> delivers that. But more importantly, players love the feel, the optimization, and the sheer amount of opportunity in the game’s weapons, maps, and modes.</p><p>It’s not all sunshine on the battlefield, though. Many players find they cannot enjoy the experience because it feels like a cheap knockoff of their beloved franchise. Some point toward gun recoil ruining the experience, the presence of too many useless gadgets, and the game’s anti-cheat system, which the developer had to rectify in a post-launch update.</p><p><br>No matter which side of the fence you inevitably fall on, there’s no reason not to try <em>Delta Force</em>. It’s a free-to-play game with no pay-to-win mechanics. Plus, the developer resolved the anti-cheat software woes. Here’s your look at <em>Delta Force</em>, as told by Steam reviews! <br></p><hr><figure id="" data-id="803fabb66c8887edb7d2957af5b0cbbc" data-recommend-id="image://803fabb66c8887edb7d2957af5b0cbbc"

                <p>Industry analysis firm DFC Intelligence has released its 2024 market report and forecast, and despite the past two years of uncertainty, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-industry-layoffs-are-worse-than-ever-how-did-we-get-here/1100-6521799/" data-ref-id="1100-6521799">sweeping layoffs</a>, and studio closures, the industry is set to rebound. After two years of major growth fueled by the pandemic, and its subsequent slump, DFC predicts the industry will return to growth in 2025 and beyond.</p><p>As of 2024, the number of gamers worldwide is around 3.8 billion, a figure DFC expects to reach 4 billion--around half the global population--by 2028. Of that number, 10% are considered core gamers and account for 65% of video game spending, while the rest are considered casual gamers, many of whom only game on mobile devices and don't own any dedicated hardware.</p><p>Nintendo is set to be a major winner in the next few years, with its next console (<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">colloquially known as the Switch 2</a>) expected to release in 2025 with little competition from Sony or Microsoft. DFC predicts that the Switch 2 will sell 15-17 million units in 2025, and more than 80 million by 2028.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1323506270" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

and console software sales in 2023. The category includes not only video game consoles, but PC parts and accessories, and handheld devices like the Steam Deck. This trend is driven by the core gaming audience, especially PC players who see high-end gaming hardware as a status symbol. Despite the cost of some video game accessories and hardware, DFC points out that it is still far more affordable than other hobbies like "sports cars, arts/antique collecting, travel, skiing, golf etc."</p><p>Despite the favorable outlook for hardware sales, DFC is predicting that there will be a major loser in the next generation of console wars--which could be either Sony or Microsoft depending on a number of variables. Getting in early is likely to be the deciding factor, but DFC also says a portability feature, like the Switch's, could make a difference. At this point Sony has a slight advantage thanks to its loyal user base, while Microsoft could pivot to focus on software and distribution as the largest software publisher in the industry.</p><p>"Overall, 2025 is also shaping up to be one of the best years ever for new game releases," DFC adds, singling out the highly anticipated release of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi/" data-ref-id="5000-569323">GTA 6</a>, which is expected to break records. The firm also expects that new consoles from Microsoft and Sony will release sometime between 2026 and 2028, contributing to DFC's prediction that PC and console revenue will reach $200 billion a year by 2028.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/18/alien-rogue-incursion-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>An Alien VR game seems like a no brainer, especially as the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2014/10/03/alien-isolation-review/">Alien Isolation’s</a> VR prototype has become a cornerstone myth of virtual reality gaming. This is one of the biggest sci-fi horror franchise of all time with iconic enemies, locations and weapons, and even the tracker ping is iconic. It’s a world just begging to be jammed in to a fancy headset. Alien: Rogue Incursion gets the the atmosphere right, but it’s more frustrating than scary to actually play.</p>
<p><iframe title="Alien: Rogue Incursion | Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bSTJ9RnDGfc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The game starts strong with ex-Colonial Marine Zula Hendricks literally in the hot seat of a transporter as it hurtles towards the planet Purdan – a planet which unsurprisingly looks a lot like LV-426. It’s cold and snowy with an abandoned Gemini Exoplanet Solutions research facility doing a very good impression of the colony from Aliens. You get a few moments peace before something dislodges some snow from a roof and there it is, a glistening black xenomorph, visible in the night for a few brief seconds before it skitters off in to the darkness with that classic terrifying scream.</p>


<p>The first encounter with a xenomorph is truly exhilarating as it scampers from the shadows, crawling around the sides of buildings before dropping to the ground and towering over you just as it should. Some well placed shots from the classic Pulse Rifle and you also learn the first annoying thing about the game: the Pulse Rifle kicks like a mule. Hold the trigger down and after less than a second it is firing bullets in the ceiling. This is because you are meant to be using two hands to steady the rifle, which is fine, but you need to hold the tracker in your other hand to work out where the xenomorphs are coming from, or have the map out to know where to go.</p>
<p>You’ll soon have other tools and extra weapons to juggle as you settle into a rhythm of moving between locations while fighting a few enemies,&nbsp;solving a fairly simple wiring puzzle, surviving a wave of creatures and moving on. The game is billed as having “most cunning Xenomorphs ever encountered” but it doesn’t take too long to realise that’s not true.</p>

<p>They will stalk you, scampering around in the ceiling and popping out of vents but when they decided to get close they always take a few seconds to hiss at you before they attack. They just stand there, arms outstretched like they’re coming in for a hug and always giving you a window of opportunity to unload a shotgun in their direction. You will also learn that, apart from a few key sequences, the xenos come in pairs so you know exactly how many there will be and how easy they are to kill, robbing them of their fear factor and making them more of a nuisance than anything else. You can also just away – they aren’t fast enough to catch up and kill you, so you can just leg it round most of the corridors and listen to them snarl in the distance.</p>

<p>If an encounter with an Alien gets a bit too close it will result in death (as it should) and there’s some delightfully gory sequences including watching an Alien tail burst through your stomach. If you die then you had better have manually saved your game in a Panic Room because the checkpointing is atrocious, you can lose a good twenty minutes of progress. Just to add to the annoyance, if you do try to run back to the nearest Panic Room the game may spawn a few extra xenomorphs so you have to lose precious ammo just to get a save. The game is tense, but it’s not because of the Aliens, it’s because you are worried you haven’t manually saved for a half an hour and die.</p>
<p>The game does have moments of brilliance though. One sequence in particular was genuinely sickening, and it’s followed by an exceptionally creepy stroll that was absolutely gripping. It does feel very much like you are in an Alien movie at this point – it’s wet and squelchy with things skittering overhead and hissing at your from ventilation shafts. It looks and sounds great with lots of effects for smoke and steam and some excellent heart racing music when you are being stalked.</p>
<p>Zula is partnered with Davis, an android who accompanies her physically for a short time, adding much needed firepower, before becoming the classic quest advisor on the radio. Their dialogue is mostly functional but we do occasionally get a little more of their personality so that they feel like firm friends by the end of the game.</p>

<p>The play area is fairly large which plenty of options to explore and uncover more the story via emails on terminals. However, as every single room and corridor is of the same general design it is very easy to get lost, especially when the map is so bad. Which reminds me, all the icons the map that show if there’s a terminal or a lift or a closed door, if you zoom out a bit and they all become plain white dots. There’s no way to know if you are running towards a lift that will save you from marauding creatures, or a locked door. What would have really helped is simple but effective sign posting in the world to telling you Medical is down the corridor to the right, then you don’t need to keep bringing up the map.</p>
<p>As you enter the end of the game it does pad things out by bringing you back to your ship then sending you out to the furthest reaches of the facility to complete an objective and there’s a lot of cycling through air locks and trying to remember where lifts are.</p>
<p>I did encounter a few bugs of the video game kind. Crawling into a vent got me completely stuck one time, an important object clipped through the floor and vanished, both requiring me to go back to a previous save, and my head was always level with the floor on the pause screen.</p>
<p>What is rather more annoying is the inaccuracy of the quest descriptions and map. Davis usually gives you a quick briefing on the next step, but the quest summary on your pad is very brief and missing important details, and the map markers are frequently wrong. I spent half an hour trying to deposit some canisters inside the loading bay on my ship, only to discover that you’re meant to go outside to a nondescript panel and punch a button before the canister receptacle will appear. The following mission had me go to Operations… but not the part of the map that’s clearly marked “Operations” a completely different place.</p>

<p>There’s a good game here – it looks and sounds fantastic and really captures the feel of the films – but there are so many little annoyances that it’s hard to like it. Rogue Incursion has you constantly juggling two-handed weapons, the motion tracker, mission object, and the touch screen map that requires two hands to use, and it’s just clumsy going back and forth all the time. Heck, the map doesn’t even auto-track your location, so you need to drop whatever else you’re holding just to scroll it.</p>
<p>All of this is probably fine when it’s a quick button press away, but annoying in VR. Not to mention that Zula is an ex-Marine. Give her a helmet with the tracker, an auto-scrolling map and the mission briefing on a HUD and you fix the vast majority of problems with the game and free up your hands for the important things – like aiming straight.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lost-soul-aside-release-window-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony and developer Ultizero Games have announced that long-awaited hack-and-slash action game <i>Lost Soul Aside&nbsp;</i>finally has a release window, and they've given us a fresh glimpse at some gameplay as well.</p>

<p>In a new trailer, the two studios confirm that the game is set for release on PC and PlayStation 5 in 2025, so let's hope that this time, we're finally going to be able to get our hands on this one.</p>

<p><em>Lost Soul Aside&nbsp;</em>has had a very lengthy development process indeed. It was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/impressive-one-man-project-lost-soul-aside-will-be-timed-exclusive-for-ps4" rel="nofollow">first announced</a> as part of the inaugural round of games in Sony's China Hero Project all the way back in 2016, at which point it was to be a timed exclusive on PS4.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lost-soul-aside-2025-release-window-boss.jpg?itok=4lC5Mr5U 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lost-soul-aside-2025-release-window-boss.jpg?itok=Wv2kdiym 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Lost Soul Aside&nbsp;</em>finally has a release window.</figcaption></figure><p>We got to hear more from the game last year, when a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lost-soul-aside-shows-gorgeous-graphics-amazing-action-in-new-rtx-trailer" rel="nofollow">new trailer was released during the ChinaJoy event in July</a>. That trailer was all about the ray tracing that will be featured in&nbsp;<em>Lost Soul Aside</em>, so perhaps we'll see this one get some <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ps5-pro-announced-november" rel="nofollow">PS5 Pro enhancements</a> as well.</p>

<p>As for details regarding the game's plot and moment-to-moment gameplay, Sony and Ultizero are remaining fairly tight-lipped for now. It'll be a hack-and-slash "action-adventure RPG", according to Ultizero, and it'll be a single-player game too.</p>

<p>Narrative-wise, you're out to "save your sister and the whole of humankind from dimensional invaders", so you can perhaps think of this one as a sort of cousin to&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade</em>, albeit one with perhaps less of an emphasis on <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/festive-stellar-blade-update" rel="nofollow">the main character's costumes</a>.</p>

<p>You can check out the new release window announcement trailer for&nbsp;<em>Lost Soul Aside&nbsp;</em>right here. It's got some nice stylish action for you to look at as well.</p>




<p><em>Lost Soul Aside&nbsp;</em>is due to arrive on PlayStation 5 and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3378960/Lost_Soul_Aside/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a> sometime next year. Stay tuned for more on this one.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-new-pre-wipe-event-cultists/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tarkov-pre-wipe-event-gives-cultists-marked-keys-and-100-spawn-rates.1064256/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-new-pre-wipe-event-cultists/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Battlestate Games has rolled out another pre-wipe event for Escape from Tarkov, introducing a 100% spawn rate (at night) for Cultists across their main maps: Shoreline, Customs, and Woods. The latest update has equipped many of these Cultists with Marked Keys, which as you might know, open doors to some of the most high-value locations in the game.</p>



<p>Most recently, players were tackling a pre-wipe event in Escape from Tarkov that required them to kill 30 enemies on the Factory map to unlock Kappa, one of the most sought-after items in the game.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-kill-cultists-make-gains">Kill Cultists, Make Gains</h2>



<p>This latest pre-wipe event for Tarkov comes with the following description on social media:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The losses of both PMC factions during night-time operations have increased. The old-timers believe that this is due to the pilgrimage of the so-called “witnesses” to their marked circles. </p>



<p>There are reports of many of those hooded people carrying marked keys. Despite the increased danger, PMCs are now preparing for night raids and taking advantage of the fact that Mechanic started selling NVGs at a great discount.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Now, the large maps that accommodate Cultists (so, not Ground Zero or Factory) will have a 100% spawn rate for the faction <strong>at night only</strong>. Also, Mechanic has massively discounted NVGs like the GPNVG-18, which is selling for just 43,000 roubles at the moment.</p>



<p>When you kill Cultists, you’ll have a solid chance of picking up a range of Marked Keys from their bodies, which you can then turn into some great loot. Bear in mind that you’ll be competing with thousands of other players to access these locations, though.</p>



<p>As expected, this pre-wipe event is only available for PvP players, because the game’s PvE mode doesn’t accommodate forced wipes, so a <strong>pre-wipe event </strong>doesn’t make much sense.</p>



<p>As a bonus, you can secure Cultist Knives and trade them with Mechanic for coloured keycards.</p>



<p>It’s expected that the next Escape from Tarkov wipe will arrive around Christmas. Are you ready? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-meta-may-have-a-new-champ-as-celebi-ex-dominates<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-tcg-pocket">Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket</a> received its first expansion yesterday in Mythical Island and the collection of new cards has shaken up the meta, seemingly pushing newcomer Celebi ex to the top.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Celebi ex is one of five ex Pokémon added in Mythical Island, a Themed Booster which brought 68 unique new cards to the digital trading card game. It's a basic Grass type with 130 Hit Points and a Weakness to Fire and a one Energy Retreat Cost.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Its single attack is called Power Bloom and costs one Grass Energy and one Colorless Energy, with the following effect: "Flip a coin for each Energy attached to this Pokémon. This attack does 50 damage for each heads."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/18/celebi-1734525066409.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: Creatures Inc.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This is okay by itself; it's on par with one meta leader Mewtwo ex's smaller attack, essentially averaging 50 damage for two Energy, but increasing it to, say four Energy, means it averages 100 damage. There is potential there for some devastating attacks, with four coin flips potentially presenting 200 (or zero) damage, but it's another Mythical Island card that boosts Celebi to the top.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Serperior is a Stage 2 Grass type with 110 HP, a weakness to Fire, and two Energy retreat cost. It has a single attack called Solar Beam which deals 70 damage for one Grass Energy and three Colorless Energy, which is well below the standard rate of damage.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But it also comes with an Ability, Jungle Totem: "Each Grass Energy attached to your Grass Pokémon procides two Grass Energy. This effect doesn't stack." This "stack" clause simply means that if two Serperior are on the board at the same time then only one of these effects will activate, but it otherwise doubles the value of every energy attached to other Grass Pokémon, including Celebi ex.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/18/serp-1734525066410.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: Creatures Inc.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Having Serperior on the bench, which will take a while given its a Stage 2 Pokémon and needs to be evolved twice, therefore essentially makes Celebi's Power Bloom card half the cost. One Grass Energy attached to it will result in two coin flips, for between zero and 100 damage, two Grass Energy will mean four coin flips for between zero and 200 damage, and so on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Exactly what cards are best around these two core pieces will be figured out by players in the coming days and weeks, but Lilligant from original set Genetix Apex may be a valuable inclusion. It's a Stage 1 Pokémon evolving from Petilil that has a two Grass Energy, 50 damage attack that also grants a Bench Pokémon a free Grass Energy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Putting it in play with a Celebi ex on the Bench, and building up to a Serperior at the same time, would let players pile Energy onto Celebi ex and then switch it in with the threat of doing serious damage, enough to take down the likes of Mewtwo ex and Charizard ex in one turn.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/18/lil-1734525172640.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: Creatures Inc.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This is the first deck from Mythical Island to emerge as a meta leader, capable of stacking up to these other dominant decks, but there are other changes already in place, including some that push down Pikachu ex.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-reveals-mew-led-set-coming-next-week-and-60-million-download-milestone">Mythical Island arrived December 17 and as a Themed Booster is a smaller set</a> compared to the debut Genetic Apex, containing a total of 86 cards.

            <p>Since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-gets-its-a-first-trailer-and-yes-ciri-is-the-star">The Witcher 4's impressive, ultra-high-fidelity debut trailer at The Game Awards</a> last week, there's been a fair bit of consternation from fans as to whether it'll actually be playable on current-gen hardware. That's something only compounded by the mention, in the trailer's small print and a brief <a href="https://press.cdprojektred.com/en/news/1702/the-witcher-iv-revealed-at-the-game-awards">official blog</a>, that the trailer was pre-rendered on a mysterious, "unannounced Nvidia GeForce RTX" graphics card, "using assets and models from the game itself" - suggesting at least some minor level of similarity to what the game will look like on arrival.</p>
<p>Developer CD Projekt Red also has some history with older console struggles of course, with the last-gen consoles of the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One proving hugely problematic for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>'s launch. The studio ultimately dropped them for the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty">Phantom Liberty</a> expansion that arrived in 2023.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-dev-cd-projekt-red-talks-ciri-fan-reaction-playable-geralt-coyness-and-if-the-game-will-honour-your-previous-choices">Speaking with CDPR in a new interview this week</a>, Eurogamer asked whether the studio could reassure console owners that they could actually run it - and whether it could run on, say, an Xbox Series S, which as things stand is still required for any game releasing on the Xbox Series X. The developers were a little coy in response.</p>
<p>"You know, first of all, this is good to say: this is not a kind of 'beginning of marketing' campaign," said <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a>'s game director, Sebastian Kalemba, referring to the trailer. "We firstly wanted to showcase and share with the entire world that: Ciri is the main protagonist; it's The Witcher 4; and she's mutated; and she's on The Path, definitely, right?"</p>
<p>Rather than specifically referencing concerns about certain consoles, Kalemba elaborated a little more, but only went as far as to mention it would be coming to the key platforms more broadly.</p>
<p>"The second thing is that, yes, we are working on a new engine right now, together with Epic's engineers, and there is a great synergy and a great collaboration between us. And currently we're working on Unreal Engine 5 and our custom build. And obviously we want to support all the platforms - meaning PC, Xbox and Sony, right? - but I cannot, right now, tell you more specifics regarding that."</p>
<p>He also stressed for a second time that this trailer was just a technical showpiece and "good benchmark" for now.</p>
<p>"For sure, it's definitely worth remembering [that for this] first time, we created the cinematic, pre-rendered, without post production piece, that we want to [show that we're] simply aspiring to achieve such quality in cinematics as much as possible. That's my opinion: it's a good benchmark."</p><p>The emphasis on this just being an early showcase, rather than a true 'beginning of marketing' campaign, brings to mind some comments from CDPR joint CEO Michał Nowakowski to Eurogamer recently, detailed more fully in our recent report on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/technical-ambition-optimism-and-timeframes-what-we-learned-about-the-witcher-4-from-speaking-to-cd-projekt-red">what we can expect from The Witcher 4</a>.</p>
<p>Speaking to Eurogamer earlier this summer, Nowakowski explained that while Phantom Liberty had a more truncated, six-month marketing campaign before its launch, "for a new game, we would still expect a slightly longer - but not two-year - lasting campaign." (The two years it took for Cyberpunk 2077 was down to its delays, he explained, with the studio originally planning something closer to 12 to 18 months from its big Keanu Reeves moment at E3 to launch.)</p>
<p>Nowakowski also referred to as a marketing "mass attack" being the main kick-off point for that less-than-two-year run up to launch. "Having said that, I want to stress: it doesn't mean we would not tease or drop some cool assets before [a full reveal]. Because the marketing campaign, slightly earlier before the launch of the game, that's different than the actual, say, 'mass attack'. Mass attack is when you announce the date, you start collecting the pre-orders and it really is that race from that point, that moment, to the moment you launch the game."</p>
<p>For example, he continued at the time, "If I ask you, what do you know about The Witcher 4? The answer is not much, probably - yes, there's theories and so on. But there's nothing really specific. So we want to drop the crumbs here and there so that people - and the media as well - can, you know, pick up on it and try to figure out what it is we're trying to say this time. So that [is something] we can start doing a little bit earlier." That would involve aspects such as "having some video assets, or something to whet the appetite of the fans - not even to create the hype so much," he said, as to simply get the early conversations flowing.</p><p>More simply: it might be reasonable to infer that this first trailer would count as one of those "cool assets" releasing as an earlier tease - establishing we're playing as Ciri, and some basic foundations of lore such as her having become a fully fledged witcher - but still coming a little way before that roughly 18-month countdown.</p>
<p>Coming back to the consoles, there's also some interesting context in the form of CDPR vice president of technology Charles Tremblay's comments to Eurogamer earlier this year. There, Tremblay noted that the studio's next game likely wouldn't launch on just PC. "I don't think this is a strategy we want to adopt right now. That being said, will it mean that we will have - let's say there were 20 platforms available - we'll have 20 at launch? Maybe not. But at least PC only, and then scattered, it's not necessarily the approach we want to go forward, for sure."</p>
<p>He also noted that the studio now develops all of its games on the "lowest" spec hardware, such as consoles, at the same time as it does on PC, rather than its old method of working to PCs first and going backwards from there - one of the many causes for Cyberpunk's launch woes.</p>
<p>Console versions "working super late" are now "unacceptable," he explained. "It's part of our process; we do the reviews on console so we know exactly where we are on all the platforms, [including] the lowest [spec] platform we have, rather than saying, 'PC's fine, we can go forward'."</p><p>With the process applied across all of the studio's upcoming games, it makes for an interesting situation with The Witcher 4. If the studio's hesitant to commit to its viability on current-gen platforms (albeit not ruling that out of course), and it also now develops games on the lowest-spec platforms alongside high end PCs, what might those platforms be here? Going from what CD Projekt Red's said so far, we might be waiting a fair bit longer to find out.</p>
<p>In the meantime, our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-dev-cd-projekt-red-talks-ciri-fan-reaction-playable-geralt-coyness-and-if-the-game-will-honour-your-previous-choices">full interview with CD Projekt Red about The Witcher 4</a> has more crumbs of detail, while our report on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/technical-ambition-optimism-and-timeframes-what-we-learned-about-the-witcher-4-from-speaking-to-cd-projekt-red">the studio's technical ambition, optimism, and development timeframes</a> and our full long read on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saving-cyberpunk-2077-how-cd-projekt-red-recovered-from-one-of-video-games-most-disastrous-launches">what went wrong with Cyberpunk 2077 and how the studio responded</a> offer plenty more context on how CDPR works today.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/path-of-exile-2-update-010e<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Grinding Gear Games has released&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile&nbsp;</em><em>2&nbsp;</em>update 0.1.0e, and it's designed to introduce several oft-requested quality-of-life features to the action RPG, including checkpoint fast travel and more.</p>

<p>The update introduces the ability to travel between an area's checkpoints, and more checkpoints have also been added to areas "generally at all the entrances and exits", so traveling around an area should be a little less painful now.</p>

<p>On the whole, this update is focused on adding lots of little changes to make your&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile 2&nbsp;</em>experience smoother, rather than one or two bigger additions. It's all in keeping with the promise made by Grinding Gear last week to&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/path-of-exile-2-devs-feedback-early-access" rel="nofollow">address user feedback and implement changes</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/path-of-exile-2-update-0.1.0e-forest.jpg?itok=-Cr6spvP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/path-of-exile-2-update-0.1.0e-forest.jpg?itok=8tSksYdi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Path of Exile 2</em>'s latest update adds a ton of quality-of-life features.</figcaption></figure><p>Various changes have been made to&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile 2</em>'s endgame content as well, and its monster balance has also been addressed. Monsters will now deal 40% less bonus damage from critical strikes, for instance, while higher-tier maps no longer have extra elemental resistance penalties.</p>

<p>You'll also find a ton of changes to individual classes and skills, with lots of abilities' damage values and effects being changed to improve the difficulty curve.</p>

<p>There are far too many tweaks in update 0.1.0e to list here, but you can check out the full&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile 2&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3645467" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">patch notes</a> if you want to read everything that's new. If you're a buildcraft hound, I'd recommend doing so.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile 2</em>, it's an action RPG that serves as a followup to 2013's popular&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile</em>. Originally planned as a major expansion of the original game, it was instead <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/path-of-exile-2-will-be-standalone-game-closed-beta-date-gameplay-revealed" rel="nofollow">revealed to be a full sequel in July last year</a>.</p>




<p>The sequel released in Early Access <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/path-of-exile-2-early-access-release-delayed" rel="nofollow">earlier this month</a>, proving so popular that its developers <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/path-of-exile-2-early-access-server-issues-warning" rel="nofollow">expressed concern</a> regarding whether or not the game's servers would be able to hold up. Luckily, it seems those issues didn't manifest to any significant degree at launch.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile 2&nbsp;</em>right now on PC <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2694490/Path_of_Exile_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">via Steam Early Access</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/path-of-exile-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/path-of-exile-2/9ND8N4RW5GHX" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

            <p>Will Wright, creator of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/video-game-franchises/the-sims">The Sims</a> and co-founder of its developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/maxis">Maxis</a>, has shared fresh details of his forthcoming AI life sim, Proxi.</p>
<p>The game was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spore-and-sims-creator-will-wright-unveils-proxi">first announced back in 2018</a> and a gameplay trailer was shared a month ago by its developer Gallium Studio to explain its concept. Then yesterday, Wright appeared on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a> to discuss development of the game (as spotted by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/life-sim/the-sims-designer-will-wright-is-making-his-next-life-sim-more-personal-by-building-it-with-your-actual-memories-no-game-designer-has-ever-gone-wrong-by-overestimating-the-narcissism-of-their-players/">PC Gamer</a>).</p>
<p>Proxi is a dreamlike life sim where players seemingly train an AI to create worlds from their memories. Players record a memory through text, known as a "mem", which the game interprets and forms into an animated scene using assets created by the developers (and eventually players too).</p>

<p>These scenes can then be edited by players to tweak the details. Then players "train your Proxi's mind with each new memory" by placing them on a memory timeline and mindmap to create connections.</p>
<p>Players also place these memories into a private mind-world made of terraformable hexagons, while sentiment analysis will alter the world according to the emotions of memories placed within. Shared worlds will also be possible, constructed with others.</p>
<p>The trailer shows players can add Proxies of friends and family to their world, play games together, and export them to other worlds - Minecraft and Roblox are used as examples.</p>
<p>On the <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2329386880">BreakthroughT1D Twitch stream</a>, Wright explained why he wanted to use the real memories of players for a personal experience.</p>
<p>"I found myself getting continuously closer and closer to the player," he said. "Kind of a saying I've lived by, which is that no game designer has ever gone wrong by overestimating the narcissism of their players."</p>
<p>He laughed: "It goes to figure that the more I can make a game about you, the more you'll like it."</p>
<p>BreakthroughT1D is a global organisation funding research into type one diabetes, with a Twitch channel of talk shows and podcasts. The stream was hosted by Simmers Arielehm and Emily Morganti.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.galliumstudios.com/">studio website</a> states Proxi is coming soon and doesn't list platforms.</p>
<p>Wright appears keen for Proxi to explore the varying perceptions and philosophy of memory. It certainly seems like a powerful tool and a clever concept, though six years after its initial reveal the perception of AI has drastically changed. I suspect Gallium Studio has an uphill battle explaining Proxi in full.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/game-of-the-year-2024-%E2%80%93-best-remake-or-remaster.1064220/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/18/game-of-the-year-2024-best-remake-or-remaster/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>It’s that time of year again where we take a little break from endlessly looking forward to the Next Big Thing, and instead look in the rear view mirror at all of the Next Big Things that came out over the past twelve months. That’s right, it’s time for our Game of the Year 2024 awards to get started.</p>
<p>But we’re going to start things off once again by looking even further back into the past. Kind of. Best Remake or Remaster has become one of the most over-stuffed categories we have, with developers and publishers keen to make the most of what they already have.&nbsp;Some remasters are slavishly faithful on a technical level, some remakes are ambitious reimaginings, others are quick and breezy ports for newer systems.</p>
<p>What stood out most for us this year?</p>

<p>The Persona franchise is well known as a Japanese school life simulator with surprisingly dark undertones, and Persona 3 was quite possibly the darkest of the lot, with death, sacrifice and the cost of victory being front and centre. Even your attack in this turn-based RPG involves putting a gun to your head and pulling the trigger.</p>

<p>Faced with mortal peril, your resolve to live and fight bursts forth as your Persona — your ‘other self’ that wields arcane power — to fight the baddies and save the day.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/01/30/persona-3-reload-review/">Persona 3 Reload</a> takes this fan-favourite and improves almost every aspect of it, reviving and revamping it for modern consoles and modern players. The remastered music is incredible. The visuals (including the obligatory anime sections) are absolutely stunning, and the gameplay takes the lessons learned in the past few releases and applies them here as well.</p>
<p>Persona 3 Reload is a stunningly good game. It will make you laugh, it will make you choke up and it will stick in your head for years to come. If you’ve enjoyed other Atlus games, you will absolutely love this.</p>
<p><em>– Nic B</em></p>
<h2>Silent Hill 2 – Runner Up</h2>
<p>Bloober Team had some convincing to do with their remake of the classic <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/14/silent-hill-2-2024-review/">Silent Hill 2</a>, but any concerns proved to be unfounded once we got our hands on the finished game. Bloober took everything that made the original such a historic title and updated it for a contemporary audience, beefing up the combat, the exploration, and obviously taking full advantage of the technological developments since the original released.</p>
<p>The end result is a game that feels like Silent Hill 2 but the way that you remember it rather than through nostalgic rose-tinted glasses. Incredible graphics bring the town to brutal, foggy life whilst the voice acting is genuinely superb. All of this excellent presentation is topped off by some of the best audio design I’ve heard in years and another fantastic soundtrack by series stalwart Akira Yamaoka. The remake is so polished and brings out the best of a game that was already a genre classic, leaving us wondering only one thing – when will they remake the first Silent Hill?</p>
<p><em>– Steve C</em></p>
<h2>Sonic X Shadow Generations – Runner Up</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/21/sonic-x-shadow-generations-review/">Sonic X Shadow Generations</a> isn’t just a remaster, there’s also a whole new game bolted in alongside the 13 year old platformer, giving the dark and moody Shadow the Hedgehog the Generations treatment and taking a trip through his past as well.</p>
<p>Sonic Generations is still one of the best Sonic games in recent memory, but Shadow Generations adds an extra layer of refinement and polish that help to tip it over the edge, particularly with improvements to level design and with Shadow’s own abilities – slowing down time is always cool in games, even when you’re a broody hedgehog. Speaking of which, you can have Keanu Reeves voicing Shadow in it courtesy of a tie-in DLC with release of the latest Sonic movie.</p>
<p>Yes, really.</p>

			<p>Lost Soul Aside, the action-adventure role-playing game that's been in development for a long time by UltiZero Games as part of Sony's China Hero Project, will require a PlayStation Network account on PC.</p>
<p>Earlier today, the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3378960/Lost_Soul_Aside/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam store page</a> went live, providing a general overview of the game, some new screenshots, and the confirmation that the game will be published next year by PlayStation Publishing. As such, the game will require a PlayStation Network account to play on PC, just like the most recent titles released by the publisher on PC, such as Ghost of Tsushima: Director's Cut, God of War Ragnarok, and Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered.</p>
<p>Shortly after the Lost Soul Aside Steam store page went up, a new trailer was shared online, providing a new quick look at the game and its intense<a href="https://wccftech.com/lost-soul-aside-new-gameplay-2/"> character action-like combat </a>and confirming its 2025 release window. You can check out the new trailer below.</p>

			<p>The PC release of Final Fantasy VII Rebirth will allow the game to shine, and some of its visual settings and features will scale beyond what was possible on PlayStation 5 with the appropriate hardware.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-is-officially-coming-to-pc-and-the-epic-games-store?lang=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games</a> regarding the game as a whole and its PC release coming next month, director Naoki Hamaguchi confirmed that the lighting rendering has been greatly adjusted for the PC version of the game, addressing one of the most common complaints about the PlayStation 5 release. In addition, the game will feature even richer 3D models and texture resolutions on high-end hardware that couldn't be processed on PlayStation 5.</p>
<p>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth on PC will also feature, as confirmed in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-to-launch-on-pc-on-january-23rd-with-improved-lighting-enhanced-textures-and-nvidia-dlss-support/">reveal trailer</a>, NVIDIA DLSS, and VRR support, alongside graphical presets perfect for those who do not want to tinkle with graphics settings too much. Further granular options will also be available, so the PC version of the second entry in the series should have way more options than those offered in the disappointing PC port of Final Fantasy VII Remake.</p>
<p>The Final Fantasy VII Rebirth director also commented on mods, saying that the game won't have official mod support but that the development team welcomes user modifications, except for inappropriate mods, which the director asks modders not to make. Seeing how it went with Final Fantasy XVI, however, Hamaguchi-san shouldn't get his hopes up.</p>
<p>Unlike Final Fantasy XVI, whose additional PC features eventually made their way onto the PS5 release, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth will not launch with anything of the sort, although the team did have to resist the urge to add new content. Originally, they wanted to add an episodic story as a new DLC, but ultimately decided that finishing the final game in the trilogy was the highest priority, also considering limited resources. However, if the team receives strong requests from players after the PC release regarding certain matters, most likely including the additional story DLC, they would like to consider them, so there's still the possibility of maybe being able to see Cid or Vincent in action before the launch of the third part of the remake, as was done with Yuffie with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-fixed-doors-and-flying-ninjas/">INTERmission DLC</a>, which turned out great.</p>
<p>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is now available on PlayStation 5. The game launches on PC on January 23rd.</p>

Original developer Guerrilla Games has its hands full with the Horizon Online project and the inevitable <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/live-service-game-horizon-online-reportedly-guerrillas-next-project-horizon-3-might-be-a-ways-off">Horizon 3</a>, so any new game would probably have to come from another developer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <p>Fists up, a big fighting game mod is due out this weekend. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvel-vs-capcom-infinite">Marvel vs Capcom Infinite</a> came out in 2017 and got some flak for its plastic figurine art style. But this year a modder <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-modder-is-beautifying-marvel-vs-capcom-infinite-with-cel-shaded-visuals">began work on an overhaul</a> that would grant the game pretty cel-shaded visuals. Since then the modding team has grown to 40 people and the scope of the mod's features has ballooned. It's now going to include new moves, stages, costumes, and a chaotic-looking 2v2 multiplayer tag team mode. All good news for biff 'em up sickos, as the mod is due to release on Friday. </p>

<p>They're calling the mod "Marvel Vs Capcom Infinite And Beyond". Worth noting that Buzz Lightyear is not a character within either universe but we'll let that go. The trailer above shows off a lot of thick black outlines, halftone effects, and a flash of Venom as he dons a cute baby blue symbiote. You can also catch a glimpse of an alternate costume for Spider-Man - the get-up of British quipster Spider-Punk, who appeared in the most recent animated webslinger flick Spider-Man: Across the Spiderverse. Cool.</p>
<p>We spy some of those new arenas too, which we're told are "nods" to stages previously used in the series. I don't play a whole heap of MvC, so I only recognise the wireframe training room from Street Fighter. Please don't take my biff 'em up badge. I worked so hard for it.</p><p>You'll be able to grab the mod on <a href="https://www.mvcib.com/">the team's website</a> when it launches on December 20th, the creators say. "This was a labor of love from nearly 40 people over 8 months of work," said Maximillian Dood, a streamer who commissioned the principal modder to continue work on the mod after <a href="https://x.com/maximilian_/status/1785829442780274830">catching wind of it back in May</a>.</p>
<p>So there you go. It's a neat overhaul. The cel-shaded style is used well to evoke manga and anime in the Arc System Works fighting games such as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/guilty-gear-strive-">Guilty Gear Strive</a>, so it makes perfect sense to me that an MvC game would look swish when done in a similar style.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Helldivers 2 has just released their first official crossover with none other than Killzone 2.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Helldivers 2 x Killzone 2 collaboration is <a href="https://x.com/helldivers2/status/1869324489391268335" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">now live</a>, bringing some uniquely-themed cosmetics to the Superstore for players to grab. Apart from the new cosmetics, players also have the chance to receive an additional Killzone 2 reward, depending on their success with the ongoing Galatic War. Check out all the new Helldivers 2 x Killzone 2 cosmetics below.&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>AC-1 Dutiful (Armor Set)</li>



<li>StA-52 Assault Rifle (Primary Weapon)</li>



<li>Strength In Our Arms (Player Banner)</li>



<li>Strength In Our Arms (Cape)&nbsp;</li>



<li>Assault Infantry (Player Title)&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>Apart from the Helldivers 2 x Killzone collaboration, Arrowhead has provided some new details about the Superstore. Player feedback has made them realise that “items are in rotation for too short a time”. Hence, the developers will temporarily test longer rotations, with Killzone cosmetics sticking around for 5 days per page.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The collaboration with Killzone 2 was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/killzone-helldivers-warbond-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaked a few days ago</a>; however, at the time, it was believed that two Armour Sets would make their way to the Superstore. In other news, check out Helldivers 2’s latest major update, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-omens-of-tyranny-announced-and-released/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Omens of Tyranny</a>.&nbsp;</p>

In October of this year, we got a look at some <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/new-trailer-for-mass-effect-wannabe-exodus-features-space-capable-flesh-cathedral-whisperingly-described-by-matthew-mcconaughey">icky celestial faction</a> and zero in the way of actual gameplay. And now? <em>Now</em> we finally get a look at how you do things. Like sucker-punching armoured space bears in the face with electro-pistols.</p>

<p>What can we glean from it? It shares a similar over-the-shoulder look to Mass Effect, with a special "celestial tech" granting you the ability to freeze enemies, before shattering them into shards of charcoal. There's a pretty planet covered in sickly fog and a fight with an armoured space bear. The key to beating the bear is to bash it in the head. There is also an inquisitive frog in a vat of water, as well as a larger frog who is more menacing.</p><p>On a more serious note, this "celestial tech" seems to be the crux of the combat. Allowing you to turn your arm into a temporary energy blade, while your offhand provides the grappling hook goodness to flank or reposition. The protag's gun also morphs, transforming from a shotgun in the first bit, into a grenade launcher later and rifle later on. I'm unsure how exactly your pals help you out in the more explosive moments or whether you can direct them, as they're not really the focal point of this trailer. You do see them do a bit of shooting and a bit of stealthing, though.</p>
<p>It's hard to get a sense for the writing off only the shortest snippets, but from a general vibe sort of view, I think it looks like a 7/10 special. Not that this is a bad thing at all! 7/10 games are some of the very best, in my opinion.</p>
<p>There's no release date on Exodus yet, but you can follow the game over on its <a href="https://www.exodusgame.com/en-US">official site</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

After much teasing, the vicious tyrants of Arrowhead Games and their noxious puppets, the "democratic government" of Super Earth, have announced the very first <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> licensed crossover. In yet another hollow display of solidarity and "Liber-tea", they've teamed up with the loathsome fascists of Killzone, the elderly shooter series from Sony and Guerrilla Games.</p>
<p>From today, you'll be able to buy weapons, armour and cosmetics belonging to Killzone's despicable stormtroopers from the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a> Superstore, and there's the suggestion of an additional Killzone-themed reward depending on the fortunes of the so-called Galactic War, a xenocidal bloodbath couched as an exercise in bringing "freedom" to the upstanding socialist Automatons, the blameless wildlife of the Tyranids, and the Wellsian cosplayers of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2s-update-adds-the-dreaded-illuminate-faction-plus-city-maps-and-bouncy-jeeps">the recently added Illuminate faction</a>.</p>
<p>We here at Rock Paper Shotgun stand against Super Earth and Arrowhead's wanton aggression, which absolutely isn't a big satirical joke based on some Verhoeven film or other. Anyway, those capes. Find an image and further details below.

If you've not played Killzone, it used to be Sony's silver bullet in the battle against Halo, Gears and Call of Duty for control of shooterdom. It's a natural choice of licensing partner for Helldivers, being a series about a pseudo-World-War clash between intergalactic space empires, one of which was briefly ruled by Logan Roy. 
</p><p>
I was nuts about Killzone 2, which released in 2009 and was one of the first "big" games I ever reviewed. It was notorious for an E3 2005 trailer featuring pre-rendered footage made to look like real-time gameplay. In practice, it proved to be a perfectly OK FPS with thunderous grimdark set-dressing and a mildly confuzzling first-person cover system. The mainline sequels Killzone 3 and Shadowfall are straightforward examples of the law of diminishing returns, with spin-offs Mercenary and Liberation being respectable handheld shooters. They're all exclusive to Sony consoles, so this Helldivers 2 crossover is, I guess, Killzone's formal debut on PC. Hmm, I should put that in the headline.
</p>
<p>
The Helldivers X Killzone goodies form "a new tier of special Premium content" on the Superstore. There's been some blowback from the diver community about both the pricing and the fact of selling primary weapons as DLC. The second part of the crossover deal arrives on 23rd December, and then there are those hints in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/516322672418750491">the Steam announcement blog</a> about "an additional Killzone 2 reward for all Helldivers depending on your success in the Galactic War". 
</p>
<p>
Arrowhead have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-boss-would-love-to-do-a-take-on-star-wars-predator-and-warhammer-40000">any number of crossover collaborations</a> in mind for Helldivers 2. For a time, they envisaged a system that would effectively let individual Helldivers <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-devs-once-planned-a-licensed-cosmetic-system-that-basically-let-you-hallucinate-a-different-world">hallucinate licensed worlds</a>, with map cosmetics that are invisible to their non-buyer comrades. I'm not wildly excited to see Killzone's militaristic trappings in action once again, but one Killgadget I'd love Helldivers 2 to implement is Killzone 2's open-roofed infantry dropships. Check them out in the aforesaid E3 2005 trailer, below. Now, imagine riding one of those to the surface of Vindemaitarix Prime.
