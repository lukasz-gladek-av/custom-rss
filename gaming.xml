            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/18/square-enix-investigate-final-fantasy-16-crashes-and-graphics-after-ps5-system-update/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Square Enix has acknowledged and opened an investigation into reports of game crashes and graphical issues in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/final-fantasy-16">Final Fantasy 16</a>, problems which have seemingly emerged following <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/12/ps5-system-update-adds-customisable-welcome-hub-personalised-3d-audio-more/">the recent PlayStation 5 system software update</a>.</p>
<p>Writing on the Final Fantasy 16 <a href="https://x.com/finalfantasyxvi/status/1835956338180214969">Twitter</a> account, the company said, “Following the recent release of the PlayStation 5 system update, there have been reports of the game crashing and graphical issues.</p>


<p>“We are currently working with SIE to investigate, and sincerely apologize for any inconvenience caused.</p>
<p>“Please await our further updates.”</p>
<p>The latest PS5 firmware update was released last week, with Sony laying the foundations for a global rollout of a new customisable Welcome Hub, and direct party invite sharing with links. Additionally, the personalised 3D audio system that was in testing for the last few months with users has now gone live for all players.</p>

<p>However, console system updates also include a lot of behind the scenes changes that can affect game performance, providing system-level optimisations for specific games, new API hooks and more – they’re similar to installing driver updates on PC, or new versions of Windows. Sony doesn’t detail the changes made to that level of granularity, but it’s entirely possible that something they’ve done has not played well with Final Fantasy 16’s game engine – an adapted version of the engine used for Final Fantasy 14, as opposed to the Luminous Engine for FF15 and Forspoken, or Unreal Engine, which is used with the FF7 remakes.</p>
<p>The timing for this is rather unfortunate, since Square Enix posted the acknowledgement between all the promotional efforts for the Final Fantasy 16 PC release – it launched yesterday, 17th September.</p>
<p>It was also our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/12/29/game-of-the-year-2023-best-playstation-game-ps5-psvr2/">PlayStation Game of the Year for 2023</a>, with Nic saying in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/06/21/final-fantasy-16-review/">our review</a>, “If you’re a fan of strong narrative experiences, Final Fantasy lore, breath-taking graphics and a particularly sassy Moogle, and you don’t mind a sprinkling of The Witcher, The Handmaids Tale and the many accents of Old Blighty, then Final Fantasy XVI is the game for you. Heck, it might just be the best Final Fantasy yet!”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/four-development-studios-working-on-new-battlefield-game/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During EA's <a href="https://ir.ea.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2024/Electronic-Arts-Outlines-Long-Term-Growth-Strategy-at-Investor-Day/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Investor Day</a>, one of the big topics there was the new and upcoming Battlefield game. At the moment, the details regarding the game are relatively slim pickings. However, during the EA Investor Day, fans got to hear some details about the development process for the upcoming Battlefield game. So far, it's been specified that four development studios are working on this project in total, all taking more time for the development cycle.</p>
<p><iframe title="Electronic Arts - Investor Day 2024" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hsvX8NMGUxI?start=2412&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Introducing the <a href="https://wccftech.com/vince-zampella-confirms-next-battlefield-will-use-modern-setting/">Battlefield topic</a> in the Investor Day video, Laura Miele begins by saying, "No franchise captures that feeling of all-out warfare, epic scale, massive destruction, and high-intensity action like Battlefield." In the video, she acknowledges that the franchise has been successful due to leaning on those core tenets but admits that some of the games they have produced in the franchise have missed the mark, especially Battlefield 2042.</p>
<p>To ensure that this next game in the iconic shooter franchise is much better and more suited to the Battlefield audience, there have been "significant shifts in their approach" when developing the upcoming Battlefield game. They have been working with the community for the past year and getting feedback and ideas from them to help make the best experience for the players.</p>
<p>Byron Beede also commented on the development of Battlefield, discussing how each of the four studios plays a role in developing the game's universe. He first stated that DICE will lead the charge on multiplayer, with Criterion driving content experiences across singleplayer and multiplayer. Third, Motive will use its storytelling and action skills to provide a meaty campaign for players to explore. Lastly, Ripple Effect is instead working on a new Battlefield experience, which is "fueled by the unique Battlefield DNA that's been testing really well with players."</p>
<p>The Battlefield Central Tech team powers all of the development of the upcoming Battlefield game, with their focus on "enabling these developers with the technology and tools they need to unlock their capabilities." Byron Beede enthusiastically states "All of this with the full force of EA, we have the largest, strongest and most focused team in the history of Battlefield."</p>
<p>To keep the focus on the game, the developers have been playing the game nearly every day for well over a year, with a strong focus on software stability. In the future, they will test widely with players while gaining feedback on gameplay, performance, and the fun factors of the game.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bushido-the-awoken-themed-warband-review.984468/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/bushido-awoken-themed-warband-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Kumo have awoken and they seek to take back the Jwar Isles, enslaving and turning its inhabitants. In this article, we'll look at the new faction for Bushido, The Awoken, and their Joyless Smiles and Dark Eyes-Themed Warband starter set. We'll check out at what's in the box, and where to go from there.</p>
<p>We've been covering <em>Bushido&nbsp;</em>for years, so if you'd like to learn more about the game, check out <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/guides/bushido-risen-sun-guide" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our guide to <em>Bushido Risen Sun</em></a>, our <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/bushido-two-player-starter-set-review" rel="noopener" target="_blank">review of the <em>Bushido Risen Sun</em>&nbsp;2-player starter set</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/start-collecting-bushido-risen-sun-part-1-introduction-and-developer-interview" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our "Start Collecting" guide to <em>Bushido</em></a>, which includes an interview with the game's developer.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/Inari%27s%20Judgement%20%281%29.jpg?itok=HIZRB8L7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/Inari%27s%20Judgement%20%281%29.jpg?itok=NZXYfWyT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>What's a Themed List in Bushido?</h2>
<p>When selecting a warband in <em>Bushido</em>, you must first choose a faction from the now 13 available to select your fighters from. Each faction also has access to theme cards, which offer special abilities, but restrict the units that can be included in the warband. The Awoken are a faction for <em>Bushido</em>, and Joyless Smiles and Dark Eyes is a theme card.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-awoken-5.jpg?itok=SP6_SAGM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-awoken-5.jpg?itok=493Dz1VI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Who Are The Awoken?</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Softly through the shadows, they come, The Awoken, spinning death, dread and corruption in their silken webs. Not even the empire of flesh can withstand their potent venom with just a single bite undoing all the gods have wrought. They creep ever closer, viewing the empire and Jwar through numerous eyes, choosing their prey carefully, assembling a host that thinks as one under the control of a powerful force older than time itself. Sleep not, for The Awoken are everywhere, lurking in the twilight, biding their time, ensnaring us one by one, and reshaping the world in their terrifying image.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Awoken are an entirely new faction for <em>Bushido Risen Sun, </em>and Joyless Smiles and Dark Eyes is their first theme card. This theme card allows you to distribute Ki tokens to friendly Kumo models for each enemy that is in their Webbed Ground terrain and also gives enemy models a Ki Block marker if they have a poison marker.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-awoken-1.jpg?itok=TTfHgI88 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-awoken-1.jpg?itok=7GKCsmpu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Why Play The Awoken?</h2>
<p>The Awoken are a new and terrifying faction for <em>Bushido Risen Sun</em>. You would think they would fit under the also creepy Cult of Yurei, which includes the occult spirits and monsters of Asian myth, but GCT has made them their own faction, with their own unique playstyle.</p>
<p>The Kumo are human spider hybrids, some more spider than human in the various stages of transformation. As you would expect with a spider-like faction, they focus on slowing down their prey with webs and dealing damage slowly over time with poison. The Kumo also don't generate Ki, which is used to power special abilities, each turn like most <em>Bushido</em> fighters do. Instead, they gain Ki for enemies trapped in webs, and also for doing damage to them in combat.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-awoken-3.jpg?itok=y6-SZLp2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-awoken-3.jpg?itok=0J5db3kQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Where Should I Start With The Awoken?</h2>
<p>The only place to start with The Awoken currently is with the Joyless Smiles and Dark Eyes-themed box. This box contains 7 miniatures and has 1 theme card and 13 special cards, including a new Kumo Trait and Web Defence rules cards.</p>
<p>The units included in the Joyless Smiles and Dark Eyes-themed box are:</p>
<ul><li>Chinatsu, the Cold Anger - The largest of the Kumo in the box, Chinatsu has a ranged poison attack and the ability to stop any enemies performing scenario actions while within webbed ground (once per game), which can be used to entirely lock out your enemy with enough Webbed Ground markers on the board for a turn.</li>
<li>Aiumi, With No Compassion - Aiumi has the most effective ranged attack in the box, with Pierce(2) and Fire. They also have an aura ki feat that makes poisoned enemies weak, making it harder for them to damage your fighters. This combos nicely with another ki feat that lets them give a poison marker to an enemy in contact with webbed ground. And if they engage an enemy in contact with webbed ground, they gain Grapple Attack and Defence.</li>
<li>Eimi, of the Mind's World - Eimi messes with your opponent's unit's Ki, and has a ki feat that lets them steal 3 ki from an enemy within 8 inches, and another ki feat that puts a 4 inch aura around them, making poisoned enemies spend an additional ki to use ki abilities.</li>
<li>Tashi, the Eightfold Blessing - Tashi has a once-per-game ability that lets them move to any Webbed Ground terrain on the table, allowing you to set up some late-game shenanigans, leaping them across to score objectives. She also has a ki ability that stops all poisoned enemy fighters from using Special Abilities in ranged or melee attacks.</li>
<li>Kiyo, Who Sees Behind - Kiyo likes to lock down enemies, firstly by stopping them from gaining additional activations with a ki feat, and then through a ki feat pulse, giving out Immoblized markers to enemies failing a size test within 6 inches.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Hidemi - Hidemi is a human cultsit supporting the Kumo. They begin the game poisoned, which means they slowly die throughout the game. Hidemi comes armed with a melee and ranged weapon for supporting the more expensive Kumo fighters.</li>
<li>Banri - Banri, like Hidemi, is a human cultist who starts the game poisoned. While their are options for sacrificing your cultists for benefits, Banri also has an inbuilt ability to be sacrificed&nbsp;to give all Kumo in base-to-base contact 2 Ki and also heal 2 damage.</li>
</ul><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-awoken-4.jpg?itok=mtDGvRC5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-awoken-4.jpg?itok=aUis0oV- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>What Products Are Available For The Awoken And Where Should I Go Next?</h2>
<p>The only Awoken product released so far is the Joyless Smiles and Dark Eyes-themed warband, but two other profiles are available to see on the <em>Bushido</em> App, which hints at their future release:</p>
<ul><li>Akita, Princess of Fear and Pain - Akita is another large Kumo, but not as expensive as Chinatsu. Akita has a once-per-turn ki feat that allows them to roll dice equal to the number of Kumo in play, rerolling until you have unique dice between 2 and 6. Poisoned enemy models consider any dice they roll with the numbers shown to be 1 instead. This is a powerful ability that can shut down several of your opponent's fighters.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Ren - Ren is the cheapest unit available to the Awoken and is a full Kumo and not just a cultist. Ren has a ki feat that can reduce the move of an enemy by 3, and 2 melee attack options, Mandibles with Web Defence and Grapple Attack, or Atame with Ki Block, and Sidestep defence and +1 damage.</li>
</ul><h2>What Are Our Final Thoughts On The Awoken?</h2>
<p>Following my review of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/bushido-deep-themed-warband-review">The Deep</a> for <em>Bushido</em>, the Awoken are another fun combo-heavy faction. Like the Cult of Yurei, who focus on debuffing their enemies, the Awoken like to cover the board in webs, their opponents in poison markers, and then strike at their weakened state with their own fighters. They've got some very powerful abilities, but they don't feel overpowered, but they can feel a little oppressive to your opponent if they let them get on top of them. They're not an easy faction to pilot, but there is a lot of fun to be had with their initially available models, and it will be very interested to see where GCT goes with their future releases.</p>
<h2>Should I Buy The Awoken Theme Box?</h2>
<p>The Awoken are a very combo-heavy warband for Bushido, and if what I've described above sounds great to you, then you should definitely look at picking them up. They're a great time to start playing as you will be able to follow all their releases easily, as opposed to factions with a large amount of units available. Even if you're not looking at playing them, their miniatures are incredible, and will also suit many other systems (but you should absolutely be playing<em> Bushido Risen Sun</em>).</p>

Maybe it was the aesthetic of the gun, which looked like it was carved from the skin of a Hive grunt, that made me love it. Maybe it was its particularly wide spread that made it such a potent bruiser when I inevitably got too close to a powerful enemy. Maybe it’s all in the name—Swordbreaker goes pretty hard as far as weapon names go. What I do know for sure is that Swordbreaker was never a “meta” weapon that I pulled out because it’d guarantee me kills in PvE or PvP content. It was just a shotgun I was rewarded with for completing one of <em>Destiny</em>’s many adventures, and it’s the one weapon that stood out above the rest. Whether it was as a fashion piece or a display of power, Swordbreaker came to mean something to me.</p><p><em>Destiny </em>and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/destiny-2&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/destiny-2">its sequel</a></span><em> </em>have always prided themselves on gear like Swordbreaker—weapons that come with a story and help you tell one. Coming some years after the promise of several billions of “unique” guns in <em>Borderlands</em>, <em>Destiny </em>offered a bit of a different relationship to its equipment than similar loot-driven games. It offered a real connection to a definitive armory of some of the coolest guns and armor, rather than a randomized set of stats and buffs applied to basic archetypes. In comparison to most of its ilk, <em>Destiny </em>probably featured one of the smallest loot pools of any loot game out there, but it was also curated and <em>specific</em>. Rather than chafe against the audience, this helped grow the reputation of its loot and allowed players to nurture relationships with those individual pieces and build a history with them.</p><p>In order to earn Swordbreaker, you had to at least participate in the Crota’s End raid, a fairly straightforward, kind of unremarkable gauntlet. An auto rifle that I currently have in <em>Destiny 2</em> is a remnant from a dungeon I did years ago when I convinced my best friends to give the game a chance. My favorite pulse rifle in the game (Piece of Mind) has followed me for more than two years now, and the Choir of One exotic that has dominated my loadout for the last few weeks comes from the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-encore-overture-exotic-quest-walkthrough-1851644431&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-encore-overture-exotic-quest-walkthrough-1851644431">lengthy and difficult Encore mission</a></span> I recently undertook.

It helped me blast holes in enemies as I grinded for strike-specific loot from the Sunless Cell mission. It was my companion throughout the drought of content immediately after the aforementioned expansion and the “spring update” of 2016. And finally, we went on one last adventure together in the melancholic but awfully nostalgic <em>Rise of Iron </em>expansion<em>.</em> When the time came to move on to <em>Destiny 2</em>, I didn’t have the good fortune of being able to bring Swordbreaker with me, but that didn’t diminish the years it’d spent by my side.<em>&nbsp;</em><br></p><p><em>Destiny </em>wasn’t always great at cultivating that sense of history and ownership. In its earliest incarnation, exotic and legendary gear was exceptionally rare to come by. The Vex Mythoclast was a highly sought after gun from the series’ first raid, the Vault of Glass, but getting it to drop came down to sheer (and bad) luck. People would let out cries of relief rather than joy when they got one, since the game seemed to care little for the time and effort players would sink into their pursuits.<br></p><p>Years after this, once <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/bungie-layoffs-destiny-2-final-shape-marathon-sony-ps5-1851609905&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/bungie-layoffs-destiny-2-final-shape-marathon-sony-ps5-1851609905">Bungie</a></span> began more explicitly tying gear to specific activities and missions, the game was simply too full of weapons to balance, resulting in the studio “sunsetting” a large swath of them, or making them effectively obsolete. To this day, it’s one of the biggest sins the studio’s committed against the game and its community, especially after years of preaching about the relationships players could build to their armories. Prized possessions like the Hung Jury scout rifle became relics as <em>Destiny </em>tossed aside the legacy it’d built.</p><p>Nowadays, the studio has not only <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-the-final-shape-power-bungie-difficulty-1851436397&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-the-final-shape-power-bungie-difficulty-1851436397">repealed that controversial design choice</a></span>, but celebrates its weapons and reprises them more than ever.

Hung Jury, and indeed many of the series’ most beloved weapons, returned to <em>Destiny 2 </em>as part of the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-into-the-light-brave-arsenal-changes-1851375440&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-into-the-light-brave-arsenal-changes-1851375440">BRAVE arsenal</a></span> featured in the <em>Into The Light </em>content pack earlier this year. And most importantly, Swordbreaker is back in <em>Destiny 2</em>, since the game eventually reintroduced the very same raid that dropped it in the first place from the first <em>Destiny</em>. I’ve yet to actually complete or run the raid since, but the promise of being reunited with one of my favorite weapons ever remains one of the game’s most tantalizing pursuits.</p><p>I love that there’s a narrative to these things. In many loot-driven games, you may find a cool piece of gear, but it’s likely to be supplanted by another within a few hours or days of playing. You might swap out some nondescript sword for a similarly vague ax. Maybe you trade up a submachine gun with freezing capabilities for a rifle with acidic ones. That’s fine and all, but it has also always diminished what felt like <em>the </em>point of games like that: the ability to cultivate your own character, loadout, and story. If none of it means anything beyond some infinitely growing numbers, it’s pretty unlikely to impress me. If I can never settle on something that looks and feels like the best version of myself, then what am I really doing here?</p><p>By stark comparison to most of those titles, I know what I’m doing in <em>Destiny 2</em>: I’m fully realizing my favorite version of myself. I’m paying off years of stories I’ve told myself and have long arcs with countless pieces of gear in <em>Destiny</em>, like Swordbreaker or the Stag helmet I simply refuse to take off. My character has a definite shape and a legacy. This has all helped me connect to this series in a way I never have with any other games. As I write this, I’m planning to run Crota’s End as many times as I must to find my way back to Swordbreaker. And who knows, along the way, I might even unearth some other piece of equipment that’ll follow me for another five years, or however long <em>Destiny 2</em> remains a part of my life. Such is often the case, and it’s why I expect I’ll keep coming back to this world and continue telling my story, one weapon or armor piece at a time.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>After <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dead-by-daylight-spinoff-project-t-cancelled-due-to-poor-reception/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Project T was cancelled</a> due to poor reception, Behaviour Interactive has seemingly shut down the studio developing the game as well. According to multiple posts online, Midwinter Entertainment has been closed by Behaviour Interactive.</p>



<p>News started to appear on LinkedIn shortly after it was announced that Project T was no more.</p>



<p>“My studio abruptly closed today,” lead game designer <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/gregory-marques-39a711_my-studio-abruptly-closed-today-midwinter-activity-7241917376005349376-pHsG?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gregory Marques posted</a>. “Midwinter was a great place to work with some amazing people. I’ll miss it.”</p>







<p>“Sadly, after nearly 7 years my time with Midwinter Entertainment has come to an abrupt end due to the studio closure,” posted animation and art lead <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/dansalexander_sadly-after-nearly-7-years-my-time-with-activity-7241896961732182017-D77M?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Daniel Alexander</a>.</p>



<p>Another former employee, Eli Hanson, had praise for who he worked with at Midwinter while also questioning the decision made by Behaviour Interactive to cancel Project T.</p>



<p>“One of the crazy things is that in the most recent playtest we got a 92/100 score in fun and playability—and it is being sold that the game was not liked by the players,” they said in what appears to be a deleted post that was seen by Game Developer.</p>



<p>The shutdown effects at least 35 people. As of publishing, there have been nearly <a href="https://gaminglayoffs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">13,000 jobs lost across</a> more than 135 companies in the games industry in 2024.</p>



<p>In the company’s statement about Project T’s cancellation, Behaviour Interactive made no mention of the what would happen to Midwinter. Insider Gaming has reached out to Behaviour Interactive for comment. </p>



<p>Midwinter was founded in 2016, and was acquired by Behaviour Interactive in 2022.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/blizzard-co-founders-new-studio-to-publish-lynked-preparing-to-announce-debut-game/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Mike Morhaine is the co-founder of Blizzard Entertainment, but today, he is the owner of a new studio called Dreamhaven, which was unveiled in 2020. The company has over 100 staff members and is soon preparing to announce its first game. However, no details have been released about that just yet. Instead, they have revealed that Dreamhaven will publish Lynked: Banner of the Spark, a game unveiled during Gamescom's Opening Night Live ceremony.</p>
<p>The news of Dreamhaven publishing <a href="https://wccftech.com/fuzzybot-unveils-new-title-lynked-banner-of-the-spark/">Lynked: Banner of the Spark</a> came from Jason Schreier from Bloomberg. Lynked: Banner of the Spark is the debut game from the game studio FuzzyBot, a studio that was designed so that they could make something colorful and vibrant rather than the dark and gory games that they were used to making in previous studios.</p>
<p>Lynked: Banner of the Spark is considered to be fast-paced action with hack-and-slash combat, inspired by roguelites. You'll be able to make yourself stronger once you have completed a run and successfully gathered tools and resources.</p>
<p>In addition to Lynked: Banner of the Spark, Dreamhaven will also be unveiling a new game next month, which is being developed by Secret Door, one of their internal studios. This studio is also headed by a Blizzard veteran named Chris Sigaty, who was known for being the Executive Producer of Starcraft II.</p>
<p>Mike Morhaine<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-09-18/blizzard-co-founder-s-new-company-dreamhaven-aims-to-recreate-the-old-magic?srnd=undefined" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> spoke to Bloomberg</a> about Dreamhaven and the struggles they've had with having a functioning company, especially during COVID-19, which has led to ongoing financial issues. These issues meant that Secret Door's upcoming title missed internal deadlines, hence why it's only being announced now. Eric Dodds, also known as the Director for Hearthstone, resigned for personal reasons, meaning the ideas they had at the end of 2020 were now moot.</p>
<p>Sigaty did mention that Secret Door's first game should be out next year; however, due to a small team developing the game and budgets becoming increasingly tight, it may cause delays and alterations to the timeline.</p>
<p>When asked about the future of Dreamhaven's titles, Morhaime commented: "The size of these games probably are not going to be the size of a Blizzard game. But the quality bar we're trying to hit is still there. We're trying to still put out high-quality, published games that people can love and enjoy and share with their friends."</p>
<p>In addition to helping publish games such as Lynked: Banner of the Spark and Secret Door's project, they will also be helping market games from its second internal studio, Moonshot.</p>

What that means is that he doubles as space janitor and science experiment, taking all the most dangerous jobs aboard a colony ship and allegedly contributing to humanity’s understanding of the universe every time he’s cloned, killed, and reborn in a new body. Until eventually one of those clones doesn’t die and the Mickeys seemingly rise up.</p><p>Here’s the trailer:</p><p> Alongside Pattinson is Naomi Ackie (<em>Star Wars: Episode IX</em>), Steven Yeun (<em>Nope</em>), Toni Collette (<em>Hereditary</em>), and Mark Ruffalo (<em>Avengers</em>). We’ve seen the clone idea played out a bit in Christopher Nolan’s <em>Prestige </em>and Tom Cruise’s <em>Edge of Tomorrow </em>(an adaptation of the manga <em>All You Need is Kill</em>). Here, writer and director Bong Joon-ho is taking it into a sci-fi dystopia via Ashton’s book not unlike his English language breakout<em> Snowpiercer </em>about industrial class warfare at the end of the world (which was also adapted from a novel).</p><p>Class warfare was also one of the themes of <em>Parasite</em>, Bong Joon-ho’s 2020 Oscar winner about a a poor family infiltrating the household of upper-class elites. It’s also nice to see Pattinson continuing to stretch his wings again after his brooding portrayal of Bruce Wayne in the most recent <em>Batman</em> movie. With the surreal black-and-white thriller The Lighthouse, the former Twilight actor proved he can balance on the knife’s edge of comedy and horror as well as anyone. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It looks like it will be a while before Bungie drops shows off what its been working on with the Marathon reboot.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/09/18/new-marathon-details-on-heroes-price-and-radio-silence/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Paul Tassi at Forbes</a>, sources tell him that there are no plans for any “significant reveals” for Marathon until spring 2025 at the earliest. Tassi adds that there may be something small to give a few updates on the game, but nothing major will come until next year.</p>

<h2 id="h-what-is-going-on-with-marathon">What Is Going On With Marathon?</h2>



<p>As of writing, Marathon still has a 2025 release window for Bungie. The game will also have the expected price point of $40 that has recently been floating around.</p>



<p>“There were initial monetization concerns that came to a head when free-to-play The Finals came out and had trouble in that area,” Tassi writes. “Helldivers 2 being $40 and being a hit for Sony secured the premium cost idea. Concord’s recent failure at $40 did not change this, and it is simply too far along to pivot back to F2P restructuring anyway, so it will launch like this, barring anything seismic.”</p>



<p>There will also be a battle pass system and cosmetic shop for microtransactions.</p>



<p>As far as the game itself, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-heroes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">transition to a hero system</a> akin to that of Apex Legends was reiterated. The characters in the game will have unique abilities along with the ability to customize the gear and guns you find during your runs.</p>



<p>Regarding the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-replaces-marathon-game-director-with-former-valorant-director/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">change at the top</a> with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-director-fired-at-bungie-over-inappropriate-conduct/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Joe Ziegler replacing Chris Barrett</a> as Game Director, that’s when the move to individual heroes came to be. It’s also said, however, that the game’s art style has remained in tact through the switch over.</p>



<p>Lastly, it’s claimed that Marathon is in a “tough spot” with its release. Bungie has had issues with trust from Sony lately due to the struggles of Destiny 2, leading to a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/more-details-on-the-latest-bungie-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">number of layoffs</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-confirms-new-details-on-bungie-restructuring-plan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">restructuring within the company</a>. After the failed launch of Concord, there is heavier pressure for Marathon to be a success for Sony as a new first-party game.</p>

It’s fitting for Mortal Kombat, and certainly in keeping with the Scream franchise.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="da" dir="ltr">Mortal Kombat 1 Ghostface Fatality 🔥🔥🔥<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MK1?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#MK1</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MortalKombat1?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#MortalKombat1</a> <a href="https://t.co/zC3Tllh4zB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/zC3Tllh4zB</a></p>— thethiny 🐰🍉 (@thethiny) <a href="https://twitter.com/thethiny/status/1836391562575532523?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 18, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Elsewhere, we get a good look at Noob Saibot’s bone-crunching Animality (Animalities are new for Mortal Kombat 1), and it’s a direct reference to the character’s Fatality in Mortal Kombat 9.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Noob Saibot's Animality is 1:1 his MK9 Fatality and I LOVE it!<br>The animations are the same frame by frame, with only the speed being altered.</p><p>Here's the side-by-side sync'd video!<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MK1?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#MK1</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MortalKombat1?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#MortalKombat1</a> <a href="https://t.co/gtRjr1Qrja" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/gtRjr1Qrja</a></p></div>— thethiny 🐰🍉 (@thethiny) <a href="https://twitter.com/thethiny/status/1836398626769088664?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 18, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>NetherRealm likes to have fun with references via its Fatalities and other finishers.

The expansion adds new story mode chapters available from September 24, along with Kombat Pack 2, which itself includes six new DLC characters: Cyrax, Sektor, and Noob Saibot (available on September 24), and guest fighters Ghostface (Scream franchise), T-1000 (Terminator 2: Judgement Day), and Conan the Barbarian (post-launch release timing to be announced at a later date).</p><p>Animalities are part of a free update for all Mortal Kombat 1 owners set to go live alongside Khaos Reigns on September 24.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

The screens have a 90Hz refresh rate, but this can be bumped up to 120Hz when connected to a PC via a DisplayPort cable. There's also MicroSD card support in case you want to load it up with games and the internal storage isn't big enough.</p><p>Another cool feature is that you can quickly swap out batteries on the Focus Vision without losing any progress, as the headset has an internal battery that supplies up to 20 minutes of juice. Each detachable battery pack can provide up to two hours of continuous playtime.</p><p>You also won't need to worry about setting tracking modules like with the Vive 2 Pro, as the Focus Vision has four integrated tracking cameras and two full-color 16MP passthrough cameras that work with an infrared system to provide accurate tracking and proximity sensing in your environment.</p><p>The streaming kit in the Amazon bundle includes a five-meter streaming cable and converter--both with DisplayPort compatibility--and this is designed to give you visually lossless graphics and low-latency data transmission.</p><p>Admittedly this is a very expensive all-in-one VR solution, but the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C8VKH1ZH?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Meta Quest 3</a> is a good blend between price and performance.

<p>The Switch version has been delayed "to ensure the quality of play remains equally high across all versions of the game".</p>

<p>No further specific details on the Switch version have been provided, and no new release date has been given beyond October.</p>
<p>The remaster not only provides enhanced graphics and sound, it adds a new Story Mode with quality of life improvements more palatable to a modern audience. For instance, the UI will include subtle hints to help players solve puzzles.</p>
<p>Further, the remaster has provided a chance to tweak inconsistencies found in the original game, and alter the odd moment of representation.</p>
<p>Players can switch between modern and original versions of the game at any time.</p>
<p>After this remaster, Revolution is set to release the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/broken-sword-fans-will-be-delighted-by-original-remaster-and-brand-new-sixth-game">all-new Broken Sword 6</a> - I spoke to creator Charles Cecil at last year's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">Gamescom</a> to find out more.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/facebook-reels-beans-oh-no<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I’ve mentioned on our <a href="https://aftermath.site/tag/aftermath-hours" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">podcast</a> before my fatal disease of watching Facebook Reels: I’ll log in to look up where someone lives or doublecheck an event, only to get sucked into hours of short-form video by people I don’t know. This is exactly what Facebook wants for me, and I am a sucker for falling for it. For a while, it was dogs (good) or clips from Dropout (also good); sometimes it’s sendups of Christianity (funny) and other times it’s actual Christians, usually conservative (not funny). Lately, though, it’s nothing but beans.</p><p>Did you know there is a universe of bean influencers out there? OK, I guess they are more likely food influencers, but they seem particularly obsessed with beans, constantly acting like they have single-handedly discovered beans and are letting me know that beans exist for the first time. They are breathless as they extol beans’ virtues: Cheap! Plant-based protein! Fiber! Versatility! They want to convince me to <a href="https://archive.is/5QtIc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">eat more beans</a>. They want to show me that they are innovating with beans, discovering ways to make beans delicious that no human has thought of before. They are uniquely passionate about <a href="https://www.eater.com/24008145/why-are-butter-beans-so-popular" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">butter beans</a>, which <em>is just another name for lima beans</em>, and while certainly not a popular bean where I live is still a regular-ass bean and not some bean you’d only know about if you were in the secret cool kids bean club.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Creamy Miso + Coconut Butter Beans | SO VEGAN #food #recipe #shorts #vegan #veganrecipes" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xjfUWQY6FuM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>The recipes they make are largely pretty straightforward, especially if you are or, like me, have been a vegetarian, and so don’t have your mind blown by meals that don’t feature meat. They do a lot of beans in some kind of broth or thick sauce on the stovetop. They love serving beans over orzo or with “crusty bread.” They add vegetables. They make versions of daal or misir wat or curry that they give <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/when-it-comes-to-a-recipe-whats-in-a-name/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">English names</a>. They do all this in envy-inducing kitchens full of natural light and beautiful pans, and they wear comfy outfits and speak softly about self-care and coziness and ease. The colors are vibrant, and the sounds are soothing, and every dish is their favorite way to prepare beans and they are sure it will become my favorite too.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Butterbean stew #plantbased #healthy #healthyfood #vegan #food #recipe #yum #vegetarian #dinner" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T34iH9namts?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Especially if you don’t eat a lot of meat, you’ve probably had the experience of seeing some kind of “healthy” recipe that sounds pretty good, and doesn’t have any red flags for why it <em>wouldn’t</em> be good, but when you make it it’s actually disgusting. Much like I keep falling for Facebook Reels, I often fall for these recipes. Usually, they’re full of vegetables I already like that seem like they’d be great together, but the actual recipe ends up having a weird texture or bland flavor. For a while, I kept falling for green pasta sauces that involved steaming and blending broccoli and other greens. I like broccoli, and I like greens, and these basically read like versions of the pestos I already make regularly, but without fail they were hideous, with all that broccoli making an abundance of astringent sauce. Since I live alone and hate wasting food, that means my freezer sometimes gets full of these failed experiments that I think might be better later, even though they never are.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Armed with that experience, I look askance at the bean influencers’ recipes, trying not to be seduced by the colors and buzzwords and inclusion of ingredients I like, trying to parse if the recipe will<em> </em>actually be <em>good</em> or if it’s just sleight of hand around a pile of beans, which sounds good because it’s beans but will not be a thing I’ll actually want to eat once I have it. I’ll watch the videos on repeat, looking for cracks in their veneer. But sometimes you can’t <em>really</em> tell until you make a recipe for yourself.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="I love butter beans" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OD80WJqGyDg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>This week, I had plans to make <a href="https://www.thrillist.com/eat/nation/gochugaru-shrimp-and-grits-recipe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a version of shrimp and grits</a> I’ve been intending to get to for a while, but I've been busy and haven’t had it in me to thaw the shrimp and then deal with my general anxiety about cooking seafood. (I was a vegetarian for about 16 years, and I still try not to cook meat often; I was also <a href="https://www.fifthsense.org.uk/congenital-anosmia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">born without a sense of smell</a>, which when combined with my inexperience with meat has led to a sometimes-crippling paranoia about food safety.) Annoyed with myself, and hungry, and with half a loaf of sourdough I need to get out of the freezer, I finally caved and decided to make one of the bean recipes, a <a href="https://minaelleskitchen.ca/miso-mushroom-butter-beans/?fbclid=IwY2xjawEwbLNleHRuA2FlbQIxMAABHU3wvlFzK8oVSYF3_ImtOmMzO2GRANt-X3eJYHuZ557hzxjdgem7aeZHOw_aem_0X399IwUd_4Kw4rQnMr6nQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">miso mushroom butter beans</a> from a site I’ve never heard of but whose video had no obvious flaws.&nbsp;</p><p>I figured I’d make it with white beans, but I was surprised that my grocery store had canned butter beans. I was also surprised that they were white, like they are in the influencers’ videos, and not the green I usually associate with lima beans, which I usually only find frozen. (The different color is down to <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/article/butter-beans-vs-lima-beans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">different stages of maturity</a>; who knew?) I was a little leery of the vegan sauce, which involved blending some of the beans along with cashews, but the sauce also had green flags in the form of&nbsp; miso and nutritional yeast, two ingredients that make anything delicious.</p><p>(If you have just yelled “<a href="https://www.foodnetwork.com/how-to/packages/food-network-essentials/what-is-nutritional-yeast" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nutritional yeast</a>?!” in alarm, I have been on a lifetime campaign to get it renamed to something more accurate, like “tasty dust” or “deliciousness powder.” Nutritional yeast makes <em>everything</em> good. It’s an umami-packed wonder and also has a ton of B12, which your <a href="https://www.yalemedicine.org/news/are-you-getting-enough-vitamin-b12" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">brain and body need</a> to not feel like shit all the time.)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I took the recipe’s advice and soaked the cashews in boiling water first, a step I often skip but really shouldn’t. I even used the required shallot instead of an onion because the grocery store had shallots that didn’t look too bad. I cooked the shallot and mushrooms (she uses portobello in the video, but I used baby bella, which did you know <a href="https://www.montereymushrooms.com/knowledge/are-brown-mushrooms-like-criminis-baby-bellas-portabellas-and-portobellos-more-nutritious-than-white-mushrooms" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">are the same mushroom</a>?), added the butter beans, then blitzed the sauce together and added it along with some frozen kale. Soaking the cashews made a big difference in making an actually smooth, creamy sauce without little flecks of cashew in it. It looked sort of gray and disappointing, but basically like the video without the added fancy lighting.</p><p>I ate it with a hunk of the sourdough I need to get through, and I'm both delighted and furious that it was actually fucking delicious. I’m always a little disappointed in the green lima beans, and while the butter beans didn’t change my life, they were good: big, meaty beans that are satisfying to eat, but would have been just as satisfying if they were the more common cannellini or great northern beans. The miso and nutritional yeast made the sauce savory and rich-tasting, with the lemon juice adding some life. It’s a little too hearty of a dish for the current warm weather in New York, but there’s a good chance I’ll add it to my rotation of fall and winter go-tos.&nbsp;</p><p>The problem here is that now it opens the door to all the <em>other</em> bean influencers’ recipes. If <em>this one</em> was good, what about the others? Should I try them? I’ve been needing more iron and protein, and also to spend less money on groceries–could beans be the answer? Have the bean influencers been right all along about the life-changing nature of beans? Have I fallen into their cursed clutches? How many bean recipes will I try before one is inevitably shit, and the whole bean influencer artifice crumbles into dust, leaving them richer off my clicks and me poorer, with a tupperware full of shitty beans?</p><p>God damn you, Facebook Reels, and god damn you, bean influencers. Thanks for the lunch, though. &nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-vast-improvement-playstation-5-pro/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is a vast improvement on PlayStation 5 Pro, delivering a much better image quality at 60 frames per second over the base model, according to a new early analysis.</p>
<p>Today, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry">Digital Foundry</a> released their first look at the second entry in the remake trilogy running on PlayStation 5 Pro. The analysis is based on 7-minute long uninterrupted footage set at the beginning of Chapter 2 when Cloud and his companions venture into the first open-world region of the game, the Grasslands. Right from the start, it's clear how much better the game looks on PlayStation 5 Pro, as the unnamed visual mode featured in the video delivers a sharp 4K image while painting smooth 60 frames per second. Regarding image quality, everything seems to be a massive improvement over Performance Mode on the base model, with a sharper image and better details. Many of the visual issues seen on the base model are also fixed, such as ghosting issues, distant trees shimmering, and others.</p>
<p>The same improvements can be seen in combat as well. Even during Final Fantasy VII Rebirth's most intense enemy encounters, the image quality remains sharp, with 4K-like detail. Particles have also been improved, although they reveal how the game is using PSSR, which is upscaling the image to 4K from a base resolution of 1152p or 1224p.</p>
<p>The Final Fantasy VII Rebirth Digital Foundry early analysis also compares the game running on the PlayStation 5 Pro with the base model's Quality mode, highlighting how the image quality is mostly the same, with some improvements on the Pro model. With performance being solid as well, with only a few minor drops here and there, it seems like the power of the new console will benefit the second entry in the trilogy series quite a bit.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-september-2024-snes</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-online-september-2024-snes-haul-announced.984360/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-september-2024-snes<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Four more SNES games have been added to Nintendo Switch Online, and unlike Game Boy Advance or N64 games, you're not going to need an Expansion Pack addon to enjoy these.</p>
<p>The first game to be added to the service's retro lineup is&nbsp;<em>Battletoads Double Dragon</em>, a Rare-developed beat-'em-up that serves as a crossover between the two titular franchises (<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/battletoads-puts-up-its-dukes-on-august-20th">both of which</a> have <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/double-dragon-revive-announcement">since seen revivals</a>).</p>
<p>As you can probably imagine, it's a combination of the fast and furious button-mashing action of both&nbsp;<em>Battletoads&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Double Dragon</em>, so check this one out if you've got some frustration to work out on your controller.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/battletoads-double-dragon-nintendo-switch-online-september-2024.jpg?itok=MNz0U_Cv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/battletoads-double-dragon-nintendo-switch-online-september-2024.jpg?itok=4lXrQkPD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Battletoads Double Dragon&nbsp;</em>should provide some enjoyable beat-'em-up action on Nintendo Switch Online today.</figcaption></figure><p>Your next SNES game for today is&nbsp;<em>Kunio-kun no Dodgeball da yo Zen'in Shūgō!</em>, a Japan-only dodgeball-themed spinoff of the&nbsp;<em>Kunio-kun</em>&nbsp;franchise (which is known as&nbsp;<em>River City&nbsp;</em>in the West).</p>
<p>As you've probably guessed, this will be the first time the game has been available in the West, although it will still be entirely in Japanese. Hopefully, you can still fire it up and enjoy a good old-fashioned game of dodgeball,&nbsp;<em>Kunio-kun&nbsp;</em>style.</p>
<p>Next, it's Namco's 1992 puzzler&nbsp;<em>Cosmo Gang the Puzzle</em>, a block-stacking puzzle game in which you must clear your screen of clutter. You might be familiar with this one as&nbsp;<em>Pac-Attack</em>, a reworked version of the game featuring Pac-Man that was released in the West the following year.</p>
<p>Finally, you're getting 1989 racer&nbsp;<em>Big Run</em>, an arcade racing game in which you can experience a very early video game version of the Paris-Dakar rally. Neat, right?</p>

<p>All four of these games are available right now for Nintendo Switch Online subscribers, along with a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-april-2024">wealth</a> of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-game-boy-launch">other titles</a> across the NES, the SNES, and the Game Boy. You can sign up for a Switch Online membership via your Switch console if you're interested.</p>

            <p>The PlayStation Vita exclusive Freedom Wars is receiving a remastered version due out on current platforms early next year.</p>
<p>Originally developed by Dimps and published by Sony in 2014, Bandai Namco will now publish a remastered port of the action game for Switch, PS5, PS5, and PC (Steam).</p>
<p>It's set to release on 10th January 2025. Below is a teaser trailer.</p>

<p>Freedom Wars is set in a distant dystopian future where the planet has been ravaged by pollution and humanity resides in city-sized prisons called Panopticons. In this anime world, just being alive is considered a sin.</p>
<p>Players explore the world and fight enemies using weapons called Thorns, allowing for fluid movement as well as subduing enemies. The game also features local and online multiplayer for both co-operative and competitive modes for up to eight players.</p>
<p>The remaster will feature several enhancements, including 4K resolution, upgraded textures, 60fps performance (on PlayStation and PC), an overhauled weapon crafting system, added difficulty settings and more.</p>

<p>Though previously released globally, Freedom Wars proved most popular in Japan where it achieved the second highest all-time opening sales for a Vita game.</p>
<p>The game received a mixed response, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/freedom-wars-review">Eurogamer's Freedom Wars review</a> was critical. "All it would take to save Freedom Wars is for it to get even one big thing right," it reads. "As it stands, combat is the brightest highlight, though it's still dulled by clumsy controls. Beyond that, the environments are so monotonous as to kill any passion for the thing. The plot has some strong ideas that never really pan out, so I can't recommend it for that either. In between those two bits of mediocrity lies hours of wandering around the same grey-brown hallways, grinding to cut your sentence down."</p>
<p>It's perhaps a bizarre choice for a remaster, then, some 11 years after its original release, but at least more people can give it a try.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-is-a-thing-for-some-reason.984342/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-esrb<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>An ESRB listing has appeared for something called&nbsp;<em>Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered</em>, and it doesn't take a genius to figure out what it might be.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/40023/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">listing</a>&nbsp;appears to confirm a remaster for the game will appear on PC and PlayStation 5 at some point in the future, although since it's just an ESRB listing and not an official PlayStation announcement, it doesn't reveal the extent or scope of the remaster.</p>
<p>This could just be a simple visual and performance overhaul for the game's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/horizon-zero-dawn-pc-release-date-is-set-in-august">PC version</a> alongside a PS5 port, or it could be something more extensive and transformative (although since it's not a remake, we probably shouldn't expect the&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/until-dawn-remake-release-date"><em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>treatment</a>).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-esrb-tallneck.jpg?itok=vvbtTDL2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-esrb-tallneck.jpg?itok=ysypGcLQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Horizon Zero Dawn&nbsp;</em>appears to be getting the remaster treatment soon.</figcaption></figure><p>The ESRB's description for the game sure sounds like&nbsp;<em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em>, although I admit there are a few lines mentioned in warnings regarding "sexual material" and "fictional drugs" that I'd forgotten.</p>
<p>Apparently, a character in&nbsp;<em>Horizon Zero Dawn&nbsp;</em>makes a reference to "lounging around Elysium watching porn", which has slipped my mind, while others refer to being a "drug addict", meeting a "pusher" selling "Razorwing for eight bucks a tab", and "OD[ing] on Overcast".</p>
<p>Additionally, the word "shit" apparently appears in text and/or dialogue, so there's that.</p>
<p>Again, this being the ESRB, there's no mention of exactly what will be different in this remaster, but if <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/spider-man-remastered-recasts-peter-parkers-face-model">other recent Sony remasters</a> are anything to go by, we can likely expect some visual improvements, some quality-of-life tweaks, and perhaps some extra accessibility features as well.</p>

<p>It's also not clear whether owners of&nbsp;<em>Horizon Zero Dawn&nbsp;</em>on PC will get access to the remastered version for free, nor whether those who own the game on PS4 will be able to upgrade to PS5 at no extra cost.</p>
<p>We'll probably have to wait for Sony to announce something official before we know for sure. In the meantime, you can refresh your memory of the original&nbsp;<em>Horizon Zero Dawn&nbsp;</em>by <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/horizon-zero-dawn-review-merging-past-future-into-great-present">checking out our review</a> from way back in the mists of 2017.</p>

We talked to her about performing at a D&amp;D stage play, and her roots in improv comedy.</p>
<p>Felicia Day should be known by all in nerdy communities as the creator of Geek &amp; Sundry and <em>The Guild</em>. More recently <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e02e379b-4a69-4082-a688-3c8730b18a32" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/felicia-day-talks-making-3d-printing-more-inviting-space-with-feliciaday3d">Felicia Day has been getting involved in 3D Printing</a> and hosting multiple podcasts alongside regular acting roles for live-action and animated productions.</p>
<p><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: The Twenty-Sided Tavern</em> is a D&amp;D stage play experience where the players are influenced by audience prompts as well as the outcomes of various audience-led minigames that they can partake in with their mobile phones. <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="05539938-70ba-4cd6-98cf-b51345d15acc" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/twenty-sided-tavern-is-bringing-interactivity-to-dd-stage-theater">Earlier this year we spoke with DM and Tavern Keeper of The Twenty-Sided Tavern, David Andrew Greener Law (DAGL) and Sarah Davis Reynolds, respectively</a>.</p>
<p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed//4zqXlDgzj8M"></iframe></p>
<h2>The Perfect Blend Of D&amp;D, Improv, And Stage Acting</h2>
<p>To start our conversation I wanted to understand how Day got involved in this production. She laughed as she began to explain that she "wished it was more exciting but they called and I said Yes. I am so thrilled, I had actually been seeing advertisements and reviews on all of my socials and I vowed as soon as I could get to New York I would see the show because it looks so awesome and to get an email asking me to be the first guest star for the show was such an amazing honor and I couldn't have said yes fast enough."</p>
<p>At this point Day explained that she had yet to see the show in person, but she had been provided a recording of the show to get a better understanding of how it functioned. "Believe me I do my homework, I'm an A-student" Day confessed</p>
<p>"I will be seeing it multiple times before I go on the stage next Thursday," Day continued "we have a great rehearsal process and I can't wait to get on the stage, it's so beautiful!"</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/felicia-day-twenty-sided-tavern-gameplay.jpg?itok=5fGKsYBv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/felicia-day-twenty-sided-tavern-gameplay.jpg?itok=62cCJ1lm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A session of The Twenty-Sided Tavern in progress</figcaption></figure><p>With Day being involved in productions from stage to screen across multiple disciplines I wanted to understand what it was that made Day so excited to join as a guest of The Twenty-Sided Tavern.</p>
<p>"As an actor, it's always been my dream to act in a play on Broadway and of course I have been very involved in the D&amp;D world from the very beginning of the broadcasting D&amp;D world and on top of that I've been doing improv for as long as I've been in Hollywood. <em>The Guild</em> actually came out of an improv class, two of the cast members were in my improv group and we still perform occasionally in Los Angeles together.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"This is truly combining three things that I love more than anything in once beautiful package"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Later on in our discussion Day spoke about the different material she has access to in the lead up to her role in The Twenty-Sided Tavern but reinforced that what she's been working on the most has been improv. "The wonder thing is that I can come and do the show without weeks and weeks of rehearsal because we're making it up, there's a lot of structure, audience interaction, and technical stuff going on but it's one of those things that it's going to be a lot of on the job training"</p>
<h2>The Role Of A Lifetime</h2>
<p>The way that The Twenty-Sided Tavern functions is that at the start of each performance the party is selected. Each archetypal character – Rogue, Warrior, Wizard, etc – has a number of different permutations that can be selected.</p>
<p>The role that Felicia Day is playing is the Mage.</p>
<p>"The character of the Mage depends on the audience, the wonderful thing about Twenty-Sided Tavern is that the audience is completely involved the whole time with what's going on on-stage. The audience gets to choose what character I play, they get an option between three different characters,"&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/felicia-day-twenty-sided-tavern-audience-selections.jpg?itok=Qt_XeJvS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/felicia-day-twenty-sided-tavern-audience-selections.jpg?itok=p06RWA79 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The audience selecting which character they want to see for a night</figcaption></figure><p>Day continued to describe the many ways the Audience gets to participate "there are all these points at which the audience helps me win a battle, or chooses the approach that we take as a party and it's so fun and so amazing, I can't wait to be live in the audience and then I can't wait to be on the stage after that."</p>
<p>Asking how involved she was in building out the skeleton of the three different mage characters Day explained to me that where she'll really be involved in is fleshing that character out past their selection. "The archetypes are there but of course my interpretation of a Gnome Mage is going to be very different from Aabria (Iyengar) or Erika (Ishii's) Gnome Mage so the wonderful thing about improv is that it's unique to the performer."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Every scenario is going to be different every night, every character is going to be different every night, heck, my Gnome Mage is probably going to be different every night"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I couldn't resist asking whether there was any chance of a cameo appearance from Codex, Day's character from <em>The Guild</em>. "You know, I don't think Codex will be appearing on this stage but I am working on a Guild musical, we're going to be doing a stage reading of that very soon so you will see Codex on a stage, probably in 2025"</p>
<p>Felicia Day's run at The Twenty-Sided Tavern begins on the 19th of September and will last until the 24th. At the time of writing there is only one showing left for Felicia Day's run, but if you're a fan of TTRPG actual plays like Dimension 20 Aabria Iyengar will be special guesting from September 26th - October 7th and Erika Ishii will be joining the Tavern from December 5th - December 17th.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/18/24247911/wooting-80he-keyboard-gaming-hands-on<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>Wooting created the best gaming keyboard on the market two years ago with the 60HE. It popularized the use of Hall effect switches and a <a href="https://wooting.io/rapid-trigger">Rapid Trigger</a> system that speeds up how quickly you can activate a key, making it ideal for PC gaming. Now, Wooting has created <a href="https://wooting.io/wooting-80he/wooting-80he">the 80HE</a> — an 80 percent keyboard that makes the best gaming keyboard even better.</p><p>While I’m a fan of 60 percent keyboards for gaming, I miss having a delete key, a print screen button, and even dedicated arrow keys and an F-row. The 80HE adds all of these keys inside a package that really doesn’t feel <em>that </em>much larger than the 60HE. It’s essentially two keys wider and an F-row of keys taller. The extra keys certainly make it more comfortable for regular typing and a lot more convenient than having to mod keys or use function key shortcuts.</p><div><p><h3><a data-item-id="59WVjK" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://wooting.io/wooting-80he">Wooting 80HE</a></h3></p><p><span>$<!-- -->200</span></p><p>Wooting’s 80HE is the company’s latest Hall effect keyboard, following the popular 60HE. It has a bigger 80 percent layout, a new light bar, 8kHz polling, and more.</p></div><p>Wooting has also switched up the housing for its 80HE, moving to a gasket mount instead of the tray mount on the 60HE. The silicone gasket mount holds together the board and the switch plate. It does a great job of reducing the noise, making the typing experience a little softer than on the 60HE. You can also adjust the case angle to 2.8 degrees, 7.5 degrees, or 10 degrees thanks to a variety of silicone feet included in the box.</p><p>I’ve been trying out both the $109.99 zinc alloy case and the $34.99 PCR ABS plastic case for the 80HE over the past week, and I personally prefer the zinc material. It’s the pricier option of the two, but you get a hefty case that helps produce the kind of <em>thock</em> sound I enjoy on keyboards. </p><div><p><figcaption><em>The Wooting 80HE (top) versus the 60HE (bottom).</em></figcaption></p></div><p>I found the plastic case a little fiddly to open when I was building a bare-bones module version of the 80HE thanks to the clips holding it in place. The zinc option slid apart a lot more easily, though. You’ll have to be careful if you do take the 80HE apart or build one yourself, as there is a JST cable that needs to be disconnected when you remove the board from the case.</p><p>The sound on the 80HE is also improved over the 60HE thanks to updated Hall effect switches. Wooting’s Lekker V2 switches now wobble less and sound better than the original V1 switches. The differences are subtle, but I always disliked the key wobble on the 60HE default switches, so I’m happy to see that improved.</p><p>The Lekker switches are hot-swappable, so you can swap them out if they break or replace them with any Hall effect switches. Wooting lets you pick between the Lekker L45 and L60, with both feeling like linear switches and the L60s having a little more key start and end force. Wooting also uses screw-in stabilizers to eliminate rattle on the 80HE, and these are also replaceable with most other third-party screw-in and clip-in stabilizers.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>You can easily swap the switches and cases on an 80HE.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>The real magic of Wooting’s keyboards is made possible by these Hall effect switches, which use a magnet so the board can track how far a switch has been pressed. Most Cherry MX-style switches that are commonly used on mechanical keyboards use a copper mechanism to register a press with a board at a set actuation point of around 2mm. On the 80HE, you can adjust the actuation point on individual keys all the way down to 0.1mm. </p><p>The improved Wootility software allows you to enable adjustable actuation points, Rapid Trigger, and more advanced key functionality. Rapid Trigger changes the actuation and reset point of keys on the fly so that keys will activate the moment you press down and deactivate instantly when you release them. You can then repeat a key press in the middle of a motion, without needing to surpass the actuation point.</p><p>Rapid Trigger is ideal for PC gaming because of the fast deactivation that lets you move around quickly and repeat key presses faster. Keyboard manufacturers like SteelSeries, Keychron, and others have copied the Rapid Trigger feature after adopting Hall effect switches, and it has become a popular feature among <em>Valorant</em>, <em>Counter-Strike 2</em>, <em>Overwatch 2</em>, and <em>Apex Legends</em> players.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>The LED bar can be used for key indicators and much more.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>The other big addition to the 80HE is a new LED bar that sits above the arrow keys. Wooting says it’s designed to communicate with you and can tell you which profile you have active on the board or how much RAM or CPU your system is using. You can also just use it for fun RGB effects to match your keys or the rest of your setup. You can configure the LED bar in Wooting’s updated Wootility software. </p><p>One great feature of Wooting keyboards is that they store your profile on the board itself. You configure it in the Wootility web app, and there’s no need to install an app or have anything running in the background on your PC. Wooting is breaking from that tradition somewhat with the 80HE, though. </p><div><p><figcaption><em>The light bar can animate during a firmware update.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>If you want RAM or CPU monitoring on the LED bar, you’ll need a new background app, which is coming soon. I haven’t been able to test this yet, but Wooting says it will only be required for the more advanced LED bar functionality. I’ve been using the LED bar as a profile indicator, which is super useful for swapping between gaming and typing profiles.</p><p>If you update the firmware on the 80HE, the LED bar fills up to show the progress, a neat little touch that hints at what will be possible with this new addition. Right now, you can get it to indicate the profile you’re using, when keys are pressed, or to let you know when the CAPS lock key is enabled. It will also be able to show your system volume once the background service is available.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Wooting stores all of your keyboard settings on the 80HE module itself.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>The 80HE also supports up to 8kHz USB polling, but no wireless connectivity. While many keyboards promise 8kHz polling, the 80HE also scans every analog key position at that same rate. This faster polling rate also lowers the 80HE latency to just 0.125ms.</p><p>While I appreciate the improvements on the 80HE, the layout means the only options for cases right now are from Wooting directly. I’d expect to see third-party options over time, but until then, you’re stuck with black, ghost, and frost options for the plastic case or black, white, and raw options for the zinc case. </p><p>The 80HE — as a complete keyboard with a plastic case, switches, and keycaps — <a href="https://wooting.io/wooting-80he">starts at $199.99</a>. If you upgrade to the zinc alloy case, prices start at $289.99. You can also buy the standalone 80HE module without switches and keycaps for $154.99, but you’ll need a $34.99 plastic case or a $109.99 zinc alloy one.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/5/23989237/keychron-q1-he-hall-effect-analog-switches-price-release-date-specs-features-mechanical-keyboard">Keychron</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/10/23823001/corsair-k70-max-keyboard-price-release-date-specs-features-switches">Corsair</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/22/23178213/steelseries-apex-pro-mini-wireless-mechanical-keyboards-hall-effect-omnipoint">SteelSeries</a>, and many others offer similar boards with Hall effect switches, but none quite offer the combination of hardware and software that Wooting delivers. If you’ve always been tempted by the 60HE but wanted more keys, the 80HE delivers that and much more.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>As I’m sure as is the curse of anyone who’s watched the entirety of Peep Show multiple times, I cannot read the name ‘Marko’ without hearing it in a nasally Australian accent, inquiring about cocaine. This is probably a disservice to the hero of colourful <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-metroidvania-games">metroidvania</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marko-beyond-brave">Marko: Beyond Brave</a>, who a quick goog tells me may be based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Marko#Epic_poetry_of_Bulgaria_and_North_Macedonia">Krali Marko</a> - a popular character in the folklore of Studio Mechka’s native Bulgaria. Folk hero or not, Marko certainly has some heroic facial hair: his moustache floweth so bountifully that it can’t be contained in his character portrait. Extremely powerful of him.</p>

<p>“Entropy has escaped its prison and threatens to engulf the world. Step into the shoes of Marko, a young warrior who uncovers a secret power hidden within,” reads the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1186470/Marko_Beyond_Brave/">Steam page</a>. “Brave the ancient evils, battle mythical creatures and forge powerful alliances to restore the balance. With elemental powers at your command and every decision shaping the world's fate, embark on a thrilling adventure where courage is your greatest weapon.” I particularly enjoy this last point, given that Marko’s greatest weapon is clearly a comically large sword. </p>
<p>Massive sword aside, here are some more features:</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li><p>Traditional 2D art: The land of Zagora is brought to life in great detail, drawn, and animated entirely by hand.</p></li>
<li><p>Challenging, but fair gameplay: Tight, responsive controls. Jump, fight, and dash your way across challenges. Battle mighty foes and slay ancient evils.</p></li>
<li><p>Explore the vast land of Zagora: a huge non-linear map with hundreds of rooms. Solve puzzles and find hidden treasures, all within the Slavic-inspired fairytale setting.</p></li>
<li><p>Encounter mysterious characters: A cast of cute and creepy friends and foes, all brought to life with traditional 2D frame-by-frame animation.</p></li>
<li><p>Master New Abilities: Discover new skills, allowing you to go toe to toe with the most brutal of enemies.</p></li>
<li><p>Discover all secrets: Delve deep into the world and discover hidden areas and unspeakable treasures. Collect all the pieces and puzzle together an ancient mystery.</p></li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>I’m definitely drawn in by the art in this one, and the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a>  meets <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nine-sols">Nine Sols </a>hoppy-slashy certainly doesn’t hurt - specifically, the press release calls it a "Slavic Silksong". A few of the currently slim number of Steam reviews are reporting technical issues, however - so might be worth holding out until they’re sorted.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
