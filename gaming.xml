            <p>Sony has revealed the new games coming to its PlayStation Plus subscription this June and discounts on PS5 consoles, all part of this year's annual Days of Play promotion.</p>
<p>In addition to the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> receiving its first discount, the company has revealed both the free monthly games available for all tiers, as well as the catalogue additions available for Extra and Premium subscribers.</p>

<p>The classics catalogue will also receive two games from 5th June: Myst and Riven, both on PS4 and PS5.</p>

<p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bomb-rush-cyberfunk">Bomb Rush Cyberfunk</a> is a highlight in the monthly games, as a spiritual successor to Dreamcast classic <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/jet-set-radio">Jet Set Radio</a>. We described it as a "gloriously haunted video game" in our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bomb-rush-cyberfunk-review">Bomb Rush Cyberfunk review</a>.</p>
<p>Another Crab's Treasure is also a treat for anyone looking for a Dark Souls alternative, set under the sea with a litter-grabbing crab.</p>
<p>Sony has also announced discounts as part of its Days of Play 2025 celebration. New or upgraded PS Plus membership will have 33 percent off, so now's the time to renew your subscription.</p>
<p>Further, if you're yet to buy a PS5 console itself, both the digital and standard consoles will be on promotion on the <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-gb/">PlayStation Direct store</a> in Europe, starting at £339.99 / €399.99. That's a £90 reduction. Some accessories and games are also discounted.</p>
<p>Additionally, the PS5 Pro will be discounted by £45. That's the first time Sony's revised console has been discounted since its release last year.</p>
<p>Full details can be found on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/05/27/celebrate-days-of-play-2025-starting-on-may-28/">PlayStation Blog</a>.</p>
<p>As a reminder, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/here-are-the-games-leaving-playstation-plus-extra-and-premium-in-june">six games are leaving PS Plus in June</a>: Monster Hunter Rise, Rogue Legacy 2, Inscription, After Us, Kayak VR: Mirage, and Avicii Invector.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/guild-wars-2-janthir-wilds-final-update-absolution-is-out-on-june-3/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/guild-wars-2-janthir-wilds-final-update-%E2%80%98absolution%E2%80%99-is-out-on-june-3.1199463/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/guild-wars-2-janthir-wilds-final-update-absolution-is-out-on-june-3/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, ArenaNet announced that the final update for the <a href="https://wccftech.com/guild-wars-2-janthir-wilds-finally-launched-bringing-in-housing-mechanism-new-raids-much-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Guild Wars 2: Janthir Wilds expansion</a> will be released on June 3.</p>
<p>Titled 'Absolution', the update follows '<a href="https://wccftech.com/arenanet-to-release-godspawn-update-for-guild-wars-2-janthir-wilds-on-november-19-featuring-new-50-player-titan-battle-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Godspawn</a>' and '<a href="https://wccftech.com/repentance-guild-wars-2-janthir-wilds-second-update-is-out-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Repentance</a>' to conclude the trio of free updates that the developer had planned for Janthir Wilds. In this patch, players will find additions to game modes, new rewards, and a new map and story. Story-wise, they'll get to experience the robust and action-packed finale for themselves as they discover the ancient secrets at the heart of the Primordial Egress on Tyria’s frontiers.</p>
<p>The crumbling city of Bava Nisos, once a monument to Mursaat glory, lies twisted beneath three centuries of magic. The final descent to the heart of this new explorable zone involves a map-wide meta event that will lead players to the Mists Gate — the focal point of the titan invasion in Janthir. Alongside this new content, a new boss — the titan Ura — will be added to the Convergence game mode, which is designed for groups of up to 50 players.</p>
<p><iframe title="Guild Wars 2: Janthir Wilds – &quot;Absolution&quot;" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0boXkTbLZ8o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<p>Absolution also adds a new Fractal dungeon (Kinfall) to Guild Wars 2 in which players take on the role of a lowland Kodan and experience events from their cultural past. They will uncover the whispers of the elder dragon Jormag for the first time — an event which preceded their migration from northern Tyria to the Janthir Wilds.</p>
<p>The Homesteads housing feature will also be enhanced: the decoration limit will double from 1,000 to 2,000 objects, enabling players to create denser living spaces, and the Homestead Mastery level will increase to 500, granting access to new crafted decorations. A host of new rewards, including a legendary backpack and glider, new weapon sets, new relics, and updated offerings in the Wizards' Vault, will bring the 2024 expansion cycle to a close.</p>
<p>Given the <a href="https://wccftech.com/guild-wars-2-qa-arenanet-on-switch-to-yearly-expansions-secrets-of-the-obscure-learnings-and-2024-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">switch to yearly expansions</a>, ArenaNet should announce the next one in the coming weeks.</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/games/671323/nintendo-switch-2-wii-u-technology-games</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/with-the-switch-technology-finally-caught-up-to-nintendo.1199460/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/671323/nintendo-switch-2-wii-u-technology-games<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The Nintendo Switch is on the cusp of becoming Nintendo’s bestselling hardware ever. In retrospect, it’s easy to see why: it’s a device that seamlessly transitions from a home console to a handheld, erasing the distinction between the two. It’s been so successful that Nintendo isn’t changing all that much with the Switch 2. But both consoles are well-executed versions of ideas Nintendo has been working on since the failed Wii U — and maybe even earlier.</p><p>Purely by sales numbers, the Wii U was a flop. The Switch has sold more than 150 million units in its eight-year lifetime. The Wii U, by comparison, sold 13.56 million units — less than a 10th of what the Switch did — making it Nintendo’s worst-selling home console.</p><p>As a result, it had a much shorter lifespan, launching in late 2012 before being superseded by the Switch about four and a half years later. But many of its ideas and its games were not only excellent, they were also well ahead of their time, and, in some ways, predicted several modern trends in gaming.</p><div><p><cite>Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>The Wii U, with its tablet controller, <em>also</em> worked as a device that could play games on a TV or in handheld mode. The ability to see a game on a big screen or curl up with it on the couch is an enduring one, as the existence of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24012547/sony-playstation-portal-handheld-remote-player-ps5-chiaki-review">PlayStation Portal</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23951655/steam-deck-oled-review">Steam Deck</a> now show. The concept has become a whole category of video game hardware, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/13/24295461/dont-expect-an-xbox-handheld-any-time-soon">even Xbox wants to make a handheld now</a>. Nintendo’s interest in the idea long preceded the Wii U, as it toyed with handheld-to-TV connections with things like the Game Boy Advance’s ability to connect to the GameCube or the Super Game Boy add-on for the SNES.</p><p>The Wii U had the major limitation that you couldn’t play the games if you were too far away from the console, so they weren’t truly portable. The tablet’s battery life wasn’t great, either, so you could only play for so long before having to charge it.</p><p>The Switch improved on all of these ideas. Instead of a TV-connected console that could beam a game to the tablet, the Switch was a tablet that could easily display on a TV. The Switch’s dock made that connection seamless, as it was nearly impossible to mess up just dropping the Switch into the dock so that it could show up on your TV. (And easily recharge the console’s battery.)</p><p>Many of the Switch’s defining games started out on the Wii U. <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em>, the Switch’s bestselling title by far, is a port of <em>Mario Kart 8</em> for the Wii U. <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> was originally going to be a Wii U exclusive before Nintendo decided to release it for the Switch as well. The first <em>Splatoon</em> title launched on Wii U before getting a pair of Switch sequels, and so did the original <em>Super Mario Maker</em>. <em>Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze</em>, <em>Super Mario 3D World</em>, <em>Pikmin 3</em>, and <em>Xenoblade Chronicles X</em> are all great Wii U games that got new life on the Switch.</p><p>The Switch 2 looks to build off that legacy by being backward compatible with the vast majority of Switch games, including the Switch versions of those Wii U classics. <em>Breath of the Wild</em> will even be getting a third version for the new console <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/641365/nintendo-zelda-botw-totk-switch-2-edition-announced">with technical improvements</a>. Features like <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fgaming-systems%2Fswitch-2%2Ffeatures%2Fgameshare%2F%3Fsrsltid%3DAfmBOooxJmrZ9_LELPmfqNiku1Sqt5QJ9PgrBzcoRhyVg18GcqRqb4gB" rel="sponsored">GameShare</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/24343637/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-c-button-controller">GameChat</a> could also help people more easily play games with their friends.</p><p>Before the first Switch came out in March 2017, Nintendo was aggressively moving on from the Wii U. Production of the console ended in Japan <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/wii-u-production-is-dead-in-japan-long-live-the-wii-u/">in January of that year</a>, and the company was also dipping its toes into mobile as another avenue to reach players. Even at the time, the company seemed to realize that it was on to something with the concept. It was just too early. This is something <em>Mario</em> and <em>Zelda</em> creator Shigeru Miyamoto seemed keenly aware of in a 2016 interview with my colleague Andrew Webster around the release of the mobile game <em>Super Mario Run</em>.</p><p>“I hope people will continue to recognize the areas where Nintendo has taken that first step,” Miyamoto <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/8/13878378/super-mario-run-iphone-nintendo-shigeru-miyamoto-interview">told <em>The Verge</em></a>. “And hopefully someday people will look back on the Wii U and think ‘Oh wow, I remember when Nintendo did that, and now look at what’s come of that.’”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This culminates on the third day, where if players were successful in surviving the night must take on one of the Nightlords—new bosses for this version. Nightfarers must learn to cooperate to take down these challenges, combining their unique abilities together for an unparalleled experience in the <em><a title="Games > Elden Ring [33 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/elden-ring">Elden Ring</a></em> universe.

			<p>In January 2024, legendary game designer Hideo Kojima <a href="https://wccftech.com/physint-kojima-new-stealth-ip-playstation-transcend-film-video-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> a new partnership with Sony to create Physint, a new tactical espionage game in the vein of Metal Gear. While Kojima's focus is currently on Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, which launches next month on PlayStation 5, the veteran developer also discussed what drove him to go back to this kind of project.</p>
<p>Speaking to <a href="https://pocketmags.com/eu/edge-magazine" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EDGE</a> (issue 411, July 2025), he said that the people's wishes for a new Metal Gear game were important in the decision:</p>
<p><em>Of course, I have lots of new ideas that I want to create. But when I became sick during the pandemic, I realised that a lot of people wanted me to make something like Metal Gear. That’s when I had the idea for a new espionage game. I reflected and thought the idea was good. I took it to Sony and they were incredibly supportive. We explored many options, and we agreed on doing Physint. This made me think that these multiplatform projects will help the studio live on – not just through games but in other media too. We’re exploring other forms of entertainment as well, so we are a game company, but not only a game company. This is phase two for Kojima Productions.</em></p>
<p>Kojima had recently talked about Physint in another interview, revealing that fans will have to wait a long time - five to six years - before playing the game. That's likely because after Death Stranding 2: On the Beach the studio will focus on <a href="https://wccftech.com/od-hideo-kojima-horror-game-xbox-revealed-jordan-peele/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OD</a>, the supposedly revolutionary game he's making for Xbox and with the collaboration of Jordan Peele. The game will feature a cast with actors like Sophia Lillis (Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Honor Among Thieves), Hunter Schafer (Euphoria), and German actor Udo Kier.</p>
<p>Following the release of Physint, Kojima said that he could finally make a movie, which was his lifelong dream.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/dragon-quest-1-2-hd-2d-remake-preview-pax-east-2025</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dragon-quest-i-ii-hd-2d-remake-preview-brilliant-updates-to-classic-jrpgs.1199403/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/dragon-quest-1-2-hd-2d-remake-preview-pax-east-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>At PAX East 2025, we had the opportunity to sit down and go hands-on with <em>Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</em>, a continuation of the Erdrick Trilogy, which chronologically begins with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-review-all-that-glitters-are-pixels" rel="nofollow"><em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</em></a>, released last year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Though released decades ago on aged hardware, the <em>Dragon Quest </em>legacy is one that JRPG fans have followed very closely, with a huge amount of excitement for these remakes to come to modern consoles. From my hands-on <em>Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</em> preview experience, there's plenty to look forward to.</p>



<h2><em>Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</em> Is a Streamlined JRPG&nbsp;</h2>

<p>When people think of JRPGs and turn-based combat systems, it's easy to picture a slower-paced and methodical battle system. What I found great about <em>Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</em> is that you can speed up the battle animations to your preference, with Ultra-Fast allowing you to speed through combat encounters extremely quickly.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is perfect for those looking to grind out experience in the overworld or who want to spend more time exploring the lush and beautiful open world. These two games were built from the ground-up for the modern era, and playing a sample of both games on a PS5 proved how optimized these builds are.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Not only does the HD-2D art style bring the world into brilliantly sharp focus with vivid and colorful landscapes, but it also runs extremely smoothly – no frame drops noticed.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</em> is an excellent follow-up to <em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake </em>for those who might want to dive into <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/history-dragon-quest" rel="nofollow"><em>Dragon Quest</em></a> for the first time. And if you're a fan of the original classics, quality-of-life adjustments and modern mechanics make these stories a joy to experience all over again.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><em>Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</em>:<em> </em>Two Amazing Games in One&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Though there are some who wish the Erdrick trilogy had been bundled together from the start, getting&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake&nbsp;</em>is a huge win for JRPG fans. Each story provides a huge amount of lore, gameplay, and fun for&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest&nbsp;</em>fans. This dual pack is an excellent option for anyone itching to sink into a beautiful JRPG.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The remakes are already slated for the Nintendo Switch and Steam, and for avid Nintendo fans, they'll be pleased to know that they'll also be able to play&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake&nbsp;</em>on the Switch 2.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For a stunning reimaging of a classic RPG that is counting its age in decades, these remakes bring&nbsp;a fresh perspective to both titles, making this a phenomenal experience for fans to look forward to.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><em>Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</em>&nbsp;Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>Whether you want to take your time exploring the world and the towns and caves within or jump right into combat to test your skills against stronger and stronger enemies, <em>Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</em> delivers on all fronts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I loved wandering the world with my team, trying out new attacks, and marveling at just how quickly battles can take place with the ultra-fast options turned on. It optimizes&nbsp;a genre that, in the past, may have been challenging for newcomers to get familiar with.&nbsp;</p>

<p>By bringing these games into the modern era and rebuilding them from the ground up, Square Enix succeeds at revitalizing a beloved series and giving players an excellent reason to revisit Erdrick's story.</p>

<hr><p><em>The <strong>Dragon Quest 1 &amp; 2 HD-2D Remake</strong> release date is October 30, 2025, and it was previewed on a PlayStation 5 at PAX East 2025.&nbsp;</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fantasy-life-i-switch-2-500k-sales<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Level-5 has announced that the hit "slow life" RPG&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time&nbsp;</em>will be getting a Switch 2 Edition version complete with enhancements specific to Nintendo's new machine.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.fantasylife.jp/fli/en/topics/250527/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on the game's official website, the developer says the Switch 2 Edition version of&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i&nbsp;</em>will be launching on June 5th, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">alongside the console itself</a>. It'll cost you just $2.59 to upgrade, which isn't bad at all.</p>

<p>According to Level-5, the Switch 2 version of&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life&nbsp;</em><em>i&nbsp;</em>will take "full advantage of the hardware's capabilities" to offer "significant improvements", just like other Switch 2 Edition releases.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fantasy-life-i-switch-2-500k-horse.jpg?itok=pgSObRnz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fantasy-life-i-switch-2-500k-horse.jpg?itok=uKyXMj2- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Fantasy Life i&nbsp;</em>will be available on the Switch 2 at launch.</figcaption></figure><p>Improvements include faster load times and scene transitions, as well as "more beautiful" visuals and "more fluid" animations on the Switch 2. In short, it's exactly the kind of enhancement you'd expect from a jump to a new console.</p>

<p>Obviously, if you have the Switch 2 Edition version of the game but you play it on a regular Switch, you can expect "features and performance" to be "in line with the Nintendo Switch version", as Level-5 says.</p>

<h2><em>Fantasy Life i&nbsp;</em>has also passed a pretty big sales milestone</h2>

<p>In addition to announcing the Switch 2 version of&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i</em>, Level-5 also revealed over the weekend that its latest game has already passed a pretty big sales milestone.</p>

<p>As revealed in a <a href="https://x.com/FANTASYLIFE_EN/status/1926223393059172648" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X,&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i&nbsp;</em>has sold 500,000 copies since launching last week (although players who pre-ordered the game enjoyed a three-day advanced access period, so that ought to be factored in as well).</p>




<p>To celebrate the achievement, Level-5 is <a href="https://x.com/FANTASYLIFE_EN/status/1926889367961784354" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">giving away</a> a number of free gifts to all players, so make sure to hop into the game and claim those if you're playing through it right now.</p>

<p><em>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2993780/FANTASY_LIFE_i_The_Girl_Who_Steals_Time/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/product/JP0720-PPSA27625_00-FANTASYLIFEIGAME" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time/9pp7tdrdzghd" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-switch/" rel="nofollow">Nintendo Switch</a>. The Switch 2 version will be arriving on June 5th.</p>

There’s nothing wrong with that—plenty of people want to get new Nintendo information—and the app is a fun, if cumbersome, way of hearing the latest about what Nintendo is hoping you’ll buy. But, whichever way you slice it, it’s a commercial tool for plugging games and devices. Today on Today, underneath a cute animation from <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>, you can watch a 21-second video about Donkey Kong’s hand slap in forthcoming Switch 2 title <em>Donkey Kong Bananza.</em></p><p>“Cool!” you might think. “James’ll love that! I’ll grab a screenshot of the video and send it to him.” Or, if you don’t know James, you might think, “Ooh, I’m so excited for <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>! I’m going to post a video clip of this on my BlueSky account!” Except, no, you won’t do any of this. Now all you’ll get is a black screen. Here’s a screenshot I took today:</p><figure id="" data-id="2e571c65cb5083c8ae65b8890127d9d1" data-recommend-id="image://2e571c65cb5083c8ae65b8890127d9d1" data-format="jpg" data-width="388" data-height="863" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A black screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A black screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2e571c65cb5083c8ae65b8890127d9d1" data-recommend-id="image://2e571c65cb5083c8ae65b8890127d9d1" data-format="jpg" data-width="388" data-height="863" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A black screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I can right now, on an Android phone, still screenshot the text-based stories, such as the one plugging the new Switch 2 “All-in-One” carrying case, and I can capture the screenshots recently uploaded from <em>Mario Kart World</em>. (Except, with the latter,  the shots are included in landscape, in an app that only runs in portrait, with no way to zoom in or rotate them. Just <em>stellar</em> work.) It’s just videos that are being blocked. </p><figure id="" data-id="e91145f0ddedb95b9ca3fe1792d8860c" data-recommend-id="image://e91145f0ddedb95b9ca3fe1792d8860c" data-format="jpg" data-width="388" data-height="863" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of a landscape screenshot on a portrait phone." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of a landscape screenshot on a portrait phone." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e91145f0ddedb95b9ca3fe1792d8860c" data-recommend-id="image://e91145f0ddedb95b9ca3fe1792d8860c" data-format="jpg" data-width="388" data-height="863" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of a landscape screenshot on a portrait phone." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Let’s be unambiguously clear: Publisher-provided screenshots and videos of a game are advertising. They have only ever been advertising. The games media is  guilty of having allowed such things to be commoditized, fighting one another for the “exclusive” to publish such commercials on their own website, then becoming furious when another site reprints the adverts they wanted to be the only one to show. But ads they remain.</p><p>They exist to promote a game, with the intention of building interest and excitement in a product, and the goal of increasing sales. That’s it. That’s what they’re for. And here’s Nintendo, very cleverly encouraging millions of people to install an app on their phones that only serves to show its users these ads, and then going out of its way to stop their being shared? That’s <em>bonkers</em>.</p><p>But, it feels very par for Nintendo’s course. Sharing is such an anathema to this company that it even applies it to its own game footage and trailers—clips you’d imagine were created with the express purpose of being seen by as many people as possible. But no! Shut that shit down! People might get <em>ideas</em>.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

A new demo will be available beginning June 6, featuring improvements based on feedback from the game’s May playtest. <span id="more-967384"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Can Can Can a Man:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>In <em>Gold Gold Adventure Gold</em>, you’re not the hero—you’re the one footing the bill. Build a city in a land besieged by monsters. <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,285 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">Adventure</a>rs show up chasing treasure and glory, and it’s up to you to assign quests to kill, defend, explore, and more. Cross your fingers and hope they make it back alive! While they stumble through danger, you’ll be collecting taxes, upgrading your settlement, and trying not to bankrupt yourself by bribing them to keep going. There’s no problem gold can’t solve—except when you run out of it.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Give <a title="Platforms > Quest [138 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/meta/quest">Quest</a>s</strong> – Everyone knows that adventurers do not work for free. Their loyalty lies with GOLD! You’ll have to recruit them with promises of gold or glory, and give them quests! Kill, defend, explore, and more!</li><li><strong>Recruit Unique Adventurers</strong> – Gold-thirsty adventurers will come from all corners of the world. Humans, beastmen, mothmen, undead, and more may join your cause. Pick them all, or only your favorites!</li><li><strong>Build a City</strong> – Build a thriving city around a monster-filled dungeon. Create an economy based on either farming or monster-slaying, and watch as it evolves based on your <a title="Genres > Action [2,745 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>s. Whatever you choose, remember to collect your share of the taxes!</li><li><strong>Raise a Pet God-Beast</strong> – The pet you found snacking on your supplies seems to be growing more than expected. Far more. It might be wise to teach it what is right and wrong, before it grows too big to care about your opinions. Raise it, teach it spells or tricks, pet it, brush it, and if necessary discipline it. You might find that it becomes a trusted companion on your journey!</li><li><strong>Fight Monsters</strong> – As your adventurers clear the world of monsters, you can watch their pathetic struggle against the world. Be merciful and help them survive, get better items, and learn new skills… or feed them to your god-beast. Each level brings them one step closer towards a forbidden evolution.</li><li><strong>Survive the Night (<a title="Genres > Survival [414 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/survival">Survival</a> Mode)</strong> – Face waves of chaos in this high-stakes mode where every night brings tougher enemies and harder choices. Build your settlement, spend your coin, and see if your adventurers can survive long enough to see daylight. How many nights can your gold keep them alive?</li><li><strong>Feed the Greed (Colony Sim Mode)</strong> – Take a more relaxed approach in this long-form mode focused on exploration, city growth, and watching your settlement evolve over time. Fewer disasters, more decisions—perfect for players who want to build a beautiful gold-fueled mess at their own pace.</li></ul><!-- AD: content -->

All PS Plus members will be able to claim several freebies starting June 3: <strong>NBA 2K25</strong>, <strong>Alone in the Dark</strong>, <strong>Bomb Rush Cyberfunk</strong>, and <strong>Destiny 2: The Final Shape </strong>(the Destiny 2 expansion will be available starting May 28).

The Final Shape was a thrilling adventure that wrapped up the first decade of Destiny, introduced the new Prismatic subclass, and dropped a ton of new weapons into the game's loot pool. You will need Destiny 2 to play it, but the base game is free-to-play.</p><p dir="ltr">Sports fans can shoot some hoops in NBA 2K25, but you might want to watch out for some <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nba-2k-play-will-let-you-join-tournaments-for-real-money-from-your-couch/1100-6530099/" data-ref-id="1100-6530099">especially egregious microtransactions</a> in this year's edition. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/nba-2k25-review-luxury-taxed/1900-6418281/" data-ref-id="1900-6418281">The core experience still looks and feels great</a>, but it is tarnished by various pay-to-win systems.</p><p dir="ltr">For something more nostalgic, check out Bomb Rush Cyberfunk. A spiritual successor to Jet Set Radio, the game has a 2000s-inspired vibe, a killer soundtrack, and cel-shaded visuals to make your trip across the city of New Amsterdam feel <em>extreme</em>.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nacon-wrc-games-2027-2032</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nacon-to-take-over-wrc-video-game-duties-from-ea-and-codemasters.1199352/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nacon-wrc-games-2027-2032<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nacon has announced that it will take over WRC video game duties from EA and Codemasters, having signed an agreement with WRC Promoter to create new FIA World Rally Championship games for the next few years.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/05/26/3088220/0/en/PRESS-RELEASE-NACON-ANNOUNCES-AGREEMENT-WITH-WRC-PROMOTER-FOR-THE-PUBLISHING-OF-THE-OFFICIAL-GAMES-OF-THE-FIA-WORLD-RALLY-CHAMPIONSHIP-FROM-2027-TO-2032.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">press release</a>, Nacon says that it will publish official FIA WRC games between 2027 and 2032, and that it has "exclusive rights" to do so on PC and consoles "for six seasons".</p>

<p>Lest you think Nacon is just going to continue EA and Codemasters' work on the&nbsp;<em>WRC&nbsp;</em>series, however, think again. The French publisher says it will be creating "a complete reboot of the franchise, based on an entirely fresh vision".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nacon-wrc-games-ea-sports-wrc.jpg?itok=Pe60rPB3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nacon-wrc-games-ea-sports-wrc.jpg?itok=KusZXlK4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Nacon is taking over WRC gaming duties from EA and Codemasters.</figcaption></figure><p>In the aforementioned press release, Nacon promises to "deliver an immersive experience that faithfully reflects the quality of the championship and meets the expectations of both rally enthusiasts and new players".</p>

<p>The publisher says that all of the official teams, rallies, vehicles, and drivers from the FIA WRC will be featured in its games, as will sponsor brands. In short, it sounds like this will be every bit as faithful to the event as EA's series was.</p>

<p>This is, of course, not Nacon's first rodeo (or perhaps that should be rally) when it comes to WRC games. Between 2015 and 2020, the&nbsp;<em>WRC&nbsp;</em>franchise was under Nacon's stewardship, with racing stalwart Codemasters subsequently snapping it up.</p>

<p>Following that, Codemasters found itself subject to something of a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/take-two-interactive-targeting-purchase-of-codemasters" rel="nofollow">bidding war</a> between <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-to-purchase-codemasters-instead-of-take-two" rel="nofollow">Take-Two and EA</a>, with the latter eventually purchasing the studio. The partnership produced only one rally racer, that being <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-sports-wrc-announced-promising-most-authentic-awe-inspiring-off-road-experience" rel="nofollow">2023's&nbsp;<em>EA Sports WRC</em></a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nacon-wrc-games-wrc-9.jpg?itok=WDTB-IcO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nacon-wrc-games-wrc-9.jpg?itok=JlAz1VzX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This won't be Nacon's first foray into the rally racing genre.</figcaption></figure><p>Earlier this month, EA <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-rally-games-pausing-codemasters" rel="nofollow">announced it would be "pausing" development</a> on future rally racing games, and the X account of developer Codemasters was also scrubbed, leading to fears that the developer had been shut down.</p>

<p>It was subsequently <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/codemasters-confirms-layoffs-as-ea-owned-studio-shifts-focus-away-from-beloved-rally-games/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">confirmed</a> that Codemasters had been hit by layoffs, and that some of its staff had been moved away from the studio to work on other in-development EA titles.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see what Nacon's plans for its WRC games are; we don't yet know who's developing the new rally racers, but it sounds like we'll have to wait until at least 2027 to get our hands on the first post-EA Nacon WRC game.</p>

			<p>Few products have the same clarity of design as the RIG line of headsets. Originally created by audio specialists Plantronics, and then bought and nurtured by French giant Nacon, RIG headsets have evolved, progressed and developed, but their design language has never faltered from the robust industrial looks of the first headset. RIG headsets look, unequivocally, like RIG headsets, and there’s nothing else quite like them. As for the RIG 900 Max HS? Well, it looks like a RIG headset, and frankly, it performs exactly like one too.</p>
<p>The RIG 900 HS is black. There’s a black steel headband, a black fabric tension band, black plastic earpieces and black dual fabric ear cushions. There are silver RIG logos, and the most minimal of silver detailing, but this is a plain, classic, gaming headset design. If you’ve never vibed with the industrial, girders and bolts looks of a RIG headset before, there is nothing here that will convince you otherwise because it looks more or less identical to the vast majority of their output.</p>



<p>It’s what’s on the inside that counts, though. The 900 Max HS is, for now, the pinnacle of RIG’s lineup, with an RRP of £210/€250, and a specification that should make most prospective headset buyers sit up and take notice. There’s the dual wireless connections, with both Bluetooth and a USB dongle, allowing users able to connect to both at the same time. There’s the 50 to 60-hour battery life, and an included charging stand, which makes sure it’s nearly impossible to run out of power.</p>
<p>The killer feature has to be comfort. Nacon have nailed this down over the last few years, and the RIG 900 Max HS is amongst the lightest and most comfortable headsets you’ll find. Despite packing in all the necessary tech and honestly being pretty massive on your head, they only weigh 293g, and that’s dispersed perfectly across your head and ears thanks to the floating headband design. I would say that, despite their Bluetooth connectivity, this isn’t a headset I’d be wearing outside of the house, but it is one you can wear all day long, through the longest gaming sessions, and come out the other side feeling like you’ve not had anything on your head at all.</p>

<p>In that quest for ultra-lightweight, there are some elements that feel less premium, particularly in the amount of plastics used, and the controls and microphone boom arm missing the heft or solidity that you might find in other similarly priced headsets. Personally, I don’t mind that when it results in such a lightweight headset, but I can see some buyers feeling as though they’ve bought something economical rather than exceptional.</p>

<p>The audio certainly isn’t cheap though. Delivered by 40mm drivers, the key with the Nacon 900 Max HS’s delivery is tautness. It’s tight, precise and perfectly tuned, with plenty of top-note detail balanced against a bottom end that’s rounded and firm, avoiding becoming overwhelming. It’s almost restrained compared to some of its peers, particularly Turtle Beach’s offerings, but that ensures you can hear every element of a game, movie or song without losing anything. Just as with the weight, this is a headset you can listen to all day, without fatigue.</p>
<p>You can tune it to match your tastes, with the ability to use custom EQ settings via the RIG 900 Max Series iOS and Android app. From here, you can update your headset, alter the microphone performance, and really dig into the details with Expert Mode, shifting your options from a 3-point EQ to 10-point one, and giving you more granular control elsewhere. Since I listen to an unholy amount of rock and metal, I tend to use the classic scoop EQ layout, and the 900 Max HS gave the new Sleep Token album’s dark synth-led tones plenty of heft, without losing any detail from the soaring vocals.</p>
<p>The RIG 900 Max HS boasts a fold-away boom mic, and though the end is made from flexible rubber, it doesn’t particularly mould or move in any way beyond up and down. That might be a hindrance for some – particularly if you like to be able to shift your mic and whisper into it when everyone else in your house has gone to sleep, but you can tune the gain up if you’re trying to be quiet, or down when the whooping and hollering begins. I’ve been whopping and hollering quite a lot while playing Roadcraft, and my co-op partners didn’t seem to mind too mcuh, so I’d say it’s doing a good job.</p>

<p>Most impressively, this is a true multiplatform headset. While it’s PS5 branded, it works with Playstation, Xbox, PC, Mobile and Nintendo Switch without any fuss. The dock does exactly as it needs to as well. The connection is straightforward and robust, letting you plonk your headset down on the dock without having to wiggle or manoeuvre it into place like you might with others like the Astro A50. There’s also a USB-A port built in for the wireless dongle, keeping everything together in one place and helping ensure the dongle can provide a good signal by being out in the open.</p>
<p>We’re at a point now where £210 is almost becoming the mid-tier for gaming headsets, and the RIG 900 Max HS brings a lot to the table for that price. There is literally nothing on the market that’s as comfortable as this, but if you’re looking for bombastic audio there’s the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/07/26/turtle-beach-stealth-pro-gaming-headset-review/">Turtle Beach Stealth Pro</a>, or if you want something that feels truly premium there’s the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/10/corsair-virtuoso-max-gaming-headset-review/">Corsair Virtuoso Max</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-developers-detail-may-28-ver-1011-update<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds"><u>Monster Hunter Wilds</u></a> director Yuya Tokuda has revealed what's coming up in the May 28 Ver. 1.011 update, including "an abundance of new features and changes to the game including a collaboration with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/street-fighter-6"><u>Street Fighter 6</u></a>."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In his latest Director's Letter, Tokuda said the team wanted "to provide more great content for you to enjoy as well as make various adjustments to make Monster Hunter Wilds even more fun to play," including new challenger, Street Fighter's Akuma. You'll get a full Arkuma armor set as well as layered armor, and whenever you have either set equipped, three items will be added to your item bar — assisted combo Akuma, Drive Impact, and Gou Hadoken (you can find out more about them on the official Monster Hunter <a href="https://www.monsterhunter.com/wilds/en-uk/topics/director-letter-2505/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>website</u></a>).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We're also getting eight-star "challenging" monsters in Ver. 1.011 — Gore Magala, Rey Dau, Uth Duna, Nu Udra, and Jin Dahaad will become available to hunt at HR 41 and higher; this will give players options for hunting eight-star tempered monsters other than Arkveld — although they will still be available to hunt at seven-star difficulty. The eight-star versions, however, will be more resilient, with increased health, wound resistance, and "tweaks to multiplayer scaling." Tokuda warns that Tempered Gore Magala is a "particularly tough challenge to even the best of hunters." You can expect higher-difficulty quests and quests with multiple monsters to pop up more often, too, as your HR increases.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">A slew of "player-centric balance adjustments" are also on the way in both Ver. 1.011 and Title Update 2. The Hammer, Hunting Horn, Gunlance, Light Bowgun, and Heavy Bowgun all had various adjustments made, and "certain aspects" for Gunlance Artian weapons have been increased.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"While some weapons have had certain parameters adjusted downward, other parameters have been adjusted upwards, and viewed in totality I think you will find that all weapon types have had their possibilities expanded, so I encourage you to give them a try for yourself once the update is out," Tokuda said, adding that the Hammer and Dual Blades are additionally receiving "various improvements."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As part of other QoL tweaks, Hunters will be able to rest in the Grand Hub and Suja, Peaks of Accord. Resting restores all destroyed Pop-up Camps, a confirmation window will no longer appear after obtaining an item when your item pouch is full (the obtained item will automatically be sent to your item box), and the visibility of the remaining time of meal effects is improved — the countdown will display 10 minutes before expiration. In fact, all notifications have been adjusted, with their frequency in locales lowered so only higher-priority targets will be displayed in the environment overview. They will also no longer block the input for opening the map.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"As mentioned in the previous director's letter, you will be able to view individual endemic life you captured," Tokuda added. "In the Windward Plains, select Check Endemic Life in Ecological Research to view your creatures and their names, as well as the size and weight of fish you caught. You can also favorite creatures so that they'll be kept even if you go over the maximum storage capacity! Individual creatures can have different patterns or other unique elements, so if you find one you particularly like, be sure to use this feature to keep it around!"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can also expect stability improvements — particularly on Steam — and with the addition of eight-star monsters, the rewards for eight-star investigations and field surveys have also been increased. Guild Point rewards for fishing have also been "rebalanced," although how has yet to be explained. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Monster Hunter Wilds is the latest mainline installment in Capcom's longrunning Monster Hunter series, boasting dynamic, ever-changing environments, and a story of monsters and humans in a world with two faces: one in which the lands are harsh and unforgiving, where monsters fight for scant resources and another in which the lands are vibrant and brimming with life. We gave <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-review"><u>Monster Hunters Wilds an 8 in our review</u></a>, writing: "Monster Hunter Wilds continues to smooth off the rougher corners of the series in smart ways, making for some extremely fun fights but also lacking any real challenge."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Did you see that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-player-uses-an-unconventional-method-to-dodge-an-attack-their-emotes"><u>Monster Hunter Wilds players have discovered an unconventional method of dodge attacks by using their emotes?</u></a></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.

			<p>Future Nintendo Switch 2 games may be able to use more of the system's resources, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>Famiiboards forums member&nbsp;<a href="https://famiboards.com/threads/future-nintendo-hardware-technology-speculation-discussion-st-closes-june-5th-12am-jst-please-read-newest-staff-post.55/post-1813878" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MattAgain</a>, a known developer who has worked in the game industry and has provided some <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-cpu-not-cause-of-concern-ports/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interesting insights in the past</a>, revealed that more console resources, such as CPU cores and RAM, are now available for developers compared to an earlier development environment. According to the user, the goal is to reduce the system resources reserved for the OS to 1 CPU core and 2 GB of RAM, which would allow developers to squeeze more out of the hardware in the future.</p>
<p>Though Nintendo, as usual, hasn't provided detailed information, we learned more about the Nintendo Switch 2 specifications <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-final-system-specifications-cpu-gpu-dlss/">earlier this month</a> thanks to the system SDK. As confirmed by Digital Foundry, the system currently reserves 3 GB of RAM and 2 CPU cores for the OS, which will likely contribute to getting GameChat running without issues, although it's clear how the new feature could be rather demanding, as the system's SDK allows developers to test their games as if the feature is running without having an active session.</p>
<p>Even without all the system resources available for games, some Nintendo Switch 2 games are already showing that the system can run demanding games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-new-comparison-videos-highlight-how-the-game-and-technology-have-come-a-long-way-since-1-0-version/">Cyberpunk 2077</a> well. The open-world RPG developed by CD Projekt Red, which will launch together with the system early next month, has already proven with pre-release footage how Nintendo's next-generation console can deliver a better experience than previous-generation systems and some of the most popular handheld systems like the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 launches on June 5th worldwide, with some exceptions.</p>
