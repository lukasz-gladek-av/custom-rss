            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Templar Media is a new publisher in the video game industry that was founded earlier this year by John Gibson, former chief executive officer of the publisher and developer Tripwire Interactive. Templar Media's first published title is set to be Gate Zero, a time-travelling action-adventure game where you can "<em>play the Bible</em>," <a href="https://gatezero.game/">according to its website</a>, and today Templar Media announced it would be doing more than just publishing Gate Zero;<a href="https://templarmedia.com/templar-media-acquires-gate-zero-developer-bible-x-cementing-commitment-to-entertainment-first"> it will acquire the studio making the game, Bible X</a>.</p>



<p>Gibson, you might recall, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tripwire-appoints-new-interim-ceo-following-backlash-against-john-gibsons-views-on-abortion/">stepped down from Tripwire Interactive in 2021</a> after the studio received significant backlash due to Gibson sharing his views on abortion on X (formerly Twitter) and advocating in favour of the abortion ban that, at the time, had recently been passed by Texas.</p>



<p>Within hours of Gibson sharing his views, studios that had previously worked with Tripwire had made public statements that they would be cutting off ties to the publisher. A few short days after the tweet, Tripwire announced that Gibson would be stepping down.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>After all that, for Gibson to return with a studio called 'Templar Media,' and for the first game it publishes to be a game by a studio called Bible X, a studio they are now acquiring as they work on a game where you play as a rebellious teenager from the future who is mistakenly sent back in time and experiences Biblical stories first-hand is perhaps one of the least surprising elements of 2025.</p>



<p>All that said, it's not like Gibson, his team, and Bible X are making a game that only they want to see. Gate Zero raised $330,000 in a Kickstarter campaign to help fund the game across 4,145 donations, and over $6 million euros raised through separate donations. That's nothing to sneeze at. </p>



<p>"<em>From the moment we saw Gate Zero, we knew it had enormous potential as a high quality game that was being created for a massive, yet underserved gaming audience,</em>" said Gibson in the acquisition announcement. "<em>With this acquisition we can now apply the full experience, support and resources of Templar Media into creating the incredible ‘Entertainment First’ experience that gamers worldwide have been asking for.</em>"</p>

<p>Arve Solli, Bible X studio head, added, "<em>As proven by the commercial success of TV and movies like </em><em>The Chosen</em> and <em>The King of Kings</em>, there’s a massive audience seeking top-tier content that explores their values. With Gate Zero, we plan to meet that demand with a full-featured, story-rich video game that allows the player to explore the history and stories found in the Bible, in a grounded and historically accurate way."</p>



<p>There's currently no release date for Gate Zero, though it is slated to arrive on PC, Xbox Series X/S, and PS5 when it's ready.</p>

            <p>Steam Replay, Valve's yearly roundup of where all of the hours spent playing games in the Steamy place have gone, has emerged from its hidey-hole yet again. 2025's edition is out now - you've likely already seen it if you've hopped into Steam since yesterday afternoon. Amid all the bits telling you that you've spent 1000 hours playing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/uma-musume-pretty-derby">Umamusume: Pretty Derby</a> thus far, the annual report's dished out some fresh stats about how old the games everyone across the platform's user base has been playing this year are.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>To get a bit navel gazey for a second, these <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/replay/">Replays</a> usually stand more than anything to remind me how much doing this job generally warps the game playing habits of myself and my peers away from the norm. For instance, 28% of my personal playtime this year was spent on games which came out in 2025, a decent chunk more than the worldwide average of 14% across the entirety of the Steamaverse. For context, that's also with some new releases I've <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-outer-worlds-2-review">spent a lot of time with</a> this year - <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-outer-worlds-2">The Outer Worlds 2</a> chief among them - not having been counted as part of that total due to circumstance dictating I didn't put my hours into them via my personal Steam account.</p>
<p>That 14% figure across all Steam users is only down a single percentage point from last year's total of 15%, with 2023 and 2022's figures sitting at 9% and 17% respectively. So, things very much look to have settled into a mid-teens ball park. The game playage this year's rounded out by 44% of our collective time being dedicated to games which have been out for one to seven years and 40% being dedicated to games eight years or older.</p>
<p>Those last two also generally stack up pretty similarly to previous years, though there was a pretty weird flip-flop in terms of the largest majority from 64% of the older lot to 52% in favour of the one-to-seven crowd from 2022 to 2023. Sadly, the data doesn't go back any further than that, let alone to pre-2008 so we could see what these numbers looked like prior to the first of the approximately ten million financial belt-tightenings we've all lived through since that point.</p><p>Anyway, as a palette cleanser following that maths, here's a very tragic personal factoid. Last year, I managed a longest streak of 69 consecutive days firing up a game on Steam. It was totally by accident that this ended up being the sex number, I swear. This year, I regret to inform you that my longest streak ran to 97 days, which - aside from inferring a slightly more dire state in terms of my ability to drag myself away from my keyboard - is not a funny number.</p>
<p>And what is life if you're not accidentally racking up funny numbers whenever possible?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p><em>Remember when you’d walk into a local music, book, or video store and there’d be an adorable section where the employees would recommend what they were interested in that month?&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>Welcome to our little version of it, called Remap Recommends.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>It's a chance for the staff at Remap to let you know what they've been playing, reading, listening to, or watching.</em></p><hr><h3 id="patrick-recommends-the-mitchells-vs-the-machines">Patrick Recommends: <em>The Mitchells vs. The Machines</em></h3><figure></figure><p>Okay, so this movie isn't new—it came out back in 2021—but it's become the latest movie my children are watching over and over and over again, to the point that sometimes they won't even watch it from the start and will instead choose a favorite part they're into, load the movie there, and watch until the credits hit.</p><p>Fuck, man, this flick makes me cry every time. Hell, I'll be on the other side of the house and start tearing up when I hear certain musical notes being hit. Which is probably not shocking to learn when you combine a sap (me) with a movie about a father and daughter relationship (also me) and a parent who hopes they'll find a way to graduate from parent to friend when their kids are older (again, also me).</p><p>Do I think I'm as obviously aloof as the dad in the movie (Danny McBride)? Of course not! I <em>know</em> I'm not! But I also don't know <em>what </em>I'll be aloof about until it's too late; it's the very nature of an evolving relationship between kids and parents.</p><p>I remember quite liking it back in 2021 but over the course of the past month, I've probably watched the movie in totality, in some mangled form, a half dozen times. And now it's gone from a movie that I liked to a movie I love and, quite frankly, probably one of my favorite animated films. It really seems to understand the complicated dynamics driving modern relationships between parents and kids in a way that has only become more relatable as my oldest becomes, well, older. (She's nine now. She would've been 5ish when the movie originally came out on Netflix. That's basically a generation of time.)</p><p>The message at its core is a good one, imo, and it's part of why I managed to have such a good relationship with my parents as I got older: they <em>saw</em> me. Or tried. The key to navigating the maturing of a kid/parent relationship, I think, is seeing one another, and for the parent, it's realizing it's your responsibility to see them before they can see you. Maybe you think they're making a mistake, maybe you don't "get" them. But say you do. You <em>try</em>. Getting that feeling back at you is going to take longer for a kid, young adult, whatever—you <em>know</em> better. You went through this already!</p><p>Also, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7s1tcl4fhM&amp;ref=remapradio.com">the song that plays over the soundtrack is <em>so</em> good</a>. What a bop.</p><hr><h3 id="rob-recommends-superman-2025">Rob Recommends: Superman (2025)</h3><figure><figcaption><span>Sad robot is sad.</span></figcaption></figure><p>I tend to find James Gunn’s stuff a little grating. Enjoyable, but a bit twee and cloyingly “feel good”. So I was not excited about his <em>Superman </em>and the way it was seen as a return to what the character “ought” to be: pure uncomplicated goodness and optimism. The moment in the trailer where a little kid in some Distant War Torn Land did the Iwo Jima flag-raising with a Superman pennant did not, to put it mildly, inspire confidence.</p><p>You know what, though? <em>Superman </em>ruled. Even that moment ends up being more nuanced than expected, as (spoilers) Supes is not going to come save that kid at that moment and the happy outcome is ambiguous even as it’s delightful.</p><p>The slightly peevish, needling dynamic between Clark and Lois? Krypto the Superdog being a little asshole chaos gremlin? Alan Tudyk doing what he does best: playing a charismatic robot? Loved all of it.</p><p>It’s also fascinating in the ways, like all great superhero movies, it reflects its moment. Superman’s parents are revealed to be would-be colonizers whose tragic backstory does not diminish their authoritarian, violent vision for how Superman should conduct himself on earth. The US government views Superman as a dangerous alien threat to its unipolar world order and banishes him to a extradimensional black site run by a private contractor. In Nicholas Hoult’s Luther and his army of STEM lackeys, the movie has the Musk cult pretty neatly dialed-in. We see Superman helping firefighters a lot. Cops and troops? Not so much. We even have an early scene where Lois nails Clark with a lot of “gotcha” questions predicated on “view from nowhere” reporting that pretends to have no memory or judgment about the subjects of its stories.</p><p>All in all, it was a pretty great thing to fire up on <em>HBO Max Plus Discovery </em>or whatever they’re calling it now. It also made me wonder: should I watch <em>Peacemaker? </em></p><hr><h3 id="chia-recommends-star-wars-rebellion-with-the-rise-of-the-empire-expansion">Chia Recommends: Star Wars Rebellion (with the Rise of the Empire Expansion) </h3><figure><figcaption><span>Image courtesy of Fantasy Flight Games</span></figcaption></figure><p>I’m a bit of a mark for most anything Star Wars, so it’s a bit of a shock to me that I’d missed out on <em>Star Wars Rebellion </em>for so long. I’d spent the better part of the late 2010s getting into and then watching the slow “death” of <em>X-Wing, </em>the miniature dogfighting game from Fantasy Flight Games that has one of the best feeling skill curves of any miniatures game I’ve ever played (you have to learn how each ship flies because unlike most minis games you can’t pre-measure your moves, which makes “piloting” feel dangerous and extremely satisfying once you’ve gotten a handle on the “feel” of a certain ship). All the while, Fantasy Flight Games were also making one of the best asymmetric two player board games I’ve played in a long time, also set in the Star Wars universe, whose thematic trappings and asymmetric mechanics are so strong that the second my first nearly 5 hour spanning game was done, I was immediately chomping at the bit to run it back.</p><p><em>Star Wars Rebellion </em>puts two players into the roles of the Galactic Empire and the Rebel Alliance, each working towards their own specific end game goals. The Galactic Empire has to find the Rebel Base and destroy all rebels on that planet (or you know, take the death star over there and destroy the whole planet) while the Rebels have to complete specific objectives that gain them reputation. Reputation is a marker that starts at the far end of the round timer track, and if the round timer ever meets the Rebel reputation marker, then the rebels have convinced enough of the galaxy to join their cause that the Empire is overthrown.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Image courtesy of Fantasy Flight Games</span></figcaption></figure><p>You each plan your turns out by assigning a pool of Leaders to specific mission cards, first the rebels, then the empire. This is important because each leader that doesn’t get assigned to a specific mission can be used across your turns to move your units across the board, initiating combat, or to try to counter your opponents missions. This balancing act of trying to do missions but also being cognizant that there might be something you need to contest directly gives the game a lot of strategic depth, and with the Empire being able to plan after the Rebels it gives this added layer of the Empire always knowing the shape of their opponent’s turn before they have to commit to any missions themselves. It makes the near omniscience of Empire really felt, even if they don’t know <em>what</em> you’re doing, they know <em>that</em> you’re doing something, and that’s dangerous.</p><p>The magic of this game comes from this asymmetry and the Probe Deck. Each space on the board is a different system, planets from across all sorts of Star Wars media, and each planet has a corresponding card in the Probe deck. At the start of the game, after the Empire has set up on a randomized set of Empire specific systems, the Rebel Player chooses one card out of the leftover 26 cards to designate as the rebel base. The base has it’s own separate space on the board which allows you to build and move units in and out of while at the same time keeping the actual location of the base secret. Each turn the Empire player is going to draw two new cards from the remaining 25, understanding that if you draw a card from the Probe deck that means it can’t be the rebel base, creating an inevitability dwindling amount of safe spaces to house the scrappy rebellion as the game goes on.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Image courtesy of Fantasy Flight Games</span></figcaption></figure><p>This cat and mouse game, the feeling of slow suffocation as the Rebels, the sense of growing insurgency and popular opinion slowly turning against you as the Empire, is so strong from these mechanics alone that if you were to wholesale shift these mechanics to a different themed Oppressor vs. Oppressed setting it would still be as compelling, which makes for the best kind of franchise based game in my opinion. The <em>Star Wars </em>special sauce sprinkled on top however does give it that extra oomph that makes pulling off certain moments really sing if you’re a fan of the series. In one of my playthroughs as the Empire I was able to take Luke and turn him to the dark side, effectively stealing one of my opponents commanding pieces, while in turn they were able to kill one of my generals with Leia, who in the absence of her brother almost naturally seemed to step into his role as the Jedi in training. It’s really fun thematically, but so strong mechanically that it doesn’t lean on it’s themes to prop it up. All in all it’s an excellent way for two people to spend a really tense and exhilarating 4-6 hours, one that I’m so glad I’ve had the opportunity to enjoy.</p>

It will ship with the September-released version 2.0 update “LASTBOSS, Genius Gyaru Doctor,” as well as cross-play support. <span id="more-1015756"></span></p><p><em>UNDERWARD</em> first launched for PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3025290/UNDERWARD/" target="_blank">Steam</a> on February 5, followed by PlayStation 5 on June 22.</p><div><p><strong>About</strong></p><p><em>UNDERWARD</em> is a one-to-four-player cooperative horror exploration game.</p><p>Investigators must carry “TEST-SUBJECT” monsters from a deadly underground abandoned hospital ward.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Can you uncover the truth hidden deep within the depths of <em>UNDERWARD</em>?</p><p><strong>Single Play: An Extreme <a title="Genres > Stealth [106 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/stealth">Stealth</a> Challenge</strong></p><p><em>UNDERWARD</em> is also playable single play, but be warned—single play is an ultra-high-difficulty mode where getting caught means instant game over. The game includes many trial-and-error challenges, so in solo play, you’ll need to learn through death and keep progressing.</p><p>(Version 1.0.2.0 introduced extra lives and solo play adjustments for a better experience.)</p><p>Without the ability to perform chained carries, you’ll have to carefully transport your cargo while constantly fearing an enemy ambush, making for an intensely thrilling experience. You’ll need to avoid detection, watch out for traps, and proceed with extra caution. While the gameplay differs significantly from <a title="Genres > Multiplayer [665 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer">multiplayer</a>, this mode is perfect for players seeking a truly spine-chilling horror experience.</p><p><strong>Mission</strong></p><p>Explore the depths of <em>UNDERWARD</em> and carry the “TEST-SUBJECT” monsters to the elevator.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Search “Test Subjects”</strong></p><p>Once you exit the elevator, scour the floor for “TEST-SUBJECT.”</p><p>But beware—traps and dangers are lurking everywhere. Some areas and mechanisms can only be accessed by cooperating with your teammates. It’s best to avoid venturing alone if possible.</p><p>You might also find useful tools left behind in the area. Be sure to check out lockers, shelves, and any other hiding spots for gear. With luck, you may even find some highly advanced equipment.</p><p><strong>Step 2: If They See You, Run or…</strong></p><p>There’s a chance you will encounter unknown enemies during your search.</p><p>They’re attracted to noise, so stay cautious. If you hide quietly, they might pass without noticing you. Adapt to the situation as needed.</p><p>But if you get spotted, run as fast as you can! Throw items you have at them—it might just help you fend them off.</p><p>Even if someone gets taken down, there’s still hope for rescue.</p><p>Your teammate’s location will be displayed on the screen, so act quickly and stay calm. Minimizing casualties will strengthen the team bond.</p><p>But remember: the window for rescue is shrinking by the second.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Carry and Carry and Carry!</strong></p><p>Once you’ve found “TEST-SUBJECT,” carry it to the elevator with all your might.</p><p>Carrying the capsule creates a lot of noise, attracting enemies, so stay vigilant.</p><p>Although a single investigator can’t handle the heavy capsule alone, you can perform a “Connected Carry” system with multiple players to move it faster than the enemies can catch up.</p><p>However, if your teamwork falters, it could mean a one-way ticket to the afterlife.</p><p>Each “TEST-SUBJECT” has a different value.</p><p>We hope the team can retrieve the most valuable “TEST-SUBJECT” possible.</p><p><strong>Then… Deeper into the “UNDERWARD”</strong></p><p>Once you’ve met the recovery quota, proceed with the verification of the “TEST-SUBJECTS.” We will operate the elevator to the next floor, so investigators should close the elevator door and wait inside.</p><p>We take great pride in the investigators who choose to venture deeper into the more dangerous floors.</p><p>…Please note that we do not guarantee the safety of your life on this mission.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li>One-to-four-player cooperative horror exploration game.</li><li>Proximity-based voice chat.</li><li>Randomized, labyrinthine underground hospital floors (with some areas that don’t feel like a hospital at all).</li><li>Deadly and seductive nurse monsters that hunt you.</li><li>Vicious hunters that can be unleashed over time.</li><li>Retrieve capsules containing “TEST-SUBJECT.”</li><li>Supply Machine System: Exchange retrieval rewards for randomized items.</li><li>“Connected Carry” system for high-speed carry with multiple players.</li><li>Various useful items that can be carried over to the next floor.</li><li>Total wipeout = all is lost.

<p dir="ltr">The Nintendo store listings note that there will be a free Switch 2 upgrade for Dispatch. That edition of the game sports "enhanced resolution and improved frame rates" and will take up an estimated 14.6GB of storage space. The listed price is $43.95 AUD--with a launch discount--but keep in mind Australian prices are usually higher than in the US. For example, <a href="https://ec.nintendo.com/AU/en/titles/70010000084767" rel="nofollow ">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond on Switch 2</a> is $109.95 AUD. In comparison, Dispatch costs $30 on Steam and PS5.</p><p dir="ltr">Dispatch is one of <a href="https://ec.nintendo.com/AU/en/titles/70010000084767" rel="nofollow ">GameSpot's 10 best games for 2025</a>. The game sees you taking on the role of Robert Robertson's Mecha Man, though his suit has become damaged. As such, Robert has to adapt from working out in the field to working in a dispatch center.

                <p>For years, EA Sports was the one-stop shop for FIFA-branded soccer, but that partnership officially ended in 2023. Since then, FIFA has been absent from the video game scene, but today Netflix Games and Delphi Interactive have announced that they will be bringing officially branded FIFA soccer back in a new game slated to launch in 2026.</p><p>The unnamed FIFA soccer game will be available via the Netflix app on both iOS and Android devices, and it is planned to launch "this summer," just in time for the FIFA World Cup 2026. The official announcement calls the new game a "newly reimagined FIFA football simulation game," but no other details were provided.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4624666-fifa-netflix.png" data-ref-id="1300-4624666" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1600" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4624666-fifa-netflix.png" data-ref-id="1300-4624666"></a><figcaption>FIFA and Netflix Games</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4624666-fifa-netflix.png"></figure><p>"This major collaboration is a key milestone in FIFA’s commitment to innovation in the football gaming space, which aspires to reach billions of football fans of all ages everywhere in the world and will be redefining the pure notion of simulation games," FIFA president Gianni Infantino said in the offical announcement. "Our reimagined game truly marks the beginning of a new era of digital football."</p><p>The FIFA partnership marks the latest splash from Netflix Games, which also added WWE 2K and Grand Theft Auto to its service in recent months. Its parent company has not been quiet either, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-announces-purchase-of-warner-bros-for-over-82-billion/1100-6536717/" data-ref-id="1100-6536717">Netflix recently reaching an agreement to purchase Warner Bros.</a> for $82 billion.</p><p>Delphi Interactive is a California-based development studio headed by Casper Alexander Daugaard and ex-Zynga executive Andy Kleinman. The studio is also working in partnership with IO Interactive on 007: First Light.</p><p>More information on this new FIFA soccer game will "come in 2026."</p>

                <p>The Last of Us co-director Bruce Straley has shared his thoughts on using generative AI to aid in game development, saying the technology cannot "grow and think for itself."</p><p>The technology "just consumes, and tries to mimic what it's consumed," he told <a href="https://www.polygon.com/bruce-straley-generative-ai-interview/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Polygon</a>. "That's the best it can do right now." He also described generative AI as "a snake eating its own tail."</p><p>One of the reasons why AI has been such a contentious issue in gaming is that not everyone defines it the same way. For his part, Straley said "NPCs are AI" and have been for decades already in gaming. Straley's new game, Coven of the Chickenfoot, has players taking on the role of Gertie, an elderly witch who works alongside a "creature companion" who can "observe, learn, and evelopment new behaviors based on contextual situations."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRNAbGYwvgg" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mRNAbGYwvgg" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>This setup has led some to wonder if the creature was made using generative AI or other types of artificial intelligence technologies. But Straley said the creature was human-crafted.</p><p>"If you feed it too many bad apples, it gets indigestion and poops in the woods. These are the things you can discover, but it's because we can create a world and craft those moments," he said.</p><p>The goal was not to create a "human" companion with "human intelligence," Straley said. He pointed out that the human brain is a "miracle" and trying to replicate that in a machine isn't something Straley is interested in pursuing.</p><p>"I don't know who wants it, I don't know who's asking for it, I don't know who's pushing for it, but I don't think it's the way as a human species we need to be evolving," he said.</p><p>For Coven of the Chickenfoot, Straley said there was no machine-learning or large language models used in the game's development. "No, we did none of that. This is hard work, and a lot of problem solving, and a lot of creative thinking," he said.</p><p>Finally, Straley said he believes generative AI systems can "maybe" create compelling content in some contexts where the systems are limited to a specific game world. But Straley said he is "not interested in the slightest" to pursue this. "I have zero interest in looking at art that is generated by a computer. I don't think prompting is art. I don't like AI!" he said.</p><p>Straley <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-bruce-straley-shares-more-details-about-why-he-left-naughty-dog/1100-6536947/" data-ref-id="1100-6536947">left Naughty Dog in 2017</a> after 18 years and started a new studio, Wildflower Interactive, in 2022.</p><p>In other AI-related news, the CEO of Baldur's Gate 3 developer Larian recently responded to backlash to his comments about how the studio <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-divinity-dev-reveals-how-it-uses-generative-ai/1100-6537001/" data-ref-id="1100-6537001">may use AI in early-production work for Divinity.</a></p>

            <p>Arkane Studios' Harvey Smith has reflected on Microsoft's closure of the studio last year, describing it as "a shock" after its run of successes.</p>
<p>Smith was lead game designer on the original <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/deus-ex">Deus Ex</a> in 2000, before eventually joining Arkane in 2008. After working as co-creative director on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dishonored">Dishonored</a>, he worked on its sequel, Prey, and the studio's final, ill-fated live-service game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/redfall">Redfall</a>. The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-shuts-slew-of-bethesda-studios-including-redfall-hi-fi-rush-developers">studio was shut down by Microsoft in May last year</a>, following the poor sales of Redfall.</p>
<p>"Every company makes the decisions they make for the reason they make them," said Smith  on the <a href="https://shows.acast.com/my-perfect-console/episodes/harvey-smith-game-director-deus-ex-dishonored-redfall">My Perfect Console podcast</a>. "I don't agree with them often, but the main shock there was this studio made Dishonored, along with the Lyon studio, and then they made Prey. Then we were working on Redfall for a number of years during the pandemic and everything else. The industry exploring games-as-a-service games... It is what it is. Creative efforts are unpredictable."</p>

<p>He continued: "It was a shock at first, but who I really felt for were the people who were new, this was their first project or they'd only been in the industry for a while."</p>
<p>Smith admitted his own privilege with the situation considering his years of experience and the ups and downs he's worked through, but lamented the loss of junior staff through studio closures and layoffs for whom developing the game was a "mind-blowing experience".</p>
<p>"It was a shock," he said. "It was not a decision I agreed with. I did believe very much in the future of the studio, we were working on something super cool."</p>
<p>At least, the studio was able to release its 1.4 update to Redfall after the announcement of its closure, what Smith described as a "huge upgrade to the game". "If we had launched with that and then built from there it might have been a different story," he said, adding the update allowed the team to get "as close as we could" to the vision of the game.</p>
<p>Smith also discussed the difficulties of receiving feedback from players online, which perhaps led to the downfall of Redfall and the studio - particularly the "vitriol" on social media.</p>
<p>"I feel like video game developers get it worse," he said, comparing the reaction to games to that of artists or musicians. "You release your game, it took years to get there, maybe it flops, maybe it does ok, maybe people hate it. Even if they love it, there's a social media caustic, acidic vitriol that gets thrown at you. And every time you ship a game there's always going to be that, every time there's that vitriol no matter what you do. Then you hope that the number of people who love it swamp that, overwhelm it."</p>
<p>Before Dishonored, Smith said he worked on a couple of games at Arkane that never saw the light of day. One of those was a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/blade-runner">Blade Runner</a> game, which certainly would've suited him well after Deus Ex.</p>
<p>"We were working for a while on a Blade Runner game, which was super exciting to me. What we could have done with Blade Runner…," he said, before tailing off. Alas, perhaps we'll never know.</p>
<p>After Redfall's release, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-apologises-for-redfalls-disastrous-launch-we-let-a-lot-of-people-down-this-week">Microsoft Gaming boss Phil Spencer apologised for its disastrous launch</a>. "We let a lot of people down this week," he said.</p>
<p>"Arkane's vampire thriller is muddled and deeply compromised, but has moments of real charm," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/redfall-review-a-bit-of-a-mess-but-not-without-its-pleasures">Redfall review</a>.</p>

You don't need yet <em>another</em> reason to pick up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a>, right? Well, you know us, we're here to deliver the goods.</p>
<p>GameStop has announced that it will be issuing a free tote bag (gasp!) for in-store pre-orders for Requiem on all available platforms. It depicts the ruined landscape of Racoon City with the game's title at the top. Form an orderly queue folks, come on now!</p>

<p>Look, to be serious for a moment, we know it's not the coolest pre-order bonus ever, but heck, it's free. For diehard fans of the series, it could be a cool little thing to hang off the end of a shelf, or something. We're grasping, sure, but still...</p>
<p>Regardless of where you wind up purchasing it, Resident Evil Requiem will launch on the Switch 2 on <strong>27th February 2026</strong>. It sees the return of veteran Leon Kennedy and the introduction of FBI agent Grave Ashcroft, whose mother – Alyssa – was a key character in the classic PS2 title, Resident Evil: Oubreak.</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/games/845376/xbox-games-pass-best-games-2025</link>
            <guid>1385941</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>From <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/693535/microsoft-layoffs-july-2025-xbox">pervasive layoffs</a> to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/789424/xbox-game-pass-premium-essentials-ultimate-price-increase-changes">continued price hikes</a>, things didn’t go so well for Xbox in 2025. But even though Game Pass, the Xbox subscription service, isn’t quite the deal it once was, there are still a lot of excellent titles to check out. This was an especially good year for indie titles, with breakout hits like <em>Blue Prince</em> and <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> dominating much of the conversation. Here are the best things to check out right now.</p><p>Who the heck knows when Bethesda will finally release the next <em>Elder Scrolls</em>. But in the meantime, <em>Avowed</em> fills in that gap quite nicely. It’s a more contained fantasy RPG in terms of scale, but it’s still pretty big, and features a fascinating world to explore and combat that lets you mix and match with swords, guns, and magic. You can lose yourself in it without giving up all of your free time.</p><p>For some people, the idea of a game where you play as a sentient lighthouse solving puzzles in a world devoid of people is probably enough of a sales pitch. For everyone else, let me just say: <em>Keeper</em> is an incredible puzzle-platform game and unlike almost anything else I’ve ever played. Perhaps most impressive is that it’s constantly shifting, so that once you come to grips with its weirdo world, it changes into something new and different.</p><p>What really sets this action-adventure game apart is its distinct world. <em>South of Midnight</em> is set in the deep South, and weaves together Black and southern folklore and culture to create the kind of setting you almost never see in video games. On your quest you’ll fight various monsters and creatures in order to heal a blighted landscape, which involves wielding magic powers and partnering with a sentient stuffed toy.</p><p>One of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/837245/expedition-33-was-the-most-popular-third-party-game-on-game-pass-this-year-rightly-so">most popular games on Game Pass this year</a> seemingly came out of nowhere. Developed by a brand-new studio called Sandfall Interactive, <em>Clair Obscur</em> is built in the mold of classic Japanese role-playing games like <em>Final Fantasy</em>, but with a distinctly French sense of style. Its mixture of sweeping story, incredible soundtrack, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/656552/clair-obscur-expedition-33-battles">open-ended combat</a> helped it stand out in a very crowded genre.</p><p>More than a decade in the making, <em>Routine</em> is a harsh sci-fi horror game with a very old-school sense of style inspired by the <em>Alien </em>films. That means lots of chunky retrofuturistic gadgets to get your hands on, and a very bleak and terrifying moon base to explore — if you can summon the guts.</p><div><p id="fallout-4-anniversary-edition"><h2><em>Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition</em></h2></p></div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/844926/fallout-season-2-review-amazon-prime-video">The return of the <em>Fallout</em> TV series</a> means there’s a good chance you’ll be looking to explore the post-apocalyptic wasteland in video game form, too. This new edition of <em>Fallout 4</em> — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/11/9/9693246/fallout-4-review-ps4-xbox-pc">which first released back in 2015</a> — brings together the base game and all of the previous DLC, but otherwise mostly leaves the experience intact. As they say, war never changes.</p><p>How much time do you have? Because the thing about <em>Blue Prince</em> is that, if it gets its hooks in you, it’s going to be very hard to put down. The architectural puzzle game has you exploring a vast mansion at the same time you build it, all in an attempt to uncover its secrets and find an inheritance you’re owed.</p><p>We called this “the feel-good game of the summer,” which should make <em>Wheel World</em> ideal for the gloomy and grey winter months. It’s an open-ended adventure where you bike your way through a fantasy world in order to perform an ancient ritual, which involves assembling a bicycle of legend. Mostly, though, it’s a peaceful way to take in some beautiful sights while speeding down the street.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTk3"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Webster</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/845376/xbox-games-pass-best-games-2025]]></content:encoded>

            <p>There won’t be any prizes for correctly guessing that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-walkthrough">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>’s first expansion, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksongs-first-big-expansion-sea-of-sorrow-flows-into-our-lives-for-free-next-year">Sea of Sorrow</a>, will involve a) a sea and b) some kind of adverse emotion. But there is mounting evidence that the watery DLC will restore, or at be inspired by, places and bugs that developers Team Cherry had previously left on Silksong’s cutting room floor – yet had been shown in in marketing for the main game as far back as 2019.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>All credit for this goes to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD0EZHwb9Zo">YouTube’s Hollow Knight loremaster Mossbag</a>, along with the loveable sickos that maintain the (non-Fextralife) <a href="https://hollowknight.wiki/w/Cut_Content_(Silksong)">Hollow Knight wiki</a>. Mossbag’s rain-lashed compass points towards Sea of Sorrows being at least partially based on <a href="https://hollowknight.wiki/w/Cut_Content_(Silksong)/Areas">Pharloom Bay</a>, which according to early development materials, would have been plopped at the far east of Silksong’s map, next to (eurghh) Bilewater. Pharloom Bay never made it into the game that finally released in September this year, but there is a distinctly nautical-lookin’ region shown at 1:13 in Silksong’s original reveal trailer, covered in barnacles and housing at least one conch-dwelling NPC:</p>
<figure><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFAknD_9U7c">
</a>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFAknD_9U7c" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>

<p>That area was never found in-game either, so it’s a pretty safe bet this was meant to be Pharloom Bay. And, as Mossbag notes, that old footage also shows the area being lit by distinct scythe-shaped bell lamps of an almost identical design to the lashed structures we see in the very first shot of Sea of Sorrow’s own teaser.</p><figure>

<p>Pharloom Bay might not be the only resurrected concept, either. The mysterious, lightning-struck glass chamber shown halfway through the Sea of Sorrow trailer looks an awful lot like the Lifeblood Spire, another cut area that’s been documented since before Silksong’s release. Specifically, by helpful Australians, who <a href="https://x.com/arfa2706/status/2000736787040203098">snapped photos</a> of a Hollow Knight exhibit at Melbourne’s ACMI (Australian Centre for the Moving Image) museum in Melbourne. That one never made it into a trailer so, y’know, cheers mates.</p>
<p>I absolutely don’t want to sound like I’m disdaining the practice of developers recycling ideas for DLC or expansions. If anything, it’s quite cool to see individual concepts float in and out of the gamesmaking process, and to wonder – aloud, sometimes – how they might’ve changed in the meantime. Silksong itself has another interesting example of this, which I’ll spell out if you don’t mind light spoilers. See the coral-coated, seemingly underwater environment at 0:23 in the reveal trailer? Seasoned skongers will know that colourful design only accounts for a tiny, optional segment of the game’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-act-3">infamously tricky final act</a>, but paying attention to lore snippets will reveal that Team Cherry reworked the wider region into the Sands of Karak: the same coral kingdom hinted at in the earlier trailer, but lost to time, dried out, and claimed by the desert.</p>
<p>Whether or not Pharloom Bay has been as drastically rejigged, Sea of Sorrow is currently aiming for release in 2026. Like the original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a>’s expansions, it’ll be free to owners of the base game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>LEGO sets is a holiday gifting staple that works for kids and adults but as Christmas approaches, finding products that actually arrive before December 25th becomes increasingly critical. This <em>Hogwarts Castle and Grounds</em> building set <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4207/">currently sells for $140 on Amazon, down from its regular $169 price</a>, and more importantly, it ships with guaranteed delivery before Christmas through Amazon’s fast shipping network.</p>
<p>This 2,660-piece display model recreates the most iconic location from the Harry Potter universe in impressive detail which makes it perfect for adult collectors and Harry Potter fans.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4207/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Full Castle Recreation with Amazing Detail</h2>
<p>The model shows how complicated the architecture of Hogwarts Castle is by including the <strong>Main Tower, Astronomy Tower, Great Hall, several courtyards, bridges, greenhouses, the Boathouse, and even the Black Lake</strong>. Each part fits together to make a complete picture of the castle grounds that matches the size and layout fans know from the books and movies.</p>
<p>The castle’s interior details make famous places come to life, like the <strong>Chamber of Secrets</strong> with its snake-shaped architecture, the Winged Key room from the Philosopher’s Stone challenges, the Potions Classroom where Snape scared students, and the Chessboard Chamber with its checkered floor pattern. These hidden details are worth looking for closely, and they add depth to the model beyond its impressive shape.</p>



<p>The grounds around the castle add to the experience by including important parts of the larger Hogwarts setting. The Durmstrang Ship is ready to take students who are visiting, and the Beauxbatons Carriage is a nice touch that fits with the story of the Triwizard Tournament. The Whomping Willow is standing there with its unique twisted branches, and the crashed Ford Anglia is nearby as a nod to Chamber of Secrets.</p>



<p>One of the best things about the model is how good it looks: When finished, <strong>it is over 8.5 inches tall, 13.5 inches wide, and 10 inches deep</strong> and the castle stands out on a shelf, desk, or display area without taking up too much space or needing a whole bookcase to hold it. The gold-colored Hogwarts architect statue mini-figure that comes with it is the icing on the cake, and the <em>“Hogwarts Castle”</em> nameplate makes it a collectible display piece.</p>
<p>You’re saving here almost $30 on a big LEGO set that has a lot of pieces and detail for the price. In this size range, LEGO sets that are similar to castles or buildings usually cost the same or more, so this deal is a good deal for adults who like LEGO and the promise of delivery before Christmas takes away the stress of ordering gifts so close to the holiday.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-dumps-the-eero-pro-wi-fi-6e-system-3-pack-at-40-off-breaking-the-price-down-to-almost-nothing-per-router-2000653948</link>
            <guid>1385923</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The year is coming to a close. While you’re crossing off every name on your list of who you need to shop for this holiday season, make sure not to forget someone especially important—you. That’s right, you deserve a big upgrade this time of year. How about saying goodbye to slow, spotty internet with the help of a Wi-Fi 6E mesh network? <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6467/">Right now, you can save as much as 40% on an eero Pro 6E mesh Wi-Fi router.</a> Individually, the router normally goes for $250, but the limited time deal has it marked down to just $160. You’ll save a solid $90.</p>
<p>A mesh Wi-Fi router’s real value lies in its ability to create a mesh network, which requires more than one router. Amazon offers these routers both individually and in bundled sets, including two, three, and four packs. Currently, these bundles are all heavily discounted. The two-pack, originally priced at $400, is now down to $240; the three-pack, originally $550, is now available for $330; and the four-pack, originally $800, has been reduced to $490. The best value right now is the three-pack, as each node costs just $110, making it the most affordable choice for expanding your network.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6467/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Full Home Coverage</h2>
<p>Slow or unreliable internet can be incredibly frustrating, especially when you’re trying to load web pages or stay connected to your devices at home. A Wi-Fi 6E mesh network, like the eero Pro 6E system, can resolve these issues by providing consistent coverage. Each eero node covers up to 2,000 sq. ft. and can support more than 100 Wi-Fi-enabled devices. The system’s patented TrueMesh technology ensures that your network traffic is routed efficiently, reducing dead zones and drop-offs.</p>
<p>With a three-node setup, you’ll be able to cover up to 6,000 sq. ft., connecting over 300 devices simultaneously. If that’s not enough, you can easily add more nodes later on to further expand both your coverage area and device capacity.</p>



<p>With the addition of Wi-Fi 6E, which introduces access to the 6 GHz band. It operates as a third lane, separate from the traditional 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands. You’ll experience faster speeds and improved performance across more devices. And setting up your mesh network is straightforward. The eero smartphone app provides step-by-step guidance to get your system up and running in no time.</p>
<p>In addition to excellent wireless coverage, three eero Pro 6E routers all together feature six built-in Ethernet ports, which can support speeds of up to 1 Gbps (1,000 Mbps). This makes them ideal for high-demand activities like streaming 4K video or playing cloud-based games. With the growing number of devices that support cloud gaming, such as Fire TV sticks and Samsung smart TVs, you can enjoy smooth gaming experiences without needing a physical console, thanks to the fast and reliable internet.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/steam-top-selling-2025-friendslop-rpgs-sales-2000654157</link>
            <guid>1385920</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>What were the most popular Steam games of 2025? Players have a sense based on Steam charts, general vibes, and what dominated conversations this year, but analyst Simon Carless recently shared official <em>GameDiscoverCo</em>. estimates for the top-performing games that show <a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-budget-cost-goty-sandfall-2000652590">just how much RPGs</a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/peak-roblox-cliff-knock-off-aggro-crab-2000614671">multiplayer games</a> reigned supreme.</p> <p>The latest edition of <a href="https://newsletter.gamediscover.co/p/revealed-the-top-new-pc-and-console-58">his excellent newsletter</a> contains estimates for the top-20&nbsp;<em>new</em> games on Steam this year by both total sales and total revenue. Here’s the list of games with the most copies sold:</p> <blockquote><p>20. Revenge on Gold Diggers<br> 19. Borderlands 4<br> 18. Dispatch<br> 17. Mage Arena<br> 16. The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered<br> 15. Split Fiction<br> 14. Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2<br> 13. Stellar Blade<br> 12. Megabonk<br> 11. Elden Ring Nightreign<br> 10. Clair Obscur: Expedition 33<br> 9. RV There Yet?<br> 8. Escape From Duckov<br> 7. Hollow Knight: Silksong<br> 6. Arc Raiders<br> 5. Monster Hunter Wilds<br> 4. Schedule I<br> 3. Battlefield 6<br> 2. Peak<br> 1. R.E.P.O.</p></blockquote> <p>What stands out? Well, as Carless notes, the “<a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/friendslop-peak-repo-fortnite-trend">friendslop</a>” like <em>Peak</em> and <em>R.E.P.O.</em> were huge, suggesting that many players do indeed just want to play games in which the co-op mechanics encourage goofing around with others. Multiplayer games in general were dominant, taking the six top slots. Fantasy RPGs were also super popular, with <em>Oblivion</em>, <em>Deliverance 2</em>, and <em>Clair Obscur</em> all having strong showings. I also think it’s worth calling out <em>Borderlands 4</em> and <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> specifically. Both struggled with PC optimization and word-of-mouth probably did them no favors, but they landed spots here regardless. Even so, it’s surprising to see <em>Borderlands 4</em> <em>below</em> an episodic narrative game like <em>Dispatch</em>.</p>

 <p>This list is arranged by total sales though, and <em>Borderlands 4</em> launched at $70. When you look at the list of top 20 games by revenue instead, <em>Borderlands 4</em> breaks into the top 10 and<em> Dispatch</em> (which is only $30) falls to number 19. That list is still very much skewed back toward 2025’s conventional blockbusters, with <em>Battlefield 6</em> at number 1. Clearly a big part of which games break out big time on Steam comes down to a lower barrier to entry. <em>Schedule I</em> is only $20, <em>R.E.P.O</em> is only $10, and <em>Peak</em> is just $8.</p> <p>Are games that engineer viral moments and encourage you to bully your friends into buying them the key to unlocking success on Steam, or has “friendslop” run its course? At the very least, these games are cheaper and quicker to make than MMOs, MOBAs, and RPGs, so we probably won’t have to put up with a bunch of knock-offs that missed the boat launching in 2028.</p>

            <p>AdHoc's superhero workplace comedy Dispatch has appeared rather unexpectedly on the Australian Nintendo eShop for Switch and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a>.</p>
<p>According to the listings, Dispatch will be available on Switch consoles from 29th January, but can be pre-ordered now for $39.55 AUS.</p>

<p>I have just checked the eShop here in the UK, and at the time of writing Dispatch is not appearing in any of the search results. Rather, the main result was for SnowRunner - Season 5: Build &amp; Dispatch. The second result was for a game that places you in the role of an airport dispatcher (see image below).</p>
<p>It's a different story over on the Australian site, though, which currently states the Switch 2 edition of AdHoc's acclaimed Dispatch will include "enhanced resolution and improved frame rates" on its release.</p>

<p>Here are the Dispatch links for <a href="https://ec.nintendo.com/AU/en/titles/70010000105332">original Switch</a> and <a href="https://ec.nintendo.com/AU/en/titles/70010000110139">Switch 2</a> on the Australian eShop. Eurogamer has asked AdHoc for comment on an impending Switch announcement.</p>

<p>Many of us here at Eurogamer are big fans of Dispatch, and we are far from alone. Earlier this year, AdHoc announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-episodic-gaming-back-on-the-map-ex-wolf-among-us-devs-superhero-workplace-comedy-dispatch-sells-big-to-become-a-well-deserved-smash">Dispatch had sold over 1m copies in just 10 days</a>. Thanks to this success, the studio is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dispatch-dev-adhoc-set-on-season-2-but-has-difficult-second-album-problem">now considering a second season</a> (perhaps one with more sex scenes, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dispatch-writer-regrets-cutting-sex-scenes">given the "ravenous" response to the first season</a>).</p>
<p>For more, our Bertie recently sat down with AdHoc studio co-founders Nick Herman and Pierre Shorette to discuss the team's episodic superhero comedy, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/making-of-dispatch-how-adhoc-rode-rejection-to-huge-success">which includes the story of a cut Dispatch Kpop character</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Beloved Superhero Comedy Dispatch Is Seemingly Flying Onto Switch 2 Next Year]]></title>
            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/beloved-superhero-comedy-dispatch-is-seemingly-flying-onto-switch-2-next-year</link>
            <guid>1385890</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>

<p>Well, here's a nice piece of news! Fresh off a couple of nominations at The Game Awards, it looks like AdHoc Studio's superhero workplace comedy <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dispatch-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Dispatch</a> will be flying onto Switch and Switch 2 early next year.</p>
<p>A surprise listing has popped up on the <a href="https://ec.nintendo.com/AU/en/titles/70010000105332">Australian eShop</a> (thanks to <a href="https://www.vooks.net/dispatch-is-coming-to-switch-and-switch-2-early-2026/">Vooks</a> for the heads up), displaying the game and a free Switch 2 upgrade with a planned <strong>29th January</strong> release date.</p>
<p>And hey, this is good news! For those who missed out this year, Dispatch is a new comedy from the writers of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tales_from_the_borderlands">Tales from the Borderlands</a> and <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-360/wolf_among_us">The Wolf Among Us</a>. It sees you step into the shoes of Robert Robertson (superhero alias, Mecha Man), who's forced to take a job in a superhero dispatch centre after his mech suit is destroyed in battle.</p>
<p>Strategically sending out supes is one thing, but a large part of the game is built around your decisions <em>outside</em> the action, with each choice having the potential to send the story in vastly different directions.</p>
<p>All of this is supported by a <em>stacked</em> voice cast, featuring the likes of <strong>Breaking Bad</strong>'s Aaron Paul, <strong>The Batman</strong>'s Jeffrey Wright, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a>'s Alanah Pearce, <strong>Critical Role</strong>'s Matt Mercer, Laura Bailey and Travis Willingham and many, <em>many</em> more.</p>
<p>Here's a rundown of the game's key features and a handful of screenshots from the eShop listing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&gt; Shape the Story<br>
In Dispatch, every decision you make influences the unfolding narrative. From banter in the breakroom to life-or-death situations in the field, your choices affect your relationships with the heroes, their allegiances, and the path your own story takes.</p>
<p>&gt; Deploy Your Heroes<br>
Use the strategy map to review ongoing emergencies and deploy the right (or wrong) heroes to deal with them. Balance the risks and rewards as you make tactical decisions, knowing that each choice can have lasting consequences for your team and the city.</p>
<p>&gt; Manage Your Roster<br>
Managing heroes sometimes goes beyond their powers. Each hero comes with quirks, flaws, and baggage you’ll need to navigate to keep the team together. Upgrade their skills and unlock abilities to boost their effectiveness in the field.</p>
<p>Blending narrative, strategy, and humor, Dispatch explores what it means to be a hero, whether you're wearing a cape or behind a desk.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Launching episodically earlier this year, Dispatch has gone on to rack up over 83,000 '<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2592160/Dispatch/#app_reviews_hash">Overwhelmingly Positive</a>' reviews on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2592160/Dispatch/">Steam</a>. Our good friends over at <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/dispatch">Push Square</a> had this to say about the game's PS5 release: "While it's very light on meaningful gameplay, it tells a brilliantly paced, consistently entertaining superhero story that touches on some refreshingly adult themes".</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Creepy Jar has released a brand new trailer for its base building survival game StarRupture, giving a positive look at what is a not so great situation. The representative of Claywood Corporation gives a cheery view to the prisoners and exiles of Arcadia 7 on the luxuries they can expect, including accommodation, access to new technology, and nice views. The only disadvantage is the work and the hostile animal life that wants to feed on your base’s resources.</p>
<p><iframe title="StarRupture - &quot;Special Message&quot; Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e0GBfgSq_5Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In StarRupture, players take on the role of an exile from Earth who has been tasked with mining and expanding a base as part of their sentence. The game will be able feature co-op for up to four players, but if you want to explore this frontier alone you can. Weather cycles of the planet and regular attacks by Arcadia-7’s creatures will impede player progress, so learning the patterns and consequences of the dangers will be critical to making it through the days.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Creepy Jar released <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/01/starrupture-gets-10-minutes-of-showcase-footage-showing-gameplay/">10 minutes of showcase footage showing gameplay for StarRupture</a>, which focused on the world of Arcadia 7 and its dangers. Creepy Jar previously released Green Hell, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/03/11/green-hell-review-spirits-of-amazonia/">in our review</a> Steve said,&nbsp;<em>“Green Hell is a fantastic survival experience with an exemplary sense of place and peril. Creepy Jar have really nailed the feeling of loneliness and despair that true isolation would lead to and married this to some well balanced challenges and a refreshingly user friendly approach. The range of ways to play are really welcome and should ensure that even those players who may be turned off by the rigours of hunger and thirst mechanics can enjoy the immersive jungle experience. This may not be a welcoming jungle, but there’s plenty of fun and games to be had.”</em></p>

<p>StarRupture will launch into Steam Early Access on January 6th.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Game of the Year 2025 – Best Visual Design]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/17/game-of-the-year-2025-best-visual-design/</link>
            <guid>1385884</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Welcome back to our Game of the Year picks for 2025 as we look to hand out our gong for Best Visual Design. Every year, this ends up being a heavily contested category, always swinging between games that impress in terms of sheer fidelity, pushing gaming hardware to the very limit, and titles with peerless art direction that seek to do more with less. More often than not, the winner strikes a deft balance between the two, as proved by this year’s winner…</p>

<p>We’ve always had somewhat of a soft spot for all things <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2012/03/01/review-journey-ps3/">Journey</a>. We’re also big fans of anything developer Giant Squid puts their name to, the studio’s previous games – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2016/08/09/abzu-review/">Abzû</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/11/10/the-pathless-review-ps4-ps5-xbox-mobile/">The Pathless</a> – have a distinct Journey-like quality to them. So, naturally, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/12/sword-of-the-sea-review/">Sword of the Sea</a> almost feels tailor-made for us here at TSA, coming full circle with Journey’s art director, Matt Nava, joining forces with Giant Squid for a visually stunning jaunt through carefully crafted vistas.</p>


<p>These games shred dialogue and exposition, presenting their stories through striking set pieces and multi-layered worlds that flit between calmly isolating and full of life. As you play Sword of the Sea, you’ll venture through familiar deserts as well as ruins, and snowy mountains, the hero’s trusty blade capable of transforming these areas into thriving aquariums teeming with enchanting sea life. It’s yet another gorgeous game from Giant Squid and a worthy winner of this year’s award for Best Visual Design.</p>
<h3>Lumines Arise –&nbsp;Runner Up</h3>
<p>When it comes to the rhythm action genre visuals can be just as important as audio, as proven by <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/11/lumines-arise-review-tick-follows-block-in-mizuguchis-latest-masterpiece/">Lumines Arise</a>. It may not be quite as entrancing and new-feeling as developer Enhance’s previous game, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/11/16/tetris-effect-connected-review-xbox-series-x/">Tetris Effect</a>, but it comes pretty close, pairing catchy tracks with immersive stage backgrounds and visual effects timed perfectly to match the player’s button presses. Together, these elements offer that near hypnotic sensory experience that elevates the Lumines formula and adds prestige to what started off as a gem for the PlayStation Portable.</p>

<h3>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 –&nbsp;Runner Up</h3>
<p>Grabbing its second podium finish in this year’s Game of the Year awards, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/05/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review/">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> really is the full package. Aside from its gripping, emotional narrative and smart evolution of the turn-based RPG formula, it also boasts some of this year’s most jaw-dropping visual set pieces.</p>
<p>Making smart use of ready-made assets for environments and scenery, to let the team put their efforts toward the more impactful “hero assets”, Sandfall conjured up a&nbsp;distinct dream-like surrealness that gives Expedition 33 its own identity, galvanised by Art Nouveau and Belle Époque influences. It breaks free of fantasy and steampunk tropes, imbuing every aspect – from character designs to battle menus – with a masterfully curated touch.</p>
<p><strong>Honourable Mentions</strong> (in alphabetical order)</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/25/ghost-of-yotei-review/">Ghost of Yotei</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/17/keeper-review/">Keeper</a></li>
<li>Once Upon A Katamari</li>

		<p>The original creators behind Speedrunners, Casper &amp; Gert-Jan, have announced Sprint City which is being developed by Second Stage Games. Sprint City looks very much like a successor to Speedrunners, though there is also a Speedrunners 2 in development by Fair Play Labs. It seems 2026 will be the year of sprinting for games.</p>

<p>Co-Owner &amp; Game Designer at Second Stage Studio, Casper van Est, said <em>“With Sprint City, we wanted to focus on what we love most in games and what we’re best at, which is pure movement. It’s a shared world multiplayer experience built around how good it can feel just to move around, so we worked really hard on a satisfying game feel and a visual style that never gets in the way of that.”</em></p>
<p>In Sprint City, up to eight players can race against each other or free roam across different courses in the city, using wall runs and grapples to keep momentum going. Additionally, anyone who owns Sprint City will be able to invite friends in to play the game, even if they themselves do not own it. In multiplayer there will be leaderboards to climb as you aim to become the best sprinter in Sprint City.</p>

<p>Currently, there is no confirmed release date for Sprint City, but it is due to enter Steam Early Access in 2026.</p>
