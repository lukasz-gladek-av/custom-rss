            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nacon-wrc-games-2027-2032</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nacon-to-take-over-wrc-video-game-duties-from-ea-and-codemasters.1199352/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nacon-wrc-games-2027-2032<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nacon has announced that it will take over WRC video game duties from EA and Codemasters, having signed an agreement with WRC Promoter to create new FIA World Rally Championship games for the next few years.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/05/26/3088220/0/en/PRESS-RELEASE-NACON-ANNOUNCES-AGREEMENT-WITH-WRC-PROMOTER-FOR-THE-PUBLISHING-OF-THE-OFFICIAL-GAMES-OF-THE-FIA-WORLD-RALLY-CHAMPIONSHIP-FROM-2027-TO-2032.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">press release</a>, Nacon says that it will publish official FIA WRC games between 2027 and 2032, and that it has "exclusive rights" to do so on PC and consoles "for six seasons".</p>

<p>Lest you think Nacon is just going to continue EA and Codemasters' work on the&nbsp;<em>WRC&nbsp;</em>series, however, think again. The French publisher says it will be creating "a complete reboot of the franchise, based on an entirely fresh vision".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nacon-wrc-games-ea-sports-wrc.jpg?itok=Pe60rPB3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nacon-wrc-games-ea-sports-wrc.jpg?itok=KusZXlK4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Nacon is taking over WRC gaming duties from EA and Codemasters.</figcaption></figure><p>In the aforementioned press release, Nacon promises to "deliver an immersive experience that faithfully reflects the quality of the championship and meets the expectations of both rally enthusiasts and new players".</p>

<p>The publisher says that all of the official teams, rallies, vehicles, and drivers from the FIA WRC will be featured in its games, as will sponsor brands. In short, it sounds like this will be every bit as faithful to the event as EA's series was.</p>

<p>This is, of course, not Nacon's first rodeo (or perhaps that should be rally) when it comes to WRC games. Between 2015 and 2020, the&nbsp;<em>WRC&nbsp;</em>franchise was under Nacon's stewardship, with racing stalwart Codemasters subsequently snapping it up.</p>

<p>Following that, Codemasters found itself subject to something of a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/take-two-interactive-targeting-purchase-of-codemasters" rel="nofollow">bidding war</a> between <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-to-purchase-codemasters-instead-of-take-two" rel="nofollow">Take-Two and EA</a>, with the latter eventually purchasing the studio. The partnership produced only one rally racer, that being <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-sports-wrc-announced-promising-most-authentic-awe-inspiring-off-road-experience" rel="nofollow">2023's&nbsp;<em>EA Sports WRC</em></a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nacon-wrc-games-wrc-9.jpg?itok=WDTB-IcO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nacon-wrc-games-wrc-9.jpg?itok=JlAz1VzX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This won't be Nacon's first foray into the rally racing genre.</figcaption></figure><p>Earlier this month, EA <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-rally-games-pausing-codemasters" rel="nofollow">announced it would be "pausing" development</a> on future rally racing games, and the X account of developer Codemasters was also scrubbed, leading to fears that the developer had been shut down.</p>

<p>It was subsequently <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/codemasters-confirms-layoffs-as-ea-owned-studio-shifts-focus-away-from-beloved-rally-games/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">confirmed</a> that Codemasters had been hit by layoffs, and that some of its staff had been moved away from the studio to work on other in-development EA titles.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see what Nacon's plans for its WRC games are; we don't yet know who's developing the new rally racers, but it sounds like we'll have to wait until at least 2027 to get our hands on the first post-EA Nacon WRC game.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/27/rig-900-max-hs-gaming-headset-review/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/rig-900-max-hs-gaming-headset-review.1199343/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/27/rig-900-max-hs-gaming-headset-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Few products have the same clarity of design as the RIG line of headsets. Originally created by audio specialists Plantronics, and then bought and nurtured by French giant Nacon, RIG headsets have evolved, progressed and developed, but their design language has never faltered from the robust industrial looks of the first headset. RIG headsets look, unequivocally, like RIG headsets, and there’s nothing else quite like them. As for the RIG 900 Max HS? Well, it looks like a RIG headset, and frankly, it performs exactly like one too.</p>
<p>The RIG 900 HS is black. There’s a black steel headband, a black fabric tension band, black plastic earpieces and black dual fabric ear cushions. There are silver RIG logos, and the most minimal of silver detailing, but this is a plain, classic, gaming headset design. If you’ve never vibed with the industrial, girders and bolts looks of a RIG headset before, there is nothing here that will convince you otherwise because it looks more or less identical to the vast majority of their output.</p>



<p>It’s what’s on the inside that counts, though. The 900 Max HS is, for now, the pinnacle of RIG’s lineup, with an RRP of £210/€250, and a specification that should make most prospective headset buyers sit up and take notice. There’s the dual wireless connections, with both Bluetooth and a USB dongle, allowing users able to connect to both at the same time. There’s the 50 to 60-hour battery life, and an included charging stand, which makes sure it’s nearly impossible to run out of power.</p>
<p>The killer feature has to be comfort. Nacon have nailed this down over the last few years, and the RIG 900 Max HS is amongst the lightest and most comfortable headsets you’ll find. Despite packing in all the necessary tech and honestly being pretty massive on your head, they only weigh 293g, and that’s dispersed perfectly across your head and ears thanks to the floating headband design. I would say that, despite their Bluetooth connectivity, this isn’t a headset I’d be wearing outside of the house, but it is one you can wear all day long, through the longest gaming sessions, and come out the other side feeling like you’ve not had anything on your head at all.</p>

<p>In that quest for ultra-lightweight, there are some elements that feel less premium, particularly in the amount of plastics used, and the controls and microphone boom arm missing the heft or solidity that you might find in other similarly priced headsets. Personally, I don’t mind that when it results in such a lightweight headset, but I can see some buyers feeling as though they’ve bought something economical rather than exceptional.</p>

<p>The audio certainly isn’t cheap though. Delivered by 40mm drivers, the key with the Nacon 900 Max HS’s delivery is tautness. It’s tight, precise and perfectly tuned, with plenty of top-note detail balanced against a bottom end that’s rounded and firm, avoiding becoming overwhelming. It’s almost restrained compared to some of its peers, particularly Turtle Beach’s offerings, but that ensures you can hear every element of a game, movie or song without losing anything. Just as with the weight, this is a headset you can listen to all day, without fatigue.</p>
<p>You can tune it to match your tastes, with the ability to use custom EQ settings via the RIG 900 Max Series iOS and Android app. From here, you can update your headset, alter the microphone performance, and really dig into the details with Expert Mode, shifting your options from a 3-point EQ to 10-point one, and giving you more granular control elsewhere. Since I listen to an unholy amount of rock and metal, I tend to use the classic scoop EQ layout, and the 900 Max HS gave the new Sleep Token album’s dark synth-led tones plenty of heft, without losing any detail from the soaring vocals.</p>
<p>The RIG 900 Max HS boasts a fold-away boom mic, and though the end is made from flexible rubber, it doesn’t particularly mould or move in any way beyond up and down. That might be a hindrance for some – particularly if you like to be able to shift your mic and whisper into it when everyone else in your house has gone to sleep, but you can tune the gain up if you’re trying to be quiet, or down when the whooping and hollering begins. I’ve been whopping and hollering quite a lot while playing Roadcraft, and my co-op partners didn’t seem to mind too mcuh, so I’d say it’s doing a good job.</p>

<p>Most impressively, this is a true multiplatform headset. While it’s PS5 branded, it works with Playstation, Xbox, PC, Mobile and Nintendo Switch without any fuss. The dock does exactly as it needs to as well. The connection is straightforward and robust, letting you plonk your headset down on the dock without having to wiggle or manoeuvre it into place like you might with others like the Astro A50. There’s also a USB-A port built in for the wireless dongle, keeping everything together in one place and helping ensure the dongle can provide a good signal by being out in the open.</p>
<p>We’re at a point now where £210 is almost becoming the mid-tier for gaming headsets, and the RIG 900 Max HS brings a lot to the table for that price. There is literally nothing on the market that’s as comfortable as this, but if you’re looking for bombastic audio there’s the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/07/26/turtle-beach-stealth-pro-gaming-headset-review/">Turtle Beach Stealth Pro</a>, or if you want something that feels truly premium there’s the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/10/corsair-virtuoso-max-gaming-headset-review/">Corsair Virtuoso Max</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-developers-detail-may-28-ver-1011-update<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds"><u>Monster Hunter Wilds</u></a> director Yuya Tokuda has revealed what's coming up in the May 28 Ver. 1.011 update, including "an abundance of new features and changes to the game including a collaboration with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/street-fighter-6"><u>Street Fighter 6</u></a>."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In his latest Director's Letter, Tokuda said the team wanted "to provide more great content for you to enjoy as well as make various adjustments to make Monster Hunter Wilds even more fun to play," including new challenger, Street Fighter's Akuma. You'll get a full Arkuma armor set as well as layered armor, and whenever you have either set equipped, three items will be added to your item bar — assisted combo Akuma, Drive Impact, and Gou Hadoken (you can find out more about them on the official Monster Hunter <a href="https://www.monsterhunter.com/wilds/en-uk/topics/director-letter-2505/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>website</u></a>).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We're also getting eight-star "challenging" monsters in Ver. 1.011 — Gore Magala, Rey Dau, Uth Duna, Nu Udra, and Jin Dahaad will become available to hunt at HR 41 and higher; this will give players options for hunting eight-star tempered monsters other than Arkveld — although they will still be available to hunt at seven-star difficulty. The eight-star versions, however, will be more resilient, with increased health, wound resistance, and "tweaks to multiplayer scaling." Tokuda warns that Tempered Gore Magala is a "particularly tough challenge to even the best of hunters." You can expect higher-difficulty quests and quests with multiple monsters to pop up more often, too, as your HR increases.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">A slew of "player-centric balance adjustments" are also on the way in both Ver. 1.011 and Title Update 2. The Hammer, Hunting Horn, Gunlance, Light Bowgun, and Heavy Bowgun all had various adjustments made, and "certain aspects" for Gunlance Artian weapons have been increased.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"While some weapons have had certain parameters adjusted downward, other parameters have been adjusted upwards, and viewed in totality I think you will find that all weapon types have had their possibilities expanded, so I encourage you to give them a try for yourself once the update is out," Tokuda said, adding that the Hammer and Dual Blades are additionally receiving "various improvements."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As part of other QoL tweaks, Hunters will be able to rest in the Grand Hub and Suja, Peaks of Accord. Resting restores all destroyed Pop-up Camps, a confirmation window will no longer appear after obtaining an item when your item pouch is full (the obtained item will automatically be sent to your item box), and the visibility of the remaining time of meal effects is improved — the countdown will display 10 minutes before expiration. In fact, all notifications have been adjusted, with their frequency in locales lowered so only higher-priority targets will be displayed in the environment overview. They will also no longer block the input for opening the map.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"As mentioned in the previous director's letter, you will be able to view individual endemic life you captured," Tokuda added. "In the Windward Plains, select Check Endemic Life in Ecological Research to view your creatures and their names, as well as the size and weight of fish you caught. You can also favorite creatures so that they'll be kept even if you go over the maximum storage capacity! Individual creatures can have different patterns or other unique elements, so if you find one you particularly like, be sure to use this feature to keep it around!"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can also expect stability improvements — particularly on Steam — and with the addition of eight-star monsters, the rewards for eight-star investigations and field surveys have also been increased. Guild Point rewards for fishing have also been "rebalanced," although how has yet to be explained. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Monster Hunter Wilds is the latest mainline installment in Capcom's longrunning Monster Hunter series, boasting dynamic, ever-changing environments, and a story of monsters and humans in a world with two faces: one in which the lands are harsh and unforgiving, where monsters fight for scant resources and another in which the lands are vibrant and brimming with life. We gave <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-review"><u>Monster Hunters Wilds an 8 in our review</u></a>, writing: "Monster Hunter Wilds continues to smooth off the rougher corners of the series in smart ways, making for some extremely fun fights but also lacking any real challenge."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Did you see that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-player-uses-an-unconventional-method-to-dodge-an-attack-their-emotes"><u>Monster Hunter Wilds players have discovered an unconventional method of dodge attacks by using their emotes?</u></a></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.

			<p>Future Nintendo Switch 2 games may be able to use more of the system's resources, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>Famiiboards forums member&nbsp;<a href="https://famiboards.com/threads/future-nintendo-hardware-technology-speculation-discussion-st-closes-june-5th-12am-jst-please-read-newest-staff-post.55/post-1813878" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MattAgain</a>, a known developer who has worked in the game industry and has provided some <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-cpu-not-cause-of-concern-ports/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interesting insights in the past</a>, revealed that more console resources, such as CPU cores and RAM, are now available for developers compared to an earlier development environment. According to the user, the goal is to reduce the system resources reserved for the OS to 1 CPU core and 2 GB of RAM, which would allow developers to squeeze more out of the hardware in the future.</p>
<p>Though Nintendo, as usual, hasn't provided detailed information, we learned more about the Nintendo Switch 2 specifications <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-final-system-specifications-cpu-gpu-dlss/">earlier this month</a> thanks to the system SDK. As confirmed by Digital Foundry, the system currently reserves 3 GB of RAM and 2 CPU cores for the OS, which will likely contribute to getting GameChat running without issues, although it's clear how the new feature could be rather demanding, as the system's SDK allows developers to test their games as if the feature is running without having an active session.</p>
<p>Even without all the system resources available for games, some Nintendo Switch 2 games are already showing that the system can run demanding games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-new-comparison-videos-highlight-how-the-game-and-technology-have-come-a-long-way-since-1-0-version/">Cyberpunk 2077</a> well. The open-world RPG developed by CD Projekt Red, which will launch together with the system early next month, has already proven with pre-release footage how Nintendo's next-generation console can deliver a better experience than previous-generation systems and some of the most popular handheld systems like the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 launches on June 5th worldwide, with some exceptions.</p>

			<p>The Monster Hunter Wilds development team is continuing to identify stability issues and make improvements to the game where possible, including some PC-specific improvements.</p>
<p>In a new message shared on the game's official website, director Yuya Tokuda provided an update on the ongoing game stability improvements the team is researching and implementing, confirming that enhanced texture streaming is planned for future game updates. Texture streaming is among the <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-gpu-streaming-issues-barely-60-fps-rtx-5080/">probable causes</a> of the game's unstable performance on PC, so the team looking to improve the problem is definitely good news.</p>
<p>In the new message, the Monster Hunter Wilds director also revealed additional details on the Street Fighter 6 special collaboration, which will effectively add Akuma as a playable character via a full armor set and layered armor, tempered (8★) Gore Magala, Rey Dau, Uth Duna, Nu Udra, and Jin Dahaad, balance adjustments, quality of life improvements, a layered weapons system and more coming with tomorrow's 1.011 update and other changes coming with Title Update 2, such as improved Seikret usability and more. You can find all the details <a href="https://www.monsterhunter.com/wilds/en-uk/topics/director-letter-2505/">here.</a></p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S worldwide. You can learn more about one of the finest entries in the series by checking out my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/">review</a>.</p>

            <p>Last week's Warhammer Skulls brought announcements for a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-leagues-of-votann-are-coming-to-warhammer-40000-mechanicus-2">new Mechanicus 2 ally faction</a>, a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> remaster in the form of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/relic-reveal-warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-definitive-edition-with-full-dlc-and-mod-support">first Dawn Of War and all expansions</a>, and a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warhammer-40000-boltgun-2-is-coming-2026-but-theres-a-typing-of-the-dead-esque-spinoff-you-can-play-for-free-right-now">free Boltgun typing game</a> in which you tap out phrases like 'emperor' and 'thin your paints' to chainsword cultists. Nestled away in the recesses of that skull, like a coiled snake on a tattoo with the name of someone's pug on it, was a teaser for the next <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-warhammer-iii">Total War: Warhammer 3</a> DLC. Here's that teaser.</p>

<p>The hooded zap lad is Sayl the Faithless, a Norscan sorcerer famous for interrupting rituals and turning the attendant spellcasters into chaos spawn. It was fairly slight and esoteric as far as trailers go, but Creative Assembly followed it up with one of those <a href="https://youtu.be/-wN0zM9gp-s">casual sofa talks</a> full of highly curated information and soundbites about how unbeatable their benefits package and workplace satisfaction is.</p>
<p>There was some good stuff in there, in terms of detail. We already knew about Slaanesh's appearance in the DLC, and now it's double-confirmed Norsca will be joining. Sayl's campaign is focused on manipulation, there'll be more monster hunts for Throgg and Seafang raiding from Wulfric, and both are getting new voicelines.</p>
<p>Not mentioned was the DLC's third faction but, as chronicled in a swathe of Reddit posts and <a href="https://youtu.be/BkfUHF2n9jQ">content creator videos</a>, the community seems more or less certain on what that faction is: the high elves, specifically elf naval commander <a href="https://warhammerfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Aislinn">Aislinn</a>. He likes tides, 'tides' is in the name, the missing High Elf units from the game include naval-themed centerpieces like the Merwyrm and the Skycutter, there's thematic connections there with Slaanesh, people like elves, and so on. Norsca like to raid on boats, Slaanesh likes to lick boats (canon), elves like to ride boats. It all lines up. I also get the impression Creative Assembly like including at least one good guy or neutral faction in these packs too, just for balance. Things get a bit monochrome and grim if it's all chaos, all the time.</p>
<p>There was another notable in that video, too: all the developers interviewed were from CA Sofia, the sister studio previously responsible for games like Pharaoh and Troy, who seem largely to have been moved on to Twarhammer DLC duty since the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sega-sells-company-of-heroes-developer-relic-and-lays-off-more-staff-at-creative-assembly-and-hardlight">big shake ups at CA last year</a> following the cancellation of Hyenas. This could mean that there's multiple expansions in the works, requiring the attention of director Rich Aldridge and the UK team. Or, it could mean that Alridge and his team are already busy on other, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/future-creative-assembly-games-may-require-blood-thematically-which-sure-sounds-like-a-total-war-warhammer-40000-teaser">more power-armoured Games Workshop adaptations</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Dragon Quest 1 + 2 HD-2D Remake follows the release last year of Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake, which went on to be a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-exceeded-square-enix-expectations-but-game-sales-drop-overall">huge sales success for Square Enix</a> - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-already-best-selling-game-in-japan-for-2024-after-just-one-week">particularly in Japan</a>.</p>
<p>The company began with the third game in the series as it's chronologically the first, with a post-credits scene confirming the release of the first two games.</p>
<p>The Dragon Quest HD-2D Erdrick Trilogy Collection will be digital-only and include all three games in one collection. It will launch across all platforms on the same day, 30th October.</p>
<p>"Some excellent enhancements make this the ultimate version of Dragon Quest 3, but it could still do more to make it wholly welcoming to newcomers," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-review">Eurogamer review of Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake</a>.</p>
<p>As for new Dragon Quest games, series creator <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/yes-dragon-quest-12-is-still-in-development-says-series-creator">Yuji Horii confirmed in February that Dragon Quest 12 is still in development</a>.

		<p>Square Enix has announced that Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake will launch on 30th October, coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Switch and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a>, and PC.</p>
<p>Unlike the release of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake">Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</a> last year, this is a combined release that will feature both Dragon Quest I and Dragon Quest II. This one release will round out the Erdrick Trilogy, with DQ3 having been a prequel story to the original game – this is why Square Enix chose to remake and release DQ3 first.</p>
<p><iframe title="DRAGON QUEST&nbsp;I&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;II HD-2D&nbsp;Remake  | Teaser&nbsp;Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CDtWQZNL5MA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Dragon Quest I and II both cast the player as a descendant of the legendary hero Erdrick (themselves a heroic descendant), facing off against evil forces that plague the land, be they Dragonlord, evil wizards or whatever else.</p>
<p>While the structure of the turn-based JRPG will remain, these two games are being remade in the HD-2D art style. The battle system is also being refined with quality of life updates throughout and some story additions – details about this new content will come at a later date.</p>

<p>Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake will launch both digitally and physically, but there’s a few options here. As well as the standard editions, a digital-only Erdrick Trilogy release will bundle together Dragon Quest I &amp; II with Dragon Quest III. Owning the full Erdrick Trilogy (whether bought together or separately) can unlock a Dog Sui for DQ1 and a Cat Suit for DQ2.</p>
<p>There is also a collector’s edition physical release that will include:</p>

<p>We also <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/13/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-review/">reviewed Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</a> last year, calling it “a lovingly-crafted celebration of gaming’s most iconic franchises. Rather than reinvent that wheel and change the game for modern audiences, Square Enix has highlighted and elevated the elements that made this such an iconic game all those decades ago, while slipping in a treasure trove of quality-of-life features that make it an even smoother experience to either dive into for the first time ever or return to yet again.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/lies-of-p-rumored-for-nintendo-switch-2-launch/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>According to <a href="https://x.com/NWeedle/status/1926682916760793582?ref_src" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spanish insider Nash Weedle</a>, Neowiz's highly successful Soulslike game <a href="https://wccftech.com/lies-of-p-sold-over-1-million-units-in-less-than-a-month-despite-being-on-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lies of P</a> is headed to the Nintendo Switch 2. Here's what they wrote on X:</p>
<p><em>I can confirm that a port of Lies of P for SWITCH 2 is in the works. Its announcement could be made in June, but it depends on “some factors” of the port's development, as they want to show it with a release date. Following the latest information about the Lies of P DLC, I started to pull the thread and was able to confirm with a contact that the port is in development for Switch 2. According to Digital Foundry, Double A-studios had not received the development kit, but this is not true.</em></p>
<p>Honestly, it would not be surprising at all if Neowiz were indeed porting the game. Third-party developers and publishers are <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-cyberpunk-2077-hades-2-and-more-confirmed-for-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flocking to the new Nintendo console</a>, and it's not like it's very heavy in terms of performance requirements, anyway - on PC, it can <a href="https://wccftech.com/lies-of-p-pc-requirements-rx6700-rtx2060/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">run</a> on far weaker hardware than what's in the Switch 2:</p>
<p><em>Processor: AMD Ryzen 3 1200／Intel Core i5-7500</em></p>
<p><em>Memory: 8 GB RAM</em></p>
<p><em>Graphics: AMD Radeon RX 560 4GB / NVIDIA GeForce GTX 960 4GB</em></p>
<p>Now the question is rather whether the port will launch alongside the Lies of P DLC, Overture, which still has no release date but should be available relatively soon. Our Kai Tatsumoto recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/lies-of-p-overture-hands-on-preview-krats-winter-wonderland/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previewed</a> Overture at a press event:</p>
<p><em>Three hours were not enough to do more than scratch the surface of Lies of P: Overture, and I’m already considering how my NG+3 playthrough will go in preparation for tackling the DLC. There’s initially a bigger focus early on with using large two-handed weapons in Overture, so I’m looking forward to picking up that gunblade once more and exploding my way to glory. There isn’t a firm release date beyond Summer 2025, but alongside the Overture DLC, there will also be a sizable patch with quality of life fixes for all players, including two new difficulty levels geared towards a more story-focused experience for those that might want to explore Krat but not have to fully engage with parrying and the other more difficult nuances to Lies of P’s combat. Lastly, Lies of P Overture will launch as a $29.99 premium DLC for the base game.</em></p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>The dirt-speckled WRC <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-racing-games">racing games</a> that were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ea-arent-making-any-more-rally-games-but-there-are-alternatives">dumped by Electronic Arts</a> a few weeks ago have already found a new partner in Nacon. The French publishers are promising a "complete reboot" of the rally game series, and have exclusive rights on the grubby wheelspinners until at least 2032. This isn't the first time the publisher have had stewardship of the WRC either, so it all kinda makes sense.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Nacon is pleased to announce the signing of a new agreement with WRC Promoter for the publishing of games based on the FIA World Rally Championship," they said in <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/05/26/3088220/0/en/PRESS-RELEASE-NACON-ANNOUNCES-AGREEMENT-WITH-WRC-PROMOTER-FOR-THE-PUBLISHING-OF-THE-OFFICIAL-GAMES-OF-THE-FIA-WORLD-RALLY-CHAMPIONSHIP-FROM-2027-TO-2032.html">a press release</a>. "The agreement covers the development and publishing of the official WRC games and eSports competitions, granting Nacon exclusive rights for PC and consoles for six seasons, from 2027 through 2032.</p>
<p>"The games will feature the official rallies, vehicles, teams, drivers, and sponsors among the many anticipated content elements. This project represents a complete reboot of the franchise, based on an entirely fresh vision, and marks an ambitious new chapter in the brand’s development." </p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>They don't yet say which studio, in-house or otherwise, will actually develop the vroomy vrooms. But Nacon are the owners of Kylotonn, as <a "="" a-month-after-electronic-arts-mashed-the-brakes-wrc-rally-racing-games-are-coming-back-with-a-complete-reboot-under-a-new-publisher="" games="" href-"https:="" racing="" www.pcgamer.com="">PC Gamer point out</a>. Aka, the developers who previously made WRC games for a long time, including WRC 10 in 2021 and WRC Generations in 2022. So the most likely outcome is that the games will be handed back to them. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, the governing body of the rally championship, the FIA (Federation Internationale de l'Automobile), seem happy enough to bounce back to old partners.</p>
<p>"After a comprehensive evaluation, we are delighted to have reached an agreement with Nacon," said a marketing chief. "Their vision for the franchise stands out, and their expertise in delivering great rally games is unquestioned."</p>
<p>Well, it is a <em>little</em> questioned. Their most recent game, Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown was badly received, with players complaining about dead servers, crashes, grind, and a lack of an offline single player mode. It's sitting at a "mostly negative" average on Steam. Their last rally game, WRC Generations, has a "mixed" review average. Perhaps now is the time to check out all those other cool little indie rally games, like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/drive-rally-blends-wrc-seriousness-with-arcade-cheer">#Drive Rally</a> or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/parking-garage-rally-circuit">Parking Garage Rally Circuit</a> or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/550320/art_of_rally/">Art Of Rally</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake was a massive success for Square Enix, earning the praise of fans and critics alike. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In Wccftech's review</a>, the game was rated 8.6 out of 10 by Kai Tatsumoto:</p>
<p><em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake has been given a complete graphical overhaul, instead giving the iconic RPG a makeover in the same vein as Square-Enix’s Octopath Traveler and other similar titles. The entire world is brightly colored and blooming with light. Even if you’re intimately familiar with every step retracing Ortega’s journey, the complete reimagining of the adventure makes this feel like a brand new adventure rather than just another release of Seeds of Salvation. All I can say now is that I can’t wait to go through the other Remakes next year.</em></p>

            <p>The Last of Us season two finale, which aired early on Monday morning here in the UK, welcomed 3.7 million cross-platform viewers in the US.</p>
<p>This figure is significantly lower than the season's opening episode, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-debut-viewing-figures-beat-season-one-premiere">which premiered with 5.3 million same-day US cross-platform viewers</a>. To compare further, The Last of Us' first season finale set an audience record of 8.2 million viewers on its debut.</p>
<p>However in a <a href="https://press.wbd.com/us/media-release/hbo-0/last-us/influx-viewers-raises-global-audience-over-90-million-last-us">press release</a>, HBO said it expects to see the second season finale's audience "grow significantly" following the Memorial Day holiday weekend, which contributed to lower viewer numbers.</p>

<p>Additionally, the network states the second season of The Last of Us is now averaging close to 37 million global viewers per episode, with that number "growing".</p>
<p>To give more context, following its debut in 2023, HBO said the first season of The Last of Us was averaging nearly 32 million cross-platform viewers per episode in the States. At this time, the company added <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-averaging-32m-viewers-per-episode-in-us-most-watched-hbo-max-show-in-europe">The Last of Us was the most-watched show in the history of HBO Max in both Europe and Latin America</a>.</p>
<p>Viewer numbers have continued to rise since season one's release, and the show's global audience now sits at more than 90 million.</p>
<p>The second season of The Last of Us picks up five years after the events of the season one finale, with Ellie and Joel - played by Bella Ramsey and Pedro Pascal - now living in Jackson. New cast members this season include Kaitlyn Dever as Abby, Isabela Merced as Dina, Young Mazino as Jesse and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-who-catherine-ohara-will-play-in-the-last-of-us-marking-a-significant-change-from-the-games">Catherine O'Hara as a new character for the show, Gail</a>.</p>

At this time, showrunner Craig Mazin said: "We approached season two with the goal of creating something we could be proud of. The end results have exceeded even our most ambitious goals, thanks to our continued collaboration with HBO and the impeccable work of our unparalleled cast and crew."</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the showrunner confirmed The Last of Us TV team is working on a four season plan, stating <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-tv-showrunner-confirms-four-season-plan-says-no-way-to-wrap-things-up-in-three">there's "no way" the show's narrative can be wrapped up in only three seasons</a>.

		<p>Dragon Quest sits in a strange part of gamers’ collective experience. Either you’re Japanese and you’ve played it, or you’re not and you’ve played something inspired by it.</p>
<p>OK, sure, this is a gross oversimplification, but there is an element of truth to it. The 1986 RPG Dragon Quest is still huge in Japan. It’s so ubiquitous there that you can see it everywhere from T-shirts to convenience stores, with aisles decked out with the latest tie in. Dragon Warrior, as it was called in the US when it was released 3 years later, but it wasn’t until Dragon Quest VIII in 2004 that the series really had any traction outside Japan, but then pivoted away to DS ports and an MMORPG. Even so,&nbsp;almost any serious gamer will recognise the series mascot, the Slime.</p>
<p>Yet, without Dragon Quest we wouldn’t have had Final Fantasy — series creator Hironobu Sakaguchi said he drew inspiration from Dragon Quest. And how many games have been inspired in turn by Final Fantasy? Without Akira, we wouldn’t have The Matrix. Without Dragon Quest, the mind boggles as to what we would be missing out on.</p>
<p><iframe title="DRAGON QUEST I &amp; II HD-2D Remake – Teaser Trailer – Nintendo Switch" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CC1iBil7DR0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>So, with its lofty position in video game history in mind, how many of us have actually played the Erdrick Trilogy? Why does one even quest for dragons?</p>

<p>Fortunately, on October 30 this year, we’re all going to get the opportunity to put that right, with the Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake.</p>
<p>We got a hands on session earlier this month, playing around 20 minutes of each of the two games. And so far, we’re very impressed. In short, the first game follows the descendent of the legendary hero Erdrick, on a quest to defeat the Dragonlord. In Dragon Quest II, which jumps forward in time a little, follows future descendants of Erdrick on their quest to solve the problem of the day (spoilers etc).</p>
<p>The weird thing is that Dragon Quest 1 isn’t the first one in the series chronology. Dragon Quest 3 is actually the prequel, and an excellent one at that, following the adventures of Erdrick himself. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/13/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-review/">We gave Dragon Quest 3 a solid 9/10</a> when we reviewed it last November.</p>

<p>In many ways, the upcoming remakes of 1 and 2 follow in the footsteps of number 3. The skeleton of these games is much the same, but with some modern tweaks to make things a lot easier in 2025. The HD-2D art style harks back to the original pixellated visuals and are incredibly nostalgic for those of us who grew up with turn-based RPGs, but lends the game a modernity that looks fantastic when expanded to fill a modern TV screen.</p>
<p>But then there’s the gameplay updates like variable difficulty, tweaks to improve combat, and ability to set different combat speeds to help you get through the game quicker. It sounds like a minor thing, but once you realise you can blitz through combat, it’s hard to go back. On top of this, we’ve been promised never-before-seen story content, which is something that all fans should be excited by.</p>

<p>If you want to make a start on the story and prefer physical media, you can already pick up and play Dragon Quest 3 and games 1 and 2 on release. However, if you want to wait and don’t mind digital-only games, you can wait to pick up the Dragon Quest HD-2D Erdrick Trilogy Collection, which packages all three games into a single definitive set.</p>
<p><i>Dragon Quest 1 &amp; 2 HD-2D Remake is released October 30 2025 on Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch 2,&nbsp; PlayStation 5, Xbox X/S and PC.</i></p>

			<p>Polish developer PARASIGHT, maker of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/blacktail-intriguing-slavic-witchcraft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BLACKTAIL</a>, has announced a new and intriguing first-person shooter game titled DAVY x JONES.</p>
<p>As you might easily guess from the title, the protagonist is the infamous pirate of legend. In this game, though, he's been betrayed, robbed, and even beheaded. But that's not the end for him, who falls into The Locker, a surreal pirate hell, and allies with his own skull - a guide and a source of endless jokes - to get revenge on the one who wronged him, none other than Blackbeard.</p>
<p>Bartosz Kaproń, CEO and Creative Director of PARASIGHT, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>We're beyond excited to finally unleash DAVY x JONES upon the world. At PARASIGHT, we believe great stories should hit as hard as the action—and in DAVY x JONES, they literally do. We split our protagonist in two—his skull and his body—and threw them into the pirate underworld to fight their way back to legend. It’s our wildest journey yet, packed with surreal adventure, larger-than-life characters, and just enough surprise to keep things fun. If you've ever dreamed of swashbuckling through the afterlife with your own severed head cracking wise beside you—this is your game.</em></p>

<p>The Locker is split into nine islands drifting across an endless sea of clouds. In these unique environments, players will face twisted fiends, cursed souls, and legendary behemoths like the Kraken — guardians of the underworld’s darkest secrets.</p>
<p>However, another behemoth, the whale-ship hybrid Abby, befriends the protagonist and becomes his mobile base. Players can even recruit legendary officers to crew her and unleash her cannons in combat. Fights will mix swordfighting, gun action, and a grappling hook to get close.</p>
<p>Moreover, enemy drops provide an element of risk versus reward. Each defeated enemy drops Underworld Essence, and when Essences converge, they merge into a treasure chest containing powerful loot. However, each chest also unleashes an unpredictable fiend, so it's up to the player to decide whether to take that risk.</p>
<p>There's no release window yet, but DAVY x JONES will be launched for PC (there's already a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2611170/DAVY_x_JONES/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam page)</a> and consoles.</p>

            <p>It looks like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii">Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2</a> will be getting a physical release across PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, the <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/40602/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii/">ESRB</a> posted about a release for Ninja Theory's sequel across Xbox Series and Playstation 5. This time, though, Microsoft was not listed as the game's publisher, but Limited Run Games was instead.</p>

<p>Limited Run Games is known for publishing physical editions of games which may otherwise remain only available to purchase digitally. So, while an official announcement hasn't been made, this rating all but confirms the physical editions' existence.</p>
<p>In addition to the above releases for Hellblade 2 on PS5 and Xbox Series X, a new Switch listing for the original <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hellblade">Hellblade</a> game has also been added to <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/40601/hellblade-senuas-sacrifice/">ESRB</a>, again with Limited Run Games listed as publisher. This suggests Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice will also be getting a physical Switch version. The first Hellblade game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2019-hellblade-switch-tech-analysis">originally arrived on Nintendo's platform digitally back in 2019</a>. </p>

<p>Earlier this month, Ninja Theory announced Hellblade 2 was set for a PS5 release this summer, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/senuas-saga-hellblade-2-coming-to-ps5-in-enhanced-edition">in a package known as Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2 Enhanced Edition</a>. This release will include new features and haptic feedback, and also be optimised for the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a>. A free update will be coming to the PC and Xbox versions of the game.</p>
<p>Unlike its predecessor, Hellblade 2 did not initially release on PlayStation, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-buys-ninja-theory-playground-games-more">Ninja Theory was acquired by Xbox maker Microsoft in 2018</a>.</p>
<p>"We have such incredible fans of Ninja Theory on PlayStation going all the way back to the days of Heavenly Sword," studio head Dom Matthews said at the time of the game's PS5 announcement. "And we're so pleased that we can welcome PlayStation fans back to Senua's story."</p>

<p>We were rather taken with Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2 on its debut last year, with Johnny Chiodini calling it a "triumphant return to a challenging story" in their review. "Hellblade 2 continues Senua's story with grace, confidence, surprising brutality and thundering conviction," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/senuas-saga-hellblade-2-review">Eurogamer's five star Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2 review</a>.</p>
<p>The Hellblade sequel went on to become the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/senuas-saga-hellblade-2-receives-most-nominations-at-this-years-bafta-games-awards">most-nominated game at this year's BAFTA Game Awards</a>, ultimately winning the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/astro-bot-is-this-years-big-winner-at-the-bafta-game-awards">award for Technical Achievement</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>One particular The Last of Us Part 2 death was "one too many" for the showrunners to include in the show's second season.</p>
<p><strong>Please note there will be spoilers for The Last of Us - both the show and the games - below.</strong></p>

<p>The Last of Us Part 2 isn't short on death and misery. Seattle is carnage, with warring factions the WLF (Wolves) and the Seraphites (Scars) taking no mercy on each other, and that's before you add Ellie or any of the Jackson community into the mix.</p>
<p>The TV series has remained faithful to most of the game's key deaths. As in Part 2, The Last of Us' second season sees Joel, Nora, Mel, Owen and Jesse murdered, the latter three all in the series finale. One character, however, makes it out alive despite being killed in the game: Alice.</p>
<p>Alice is one of the WLF's canine companions in The Last of Us Part 2, and while she may only be an animation, at the end of the day her death was one that actually hit me hardest when I played the game for the first time. When Ellie makes her way into the aquarium during her search for Abby, Alice is alerted by the noise and attacks her. Ellie then fatally stabs Alice with her switchblade. However, this doesn't happen in the show.</p>
<p>Why? There are two reasons. The first is that The Last of Us showrunner Craig Mazin, who also penned Chernobyl, felt he couldn't do another pet killing scene. Chernobyl is a historical miniseries which revolves around the Chernobyl disaster of 1986, and one moment sees pets culled in a bid to stem the spread of radiation.</p>
<p>"I think you get like one dog murdering episode a lifetime," Mazin said when the topic of The Last of Us' Alice came up during a recent press event (thanks, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/features/601536/last-of-us-season-2-ending-changes-breakdown">Polygon</a>). "There are two cardinal rules in Hollywood. One: don't spend your own money. Two: don't kill a dog."</p>
<p>The showrunner added that "because it's live action, the nature of violence becomes much more, well, graphic. It's more graphic because... it's not like there's an animation between you and it, [and] it's very disturbing".</p>
<p>So, that's Mazin's reason for not including Alice's death in the show's second season, but what was <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a>'s Neil Druckman's? Well, essentially, the finale had too much death already, with Ellie herself nearly dying at the hands of the Seraphites, before she proceeds to kill Owen and Mel (and by extension Mel's unborn baby) pretty soon after. Then, before the episode wraps for good, Jesse is shot in the face by Abby, and dies immediately from his wound. It is all quite harrowing as it is, let alone if we then had to also see a dog get murdered in the name of revenge.</p>
<p>"And in our conversation, we're like this [is] probably one too many," Druckmann concluded.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-quest-1-2-hd-2d-remake-first-impressions-classic-dq-has-never-looked-so-good<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Anecdotally, it’s been said that in its native Japan, Dragon Quest is more popular than Final Fantasy, which is more popular abroad. This is most obvious for any fans of fantasy anime who will find Dragon Quest’s undeniable influence over the genre, from monster designs like Slimes to other fantasy tropes pioneered by the early Dragon Quest games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As someone who grew up primarily in the United States, I’m in the camp of gamers more familiar with the Final Fantasy series, with only a passing familiarity with Dragon Quest. Plus, while newer entries like Dragon Quest 11 have been rapturously received by fans, it’s the older Dragon Quest games that hold that certain air of history and mystique for someone like me who’s more interested in the legacy of the series.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Dragon Quest 1 &amp; 2 HD-2D Remake: Preview Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Which also means it’s been a pretty good couple of years for me as Square Enix is finally remaking these older, beloved, Dragon Quest games for modern systems – and with a fresh new look. Rather than a full, polygonal upgrade, Square Enix is utilizing the retro-modern fusion they call HD-2D from its Octopath series to revive games like Dragon Quest 3 for modern audiences. And that continues with its next remake, Dragon Quest 1 &amp; 2 HD-2D Remake, coming later this year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite being released before Dragon Quest 3, Dragon Quest 1 and Dragon Quest 2 are actually sequels, so playing Dragon Quest 3, 1, and 2 in that order is chronologically correct within the game’s universe. I got a chance to play those next two recently on PlayStation 5, and I came away even more excited to finally discover these early Dragon Quest titles.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>The Best Way to Play the Original Dragon Quest Games</strong></h3><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The first three Dragon Quest games comprise the “Erdrick Trilogy” – named after the hero of Dragon Quest 3. It’s no spoiler to say that in Dragon Quest 3, Erdrick is successful in his mission to save the kingdom from evil. You will then play as Erdrick’s descendents in Dragon Quest 1 &amp; 2. Thus, Square Enix is actually releasing these games in chronological order, which is nice of them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Up until these remakes, these have only been released as ports on mobile and certain game consoles, but there’s no need to bother with those now, unless you want a truly classic experience.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>How Square Enix is Modernizing Dragon Quest</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Given the legendary status of these games, Square Enix has to walk a bit of a tightrope trying to maintain parts of them that fans already love while modernizing some of the more dated bits. These changes, aside from the art style, are typically related to gameplay and storytelling, I’m told. In Dragon Quest 1 for example, there was no party system in the series yet, so the whole campaign is played using a single character who fights one enemy at a time. This has been changed so that now the player, while still solo, faces multiple enemies at once.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The two games are also “shorter” compared to modern RPGs, with How Long to Beat clocking <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/game/2833" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dragon Quest 1 at around 10 hours,</a> while <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/game/2837" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dragon Quest 2 dials it up to 16 hours</a> of playtime. Square Enix says they’ve beefed up some of the content and cutscenes to try and push those numbers up a bit, but don’t expect to be suddenly playing a 100-hour RPG.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Even Better Looking Than Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/24/dq2-field-pc-1748045668905.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Dragon Quest 2 HD-2D Remake. Credit: Square Enix</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The main draw of the remakes, certainly, is the visual style. Square Enix has championed this HD-2D art style – wherein pixelated 2D player character models exist in a vibrant, 3D world. Despite already playing games like Octopath Traveler 2 and Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D in this art style, it somehow looks even better in the upcoming collection.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The textures are even sharper, making the contrast between the 2D pixels and the 3D world starker, but more striking as a result. The 2D pixels have also received an upgrade, though you might not realize it at first. I compared some of the screenshots Square Enix sent over with my copy of Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D running on the Switch, and they’re quite different, with the pixelwork in Dragon 1 &amp; 2 HD-2D looking much more detailed and sophisticated than the pixels in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-review">Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The character models are a little larger, and much more detailed with their armor and weapons looking particularly sophisticated in the new remakes. I found the art style, combined with the gorgeous music, drawing me into the world of Dragon Quest quite completely. Square Enix put out some chips during my preview event and I found myself munching away while fully engrossed in the story of the hero’s party discovering the wreckage of a fallen kingdom. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a way, Dragon Quest’s, let’s say “classic” storyline and trope-ish setting is easier to appreciate today than maybe a decade ago. Nowadays, with graphics as advanced as they are and storylines trying to compete with the biggest movies and TV shows, Dragon Quest is a reminder that some stories are timeless for a reason. I’m looking forward to playing both of these HD-2D remakes  when they’re released on October 30, 2025 for all major systems – including the Nintendo Switch 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Kim is IGN's Senior Features Editor.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>
