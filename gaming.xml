<p>Pacific Drive, which was released last year, hit <strong>one million sales </strong>last month. Now, the team at Ironwood Studios is preparing to release the next major update for the game, dubbed Endless Expeditions. In a reveal trailer posted a short while ago, the new features coming with the Endless Expeditions update were revealed, and they’ve been very well received.</p>



<p>Nestled in amongst the changes and tweaks sits the ability to suspend a run, which is a mechanic that <strong>many </strong>of the game’s fans have been asking for.</p>

<h2 id="h-endless-entertainment">Endless Entertainment</h2>



<p>In the one-minute trailer posted by Ironwood Studios, the Endless Expeditions update was revealed in full.</p>



<p>Coming next month are several overhauls and additions to Pacific Drive, the post-apocalyptic indie title that sees players assume control of a ‘relic’ in the form of an old car. It’s up to them to explore an ever-changing world, solve quests, uncover mysteries, and upgrade their vehicle to no end to better survive the troubled wastes around them.</p>



<p>The trailer (which you can see below) revealed that the following elements are coming with Endless Expeditions:</p>



<ul>
<li>Cluster spawning (no idea what that is)</li>



<li>Suspend run (save, exit, and resume)</li>



<li>Improved tools: Thermal Vacuum, Plasma Scrapper</li>



<li>IDA’s Exchange (new discoverable Zone trader)</li>



<li>Over one hour of new radio music</li>



<li>New cosmetic rewards for the garage</li>



<li>Even more lore to discover</li>



<li>And of course, <strong>Endless Expeditions</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Players can embark on journeys that never end with the Endless Expeditions feature. Ironwood Studios has described the new mechanic in the description under the trailer:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Set off from the garage on new continuous drives – Expeditions. Dangerous and filled with their own unique rewards, these challenging trips will test even the most seasoned breacher.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ironwood noted that this is the ‘biggest update yet’ in Pacific Drive.</p>



<p>Endless Expeditions will be released in Pacific Drive on April 3rd on all applicable platforms.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/inzoi-most-wanted-wishlist-game-steam/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/inzoi-is-now-the-number-one-most-wanted-game-on-steam.1143816/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/inzoi-most-wanted-wishlist-game-steam/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>InZOI will be released in just a few days, and it has blown past all comers to secure the number-one most-wanted spot on Steam. In the last week, it was creeping up the chart, and now it has beaten the likes of Hollow Knight: Silksong, Deadlock, and Elden Ring: Nightreign. In a 7-day window, it has found its way to 50,000 new followers on Valve’s PC platform.</p>



<p>Many people are curious whether inZOI will be the top-tier Sims competitor it’s shaping up to be. It certainly has the visual effects to go the distance, but is there enough meat on the bones to satisfy the average gamer for as long as a Sims game can?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-coming-soon">Coming Soon</h2>



<p>InZOI will be released worldwide on March 28, which is partly why it has jumped up the Steam wishlist chart to <a href="https://steamdb.info/stats/mostwished/?sort=id_asc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">occupy the number-one spot</a>. It has beaten some of the most widely-anticipated games in recent days, including Mecha BREAK, Borderlands 4, and Dying Light: The Beast.</p>



<p>At first blush, inZOI looks nothing short of impressive, giving gamers an entire city to play around with and offering remarkable depth when it comes to things like character creation. On March 28, the game will enter an early access period, where it’ll adopt a semi-premium price tag. </p>



<p>It’s set to arrive exclusively on PC as the early access period plays out, but it’ll eventually land on console platforms in the future – we just don’t know when. It all depends on how long it’s in that early access ‘testing’ period.</p>



<p>Last year, gamers were able to get hands-on with inZOI’s character creation menu, which is intensely detailed and deep, offering ways to customise your character that we’ve never seen before in a game like this. That’s one of inZOI’s unique selling points – it goes beyond the cosmetic and into the obsessive in some ways.</p>



<p>Do you plan to pick up inZOI when it’s released on March 28? Let me know in the comments.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/nemesis-system-why-created-monolith-wb-games/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The Nemesis system introduced in 2014’s Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor was a phenomenal thing. It gave players a living, breathing force to fight, one that would learn how you played and keep coming back for more, adapting to your tactics and providing a deeper challenge time after time.</p>



<p>It was last seen in 2017’s Shadow of War, and following the closure of Monolith last month, it seems unlikely we’ll see it again for a <strong>very long time</strong>. In a recent video, a former VP of WB Games explained exactly why the Nemesis system was created in the first place, but the real reason reveals a gaping flaw in the plan all these years later.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-that-didn-t-work">That Didn’t Work</h2>



<p>Laura Fryer, formerly a VP at WB Games who oversaw studios including Monolith, recently went on record talking about her time at the company. She oversaw Monolith’s operations since 2008, which means she was around for the inception of the Nemesis system.</p>



<p>The reason it was created is a little convoluted but it all comes down to money.</p>



<p>WB Games identified a financial flaw in the industry in the form of second-hand game sales. Players would buy a game once and then sell it back to a store as a ‘trade-in’, with it then changing hands again and again, most likely. WB Games was concerned with seeing no value on those successive sales and ‘only getting paid for the first copy sold’.</p>



<p>The solution? Make people play for longer and have more fun so they didn’t sell their game at all.</p>



<p>That’s how Fryer put it in her recent video (thanks to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ex-warner-bros-exec-reveals-the-real-reason-shadow-of-mordors-much-loved-nemesis-system-was-created" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a> for the spot).</p>



<blockquote>
<p>With Shadow (of Mordor), we faced the same problem.</p>



<p>How do we create a single-player game that is so compelling, that people keep the disc in their library forever? We knew Monolith’s game engine wasn’t yet capable of having a fully open world like a GTA, and this team wasn’t interested in going the multiplayer route. But we still had to solve for the constraint. </p>



<p>And this thinking is what led to the Nemesis system, arguably one of the most creative and coolest game features in recent memory.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5f65WksXqA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Fryer stressed</a> that second-hand game sales were ‘a disaster’ for developers who were missing out on the ‘millions of dollars’ generated by that particular market. The Nemesis system made players want to hold on to their game for a little longer because it was so unpredictable and it evolved with the gamer.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="My Time with Monolith" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r5f65WksXqA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>Sadly, the Nemesis system didn’t pan out as intended. It was due to appear in the Wonder Woman game that Monolith was working on before being shuttered by WB Games in February 2025. It’s now under lock and key at WB Games for another decade, so unless it’s used in a Batman game or something, it’s unlikely you’ll ever see it again.</p>



<p>Fortunately for WB Games, the industry has changed and drastically fewer people buy second-hand software anymore.</p>

That it's been plagued by one cultural faux pas after another, from<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/ubisoft-apologizes-for-using-a-real-life-reenactment-groups-flag-in-assassins-creed-shadows-concept-art-without-permission/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> iffy concept art</a> to an<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-figure-removed-from-sale-over-insensitive-design" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> ill-advised statue</a> through to<a href="https://aftermath.site/assassins-creed-shadows-ubisoft-yasuke-apology-sucks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> sincere apologies to fans over lapses in historical accuracy</a>. This has all now culminated in the game, made primarily by Westerners but set in Japan, being spoken about in Japanese parliament.</p><p>Specifically, questions about <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/assassins-creed/assassins-creed-shadows-sneakily-tones-down-the-mess-players-can-make-across-japans-religious-sites-in-its-day-one-patch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the way the game allows players to destroy religious sites</a> were recently put to Japan’s Prime Minister by representative Kada Hiroyuki; the Prime Minister’s<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/conormurray/2025/03/21/new-assassins-creed-releases-to-strong-reviews-but-sparks-anti-woke-backlash-and-roils-japanese-government/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> seemingly stern reply, stripped of all context, sounded pretty bad</a> for Ubisoft and the game! So bad that, in an attempt to smooth things over, Ubisoft have since patched <em>Shadows</em>, removing the player's ability to smash up historic Japanese temples.</p><p><a href="https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/3303172/japanese-pm-ishiba-condemns-assassins-creed-video-game-over-cultural-disrespect-shrine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reading <em>some </em>headlines</a>, you'd think the game had made its biggest cultural misstep yet, and that this patch was a much-needed fix, alongside every other much-needed fix that has followed every other cultural misstep made by Ubisoft in the leadup to <em>Shadows</em>' release.</p><p>The thing is, though, it's all bullshit. Ubisoft didn’t have to patch this. You could smash up a temple in <em>Shadows </em>the same way you can smash up any room in the game, because the game lets you break every table and splinter every wooden door. There's also important context to be had concerning the exchange in Japanese parliament–mostly how unimportant it actually was–some of which can be found in this <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-prime-minister-of-japan-responded-to-a-question-about-assassins-creed-shadows-today-heres-whats-actually-going-on" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IGN story, </a>and more of which is covered in this thread by Jeffrey Hall, Lecturer at Kanda University of International Studies:</p><p>Or, for a more succinct version of events, there's:</p><p>If the vibes of this sound at all familiar, it's because that sound you're hearing is Ubisoft walking into the same rake the company has been walking into for almost the entire public life of this video game. Thanks to a multitude of confluent factors--the game stars a woman,<a href="https://aftermath.site/assassins-creed-shadows-yasuke-racism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> the game stars a black man and is set in Japan</a>--there’s been an excruciatingly public "controversy" over the game for what feels like years now, not for normal people or for normal reasons, but simply because a subset of frothing-mouth internet weirdos don't like it, have convinced enough others to report on the idea that their opinion somehow matters, and Ubisoft just keeps on responding to them.</p><p>I can't believe Ubisoft keeps falling for the same old shit! <em>Assassin's Creed</em> has had religion in its sights, across multiple cultures and continents, for as long as it's been around, whether you're burning monasteries or <em>fighting the Pope</em>. And like I've said, the ability to "destroy" a temple in this game isn't an act of religious violence, it's simply an accidental, meaningless consequence of letting the player climb anything and sometimes break some tables. </p><p>These are absolute non-issues that require four seconds of context to dispel, but because there are some weebs out there who hate black people just as much as they love a particular idea of Japan, and at least one of them has written an email to a Japanese politician, suddenly this is an issue? And rather than explain it, Ubisoft just folds? <a href="https://aftermath.site/assassins-creed-shadows-ubisoft-yasuke-apology-sucks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Like I said last time</a>:</p><blockquote><p>The perfect response to dealing with shitheads like this is to simply live your life pretending they don't exist.<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://aftermath.site/the-acolyte-star-wars-controversy-ratings-this-is-all-terrible" target="_blank">&nbsp;Their opinions are ill-formed, bigoted and unsuitable for mainstream consumption, and so should be ignored at all costs</a>. Let them howl at the moon all they want, let their furious emails wash against the walls of your inbox, these people simply are not worth your time.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Every word of that still applies. You do not need to apologise, or make changes for, these people! It would not have taken an exhaustive knowledge of Japanese parliamentary politics,<a href="https://www.gawkerarchives.com/how-we-got-rolled-by-the-dishonest-fascists-of-gamergat-1649496579" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> or reactionary letter-writing</a>, to know what was up here. Removing the ability to smash some stuff in one type of place but not all the others, in stark contrast to the rest of your series' decades-long stance on this, is just the weirdest line to draw. <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/assassins-creed-shadows-message-warning-animus-climbing-on-torii-gates-not-allowed-no-consequence/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">As is discouraging players from climbing over a Torii</a> (a Japanese temple gate) because <em>someone </em>is worried copycat tourists might try it; are there legitimate worries they’re going to climb over every historic castle, home and temple in the game as well?</p><p>It's embarrassing, <a href="https://aftermath.site/assassins-creed-shadows-ubisoft-yasuke-apology-sucks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and just like last time</a>, I feel for everyone who actually worked on this game, to have it thrust once again--now, right as it's basking in<a href="https://opencritic.com/game/16792/assassins-creed-shadows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> positive review scores</a>--into the spotlight of the culture wars by spineless company leadership.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/assassins-creed-shadows-story-yasuke-podcast-revie"><h3>Assassin’s Creed Shadows Is Impressive, But Does The Story Work?</h3></a><p>We love how Assassin's Creed Shadows looks and feels, but does it deliver on the story it seeks to tell?

<p>One of the most popular, albeit controversial, skateboarders of all time is going to be in the next Tony Hawk game after all. According to The Nine Club podcast, Bam Margera will be in Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4 after all.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@thenineclub" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">recent episode</a> of the show, host Roger Bagley explained what happened to get Margera into the game after it was noticed at the reveal that he wasn’t part of the roster.</p>



<p>Bagley claims that the game was done and that Margera wasn’t going to be a part of it at all. Hawk himself then reportedly put his foot down to get him on the game’s roster.</p>



<p>“Tony called up Activision and was like ‘hey, we’re putting Bam in the thing’, and they were like ‘hey, we can’t’,” Bagley said. “He goes ‘no, you’re gonna do it’, and basically made them fly Bam back out there to get body-scanned and everything else, and get him back in the game.”</p>



<p><a href="https://www.tmz.com/2025/03/24/bam-margera-featured-tony-hawk-pro-skater-3-4-video-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TMZ</a> has since corroborated the claims, saying that Activision flew Margera out to Los Angeles recently to do motion capture work for the game. Prior to his, now likely, inclusion in the upcoming remake, Margera had appeared in seven Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater Games starting with the original Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 in 2001. His last appearance was in 2007’s Tony Hawk’s Proving Ground.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Activision for comment on the claim and will update this story should a response be received. </p>



<p>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4 is set to release on July 11 for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PC, and Nintendo Switch. It’ll also be available day one on Xbox Game Pass Ultimate and PC.</p>

<p>Minecraft has been out for over 15 years, and many fans have questioned if the time was right for the game to finally go free-to-play. If you happen to be one of those fans, you’re not going to like the answer.</p>



<p>In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/minecraft-wont-go-free-to-play-its-the-best-deal-in-the-world" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, Minecraft executive producer Ingela Garneij said that neither Microsoft nor Mojang have any plans for the game to go the free-to-play route. </p>



<p>“Yeah, it doesn’t really work with the way we built it,” she said when posed with the question. </p>



<p>Garneij continued: “I mean we built the game for a different purpose. So monetization doesn’t work in that way for us. It’s a purchase of the game and then that’s it. For us it’s important that our game is available for as many people as possible. And so I think that’s a very core value that it should be accessible for everyone. It’s the best deal in the world.”</p>

<p>Minecraft first launched on PC in May 2009 before released a full 1.0 release in November 2011. It debuted on console when it released for Xbox 360 in May 2012 and is now available on every major platform.</p>



<p>Since its launch, the game has sold over 300 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling video games of all time. The game, alongside its developer Mojang, was purchased in 2014 by Microsoft for $2.5 billion.</p>

<p>Just a week before the full Nintendo Switch 2 Direct event on April 2, Nintendo is expected to hold a separate event sometime this week. That’s according to well-known leaker Nate The Hate.</p>



<p>In a post on <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/1904275415075606643" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a> on Monday, Nate The Hate said that he’s “heard there is a Nintendo presentation this week”. He added that he believes it will be on or around Thursday, and that “it’ll be a Direct”.</p>



<p>“I’m not 100% certain on the format at present,” he said.</p>



<p>Also unknown is what type of games will be shown during the event, if it happens. Will it focus exclusively on games releasing for the current Nintendo Switch, or will Switch 2 games be teased or shown as well?</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Nintendo for comment on the claims, but the company won’t comment on rumor or speculation.</p>



<p>What do you think about a final Nintendo Direct before the full Switch 2 reveal next week? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official Insider Gaming forums.</p>

            <p>
A mod putting a playable approximation of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a>'s map into <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a> has run into trouble after Rockstar owner Take-Two issued a copyright removal request to its creator's YouTube channel.
</p>
<p>
The mod, developed by Youtuber Dark Space, was an effort to bring GTA 6's map to life in GTA 5 by building on the work of the <a href="https://gtaforums.com/topic/985670-mapping-vice-city-map-discussion-thread-no-leak-footage-allowed/">Mapping Vice City project</a> - a community led attempt to piece together GTA 6's map by scrutinising all <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-will-release-on-xbox-series-xs-and-playstation-5-in-2025">currently released official media</a> and combining any discoveries with previously leaked map coordinates.
</p>
<p>
Dark Space began <a href="https://x.com/Dark_SpaceYT/status/1882980876201685289">detailing his progress on social media</a> in January and a version 1.0 release of his mod - built from GTA 5 assets - launched last week. However, the project may already have run aground; Dark Space is reining things in after Take-Two's legal team hit his YouTube channel with a copyright removal request.

<p>
"I spent months building a fan-made GTA 6-inspired map inside GTA 5 - something purely made out of passion, not profit," Dark Space wrote in an introduction to a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LmLfJAuR_U">new video detailing the week's events</a>. "But shortly after uploading a video showcasing the project, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/take-two-interactive">Take-Two Interactive</a> took it down. No warning. No conversation. Just gone."
</p>
<p>
"I've also removed the download link even though they didn't ask me to," Dark Space continued in the video itself. "But I think it's smarter to get out in front of them rather than waiting for their email that will never come... So why did they remove my video?... Well, my guess is that the map is probably a little too accurate.""
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-map-in-gta-5-mod-suffers-inevitable-take-two-takedown-creator-believes-it-was-probably-a-little-too-accurate-and-could-have-ruined-the-surprise">follow-up interview with IGN</a>, Dark Space admitted he'd anticipated Take-Two might respond the way it did based on previous mod takedowns. "I went into this project knowing it was a possibility," he explained, "and the fact that it happened does not surprise me."
</p>
<p>
"I think my map could have ruined the surprise of their map, which I get," he continued. "If you spent years building out this amazing game world just to have some YouTuber spoil the experience of the map's shape, size, and vibe... I'd want it removed too."
</p>
<p>
Take-Two has long been at loggerheads with the GTA modding community, most recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-shuts-down-ambitious-mod-that-put-gta-4s-liberty-city-in-grand-theft-auto-5">shutting down the Liberty City Preservation Project</a> - an ambitious mod adding a playable version of GTA 4's map to GTA5. In 2023, however, it hired Cfx.re - the team behind the popular GTA 5 FiveM and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/red-dead-redemption-2-walkthrough-guide-4975">RDR2</a> RedM mods (and another group that's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-bans-gta5-modders-who-made-their-own-multiplayer">previously faced Rockstar's wrath</a>) - which is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-5-enhanced-official-modding-utility-is-on-its-way">currently working on an official "conversion tool"</a> to bring GTA 5 mods into the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grand-theft-auto-5s-next-gen-upgrades-finally-arrive-on-pc">recently released PC version of GTA 5 Enhanced</a>.
</p>
<p>
As for GTA 6, it's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-still-coming-this-autumn-confirms-take-two-despite-ongoing-delay-rumours">still targeting the autumn 2025 release window previously announced by Take-Two</a>, despite persistent reports of a delay - although a third-party accessories company <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-set-for-pc-debut-in-early-2026-accessories-company-claims">recently claimed the PC version won't arrive until early next year</a>.

The rest of the studio was then mostly populated with fresh graduates. “I didn’t even have a budget when I started, because it was an internal production,” Yoshida said. The <em>Legend of Dragoon</em> team would eventually be 100 strong and  end up costing Sony $16 million. </p><p>A lot of the effort by that large team went toward the game’s infamous 30 minutes of, at the time, gorgeous CGI cutscenes. While the prerendered backgrounds and polygonal character models were looking roughly on par with what Square was doing at the end of the PS1's life, the cinematics helped elevate into a much more epic and lavish-feeling game overall. The other highlight was the timed battle mechanic that turned combat into a mini-rhythm game, an evolution of what Hasebe had created for <em>Super Mario RPG</em> (and which continues in the modern <em>Paper Mario</em> games). <br></p><p>“Eventually, we recouped that (cost), thanks to sales outside Japan,” Yoshida <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/how-sonys-most-creative-studio-rose-from-the-ashes-1458030068?_gl=1*1cb2wzs*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MjgzNzczOS4yOC4xLjE3NDI4NDEwNDAuNTguMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/how-sonys-most-creative-studio-rose-from-the-ashes-1458030068?_gl=1*1cb2wzs*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MjgzNzczOS4yOC4xLjE3NDI4NDEwNDAuNTguMC4w">previously told <em>Kotaku</em></a></span>. “The sales in the U.S. were very strong.” Unfortunately not strong enough to manifest a sequel or spiritual successor. Fortunately, <em>The Legend of Dragoon</em> is playable today after coming to PS5 a couple of years ago, though deep down in my heart of hearts I’m still hopeful we’ll eventually get <em>The Legend of Dragoon 2</em>. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

"The prospect of a game you can actually complete is a really, really positive argument [for small games]," Doucet said.

For instance, Doucet reportedly told audience members that the game's narrative has fewer than 5,000 words and cinematics top out at roughly 12-and-a-half minutes. This means players are in control over 98% of the time in Astro Bot.</p><p dir="ltr">Making smaller games could also help rein in budgets for developers.

This has led to people like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-playstation-boss-says-aaa-game-development-/1100-6478908/">former PlayStation boss Shawn Layden saying AAA game development is unsustainable</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Last month, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/astro-bot-gets-ps5-pro-support-and-new-levels-starting-today/1100-6529484/">Astro Bot got PS5 Pro support and five new levels</a> that have rolled out weekly through this month, ending with Armored Hardcore on March 13.

Prison is a point-of-interest highlighted as an example where the ambiance of the map stays the same, but the lighting has improved to create better visibility.</p><p dir="ltr">"It's the iconic Verdansk map you remember, brought to life with more detail, higher definition, and with the best technology available today to ensure it's better than ever," the developer says.</p><p>Verdansk returns on April 3 with the launch of Call of Duty Season 3.

                <p>The Assassin's Creed Shadows development team at Ubisoft has released a heartfelt statement following the launch of the game.

The sheer amount of love and positivity we've received has been incredibly heartwarming," Ubisoft said. "Seeing your excitement, your thoughtful reactions, and your joy has meant the world to us. After years of hard work, there's nothing more rewarding than watching the community connect with what we've created."</p><p>Also in the post, Ubisoft said its staffers won't be able to reply directly to every message, but assured fans that "we're listening."</p><p>"The entire development team has been reading your posts--the celebrations, the feedback, the theories--and it's been inspiring. It fuels us. And it helps us keep improving," Ubisoft said. "Thank you for being part of this journey with us. This is just the beginning for Shadows, and we're thrilled to see the game evolve with you by our side."</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1349103633" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

Skater and former Jackass star Bam Margera will reportedly feature in Activision's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-official-announcement-reveals-deluxe-edition-with-doom-slayer">upcoming Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 remake</a>, despite being omitted from the publisher's previously released skater roster - supposedly thanks to a last-minute intervention by Tony Hawk himself.
</p>
<p>
Margera made his series debut in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3</a> back in 2001 and has appeared in all subsequent instalments. However, fans quickly noticed his absence when 3 + 4's skater line-up was unveiled earlier this month, with many speculating his omission may be related to the legal issues Margera has faced as a result of his struggles with drug and alcohol abuse.
</p>
<p>
Now, though, it's been claimed Margera will appear in the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4</a> remake after all - albeit as a last-minute addition at Tony Hawk's insistence. That's according to skating podcast The Nine Club co-host Roger Bagley, as <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/bam-margera-will-be-in-tony-hawk-34-after-all-after-hawk-intervened-its-claimed/">spotted by VGC</a>.

<p>
"Well, here's what happened," Bagley explained in a recent livestream. "The game was already done. Tony called up Activision and was like, 'Hey, we're putting Bam in the thing', and they were like, 'Hey, we can't'. He goes, 'No, you're gonna do it', and basically made them fly Bam back out there to get body-scanned and everything else, and get him back in the game."
</p>
<p>
Activision hasn't yet commented on the claims, but its currently confirmed skater roster - which includes classic skaters and new additions - is as follows: Tony Hawk, Bucky Lasek, Steve Caballero, Kareem Campbell, Geoff Rowley, Andrew Reynolds, Elissa Steamer, Chad Muska, Eric Koston, Rodney Mullen, Jamie Thomas, Rune Glifberg, Bob Burnquist, Rayssa Leal, Chloe Covell, Jamie Foy, Zion Wright, and Yuto Horigome.
</p>
<p>
Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 launches for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC (via Steam, Battle.net and Microsoft Store) on 11th July. It's also coming to Game Pass Ultimate and Game Pass PC.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/how-kendrick-lamar-and-drake%E2%80%99s-rap-beef-reignited-the-anime-big-three-discourse.1143579/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/kendrick-lamar-drake-anime-naruto-bleach-one-piece<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A year and some change ago, Atlanta rapper Future and producer Metro Boomin released their collaborative studio album "We Don’t Trust You." As is customary for rap album releases on streaming platforms such as Spotify and Apple Music, the features on the album were not disclosed until a few days after its release to encourage listeners to experience the entire album rather than skip to an artist they fancy, like Travis Scott, The Weeknd, Playboi Carti, and Rick Ross (for his four die-hard fans). Today, it is difficult to recall the other featured artists on the album due to Kendrick Lamar’s "<a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/future-metro-boomin-kendrick-lamar-like-that-number-one-hot-100-1234996590/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Like That</a>" verse, which stole the spotlight and ignited a generational rap feud between him and Drake.</p><p>We all know what followed: the world rubbernecked from their day jobs to witness the pair drop eight diss tracks against each other between April and May. Many of the tracks dropped so suddenly that only the most unemployed of the music-listening public could rise to the occasion of playing the role of Paul Revere by posting "Kendrick dropped" whenever a new track released. Their hydrogen bomb vs coughing baby feud culminated with Lamar out-rapping the <em>Degrassi </em>star by <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/music-news/kendrick-lamar-dominated-grammys-not-like-us-1236125989/#:~:text=With%20his%202024%20anthem%20%E2%80%9CNot,video%20and%20best%20rap%20performance." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">winning multiple Grammys</a> for his final diss track "Not Like Us," <a href="https://www.nfl.com/videos/kendrick-lamar-s-full-apple-music-super-bowl-halftime-show" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">headlining the Super Bowl</a>, and getting a packed stadium to sing along to the Canadian rapper being a "<a href="https://x.com/hiphop_communit/status/1803618488696611110?t=t-m1idxOWP7fVqJ6B2Gw8w&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">certified pedophile</a>" (<a href="https://x.com/cinesquetv/status/1888766681159283091?t=9VoZnH4MIsELJSMozIpNhQ&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">twice</a>). It was, and forever will be, a good time to be a K Dot fan.&nbsp;</p><p>However, one unacknowledged aspect of Kendrick, Drake, and J. Cole's feud (until <a href="https://variety.com/2024/music/news/j-cole-7-minute-drill-removed-streaming-kendrick-lamar-diss-1235969657/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post-diss clarity hit him</a>, leading him to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/08/arts/music/jcole-kendrick-lamar-diss-apology.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">apologize to Lamar</a> and duck out of the beef to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6818Dx0N9k" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">live a peaceful life</a>) is how one line in Lamar's "Like That" verse breathed life into a long-quelled feud in the anime community over which shonen series is the best of all time: <em>Naruto</em>, <em>Bleach</em>, or <em>One Piece</em>.</p><p>The bar in question was a response to J. Cole’s <a href="https://youtu.be/Xty2gi5cMa8?t=116" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“First Person Shooter” verse</a> calling himself, Drake, and K Dot the big three in rap — a claim that’s pretty easy to accept in most rap circles. Lamar, ever the competitive rapper, took playful offense to that, saying, <a href="https://youtu.be/N9bKBAA22Go?t=110" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“Fuck the big three, it’s just big me.”</a> While the phrase is in reference to the trio, it also carries weight in anime circles as the term dedicated to <em>One Piece</em>, <em>Naruto</em>, and <em>Bleach</em> as the <a href="https://otaku.fandom.com/wiki/Big_Three" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">big three shonen series</a>. While greener anime fans often mistakenly treat the term as something that can be <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/vl0rof/the_new_big_three/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">usurped by newer series</a> like <em>Jujutsu </em>Kaisen or <em>Demon Slayer</em>, old heads have gatekept the adulation as a distinction that <a href="https://gizmodo.com/shonen-jump-big-three-future-2000501015" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">can never be duplicated</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>As soon as anime fans heard K Dot’s big three bar, they knew <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZT2nBKQdJ/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">peace among fandoms would be disrupted</a> once again with the resurgence of old internet forum debates. But this time, these debates happened on the new stage of the brainrot social media site TikTok, whose video editors took K Dot’s bar as a sleeper agent activation phrase and went wild making stylish AMVs centering either of the three anime as the one that was “really like that” while their contemporaries' best work was “a light pack.”&nbsp;</p><p>While the rap trio's beef was settled through their ability to craft scathing disses at each other's character, the anime big three TikTok beef was resolved by determining which fandom excelled in creating AMVs with their show as the superior series. The discourse evolved into the rappers being aptly personified as the three anime shows. Kendrick's anime persona was <em>One Piece</em>, as he has garnered an almost religious following of listeners who dedicate their lives to converting others to his fanbase despite the breadth of his discography being more politically charged and intimidatingly dense than his peers. (It also doesn't hurt that <a href="https://aftermath.site/luffy-one-piece-lakers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Luffy reps Lamar's Los Angeles Lakers</a>.) Drake's anime persona was <em>Naruto </em>because he is the most popular of the three, garnering an all-encompassing reach thanks to the mass appeal of his songs servicing beginner rap listeners. This left <em>Bleach </em>as J. Cole’s anime persona, which was so uncannily appropriate one could almost call it fate. Like <em>Bleach</em>, J. Cole suffers from middle-child syndrome, often being left out of the conversation as the forerunner of the big three despite having a stylish flow of his own, even if he has not delivered a new flow or cadence in his rap performances since the trio broke into the rap scene over a decade ago.</p><p>Aside from stray anime AMVs, such as those featuring <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZT2nBtjSK/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>JJK </em></a>and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZT2n5HYVT/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Dragon Ball Super</em></a>, TikTok video editors engaged in widespread friendly competition. My favorite AMVs had its heroes quip catchphrases after K Dot's “big three” bar, such as Naruto saying “baka,” Ichigo saying “bankai,” and Luffy giggling while hitting his Gear 5 pose. Like the Kendrick-Drake rivalry, TikTok AMVs quickly escalated, with <em>Naruto</em> fans readily admitting they were <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZT2nBsmwc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">getting their generous ramen-eating asses beaten</a> by the video editors behind <em>Bleach </em>and <em>One Piece</em>’s “Like That” edits outperforming their creative efforts.&nbsp;</p><p>If you’re wondering who won the Anime Big Three contest of 2024, it was definitively <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZT2nBq82p/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>One Piece</em></a>. Not only did the anime’s supporters work harder on the video editing front, but they also provided empirical data, such as <em>One Piece</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_manga" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">selling more volumes worldwide</a> than the other series, as further proof of its superiority. They also cleverly utilized K Dot’s “Prince outlived Mike Jack” bar — comparing his influence to Drake’s comparing himself to Michael Jackson — to emphasize the <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZT2nBWdFV/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ongoing series outliving <em>Bleach </em>and <em>Naruto</em></a>.</p><p>Did Kendrick Lamar know his <a href="https://youtu.be/NPqDIwWMtxg?t=85" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“throw away”</a> big three bar would reignite an age-old anime beef through dueling AMVs at the same time as he was systematically dismantling his lesser? Probably not.
