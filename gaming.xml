<p>Whats your favourite?</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>The Pokémon Company has officially launched its <strong>'What's Your Favourite'</strong> campaign as part of Pokémon's 30th anniversary celebrations.</p>
<p>Kicking off during the Super Bowl LX game at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California, the ad features singer Lady Gaga alongside Trevor Noah, Jisoo, Charles Leclerc, Lamine Yamal, Maitreyi Ramakrishnan, and Young Miko as they reveal their favourite Pokémon from the series.</p>
<p>Lady Gaga's choice, as expected, is Jigglypuff, famed for its singing abilities ("in be4 jokes about Gaga sending people to sleep") The two even perform a short yet charming duet together to sing Jigglypuff's song, and it's clearly got the YouTube comments in a flurry of excitement, with one user stating "LADY GAGA SINGING WITH JIGGLYPUFF MY LIFE IS MADE". Ours too.</p>
<p>Overall, it's a fun little ad, though arguably not what more hardcore fans want to see from the 30th anniversary celebrations. We daresay that most folks have got their fingers crossed for a release of the original Game Boy / GBA games for Nintendo Switch Online.</p>
<p>The 20th anniversary saw the launch of several OG titles for the 3DS on 27th February 2016, so we'll definitely be keeping an eye out for something similar later this month.</p>

			<p>A few days ago, during <strong>AMD</strong>'s Q4 earnings call, CEO <strong>Lisa Su</strong> shared some comments on the launches of <strong>Microsoft's Xbox Next Gen console</strong> and <strong>Valve's Steam Machine</strong>. When it comes to the Steam Machine, she said <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-confirms-steam-machine-will-start-shipping-early-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Valve was on track to launch it in early 2026</a>; however, in the span of a few hours, Valve <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-machine-actually-gets-slight-delay-ram-shortage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">told Steam users</a> that <strong>it had to delay finalizing the shipping schedule and pricing</strong> due to the ongoing RAM shortage.</p>



<p>Regarding the Xbox Next Gen hardware, Lisa Su <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/amds-semi-custom-soc-thatll-power-the-next-gen-xbox-is-progressing-well-to-support-a-launch-in-2027-says-amd-ceo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stated that it was tracking well for a launch at some point next year</a></strong>. However, it appears that she was once again a little more eager than the client might have wanted. Windows Central <a href="https://wccftech.com/amds-semi-custom-soc-thatll-power-the-next-gen-xbox-is-progressing-well-to-support-a-launch-in-2027-says-amd-ceo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has published a report</a> citing that Microsoft sources were a little surprised at her comment, as <strong>there is no hard commitment to 2027 yet</strong>. It is when Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-2027-launch-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">would like to launch the console</a>, but there's still work to do before committing to next year. In Su's defense, it's not on the hardware side, at least according to Windows Central. Instead, Microsoft wants to ensure that the underlying operating system and interface are as polished as needed. As such, Windows Central reckons 2027 is currently a "best case scenario".</p>



<p>This is because much of Microsoft's vision for the Xbox Next Gen console hinges on successfully merging the console (Xbox) and PC (Windows) sides. <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-will-offer-the-best-of-console-and-pc-put-together-says-microsoft-more-info-coming-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The first step was the Xbox handheld</a>, but there's a lot more that needs to be done. The console will start in Xbox "mode" with a console-like interface, but <strong>users can apparently "exit" to full-fledged Windows 11 whenever they want and run basically any program there</strong>. Furthermore, just as on regular Windows, Xbox users will be able to get games from other PC stores, such as Steam or the Epic Games Store. </p>



<p>Given this approach, it's perhaps not much of a surprise to learn that the Xbox Next Gen console will feature Microsoft's vision when it comes to specs and pricing, but <strong>other OEM partners like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-this-is-an-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ASUS</a> or Lenovo could come up with their own versions that are either more or less powerful (and consequently more or less expensive) than Microsoft's official Xbox</strong>. </p>



<p>The report doesn't share much on the Xbox Next Gen console's pricing, other than Microsoft <strong>seemingly targeting a more premium offering</strong> (they did, after all, <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-generation-largest-technical-leap-ever-seen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">promise the largest technical leap to date</a>). The ongoing memory shortages, as well as US tariffs, are making it hard to pin down pricing at this point.</p>



<p>Still, it sounds like Microsoft itself isn't too worried if the launch price is a little high, because cross-generation with the current consoles is expected to continue for even longer <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-ps4-crossgen-right-and-rational-jim-ryan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">than the last time</a>. This means <strong>users could continue playing their Xbox Series S or X for years before any exclusive Xbox Next Gen games are released</strong>. </p>

            <p>Initial player data indicates that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/nioh-3">Nioh 3</a> is performing well following its release last Friday, hitting nearly 90,000 concurrent players on Steam over the weekend. It is currently at the top of Steam's Trending Games list.</p>
<p>Nioh 3, the latest triple-A release from Team Ninja and Koei Tecmo, hit an all-time peak of 88,045 concurrent PC players on Sunday <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3681010/charts/">according to SteamDB</a>. This is <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1325200/charts/">over double what Nioh 2 achieved on the same platform</a>, and <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/485510/charts/">eight times what the original Nioh managed</a>. The big difference, aside from a potential increase in popularity? Nioh 3 is the first game in the series to launch simultaneously on PC and console.</p>
<p>With that, it's worth considering Nioh 3 is also available on the PlayStation 5, so these figures are only one half of the whole picture. While player data isn't as readily available on console platforms, the game does currently have a 4.48 star rating on the PlayStation store.

<p>It's not just a case of good-looking numbers, either. Nioh 3 is currently sitting on a very positive rating on Steam, with games critic reviews praising the game in droves. The game is currently sitting at 86 on Metacritic.</p>
<p>As for Eurogamer,<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nioh-3-review"> it was described as "a historical high for Team Ninja" in our review</a>. Dom Peppiat summarises the game's merits with the following: "Innovation is the ki to success for Team Ninja and Koei Tecmo, as Nioh 3 iterates on the formula once more to take an already great 'masocore' series to new heights."</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a> has been in a pretty good place since 2020's Wastelanders update, which added NPCs and entirely new questlines to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-76-review-a-bizarre-boring-and-broken-mess">the once-barren online survival game</a>. Since then, it's become more of a full-blown multiplayer RPG with a strong diehard community even if not every Fallout fan vibes with the basic pitch. Why don't we have crossplay though?</p>
<p>This question has been repeatedly raised by the players over the years, and you'd think the development team is tired of giving negative answers by now, but something could change at some point in the future. Just don't expect an update to happen soon.</p>
<p>Following <a href="https://gamerant.com/fallout-76-no-crossplay-cross-progression-feature/">a roundtable interview</a> in late 2025 where the idea of having crossplay was shot down due to the "huge technical hurdle" it'd be to figure out almost eight years after launch, there's a new hope to latch on to. During an interview with creative director Jon Rush and production director Bill LaCoste (via <a href="https://www.polygon.com/fallout-76-crossplay-bethesda/">Polygon</a>), a more positive update on the matter was given.</p>
<p>"We are looking into it, and we have plans to try to scope out what that work is going to entail for us... It's just not in the immediate plans for us. We know players want it," Rush said. Don't expect proper commitment to the idea, as it sounds like Bethesda is just exploring options as the community doesn't let go of the idea, but the door hasn't been fully shut yet.</p><p>LaCoste once again brought up the "technical hurdles" of going back to the game's roots after years of iteration and trying to rework its innards into something that supports shared online play across all platforms without breaking anything in the process: "So going back and retrofitting it to do that, when you have different places that players are pointing into, and now you're having to worry about entitlements and account purchases and currency." If you've been around long enough, you know we also have to add to the pile of potential issues Creation Engine's infamous creakiness and tendency to crashing.</p>
<p>While it seems crossplay remains a distant dream, this is yet another example of organized movement from the most dedicated portion of a game's community making a difference. A few years ago, we'd lost all hope of Fallout 76 ever getting a current-gen upgrade, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-76-is-finally-getting-native-versions-for-xbox-series-x-and-s-and-ps5-early-2026">that will be happening later this year</a>, so it's never too late to turn things around if the interest is there and the financials make sense.</p>
<p>In any case, the numbers should be good enough, as Fallout Season 2 has made us (and seemingly many people) <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-2-future-of-the-games">excited for Fallout's overall future</a> and Bethesda is happily adding <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-76-goes-free-to-celebrate-tv-shows-season-2-conclusion-adds-a-30-cosmetic-cameo">$30 power armour cosmetics</a> to a game that many were burying ages ago.</p>

			<p>The announcement of the highly anticipated <strong>Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag remake</strong> won't be <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-state-of-play-february-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">at this week's <strong>State of Play</strong></a> broadcast, <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/rumor-natedrake-says-there-will-be-a-playstation-state-of-play-in-february-up-feb-12th.1416025/post-151055929" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to insider shinobi602</a>, but it will be relatively soon, and the same goes for the game's release; <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/rumor-natedrake-says-there-will-be-a-playstation-state-of-play-in-february-up-feb-12th.1416025/page-7#post-151057333" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>both are "not too far off"</strong></a>.</p>



<p>It's now been more than two and a half years since we first heard that Ubisoft was crafting an Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag remake. The original rumor <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag-remake-rumor-skull-and-bones-dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">came from Kotaku</a>, which also reported that <strong>Ubisoft Singapore</strong>, the studio behind the Black Flag-inspired game <strong>Skull and Bones</strong>, was likely involved in the development.</p>



<p>The next big confirmation came from an unlikely source: the actor who played protagonist Edward Kenway. <strong>Matt Ryan</strong>, the actor best known for playing <strong>DC's John Constantine</strong>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-practically-confirmed-by-edward-kenways-actor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">practically told a fan at a signing event that the remake was coming</a>. Later, he would say that Ubisoft <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-edward-kenway-actor-threatened-with-lawsuit-by-ubisoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">threatened him with a lawsuit unless he shut up about it</a></strong>.</p>



<p>Then, last September, French website Jeux Vidéo Magazine shared the first actual info on the remake. Ubisoft reportedly <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-assassins-creed-iv-black-flag-remake-major-changes-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cut off the boring modern-day sections of the original game (in which players took the role of an unnamed Abstergo research analyst) and added more quests and content to explore as Edward Kenway</a></strong>. Furthermore, the report said moving from land to ship and vice versa would now be seamless.</p>



<p>In late November, Insider Gaming's Tom Henderson <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag-remake-targeting-march-2026-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claimed that Ubisoft was targeting March 2026</a>, right before the end of the fiscal year, for the release of Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag remake. The announcement appeared imminent when the European game rating board, PEGI, <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag-remake-assassins-creed-black-flag-resynced-pegi-rating-ubisoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published a new classification for a game titled <strong>Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Resynced</strong></a>.</p>



<p>However, the game was included <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-major-reset-cancels-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in a list of titles that were delayed as part of Ubisoft's "major reset"</a>, while the publisher also cancelled another highly anticipated remake, <strong>Prince of Persia: Sands of Time</strong>. This <a href="https://wccftech.com/you-gonna-cancel-it-like-you-canceled-sands-of-time-ubisofts-reply-to-new-assassins-creed-iv-black-flag-remake-leak-draws-ire/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">made fans worried the same fate could befall the Black Flag remake</a>, but based on Shinobi602's information, that shouldn't happen. In fact, it shouldn't be long until we can play it.</p>

Trevor Noah prefers Psyduck, Leclerc chooses Arcanine, Jisoo picks Eevee, Ramakrishnan chooses Luxray, Yamal picks Zygarde, and Young Miko's partner is Gengar. Shockingly, The Pokémon Company managed not to put Pikachu in this ad anywhere (except in the logo, of course)!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The ad ends with all the celebrities asking the audience, "What's your favorite?" This question is the start of a year-long campaign put on by The Pokémon Company in celebration of its 30th anniversary. In addition to the ad, The Pokémon Company is kicking things off by introducing a new camera feature to Pokémon GO (which is somehow ten years old this year!) that allows users to participate in the campaign.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Additionally, The Pokémon Company has promised various events, including "Day Out" and "Night Out" experiences designed for fans to celebrate Pokémon, with daytime events more family-focused and nighttime events more for adults who grew up with the series. The Pokémon Company has also already announced other celebratory events, such as a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-day-2026-tcg-collection-is-back-in-stock-with-a-major-new-discount-at-amazon">themed TCG collection</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-lego-sets-where-to-buy">Pokémon LEGO sets</a>.</p><div id="234519"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234519" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Pokémon Day 2026 Collection</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon's 30th is a big moment for the franchise, and we're expecting them to celebrate in style. Historically Pokémon has thrown a big digital showcase entitled Pokémon Presents on or around Pokémon Day (February 27), where the company lays out its plans for the year across video games, the TCG, and merchandise. Fans are eagerly hoping for the announcement of a new Pokémon game, perhaps a remake of beloved DS games Black and White, or the kick-off for the next generation of Pokémon, Gen 10. Heck, at this point, I'd just be happy to have the classic games on Nintendo Switch Online!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN. Got a story tip?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The 30th anniversary of Pokemon took center stage for a brief moment during Super Bowl 60.</p>



<p>An entire generation of kids who wanted to be the “very best like no one ever was” has grown into a population of adults who have taken different paths but share a love of Pokemon and fond memories of it.</p>



<p>That love was on display in a Super Bowl 60 commercial. Trevor Noah, Lady Gaga, Blackpink’s Jisoo, and more all named their favorites and spoke about why they have a love for the franchise.</p>







<h2 id="h-lady-gaga-s-favorite-is-jigglypuff">Lady Gaga’s Favorite Is Jigglypuff</h2>



<p>It should come as no surprise that Lady Gaga is a fan of Jigglypuff. The Grammy Award-winning Superstar praised the fairy-type Pokemon for using her voice as a means of protection and self-defense. Gaga even noted that Jigglypuff has a 12-octave vocal range.</p>



<p>Trevor Noah remarked that his favorite is Psyduck. Noah praised Psyduck for its ability to change the world with its mind. He also said that every time you met a new one, it was like meeting a new part of yourself.</p>



<p>Charles Leclerc, Lamine Yamal, Maitreyi Ramakrishnan, and Young Miko also appeared in the ad, which ran for just over a minute.</p>

</p></figure>







<h2 id="h-pokemon-turns-30">Pokemon Turns 30</h2>



<p>2026 is a big year for Pokemon. It has been 30 years since Pokemon Red and Blue launched on the original Nintendo Game Boy. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-day-2026-pokemon-presents/">Pokemon Day</a> falls on February 27 every year. </p>



<p>Each year, a stream hosted by The Pokemon Company sets the stage for the franchise’s immediate future. This year, fans expect the launch of the 10th generation of everyone’s favorite friendly monsters.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Microsoft Still Plans First-Party Xbox Handheld, It’s Claimed]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-still-plans-first-party-xbox-handheld-its-claimed/</link>
            <guid>1429477</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>As Microsoft continues to shape its vision for the future of the Xbox brand, it still plans to develop a first-party handheld device, even if “everything is an Xbox.”</p>



<p>In 2025, ASUS launched the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/xbox-ally/" id="2725">ROG Xbox Ally series </a>of handheld gaming devices. The two new devices were more powerful versions of the previously launched <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/asus-rog-ally/" id="629">ROG Ally systems,</a> designed to make it easier to access PC game launchers, including<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/xbox-game-pass/" id="1075"> Xbox Game Pass.</a></p>



<p>Still, a new <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/exclusive-the-next-gen-xbox-2027-locked-in-most-ambitious" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">report from Jez Corden </a>notes that plans remain in place for a first-party Xbox handheld, even if the next mainline Xbox console is the primary focus for now. </p>



<p>The next-generation <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/xbox/" id="131">Xbox </a>platform is touted as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/microsoft/" id="189">Microsoft’s </a>boldest effort in the gaming space to date, even after a game-changing quarter-century. As such, they’re not committing to a firm launch date for the next home console yet.</p>







<h2 id="h-major-changes-coming-soon-to-the-asus-rog-xbox-ally">Major Changes Coming Soon to the ASUS ROG Xbox Ally</h2>



<p>The report from Corden notes that Microsoft is testing a new NPU-driven highlights feature for the Xbox Ally X that automatically transforms gameplay clips into shareable videos. This feature is slated for a March 2026 release.</p>



<p>The next Xbox console is also set to take notes from the Ally X handheld by bringing multiple launchers, such as the Epic Games launcher and Steam, to the platform. Regardless of the hardware, the overall message remains the same: make Xbox accessible anywhere and everywhere.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Man Murders His Girlfriend But is More Concerned About ‘Missing’ GTA 6]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-murder-man-concerned-about-missing-game/</link>
            <guid>1429474</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Robert Richens was apprehended by UK police last year for brutally murdering his former girlfriend. Recently, Richens appeared at Oxford Crown Court for sentencing, being sent down with a life sentence on February 6, 2026. In new footage captured by the police officers who brought Richens in, it was revealed that the killer had something else on his mind at the time.</p>



<p>In a clip that has gone <strong>viral</strong> in recent days, Richens was caught sobbing midway through being arrested, blurting out that he was going to ‘miss GTA’.</p>



<h2 id="h-callous-and-merciless-murder">‘Callous’ and ‘Merciless’ Murder</h2>



<p>In a report published <a href="https://www.thamesvalley.police.uk/news/thames-valley/news/2026/february/02-02-26/man-jailed-for-life-for-murder--abingdon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">by Thames Valley Police</a> in the United Kingdom, itwas confirmed that Robert Richens, aged 35, was jailed for life, with a minimum term of 16 years, for the 2025 murder of his former partner.</p>



<p>Per the report, Richens had called emergency services on the morning of May 30 and stressed that he’d accidentally killed someone. Upon investigation, it was found that his former partner, Rachael Vaughan, had been subject to a ‘sustained assault’ that had left her lifeless.</p>



<p>Here’s the clip that surfaced recently on social media, showing Richens sobbing and lamenting the loss of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/grand-theft-auto-6/" id="36">Grand Theft Auto 6</a>:</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>A man in the UK was arrested for murder, and his only concern was that he’d miss GTA VI as he’d likely get life in prison. </p><p>The police officer replies “You’ve got ages for that” 💀 <a href="https://t.co/by2KVdbLkn">pic.twitter.com/by2KVdbLkn</a></p></div>— ben (@videotechuk_) <a href="https://twitter.com/videotechuk_/status/2020303229091999969?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 8, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>In the video, a police officer casually asks what GTA he’s referring to, and when Richens simply said, ‘Six,’ the officer brushed it off, suggesting he ‘had ages’ until the game came out.</p>



<p>Richens won’t only miss Grand Theft Auto 6, but likely Grand Theft Auto 7 too, if <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/rockstar-games/" id="1648">Rockstar’s</a> release cadence is anything to go by. While UK prisons permit games consoles, they’re only allowed older units that cannot connect to the internet, which includes the likes of the PlayStation 2 and original Xbox.</p>



<p>During sentencing, the judge labelled Richens’ actions as callous and merciless for the crime he’d pleaded guilty to.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ps6-specs-playstation-handheld-impressive-memory/</link>
            <guid>1429471</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The latest round of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/playstation-6/" id="217" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation 6</a> claims surfaced recently, alongside claims regarding the upcoming ‘PlayStation handheld’, dubbed Project Canis. In a series of posts on NeoGAF, reliable tech leaker, KeplerL2, divulged some tidbits about the upcoming next generation of PlayStation hardware, focused squarely on <strong>memory capabilities</strong>.</p>



<p>In the string of posts, KeplerL2 claimed that the PlayStation 6 could boast up to 30 GB of GDDR7 memory, using a specific configuration to fit it into the console. Elsewhere, the PlayStation handheld, KeplerL2 says, could have as much as 24 GB of LPDDR5X memory, putting it at least on par with the recently released ROG Xbox Ally X, arguably the most premium handheld on the market.</p>







<h2 id="h-playstation-6-and-playstation-handheld-claims-surface-again">PlayStation 6 and PlayStation Handheld Claims Surface Again</h2>



<p>It’s once every few months that we’re seeing fresh information emerge regarding the next generation of PlayStation hardware.</p>



<p>In April 2025, we had claims come <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/portable-ps6-wont-be-as-powerful-as-ps5-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">from KeplerL2</a> that the upcoming PlayStation handheld won’t be as powerful as the PlayStation 5. In August, a fresh wave <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-6-console-and-new-ps6-handheld-canis-specs-leak-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">of technical specs leaked</a> for both devices, and in October, it was claimed that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ps6-to-release-in-2027-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation 6 will be released</a> as early as 2027.</p>



<p>This new spate of information comes from KeplerL2 again, who has proven to be mostly reliable in the past for technical insights.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/amd-ceo-reveals-next-gen-xbox-could-launch-in-2027-%E2%80%94-ceo-says-semi-custom-soc-ready-to-support-launch-in-2027.1693009/page-9#post-271240975" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a thread</a> on NeoGAF, KeplerL2 addressed a question around <strong>how </strong>Sony would ‘hit 30GB of GDDR7 with only 4GB modules on a 160-bit bus.’</p>



<p>Per KeplerL2, the tech titan would opt for 3 GB memory modules arranged in a clamshell configuration. It would reduce the memory bus but hit a higher memory speed overall and promote more bandwidth, as much as 640 GB/s (thanks to <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/playstation-handheld-reportedly-with-24gb-memory-ps6-console-with-30gb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">videocardz.com</a> for the breakdown).</p>



<p>Additionally, KeplerL2 suggested that a ‘good amount of memory’ for the PlayStation portable (‘PS6 handheld’) would be 24 GB, which is more or less the industry standard right now for top-tier handheld gaming devices.</p>



<p>As always, these kinds of claims or suggestions should be taken with a grain of salt until we have it from the horse’s mouth.</p>







<p>What do you think? Can you see the PS6 launching with almost double the memory capacity of the PlayStation 5? Let us know your thoughts on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-dev-confident-fans-will-like-new-ringside-pass/</link>
            <guid>1429447</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>WWE 2K26 is introducing a new Ringside Pass, similar to battle pass systems in other games. Now, the gameplay designer, Cornell Gunter, explains the benefits fans can expect from this new addition.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/wwe-2k26-2/" id="174969">WWE 2K26</a> is set to release worldwide on March 13. This year’s game features the return of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-new-match-types/" id="170273">several match types</a> to WWE video games. However, there are also many changes coming to this year’s game, including the introduction of a<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-will-the-wwe-2k26-ringside-pass-work/" id="174147"> new Ringside Pass</a>, which changes how unlockables work in the series.</p>







<h2 id="h-wwe-2k26-dev-says-ringside-pass-is-about-content-first-and-foremost">WWE 2K26 Dev Says Ringside Pass Is About Content First and Foremost</h2>



<p>During a recent interview with <a href="https://youtu.be/m935QSZHAfI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">JustBryan,</a> WWE 2K26 gameplay designer Cornell Gunter praised the changes that the new Ringside Pass will offer. He notes that Ringside Pass Premium will offer day-one DLC. He also notes that the new system is strictly about content rather than time-sensitive releases. </p>



<p>While it is divided into seasons, none of the benefits are time-limited. If a player returns to the game after several months away, they will still have access to all premium content. Overall, there will be 120 reward items per season.</p>



<p>“I’m very excited to see what the reactions are by the end of the lifecycle. Because I think people are going to be very, very happy with what we are able to achieve and what we brought to the table with the Ringside Pass,” Gunter said.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Team Vitality Wins IEM Krakow After 3-1 Victory over FURIA]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/team-vitality-wins-iem-krakow-beat-furia/</link>
            <guid>1429444</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Team Vitality has lifted the trophy at IEM Krakow, extending a phenomenal record over the last year or so and sending FURIA packing at the final post. The victory came after a hard-fought battle in the Tauron Arena in front of thousands of fans, but Vitality’s final streak through FURIA was a masterclass to behold.</p>



<p>Only the opening round on Mirage was of any use to the Brazilian side, stumping up a tough 11-13 finish that quickly went squandered in the subsequent maps. By the third map, Team Vitality was dominating 13-2, showing why it was worthy of that all-important trophy and the $400,000 prize.</p>







<h2 id="h-team-vitality-matches-iem-krakow-predictions">Team Vitality Matches IEM Krakow Predictions</h2>



<p>In our earlier coverage, our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/iem-krakow/" id="3570">IEM Krakow</a> predictions had Team Vitality sitting pretty in first place, and it’s always nice to be validated by the result.</p>



<p>Team Vitality has pushed onwards and upwards with a monumental, award-winning streak that has left the team being regarded as one of the all-time greatest <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/counter-strike/" id="482">Counter-Strike</a> rosters ever created. In the last year, the organization has edged into double-digit territory in terms of trophies raised, and this latest one, secured at the first IEM Krakow event, is more ammunition for the cabinet.</p>



<p>Before IEM Krakow, the team’s last win came at the StarLadder Budapest Major in December, which yielded a 3-1 win over FaZe Clan and a $500,000 prize.</p>



<p>Krakow seemed in the bag for Vitality throughout much of the tournament. For die-hard fans of the brand, this was only ever going to go one way.</p>



<figure></figure>

As Anku, an Aymara boy with a unique gift, you’ll harness the power of color to shape the environment itself, uncovering hidden paths to navigate challenging and complex puzzles.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Single Player</strong> – Bring the world around you to life with the power of color in <em>Colorbound</em>, a vibrant palette-platformer. Join Anku on a heartfelt journey to reunite his late grandfather’s band by using color to shape the world around you. As you journey, you’ll solve puzzles, uncover secrets, and help a family of musicians come together one last time.</li><li><strong>A Farewell Tour For Your Grandfather</strong> – Anku’s grandfather was a beloved musician to his people, but his band has long since scattered. Now, with only memories and a special gift, Anku must journey across diverse landscapes to find the missing musicians, reignite their passions, and give his grandfather the farewell he deserves. Along the way, you’ll use color to brighten the canvas, turning obstacles into opportunities, and puzzles into music!</li><li><strong>Change Colors to Change The World</strong> – In <em>Colorbound</em>, you will collect colors onto your palette, which can be used to overcome logic and light platforming puzzles. From lush forests to forgotten cities, <em>Colorbound</em>‘s overworld offers a variety of mind-bending puzzles that span a variety of locations and aesthetics.</li><li><strong>Finding Balance</strong> – Not all colors behave the same way. Some may be lighter, allowing objects to float away once painted, while other colors are heavier and may drop down. Using this to your advantage can help Anku cross the treacherous terrain to reach his destination.</li><li><strong>Rooted in Culture</strong> – <em>Colorbound</em> draws inspiration from the Aymara culture of the Andes, blending traditional music and art styles with an indie-gem-inspired puzzle platformer experience. Informed by Panpipe Studio’s Chilean culture and heritage, <em>Colorbound</em> celebrates the rich culture of South America while delivering a universal story of love, loss, and the power of art.</li></ul><!-- AD: content -->
