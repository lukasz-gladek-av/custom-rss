            <p>Embracer Group – which has reduced its headcount by 4532 employees in the past financial year – wants to harness AI to "empower" its staff, saying artificial intelligence "has the capability to massively enhance game development by increasing resource efficiency".</p>
<p>In its latest <a href="https://embracer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Embracer-Group-publishes-Annual-Report-20232024-240620.pdf">annual report</a>, as spotted by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/embracer-embraces-a-human-centric-ai-policy-says-vague-stuff-about-how-it-will-massively-enhance-game-development/">PC Gamer</a>, Embracer privacy and AI governance head Tomas Hedman stressed it would be a risk if the company <em>didn't</em> use AI, as it would put the firm at a "competitive disadvantage [with] other industry players".</p>

<p>"Certainly, one of the major risks for a company is not to use AI, as this would mean a competitive disadvantage vis-à-vis other industry players," Hedman said. "Most companies will move forward on AI integration in different ways. For us, it is the way that we do this that is the most critical element.</p>
<p>"We do not want to replace people with AI, we want to empower them," Hedman added. "This is the core of our human-centric approach to leveraging the potential with AI.</p>
<p>"It's not just that AI enables our developers to do even more, and to become more efficient on certain tasks, it will also open up coding to a broader group of developers. Entry into the industry might be easier for individuals with disabilities who, for instance, cannot use a keyboard as easily as others."</p>
<p>Hedman also says AI could help "in the creative process" by "identifying inconsistencies in scripts and storytelling", as well as scriptwriting, image creation, idea generation, quality control, "and more".</p>
<p>"As [gaming] models become more human-like, the interaction between players and AI-supported functions will be much more dynamic. If in a game scenario you bargain, AI can remember this the next time. That makes the whole gaming experience much more interesting and lifelike," Hedman added.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alone-in-the-dark-reboot-developer-closed-by-embracer">Pieces Interactive – the developer behind the recent Alone in the Dark reboot – was shut down by Embracer</a>.</p>
<p>The developer's website now reads "thanks for playing with us" and the dates 2007-2024.</p>
<p>The studio is the latest casualty from Embracer, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embattled-publisher-embracer-sells-off-saber-assets-withdraws-from-russia">sold off its Saber assets</a> in March and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/take-two-acquires-borderlands-studio-gearbox-from-embracer-for-460m">Gearbox to Take-Two</a> the same month for $460m. The company also commenced a series of brutal cuts as part of a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-the-human-cost-of-embracers-restructuring-programme">restructuring programme that's seen Embracer's headcount reduced</a> by 4532 employees in the past financial year and shutdown 44 studios closed, cancelling 80 in-development projects.</p>

                <p>According to a new report, a Red Faction sequel was in development at one point before the project was canceled during Embracer's months-long period of layoffs. While this new game in the series was pitched to higher-ups shortly after original Red Faction studio <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/saints-row-studio-volition-shut-down-just-after-30-year-anniversary/1100-6517393/" data-ref-id="1100-6517393">Volition had shut down</a>, developer Fishlabs felt that it had the necessary experience to resurrect the series.</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-embracers-cuts-killed-a-potential-red-faction-sequel-and-gutted-a-promising-studio" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Rock Paper Shotgun</a>, Fishlabs put together an elevator pitch in trailer form to sell Embracer-owned publisher Plaion on the idea. The visual prototype was built in Unreal Engine 5 and the plan was to create a game similar to 2009's Red Faction: Guerrilla, but it was never greenlit and the project was canceled by November 2023. Not long after, Fishlabs studio leadership was reportedly instructed to lay off almost every staff member not involved in an active game project and mass layoffs began soon thereafter.</p>

<p>This wasn't the first time that Embracer had flirted with the Red Faction franchise, as back in 2019, Red Faction: Guerrilla Re-Mars-tered was released by the company. This version of the game had better visuals and even more impressive physics-based destruction. Its 2011 sequel, Red Faction: Armageddon never received the same treatment.</p><p>Overall, Embracer has embarked on a series of drastic cuts lately, partly due to a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/embracer-group-loses-undisclosed-2-billion-deal-amid-challenging-year/1100-6514494/" data-ref-id="1100-6514494">major deal falling through</a>. This was later revealed to have been a pact with <a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/08/14/saudi-arabia-savvy-games-embracer-group" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Saudi Arabia's Savvy Games</a> that fell through, and eventually <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/embracer-canceled-29-games-and-laid-off-1400-people-in-just-the-last-six-months/1100-6521108/" data-ref-id="1100-6521108">29 unannounced games were canceled and 1,400 people lost their jobs</a>. Embracer Group is also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/embracers-name-is-going-away-ceo-denies-its-due-to-backlash-and-controversy/1100-6522930/" data-ref-id="1100-6522930">splitting up into three distinct companies</a> and it has recently discussed its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/embracer-outlines-plans-for-ai-and-acknowledges-potential-risks/1100-6524396/" data-ref-id="1100-6524396">plans to to use artificial intelligence technology</a> to "empower" its employees during the game development process.</p>

</article><p>Ahead of Veilguard, which launches on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC sometime this fall, we highly recommend playing Inquisition as it ties directly into the new game.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/21/dune-awakening-direct-delves-into-character-creation-and-servers/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Funcom has hosted a second Dune: Awakening Direct to reveal more details about its upcoming MMO, set in an alternate history Dune universe. This direct addresses things like the character creation system, how spirituality plays a part in the game, and how the server structure is set up to make Dune: Awakening a seamless MMO experience.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dune: Awakening Direct – Episode 2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sBRo-cotgkQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>“Dune: Awakening” unfolds in an alternate universe where Paul Atreides never existed, and House Atreides survives the attempt to destroy it. This setting grants Funcom the freedom to craft a unique narrative within the Dune universe, empowering players to make characters who can&nbsp; influence the world without Paul overshadowing everything. The war between House Atreides and its enemies does continue on the surface of Arrakis, yet the Emperor has decreed that the Spice must continue to flow without any hindrance.</p>
<p>One of the core mysteries of Dune: Awakening is the disappearance of the Fremen. They have left behind remnants of their society, and their disappearance also leaves a vacuum of power that different factions are trying to fill. It is not confirmed if the Fremen do still exist, or if they have been wiped out completely. The narrative diverges from the original books and movies, as certain characters who would have perished still live, and various factions are advancing their agendas without Paul’s influence.</p>
<p>In Dune: Awakening players will come into contact with different religious and spiritual beliefs, which differ from group to group. This feeds into the overall story of how the various groups and sects clash with each other for dominance of Arrakis. This influences the gameplay as players will experience the mystical trials of the Fremen and explore various belief systems. It’s important to understand that although Paul was on the Messiah’s journey in the original Dune story, the player’s character does not assume the same role of the Messiah.</p>

<p>The character creation screen at the start of Dune: Awakening will present a lot of customisation options to shape your character, though there are presets for those who want to just delve straight into the game. As you would expect from a character creator, you can change your body type, skin tone, hair style, eye colour, eye shape, age, facial hair, and height. Additionally, you ca adjust the thickness of arms and legs, the length of your character’s neck. The creator allows the addition of freckles, scars, tattoos and vitiligo as well.</p>
<p>After sorting the physical appearance of your character, you will determine their past. Choosing where you were born will impact the dialogue options open to you in Dune: Awakening, and also grant a unique emote associated with your birthplace. Following on from birthplace, your character’s caste is chosen, determining where in the strict hierarchy they land. The next choice is confirming who your character’s mentor was, and this grants a starting ability. This does not lock your character into a class or archetype, allowing for experimentation with more abilities as you make progress.</p>
<p>On the MMO aspect, it has been confirmed Dune: Awakening will have multiple servers and players can move between servers. There is an Overland map which connects various sandbox maps together. In the Deep Desert, hundreds of players can explore a map spanning at least 500 square kilometers. Meanwhile, in the social hubs of Arrakeen and Harko Village, the number of players is limited, but there are plenty of activities and vendors to interact with. The Hagga Basin serves as the starting area for a server, accommodating at least 40 players. Players have the option to select their starting Hagga Basin and can coordinate with friends to join the same one.</p>
<p>The Dune Awakening closed beta is currently underway on PC, and you can sign up through the<a href="https://duneawakening.com/"> Dune: Awakening website.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/crash-bandicoot-n-sane-trilogy-sales<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Activision has announced that&nbsp;<em>Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy&nbsp;</em>sales have passed a major milestone almost seven years after the collection's initial release.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://x.com/CrashBandicoot/status/1803820991555965395" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, Activision reveals that the game, which packs in remakes of the first three&nbsp;<em>Crash Bandicoot&nbsp;</em>platformers, has managed to sell 20 million copies since it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/crash-bandicoot-n-sane-trilogy-hitting-shelves-june-30th">launched on June 30th, 2017</a>.</p>
<p>The 20 million figure puts&nbsp;<em>N. Sane Trilogy&nbsp;</em>on a par with massively successful games like&nbsp;<em>Hogwarts Legacy</em> and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-has-shipped-13246-million-units-tears-of-kingdom-sold-almost-20-million"><em>Tears of the Kingdom</em></a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-sales-25-million">just behind titles like&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em></a>, although it's obviously taken&nbsp;<em>Crash&nbsp;</em>longer to achieve its sales figure than it took those two games.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/crash-bandicoot-n.-sane-trilogy-sales-platforming.jpg?itok=Tgokg0UQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/crash-bandicoot-n.-sane-trilogy-sales-platforming.jpg?itok=univXzI- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Crash Bandicoot N.

Sane Trilogy&nbsp;</em>well ahead of its successor (although&nbsp;<em>N. Sane&nbsp;</em>also has a near-three-year headstart).</p>
<p>Schadt's figures also say that&nbsp;<em>Spyro Reignited Trilogy</em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/updated-spyro-dragon-is-back-in-spyro-reignited-trilogy">another collection</a> of three classic PS1 platformers from Toys for Bob, hit 10 million sales, and that game launched just over a year after&nbsp;<em>N. Sane</em>, so it looks like Crash wins this one.</p>
<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy&nbsp;</em>is, it's a collection of the first three mainline&nbsp;<em>Crash Bandicoot&nbsp;</em>platformers, namely&nbsp;<em>Crash Bandicoot</em>,&nbsp;<em>Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Crash Bandicoot: Warped</em>.</p>

            <p>An unannounced Helldivers 2 stratagem has leaked online, seemingly by a Sony email.</p>
<p>The unforced error – which came via an official marketing email sent out to Helldivers – proudly introduces the Airburst Rocket Launcher players unlocked after they successfully liberated Penta during Operation Legitimate Undertaking.</p>
<p>There's just one problem; the weapon in the image that accompanies the email isn't the Airburst… or, indeed, any weapon currently in the game. It's a gun no Helldiver has seen before.</p>

<p>Without spoiling it further here, the weapon doesn't yet exist in-game, leading many people to believe it's either a planned sneaky tease of what's to come, or a mistake. I'll leave you to decide which.</p>

<span data-position="1"></span></p><p>It's the latest in a litany of errors from Sony, starting with the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-steam-players-will-soon-need-to-link-a-psn-account-and-they-arent-happy">infamous PSN debacle that kicked off earlier this year</a>. At the start of May, Helldivers 2 publisher Sony announced players on Steam would soon be required to link a PlayStation Network (PSN) account to keep playing. This not only resulted in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2s-positive-steam-score-tumbles-as-pc-players-hit-back-at-sonys-psn-requirements">swathes of negative reviews from a very disappointed community</a>, but the game was also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-has-been-pulled-from-sale-in-177-countries-as-its-psn-linking-requirement-rolls-out">pulled from sale in 177 countries where PSN was not available</a>, forcing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-overturns-helldivers-2-psn-requirement-following-backlash">Sony to backtrack on its plans</a>.</p>
<p>Perhaps as a consequence of this, Helldivers 2 – which is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-now-playstations-fastest-selling-game-ever">PlayStation's fastest-selling game ever</a> – has recently seen its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-sees-huge-drop-in-player-numbers-since-release">player numbers decline</a>. A look at the game's Steam charts shows a steady drop since February, when the game launched. According to SteamDB, at its peak in February shortly after launch, there were 458,709 concurrent players. In the last 24-hours, the game had a peak of 53.5K players.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-developer-donates-to-save-the-children-because-players-saved-the-children-in-game-too">Helldivers 2 developer Arrowhead Game Studios recently donated $4311 (£3397) to the Save the Children charity</a> after Helldivers chose morality over manslaughter earlier this week.</p>

            <p>A Polish developer has come under fire for expecting employees to agree to mandatory sauna sessions.</p>
<p>In a now viral LinkedIn exchange, Spectrum Studio creative director Jacek Piórkowski approached narrative designer and writer Aleksandra Wolna about working for his studio. Wolna replied to state Piórkowski had previously approached her about a job, and she had declined as it required her to agree to mandatory and reportedly naked sauna sessions.</p>
<p>"Jacek started a conversation with me under a post about me looking for a job. I did my research on him and his studio and politely declined because of the sauna thing," Wolna told Eurogamer. "I later posted about the situation about All In Games employees that weren't getting paid and are now looking for a job, since I am also owed a lot of money by this company. Suddenly, Jacek appeared offering me a job again."</p>

</figure>
<p>"I reminded him that I declined and told him why, which can be seen on those viral screenshots," Wolna continued. "Jacek then started to convince me and others that there is nothing wrong with what he's expecting of his employees."</p>
<p><a href="https://cdaction.pl/publicystyka/they-werent-paid-but-fired-and-lied-to-ironbird-creations-employee-drama-and-the-crisis-at-all-in-ga">Reportedly</a>, publisher All In Games hasn't paid its employees for half a year, as a result of its "temporary" financial crisis.</p>
<p>Piórkowski has amended a number of his comments on LinkedIn in the time since his initial post to Wolna, but still defends the decision to ask employees to participate in sauna sessions, stating the requirement is in place because it is what the studio's game is about. "I don't want to waste my time to explain what's the difference between Ruska Bania or Dry Sauna. You have to feel it," <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7207509477401538560?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28activity%3A7207509477401538560%2C7207699590786015232%29&amp;replyUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28activity%3A7207509477401538560%2C7207797666909499392%29&amp;dashCommentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A%287207699590786015232%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7207509477401538560%29&amp;dashReplyUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A%287207797666909499392%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7207509477401538560%29">Piórkowski</a> wrote.</p>

<p>"Spectrum Studio is working on new groundbreaking game: mix of Life is Strange (Narrative), Final Fantasy (story, characters), Heart of Darkness (adventure levels with dog), The Turyst (exploration and questing) and THPS2 (tricks and specials).</p>
<p>"Main character will be saunamaster and will be in charge of performing in various saunas (smells, music, choreography, everything)."</p>
<p>The studio then lists the position's requirements, and it is here mandatory sauna sessions are specified (there is no mention of nudity here). Spectrum Studio also said it would provide "plannings in sauna, free of charge" within this post.</p>

The developer said the "wetness" level inside certain saunas can get very high, and if someone was using a towel it "may result with fungal infection", which is why there are times participants are recommended to go in nude.</p>

This is something, Piórkowski said, he would not do. "One needs to understand [the] assignment and that one is very specific..." he wrote. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7207509477401538560?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28activity%3A7207509477401538560%2C7207699590786015232%29&amp;replyUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28activity%3A7207509477401538560%2C7207892925576364032%29&amp;dashCommentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A%287207699590786015232%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7207509477401538560%29&amp;dashReplyUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A%287207892925576364032%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7207509477401538560%29">Wolna</a> pointed out there is a big difference between making sure a candidate is suitable for any given job and an employer expecting its staff to be naked during work-related activities.</p>
<p>"You had a lot of time to prove me wrong. To write [a] scene in [a] sauna without being in sauna... Instead, we are wasting time on social media," <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7207509477401538560?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28activity%3A7207509477401538560%2C7207699590786015232%29&amp;replyUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28activity%3A7207509477401538560%2C7207898372312076288%29&amp;dashCommentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A%287207699590786015232%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7207509477401538560%29&amp;dashReplyUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A%287207898372312076288%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7207509477401538560%29">Piorkowski</a> replied. "My Narrative girls had to go to [the] sauna with me to come up with [an] amazing script for proof of concept... Technically, it's possible to do it without it, but I absolutely adore the fact that they could use their sauna experience to write awesome scenes."</p>
<p>Piórkowski has now released a full statement regarding Spectrum Studio's sauna mandate. In a video shared on the studio's <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/spectrum-studios-games/">LinkedIn</a> page, he apologised to Wolna. "I didn't intend to embarrass, hurt, offend, or show disrespect towards Ms Wolna. My choice of words was bad. I didn't state my intentions clearly. I didn't explain why taking a sauna is so important and practically essential for me," he said (thank you to Magdalena Kluj for translating).</p>
<p>"I wasn't expecting that it would be received as pretentious and cause negative connotations." He noted his use of "narrative girls" was wrong, and meant only to convey the narrative team at that time was all female.</p>
<p>Piórkowski further spoke of how "passionate" he is about the sauna experience. "In recruiting, I took an iron rule about talking saunas and people's openness to this experience," he stated. "I am looking for people equally passionate about the culture of taking saunas and open to experiences that are part of that culture. I believe that personal experience of a subject helps with understanding the sauna culture."</p>
<p>Piórkowski continued: "I agree that the words I chose could be perceived that it was encouraging to take a sauna session with the company boss; it was not my intention. I proposed and am still proposing candidates to [experience] the sauna session female only and male only, as long it reflects the real sauna experience."</p>
<p>Piórkowski said he will be "more careful with the choice of [his] words in the future to avoid embarrassment and doubts about [his] intentions". He stated he has also started "consulting with an HR specialist regarding this case".</p>
<p>"Once again, I'd like to apologise to Miss Aleksandra," he concluded.</p>
<p>Reflecting on this ordeal, Wolna told Eurogamer she is "a bit regretful that this is the only thing that went viral, while it all started with a post mentioning the recent situation with All In Games employees not getting paid". However, she is "glad the sauna man got called out and the situation started an important discussion about awful recruitment practices". Wolna said she has accepted the apology.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/zelda/24182328/zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-design-change<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="fOxTrA">The biggest shock of Tuesday’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24180883/legend-of-zelda-echoes-wisdom-nintendo-switch-release-date"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em></a> reveal was, of course, that Princess Zelda <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24181064/legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-nintendo-switch-princess-peach">will be the playable protagonist</a>. The second-biggest shock was that the game exists at all, and that it’s coming out <em>in three months</em>.</p>
<p id="3zwV42">The third-biggest shock took a little longer to register for me, but it’s possibly an even bigger deal: <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em> is a clear indication that Nintendo has turned its back on what you might call traditional Zelda game design for good.</p>
<p id="UR3Ucf">Tradition is deeply important to the Legend of Zelda series. This sequence of games has, over the course of 38 Earth years (and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/zelda/23618362/zelda-timeline-where-what-is-breath-of-the-wild-botw-2-tears-of-the-kingdom-imprisoning-war">millennia on Hyrule</a>), essentially told and retold the same story over and over again. Similarly, its game design has morphed and shifted within strict limits as it observed the time-worn rituals of Zelda.</p>
<p id="oXIqD0">For decades, each game would open up in a gradual, nonlinear, but carefully prescribed way, as the player unlocks new tools that fit like keys into the map’s many locks and uses them to find the solutions to intricate puzzles. In the first review of a Zelda game that I wrote — I think it was for <em>The Minish Cap</em>, in 2004 — I described the games as “clockwork fairy tales,” meaning they worked like beautiful, precision pieces of machinery that the player could slot themselves into. And they stayed that way — until 2017.</p>

<p id="dnXUQm"><em>Breath of the Wild </em>tore up the Zelda rulebook. It gave players all the most important tools at the start of the game and let them explore the map in any direction, tackling its challenges in any order. Through systems like weapon durability, weather, stamina, and cooking, it also added a lot of variables that would keep players on their toes and encourage improvisation.</p>
<p id="LoOczL">Then 2023’s <em>Tears of the Kingdom </em>turbocharged this approach with a handful of abilities that seemed conceived less to disrupt the game design than to break it completely. Ultrahand lets players build their own furniture, buildings, vehicles, and powered contraptions. Fuse splices almost every single object in the game into the weapons system. Rewind lets players send individual objects backward in time. And Ascend — which <a href="https://www.polygon.com/legend-zelda-tears-kingdom/23720221/zelda-totk-tears-kingdom-interview-ascend-ability-botw-2">started life as a debug tool for developers</a> — is almost a literal cheat, a traversal get-out-of-jail-free card.</p>
<p id="TwMtyo">With these two open-world games, <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> especially, series producer Eiji Aonuma and his team shifted the paradigm of Zelda design toward open-endedness and player creativity (<a href="https://www.polygon.com/legend-zelda-tears-kingdom/24003308/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-totk-devs-mario-maker">up to a point</a>). These games were enormously popular, but — perhaps because of the accumulated cultural weight of the first three decades of Zelda games — I assumed traditional Zelda would live on beside this new strain, probably in smaller-scale titles harking back to the series’ 2D roots.</p>
<div id="c5tDV8"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/94RTrH2erPE?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="kYlnrx">It seems not. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94RTrH2erPE">Introducing <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em></a> in a video, Aonuma laid it on the line: “Here, we wanted to create a new gameplay style that breaks conventions seen in past Legend of Zelda games with a top-down perspective,” he said. Nintendo is not done messing with its beloved franchise — or rather, letting players mess with it, and challenging its designers to keep up with them.</p>
<p id="ibjivb">In the game, Princess Zelda can <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24181059/legend-of-zelda-echoes-wisdom-why-no-sword-gameplay-nintendo-link">use a magic staff</a> called the Tri Rod to create copies of objects, and even monsters, called Echoes. She can build stairs out of bed frames, summon Moblins to fight for her, or create freestanding columns of water. In the video, Aonuma pointed out the way battles or puzzle solutions play out will vary greatly from player to player depending on the Echoes they use. The Echo ability is Princess Zelda’s Ultrahand; just as in <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>, the ability to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/legend-zelda-tears-kingdom/23723279/totk-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-bridge-totk">brute-force the game’s challenges</a>, or step outside the usual Zelda ruleset to bypass them, is baked into the game design, and part of the fun.</p>
<p id="YNa8zd"><em>Echoes of Wisdom</em> will be the first brand-new Zelda game to come out since Link’s open-world adventures shook the series up. Visually, it looks just like the 2019 remake of the 1993 classic <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2019/9/19/20870437/zelda-links-awakening-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Link’s Awakening</em></a>, but in design terms it feels like it belongs to this different, newer breed of Zelda games. Embracing creativity and player freedom now appears to be a core tenet of the series. Aonuma’s quiet revolution continues; Zelda will never be the same again. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/minecraft-arrives-on-playstation-5-with-preview-version/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>In a new <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-playstation-5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official blog post</a>, Mojang Studios confirmed that a preview is available today for a native version of Minecraft on PlayStation 5.</p>



<p>Players who own the PlayStation 4 version of Minecraft can access the new preview on their PlayStation 5 via “Settings” and “Preview” in-game. </p>



<p>The preview includes the Tricky Trials Update, and it supports multiplayer for PlayStation 4 and 5 consoles. This early version also features cross-play on Realms. Players with a subscription can create a separate preview realm that doesn’t affect their normal creations.</p>



<p>Mojang does warn that preview builds “will likely be unstable,” and invited feedback from fans. Also, the preview version does not have access to the Minecraft Store.</p>



<p>Mojang elaborated on the decision to make a PlayStation 5 version of Minecraft. The devs explained that a native PS5 version will naturally allow the game to “run more effectively on the PS5’s hardware.”</p>



<p>Minecraft Legends just <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/minecraft-legends-is-ending-new-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ended new content</a> last January, but the core Minecraft game continues to thrive. In fact, Netflix announced last month that a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/netflix-announces-animated-minecraft-series-is-coming-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Minecraft animated series</a> is “coming soon.” This is in addition to the Minecraft film adaptation, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/jack-black-minecraft-movie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jack Black attached</a> to play Steve.</p>



<p>PlayStation recently held a lengthy <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-state-of-play-may-2024-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">State of Play showcase</a>, teasing a variety of titles like Monster Hunter Wilds and a PC version of God of War Ragnarok.</p>

                <p>It'll probably be a while before we see Aloy back in action inside of a new Horizon game, but for now, you can keep her adventurous spirit close by with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09ZY79YXG?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">this adorable Nendoroid figure, which is currently on sale for just under $50</a> (was $65).

                <p>If you follow Hideo Kojima on social media, then you know the legendary game director is quite a big cinephile--and that includes a soft spot for the Paddington franchise. Apparently, the feeling is mutual, as the little Peruvian bear has offered to dine with Kojima over a marmalade sandwich.</p><p>The interaction came after Kojima posted a video of himself opening a promotional package for the upcoming Paddington in Peru movie, which contained a number of goodies--including a jar of Paddington's famous marmalade.</p><p>Marmalade sandwiches, of course, contain all the vitamins and minerals a bear needs for the whole day, though it's unclear if this will be enough sustenance for a 60-year-old human man currently working on multiple video games.</p><p>Though he's best known for being very polite and taking things very literally, Paddington has also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyHuq8uk6Ko" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dabbled in tactical operations</a>. This has helped him to put away some of England's most notorious criminals.</p><p>For his next adventure, Paddington is headed back to Peru in the appropriately titled Paddington in Peru. The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/first-paddington-in-peru-trailer-has-danger-excitement-and-marmalade-sandwiches/1100-6524193/" data-ref-id="1100-6524193">first trailer</a> dropped for the film recently, showing the bear and his adopted family, the Browns, traveling to his birthplace to search for Aunt Lucy. </p><p>Hideo Kojima is currently working on Death Stranding 2: On The Beach, as well as the horror game OD and the espionage game Physint. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamesindustry.biz/in-the-switchs-eighth-year-nintendo-can-still-surprise-opinion<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>It's almost a truism at this point, but there is arguably no company in the games industry that protects its secrecy quite as closely or as well as Nintendo.</p>
<p>Its tight control over information about its upcoming products rarely slips, and any third-party studio that has ever worked on a Nintendo property can vouch for how seriously the company takes information control and leak prevention.</p>
<p>The results are hard to disagree with; it's striking that the Nintendo Direct showcase which just wrapped up the nebulous (but very enjoyable) not-E3 season was <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/metroid-prime-4-and-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-headline-nintendo-direct">filled with major reveals about which we had had no prior inkling</a>.</p>
<p>Other companies do sometimes manage to pull off genuine surprises, but it's nonetheless common for showcase events to descend into exercises in ticking off rumoured and leaked products.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/mario-luigi-white-background.png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Nintendo's preference for tight control of information does, however, sometimes cross over into feeling like a parody of itself. The company's statements thus far about the successor console to the Switch have been a masterclass in saying nothing at all.</p>
<p>Pretty much the only things we know about the console (from the horse's mouth, at least) are that it will use Nintendo Accounts, as expected, and that it will be officially <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/nintendo-breaks-silence-on-switch-2-promises-announcement-by-april-2025">announced sometime before March 31, 2025</a>.</p>
<p>From any other company, such exaggerated secrecy would seem a little ridiculous; we're so used to it from Nintendo that it actually feels like a major concession that the company has acknowledged the existence of a Switch successor at all.</p>
<p>One side-effect of all this secrecy is that rumours and leaks about Nintendo products tend to be especially widely reported. That can cause problems when those reports are inaccurate or, as seems to have happened repeatedly with the Switch successor, when Nintendo's internal plans change without any acknowledgement from the company itself.</p>
<p>Beyond the rumours and leaks, though, a little cottage industry has also sprung up in what effectively amounts to Nintendo Kremlinology, interpreting the signs and symbols in the firm's statements and decisions to try to understand what it is planning.</p>
<p>I'm going to engage here in a bit of unapologetic Nintendology, because while the Nintendo Direct showcase we just saw was a masterclass in saying precisely nothing about the thing people most want to hear about, it was also a deeply impressive line-up of software, and that in itself tells us something about how Nintendo sees its strategy developing in the next couple of years.</p>
<p>I don't know that anyone expected Nintendo to bring their A-game to the summer showcase to this extent. Most people have viewed 2024 as the quiet year when we count down to the Switch successor, with Nintendo's major teams presumably beavering away on games for that device. Unveiling new Mario, Zelda, and Metroid titles at this event was not on most people's bingo card.</p>
<p>The conventional logic was wrong, then, but it wasn't unreasonable! Ordinarily, you'd expect a platform holder in this position – with its flagship console now in its eighth year on the market, and successor hardware waiting in the wings – to be keeping most of its powder dry for the unveiling of that new hardware. It's important, after all, to have a strong software line-up in the launch window.</p>
<blockquote><p>I'm not sure anyone expected that the long-term support for the Switch would extend to having new Mario and Zelda in production</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You want to wow people with all the games you're making available early in the lifespan of the new device, convincing them that it's worth the investment at the launch price. A new platform trades on a heady mix of optimism for the future, and FOMO. After all, the marketing tells you, look at all the great games you'd be missing out on if you didn't buy the new hardware!</p>
<p>At least, that's the conventional, traditional logic for how the console industry works.</p>
<p>In recent years it has been changed somewhat by the lengthening of "long tail" sales of older consoles, the focus on backwards compatibility, and the introduction of cross-generation flagship titles.</p>
<p>None of those things are all that new to Nintendo, though. It has always been willing to bend and flex the logic of console launches, far before its rivals started to do so. Cross-generation launches may be a relatively new thing for the other platform holders, but Nintendo has made them into a central pillar of its launch strategy since the GameCube transitioned into the Wii.</p>
<p>There's almost always a major title at the launch of a new Nintendo platform that's also available on the prior platform. It plays just fine on the old hardware, but the marketing can still tap into that potent FOMO – after all, wouldn't you like to experience it on the shiny new console?</p>
<p>You don't have to look far online to see people speculating that we've already seen one such game – doesn't Metroid Prime 4 look rather ambitious for a Switch game? Wouldn't it really shine on some upgraded hardware? It's not an unreasonable assumption.</p>
<p>The timeline fits; Metroid is a 2025 title, and all signs from Nintendo thus far suggest that it's serious about pushing the "We'll talk about the Switch successor within this financial year" line as close to that March 31 deadline as it can, meaning that it will not launch new hardware until the Switch has seen out its eighth birthday next March.</p>
<p>For a relatively graphically intensive game like Metroid Prime 4, a cross-generation launch in that timeframe would make perfect sense, although it will be very interesting to see whether that takes the form of multiple SKUs (one for the Switch, one for the successor), or a single SKU optimised for both platforms, along the lines of the Smart Delivery system for the Xbox.</p>
<p>Much of what we saw in the Nintendo Direct showcase, however, is due sooner, and very clearly targeting the current console, with no cross-generation shenanigans in evidence. That makes for a strong line-up for a console in its latter years, and a pretty solid riposte to people (myself included) who assumed Tears of the Kingdom to be the swansong title for the Switch.</p>
<p>Nintendo was never going to abandon the Switch suddenly – not with that enormous installed base still hungry for new software – but I'm not sure anyone expected that the long-term support for the device would extend to having new Mario and Zelda titles in production for the console.</p>

</figure>
<p>All of this is additional grist to the Nintendology question of the past couple of years: how is the successor to the Switch going to be branded, and how is its launch going to be presented to the public?</p>
<p>Cross-generational launches for major titles are a given, but keeping up such a strong pipeline of software for the original Switch even while ramping up to launch the new device suggests that Nintendo's aim is likely to be continuity rather than revolution.</p>
<p>Whatever it is launching is meant to take on the mantle of the Switch rather than replacing it entirely, and the strong Switch software pipeline will just amount to more good games on the shelf that play nicely on its successor device as well.</p>
<p>That fits with what little we know thus far, which suggests that the console is quite a direct successor in terms of hardware and form factor, which, if true, is a little unusual for Nintendo.</p>
<p>"Switch 2" is the obvious branding for such a device – highlighting compatibility while eliminating confusion about whether it's a genuine successor, as opposed to an add-on or a "Pro" model – but Nintendo often seems allergic to such obvious branding, and there remains a strong possibility of a left-field name.</p>
<p>One major question which could have an effect on the branding of the new device is whether Nintendo intends to continue selling the original Switch (perhaps at a lower price point or in a more kid-friendly form factor along the lines of the Switch Lite) alongside the new generation for a significant period. That decision may not entirely be in Nintendo's hands, of course; the ability to do so could be limited by chip supply if production lines for the decade-old Tegra X1 SOCs that power the Switch are shut down.</p>
<p>What Nintendo is likely to attempt with this launch is a combination of things it's done before – backwards compatibility, significant software overlap for the initial launch period, encouraging long tail sales of the existing console – with a high degree of platform continuity both in hardware and in branding. This is new ground for Nintendo to some extent, but it's not without some historical parallels.</p>
<blockquote><p>Keeping up such a strong pipeline of software for the original Switch even while ramping up to launch the new device suggests that Nintendo's aim is likely to be continuity rather than revolution</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The DS to 3DS transition was similarly about trying to create a device with an identity of its own that could nonetheless assume the mantle of its successful predecessor, and despite a rocky start (and the core 3D feature ultimately being ignored as a gimmick), it did work pretty well in the end.</p>
<p>The Wii to Wii U transition had the same objectives, and paired a rocky start with a rocky middle and an abrupt end, so that's exactly the example Nintendo wants to avoid – and is also why so many people are wondering what the "Switch 2" will actually be called, since the consensus in the years since the Wii U launch has been that the branding of the console massively confused many consumers and contributed heavily to its commercial failure.</p>
<p>Nintendo is coming off one of the most successful eras it has ever had – you can see why they're so loath to let go of the Switch and move on to its successor, but this hardware transition has to happen, and getting it right is crucial for the company's success in the coming years.</p>
<p>It's a tricky balancing act, maintaining an existing platform with a huge installed base while launching a successor that you want to position as an extension of the brand, and there's a great deal at stake in getting it right.</p>
<p>On the plus side, the one thing unequivocally confirmed by the summer Nintendo Direct is arguably one of the most important aspects – Nintendo's software pipeline is still in robust shape, still more than capable of serving up delightful surprises and getting the company's consumers excited for what's next.</p>
<p>That hasn't always been enough to deliver commercial success for the company – but as Nintendo gears up to the challenge of the coming year, it's an excellent starting point, at least.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/06/21/minecraft-is-finally-getting-a-native-ps5-version<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Developer Mojang has revealed that a native version of Minecraft is finally coming to PlayStation 5. It's currently in a testing phase, but if you own the PlayStation 4 version of the game for your PS5, you can take part in the preview right now.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Though Minecraft has been playable on PS5 for years, it's always been the PS4 version; this native version, however, is a new build of Minecraft made specifically for PS5, which means it will theoretically perform better on the console.&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RxWJJEKLoMA" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>"Currently, however, the only way to play Minecraft on a PlayStation 5 is by purchasing the PlayStation 4 version of the game," the <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-playstation-5">announcement</a> reads. "By developing a native version of Minecraft for PS5, we'll be able to make the game run more effectively on the PS5's hardware."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Though Mojang hasn't revealed how long the Minecraft PS5 version preview will last, all are welcome to take part in it, so long as they own the PS4 version of the game. To access it, go to "Settings" on your PS4 version of Minecraft while playing on a PS5 and select "Preview." This preview includes the new Tricky Trials update, so you can venture into the trial chambers, meet a breeze, craft a mace, and more.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mojang asks that players who encounter bugs during this preview report it to the developer, and more generally, provide any feedback they might have.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Over the course of the roughly 37-minute showcase, Limited Run revealed its intention to revive games from franchises like&nbsp;<em>Gex</em>,&nbsp;<em>Tomba!</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Fighting Force</em>, and we also got a new look at upcoming titles like&nbsp;<em>Rugrats: Adventures in Gameland&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Clock Tower: Rewind</em>.</p>
<p>The show also saw Ubisoft finally unveiling&nbsp;<em>Beyond Good and Evil: 20th Anniversary Edition</em>, which was probably one of the company's worst-kept secrets prior to the reveal. It's landing on June 25th across PC and consoles. Sadly no news on the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/beyond-good-and-evil-2-lead-michel-ancel-leaves-video-games">still-AWOL&nbsp;<em>Beyond Good and Evil 2</em></a>, though.</p>

The former is coming to PC, PlayStation, and Switch on August 1st, while the second doesn't have a release date yet.</p>
<p>Those two games were far from the only fifth-generation strings to Limited Run's bow, however.&nbsp;<em>Fighting Force Collection&nbsp;</em>will include Core Design's two&nbsp;<em>Fighting Force&nbsp;</em>games and is coming to PC, PlayStation, and Switch in 2025, as is a Carbon Engine version of&nbsp;<em>Fear Effect</em>.</p>
<p>Of course, we also finally got confirmation that a long-missed hero of gaming is making a triumphant return. That's right:&nbsp;<em>Gex Trilogy&nbsp;</em>is coming to PC and consoles, and it includes the first (and only) three&nbsp;<em>Gex&nbsp;</em>games.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/limited-run-games-showcase-gex.jpg?itok=gCQ3T_ta 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/limited-run-games-showcase-gex.jpg?itok=HxyILOMt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Finally, the hero returns.</figcaption></figure><p>The showcase concluded with the announcement of&nbsp;<em>Bubsy In: The Purrfect Collection</em>, which includes several remastered&nbsp;<em>Bubsy&nbsp;</em>games (including the much-maligned&nbsp;<em>Bubsy 3D</em>) as well as interviews and artifacts from the troubled mascot's history.</p>
<p>It's well worth checking out the full Limited Run Games showcase to see everything else the company announced. Though Limited Run has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/limited-run-games-3do-releases-controversy">not been without</a> its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/limited-run-games-fires-community-manager-over-transphobic-tweets">fair share of controversy</a> over the years, these efforts to preserve gaming ephemera should be celebrated.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamesindustry.biz/xboxs-matt-booty-suggests-leadership-change-was-a-factor-in-tango-gameworks-closure<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        

        <p>Exec confirms Hi-Fi Rush "did well for us" but factors behind previous success "may not all still be in place"</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Xbox executive Matt Booty has offered more insight into the platform holder's decision to close Tango Gameworks, suggesting the studio's recent change of leadership was a key factor.</p>
<p>Speaking on <a href="https://variety.com/2024/gaming/news/xbox-studios-matt-booty-podast-game-pass-fallout-studio-closures-1236038120/">Variety's Strictly Business podcast</a>, spotted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/matt-booty-implies-tango-gameworks-closure-was-partly-due-to-leadership-change">Eurogamer</a>, the head of Xbox Game Studios was asked whether Microsoft sought another buyer before closing the Japan-based developer.</p>
<p>Booty declined to share the "nitty gritty details" out of respect for the people affected by the studio's closure, but did note that "a lot of work went into delivering Hi-Fi Rush," which he described as a "great game" that "did well for us."</p>
<p>"I think the thing to be considered is that for us, it's as much a forward-looking situation as much as it is looking back at one certain game... There are a lot of things that go into success for a game," he said.</p>
<p>"What leadership do you have? What creative leadership do you have? Is the team the same team that shipped something successful previously?</p>
<p>"And we have to look at all of those things together and then ask ourselves, are we set up for success going forward? And while there may have been factors and situations that previously led to success, they may not all still be in place as you look at what you're doing going forward."</p>
<p>His comments seem to refer to the leadership changes at Tango Gameworks over the past year, following the <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/tango-gameworks-founder-shinji-mikami-to-leave-the-studio">departure of studio founder Shinji Mikami</a> in 2023.</p>
<p>Tango Gameworks was one of <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/xbox-reportedly-shutting-down-four-bethesda-studios">four ZeniMax-owned studios that Microsoft closed in May</a>, alongside Redfall developer Arkane Austin, Mighty Doom maker Alpha Dog Studios, and Roundhouse Games.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/phil-spencer-on-studio-closures-i-have-to-run-a-sustainable-business">Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer was also questioned</a> about the reasons for these closures on stage at IGN Live last month, who said that "hard decisions" needed to be made "to run a sustainable business."</p>

			<p>Mecha games have an easy path into my favourite games list, whatever form they might take. Whether it’s an emotional, non-linear narrative like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/09/15/13-sentinels-aegis-rim-review-ps4/">13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim</a>, or a Gundam game packed with smooth combat and an overwhelming amount of customisation like Gundam Breaker 3, or an addictive high-octane competitive combat like Mobile Suit Gundam Extreme VS. Maxiboost On, I’m totally in.&nbsp;So when I heard that Level 5 had released a game that combines all of those qualities called Megaton Musashi W: Wired, I was foaming at the mouth to check it out.</p>
<p><iframe title="MEGATON MUSASHI W: WIRED – OP “MUSASHI English Ver.”" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CXVebBlsb2E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Now, this isn’t technically the grand debut of Megaton Musashi W: Wired. The series kicked off a few years ago with what was originally a Japan-exclusive premium game, which was followed by an alternative free-to-play version that saw seasonal content updates, famous anime robot DLC add-ons, and collabs with Yokai Watch and Hololive vtubers. Alongside those games, a two-season anime version of Megaton Musashi aired globally. Yet despite the anime being available in English, it isn’t until now and this third iteration of the game that overseas fans can experience the mecha action for themselves.</p>


<p>Knowing that this was, at one time, a free-to-play game, I expected there to be a light focus on story and a heavy emphasis on repeatable, grindathon missions. Instead, I was pleasantly surprised to see that Megaton Musashi W: Wired mirrors the slow, peaceful pacing and character-focused interactions of 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim. Before you set off on combat missions to defend the last bastion of humanity from giant aliens using your rogue Musashi mech, you’ll spend a lot of time wandering around the city, checking in on rivals, companions, mysterious figures and innocent neighbourhood denizens. Just as much of the game is about talking to people and investigating the overarching mysteries of your place in a constantly growing sci-fi conspiracy. As you do so, you’ll fill up a robot-shaped meter at the bottom of the screen, and once it’s full, it’s time for you to head out to a major story-related battle or boss fight.</p>


<p>Admittedly, I was frustrated at first by how infrequently these combat encounters happened because of how the first few hours of the game focus so much on story and info-dumping. That frustration only stemmed from the fact that combat is so much fun. Combos are smooth and impactful, your Musashi mech flies across the combat arena gracefully, and after just one battle you can immediately get a sense for the full potential of how deep this game’s combat can go. Eventually, thankfully, you’re permitted to explore those depths and combat is a more frequent occurrence as you get further into the game, especially as you unlock bonus missions and multiplayer encounters that can be infinitely repeated.</p>
<p>Plus, as you get further into Megaton Musashi W: Wired, the massive breadth of customisation options fully exposes itself to you. There’s fun flashy stuff, like the dozens of unique equippable arms, legs, chest, and head pieces for your mecha. You’ve also got multiple base melee and ranged weapon types, and within each type there are a bunch of unique variations.</p>

<p>It’s easy to fall into a favored build and strategy for your robot, whether it’s running battles close and fast with a shotgun and knuckles or keeping things focused on aerial maneuvers and long-distance gun-fire. Equippable modifiers and a daunting motherboard customization menu let you steer your build even further into perfection. If the depth of customisation puts you off or overwhelms you, you can automatically optimise your mech based on specified parameters so that you can have the best version of your bot without having to learn what every stat and piece of gear means.</p>
<p>By the time the full scope of Megaton Musashi W: Wired revealed itself to me, I was hooked. I fell into that hole of mecha action and sci-fi intrigue happily, and came out of it feeling like I had experienced the ultimate mashup of all my favorite mecha games. It’s slow to start, but once things get in gear, you’ll be hard pressed to put this game down at all.</p>

            <p>Crash Bandicoot's N. Sane Trilogy - which comprises the remasters of the first Crash Bandicoot, as well as Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back and Crash Bandicoot: Warped - has certainly not crashed and burned.</p>
<p>Last night, the Crash Bandicoot team revealed that the trilogy has now sold through 20m copies worldwide. "Whoa! Thank you to our community of Crash players for this memorable milestone," the team wrote on social media platform X. </p>
<p>To celebrate, a number of Crash Bandicoot games are now on sale on PlayStation, with deals running until 3rd July. For example, you can currently scoop up the <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/EP0002-CUSA23470_00-CRASH2021BDL0002">Crash Bandicoot - Crashiversary Bundle</a> for £43.99. It usually retails at £110.</p>

<p>The N. Sane collection of remastered Crash Bandicoot games initially launched back in 2017 on PlayStation 4. It went on to do incredibly well for itself on release. In fact, on its debut in July of 2017, it became the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/crash-bandicoot-n-sane-trilogy-biggest-single-platform-launch-of-the-year">biggest single-platform release of the year</a> - beating even Horizon: Zero Dawn.</p>
<p>After a stint as a PS4 exclusive, it arrived on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2018-crash-bandicoot-nsane-trilogy-face-off">Xbox One, PC and Switch the following year</a>.</p> <div>

<p>Our Donlan went <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-crash-bandicoot-n-sane-trilogy-is-nostalgia-done-right-and-that-includes-the-irritations">hands- on with the Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy</a> on its release in 2017, and said it was "nostalgia done right - and that includes the irritations".</p>
<p>"I don't think these will ever be first-tier platformers - compared to what other developers were doing back at the same time, even the best Crash level feels a little shapeless and lacking in imagination - but they're clearly great memories," he wrote. "And the N. Sane Trilogy delivers the memories intact."</p>

			<p>German developer ION LANDS and publisher 505 Games announced a delay for Nivalis, a cyberpunk life simulation game set in the same world as 2020's <a href="https://wccftech.com/video-games-coming-out-april-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cloudpunk</a>.</p>
<p>Nivalis was first announced in 2022. The following year, we learned of a 2024 release window. However, ION LANDS has now set the launch for Spring 2025, citing the desire to provide the best possible experience.</p>
<p>Here's what you can expect in this peculiar game:</p>
<p><em>Making it in this cyberpunk city isn’t easy. The gangs want to harvest your organs, the Corps will fine you for breathing, and the whole time, the ground under your feet is crumbling. This city could fall into the ocean tomorrow, so you better make your fortune today. You’ve got to start small: a food stall, a noodle stand, a stim store. Build your way up to a bar, a restaurant, or even a nightclub. </em></p>
<p><em>In Nivalis, you choose how to spend your time in the city. In this unique slice-of-life sim with realistic weather simulation and night and day cycles, you can grow your business, meet strange and diverse characters, form friendships, and experience the danger and wonder of this cyberpunk voxel city.</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Experience&nbsp;your&nbsp;simulated life in Nivalis, and choose how you spend your time each day.</em></li>
<li><em>Manage businesses like restaurants, ramen stands or night clubs.</em></li>
<li><em>Buy or grow your own ingredients.</em></li>
<li><em>Explore the city with your own boat and go fishing.</em></li>
<li><em>Decorate your home or buy and customise a new one.</em></li>
<li><em>Discover the stories of the people you meet in the city, your friends, your customers, and maybe even find love.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Nivalis will be released for PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1488490/Nivalis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/nivalis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>. There's no mention of a console release in the press release. However, Cloudpunk eventually launched on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch. It's likely the same will happen in this case, too.</p>

FromSoftware's highly anticipated expansion doesn't have PlayStation Trophies or Steam or Xbox Achievements.</p><p>The downloadable content, which adds a wealth of new content to beloved role-playing game Elden Ring, is available today, June 21, 2024, and some fans are surprised to see that, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-long-is-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree">despite its roughly 25 hours of additional exploration and bosses</a>, Shadow of the Erdtree doesn't feature a new set of Trophies or Achievements.</p><p>Releasing an additional set of digital rewards is the norm for big DLC expansions. The DLC for Fallout 4, Horizon: Forbidden West, God of War: Ragnarok, Halo: Infinite, The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim, and many more all had additional Trophies or Achievements, for example.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree DLC Review Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Even <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/23/bloodborne-the-old-hunters-review">The Old Hunters DLC for FromSoftware's Bloodborne</a> had additional Trophies, providing an additional reward for players who beat its myriad bosses and acquiring the fancy (horrifying) new weapons. The inclusion of Trophies here may have been related to its PlayStation exclusivity, however, as FromSoftware hasn't included them in its other DLCs for the likes of Dark Souls and Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice.</p><p>The same is true for Shadow of the Erdtree, meaning those who enjoy Trophy and Achievement-hunting will need to find their own fun in the expansion. That shouldn't be too hard, of course, as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-review">IGN awarded it a 10/10 in our review</a>.</p><p>"Like the base game did before it, Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree raises the bar for single player expansions," we said. "It takes everything that made the base game such a landmark RPG, condenses it into a relatively compact 20-25 hour campaign, and provides fantastic new challenges for heavily invested fans to chew on."</p><p>Those still eager to explore every inch of the expansion can check out <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring/Shadow_of_the_Erdtree_DLC">IGN's extensive guide</a>, which covers <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring/Shadow_of_the_Erdtree_New_Weapon_Types">Shadow of the Erdtree's new weapons</a>, its various quest lines, and how to defeat those pesky new bosses.</p><p>Those who've not yet jumped into the DLC can <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring/How_to_Prepare_for_the_Shadow_of_the_Erdtree_DLC">make sure they've ticked off all the requirements to access it too</a>, as it involves more than just forking over money to FromSoftware.

Inside is a fuzzy lining to stay gentle on the Switch's screen, and there are two pockets to house a few accessories that are also designed to protect the console's controls from impact. This sleeve is available in various colors and has optional add-ons, like a game cartridge holder or a carabiner to attach the case to your backpack.</p><h2>How to Choose a Nintendo Switch Case</h2><p>There is no shortage of cases for the Nintendo Switch, with dozens showing up on Amazon and a wealth of other options, including boutique-made cases on sites like Etsy. And there are different sorts of cases as well; you can choose from travel cases, protective snap-on cases, charging cases, and more.</p><p>If you need something to carry your console around in, a carrying case or travel case is where you want to look. There are a lot of decorative cases that bear images of game characters or logos. That’s fine, but whatever you choose, make sure it can meet the minimum requirements of being a carrying case; it should be padded well enough to protect your investment from routine impacts.</p><p>It should also have a way to protect the screen from scratches (usually with a flip-down cover or sleeve) and be able to hold as many game cartridges as you want to carry around. Likewise, consider what you need to carry. Perhaps all you need is the console itself, but if you’re traveling home to see the parents, you might need a case large enough to hold the dock and an HDMI cable.</p><p>Some cases step up the game with an integrated battery. It’s probably not worth considering a charging case with less than about 10,000 mAh of power, as that’ll power your Switch through just short of two complete charges. Bonus points if the battery charges quickly, and can also charge other devices in your inventory.</p><p>Remember that these are cases you’ll need to cart around in the real world. What, exactly, do you want to be seen wearing or carrying? Some cases look a little goofy or childish, which is fine if you’re a child, and less so if you’re a grownup who takes a Switch to work to game on a lunch break.</p><h2>Nintendo Switch Case FAQ</h2><h3>Does a Nintendo Switch Need a Case?</h3><p>Unless you’re playing your Switch exclusively at home–and one free of kids and pets at that—then you will absolutely want a case to ensure the longevity of the device. Although the portable console is relatively durable, when you toss it in a bag or accidentally drop it, you always run the risk of cracking the screen, damaging the joysticks, or breaking other key components, essentially bricking the device or needing to fix it for far more than the cost of a case. </p><p>Beyond protection, cases also add convenience, as many come with extra storage for game cartridges and accessories and straps for easy carrying. You’ll even find options that serve as grips to make gameplay more enjoyable or cases offering integrated batteries, ensuring you’re never without juice during crucial moments in the action.   </p><h3>Do New Nintendo Switches Come With a Case?</h3><p>Unfortunately, none of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-nintendo-switch-consoles">Nintendo Switch models</a> come with a case. In some instances, there may be a bundle deal that includes a case, but for the most part, you’ll have to seek out a case on your own. That’s why we’ve created this guide to help in the search.</p><h3>What Size Does a Switch Case Need to Be? </h3><p>A Nintendo Switch is relatively compact at 4 inches high by 9.5 inches long and 0.55 inches thick with the Joy-Cons attached, which means the case used to protect it doesn’t need to be massive. You’ll need to account for the material required in the case’s design, about 0.1-0.2 inches or so. Sleeve-type cases, like <a href="https://zdcs.link/1KZj3?_ga=549648315.1689878480" target="_blank"><u>Waterfield Designs Slip Case</u></a>, are ready to house and protect the console while keeping slim dimensions.</p><p>If you’re looking for a hard-shelled case to boost protection or want additional storage for accessories, the case size will increase more drastically. You can expect to add an inch or more to the Switch’s size to accommodate these additions. When putting accessories into a case, it’s also important they don’t press up against your device, causing accidental misspresses or damage to the fragile screen. Pockets and separate storage areas can help prevent this. </p><p><em>Dave Johnson has been writing about gaming and tech since the days of the Palm Pilot.

Personally speaking, while the likes of <em>Genshin Impact</em> and <em>Wuthering Waves</em> never caught my interest, I’m half-tempted to give <em>Zenless Zone Zero</em> a shot thanks to its urban fantasy setting. Plus, one of <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/all-playable-zenless-zone-zero-characters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the playable characters</a> is a talking bear; how can anyone not love that?</p>

		<p>ION Lands has announced that Nivalis, the cyberpunk slice-of-life RPG, is slated for release in Spring 2025. Set in the same universe as the developer’s prior title, Cloudpunk, the game shifts from a neon-noir detective and delivery story to an open-world RPG, with the primary goal of establishing a thriving hospitality business.</p>
<p><iframe title="Nivalis | Official Summer 2024 Trailer [PEGI]" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VYykZ9RBo3w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In Nivalis, you begin with a small business, such as a noodle stand or a small nightclub. Your goal is to grow from these modest origins into a huge enterprise that Nivalis’ citizens will rave about and want to spend their time and money at. However, there’s more to Nivalis than just building up a business. You can get to know some of the city’s inhabitants, go fishing, or just dedicate time to home decoration. Delving into the underworld of Nivalis is also an option, but details on what that would entail have not been given.</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/11/05/cloudpunk-review/">Cloudpunk Review</a></h3>
<p>In our Cloudpunk review, Gareth said, <em>“Cloudpunk delivers the look and feel of a cyberpunk city, it just doesn’t fill the city with anything of interest. The story is okay and there’s some side conversations to keep you amused, but once the novelty of driving around Nivalis wears off, you’ll recognise that this is a game made entirely of fetch quests. The city looks gorgeous, it’s just a shame it doesn’t have more attractions.”</em></p>

            <p>A native version of Minecraft is finally coming to PS5.</p>
<p>Acknowledging that until now, "the only way to play Minecraft on a PlayStation 5 is by purchasing the PlayStation 4 version of the game", Mojang says that "by developing a native version of Minecraft for PS5, we'll be able to make the game run more effectively on the PS5's hardware, so you can lose your inventory in lava in the smoothest possible way!"</p>

<p>To get involved, you'll need a PS5 – naturally – and the PS4 version of Minecraft. Fire it up, and you'll be able to access the PS5 version by navigating to Settings, and then hit Preview.</p>
<p>After that, you'll be able to access the Tricky Trials Update, try out the trial chambers, visit Realms, meet a breeze, craft a mace, and more.</p>
<p>The preview version is essentially a test build, so you may encounter glitches and bugs that you don't usually see, and you won't have access to the Minecraft Store. You will also be restricted to who you can play multiplayer with – crossplay is only available for friends playing on PS4 and PS5 consoles, although Realms is still available to play with pals on other devices.</p>
<p>Did you catch the news that a new <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecraft-animated-series-announced-for-netflix">animated Minecraft series has been announced for Netflix</a>? The series – revealed as part of Minecraft's 15th-year anniversary celebrations – was revealed by way of a trailer showing a lone Creeper making its way onto the scene, and then exploding. The camera then pans through a blocky lava-filled cavern in the Nether, before it comes to rest on Netflix's large red 'N' logo perched atop a rock. Bats fly overhead.</p>

            <p>
You can now download or watch the latest episode of the GI Microcast, which covers (among other things) the latest Nintendo Direct.
</p>
<p>
We discuss the line-up shown with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/metroid-prime-4-and-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-headline-nintendo-direct">new Mario,  Zelda and Metroid titles on display</a>, and ponder what this says about the Switch's final year before its successor arrives. We also look at the untapped potential for the Metroid franchise.
</p>
<p>
From there, we weigh up the showcases from each of the platform holders and the implications for those businesses as well as the wider market. And, inevitably, the conversation turns to ongoing turbulence felt across the industry, and when we might start to see signs of recovery in the wake of various layoffs and studio closures.

Sometimes I have proper critical thoughts about games and sometimes I am Marge Simpson giving her opinion on a potato. Take LXD Red Honey, a free 2D metroidvania created in just 18 days for the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/metroidvania-month-24">Metroidvania Month 24</a> jam by sarn and OvergrownRobot, with playtesting by Oroshibu. I just think it's neat. So neat.

Let me try to flesh out the ways in which it is neat. Firstly, the world is sort of Loco Roco by way of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sonic-mania">Sonic Mania</a> - clean shapes and flat colours that may look like a pastiche of modern abstract art pilfered from VectorStock, but which reveal themselves in motion to be wonderfully tactile and bouncy and clattery. Secondly, it has an enemy who juts its head out of the ground like a garden eel, screws up its face and shoots squeaky, slow-moving rainbow beams at you. These beams richochet, sometimes catching you out if you try to hop over them, and thus, encouraging you to consider the layout before approaching. Neat! 
</p>
<p>
In broad strokes, it's both a condensing of metroidvania staples such as ye olde aerial dash, and a witty platformer in the spirit of Mario, except that instead of a tenacious plumber you play a small white square with an evolving ability set. You can shoot short-ranged energy blasts from each side of the square, which means you can only attack (initially) across the horizontal and vertical axis. Enemies, however, come at you from all directions and indeed through surfaces. Going by the 30 minutes I've played, beating the game is an exercise in wrestling with this disadvantage and then acquiring abilities that let you bypass it. Neat!</p>
<p>It's got a story, sort of. Here's some preamble from the Itch page: "A strange machine appeared in the sky, breaking down much of the plant life across the region into their core elements, including your humble garden. Collect and harness the power of these fragments in order to rebuild your world piece by piece. Explore 6 unique areas in order to find and defeat the evil that sought your world's destruction." The need to gather elements also gates your progress: you'll need to find enough water drops to grow a plant you can jump on to reach the next area, for example.
</p>
<p>
As for the title, LXD stands for "Liquid Xtal Dream", and red honey, I gather, refers to a kind of honey produced when bees feed on rhododendron flowers. In real life, red honey contains grayanotoxins, which confer hallucinogenic effects in small doses. Guzzle down a lot of red honey, however, and it may kill you. Neat? You can <a href="https://saturnyoshi.itch.io/lxd-red-honey">download LXD Red Honey from Itch here</a>. It's really good. It's definitely worth donating to the developers, if you have cash to spare.

			<p>Today, Elden Ring gets its first and only expansion, Shadow of the Erdtree. As part of an interview <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/hidetaka-miyazaki-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-1235042903/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with Rolling Stone</a>, game director and FromSoftware president Hidetaka Miyazaki took the opportunity to discuss some other games he'd like to make in the future.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, the Elden Ring creator would like to make a traditional JRPG. Long-time FromSoftware will certainly remember Enchanted Arms, the turn-based JRPG made by the studio and published by Ubisoft in 2006 for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. However, it doesn't sound like Miyazaki would be interested in a sequel, mainly because he doesn't believe in following up on franchises that were created by others. An exception is Armored Core, as explained below.</p>
<p><em>I think a lot of these games are so intertwined with the directors who almost invented that style of game. I don’t think there’s a scenario where I myself would make a King’s Field. The same can be said about Otogi and Enchanted Arms. I worked on Armored Core 4 and Armored Core: For Answer. It enabled me to put my own interpretation on <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/armored-core-vi-fires-of-rubicon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon</a> and develop that.</em></p>
<p>It would actually be very interesting to see what Miyazaki and his team can come up with in that genre. Perhaps a mix of turn-based and real-time dodge/parry as proposed by <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-a-reactive-turn-based-rpg-was-easily-one-of-the-most-impressive-reveals-of-xgs-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>? Meanwhile, fans of his work can dive into Shadow of the Erdtree, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-worthy-of-the-greater-wills-blessing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">got another perfect score here on Wccftech</a>.</p>
<p><em>It did not take long to get back into the engaging adventuring loop of the Elden Ring experience, searching for map fragments to get a better look at the map, placing markers where points of interest are seemingly located, and getting amazed by beautiful vistas, immense castles, and sprawling haunting forests, unaware of the dangers that lurked inside of them. With open-world fatigue setting in earlier this year due to the many open-world games released in 2024—like Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, Rise of the Ronin, and the PC versions of Horizon Forbidden West and Ghost of Tsushima—Shadow of the Erdtree's open-world design stands out as a testament to how the Elden Ring experience still surpasses anything else on the market. As such, I believe a perfect score is justified, even with the evident lack of significant innovation and some technical hiccups.</em></p>

<p>Displate is one of the most recognisable names in the collector space – and it has been that way for a few years. For those not in the know, Displate offers a staggering range of ‘metal posters’ or ‘prints’ that are created in celebration of almost every franchise or series in pop culture, be it a movie, video game, comic book, or television show. These metal posters are stunning, and in recent months, the team at Displate has innovated, applying 3D-style layering and unique textures to the prints that bring the art to life.</p>



<p>Recently, Displate unveiled a super limited edition Shadow of the Erdtree poster as a tribute to the new Elden Ring expansion that’s out <strong>today</strong>. As someone who owns Displate posters, I can firmly attest that they’re well worth the investment.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-sublime-in-the-shadow">Sublime in the Shadow</h2>



<p>The limited edition Shadow of the Erdtree poster from Displate boasts intricate 3D detailing and a shimmering gloss finish that’s sure to make it pop on any wall in the house – or workplace (it’s entirely up to you where it goes). It’s a gorgeous piece that’s limited to just 1,500 copies, so you’ll need to act fast if you want to secure one. It’s the perfect item for any streamer backdrop or to adorn the wall of a gaming room.</p>



<p>Going above and beyond a standard paper poster, a Displate poster is the pinnacle of durability and quality. On the Displate site, there are <strong>thousands </strong>of designs to choose from – and I recently picked out a couple of Fallout posters to go on my wall. They’re adorned with the ‘Textra’ finish that adds a strategically-placed 3D detail to appropriate surfaces on the poster, giving it much more depth than a flat finish.</p>



<p>Here’s a snapshot of my Displate posters:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It was hard picking out these two from the hundreds available – I’d have brought dozens if I’d had my way. There’s such a stunning range to choose from, it’s unreal. I’m a huge Fallout fan, so securing these gorgeous posters was a no-brainer, but if you’re partial to an Elden Ring-themed collector’s item, you’ll need to move fast to <a href="https://displate.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">secure the limited edition Displate poster</a>. </p>



<p>And if you’re curious about how you install them, it’s dramatically easy. Every Displate poster comes with a unique ‘sticky magnet’ that won’t damage your walls and takes seconds to fit – simple! </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/beyond-good-evil-20th-anniversary-edition-has-a-new-narrative-link-to-beyond-good-evil-2<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Ubisoft has insisted it's committed to the Beyond Good &amp; Evil franchise and even mentioned its long in-development sequel as part of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/beyond-good-evil-20th-anniversary-edition-officially-unveiled-at-lrg3-2024">the reveal of Beyond Good &amp; Evil - 20th Anniversary Edition</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/beyond-good-and-evil-2">Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2</a> is considered vaporware by many fans after an incredible 16 years since <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2008/05/28/ubisoft-announces-beyond-good-evil-follow-up">it was announced back in 2008</a>. Despite Ubisoft’s many vague references to it being still alive, no video game has materialized thus far.</p><p>But this week's announcement of <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/beyond-good-evil-20th-anniversary-edition">Beyond Good &amp; Evil - 20th Anniversary Edition</a> has sparked renewed hope that Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 is real and may even be re-revealed sooner rather than later.</p><p>This remaster includes a brand new mission in which players can discover more about protagonist Jade’s past and collect exclusive cosmetic rewards. Crucially, Ubisoft included a note to press that this new mission “also reveals more about the narrative link to Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2, showing Ubisoft’s enduring commitment to the franchise.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>That line strongly suggests Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 is not just still alive but closer than ever to launch. The question of course will be what form the game takes, given how many times development has stopped and started over the years. At E3 2017, Ubisoft revealed what looked like an incredibly ambitious project, promising a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/06/15/e3-2017-beyond-good-evil-2-is-a-massively-ambitious-rpg"><u>multi-planet world populated by dynamically-generated characters</u></a>.</p><p>In the meantime, Beyond Good &amp; Evil - 20th Anniversary Edition launches June 25 on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X and S, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, Amazon Luna, and PC through the Ubisoft Store, Epic Games Store and Steam, with a physical version from Limited Run Games out July 12. It features the aforementioned new mission, an anniversary gallery, a re-orchestrated soundtrack, support of up to 60FPS, and other "exclusive new content."</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

<p data-characters="373" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Although the summer of gaming showcases wrapped up with <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/everything-shown-in-the-nintendo-direct-for-june-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">presentations from Nintendo</a> and Limited Run Games this week, <em>Sonic the Hedgehog</em> fans had been hoping to see Sega air one of its Sonic Central showcases, especially with it being Sonic’s birthday on June 23. Unfortunately, the company has recently confirmed it has no such presentation planned at all this month.</p> <p data-characters="403" data-current-count="403" data-injectable="true">As spotted by <a href="https://www.sonicstadium.org/news/sonic/no-sonic-central-planned-for-june-2024-sega-confirms-r2270/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Sonic Stadium</a>, social media and community manager Katie Chrzanowski made a point of confirming this during <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/h77eJwjcTWA?si=g_PhNyW6khEOwfwI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a recent livestream</a> to celebrate the anniversary of the <em>Sonic</em> series. That’s not to say there couldn’t be one later in the year but, for now, “There’s not one happening this month… We don’t have news on when a Sonic Central is going to be.”</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Sega</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="409" data-current-count="709" data-injectable="true">You can’t blame fans for expecting a <em>Sonic</em> showcase of some kind in June considering Sega has been holding them regularly the last few years, with last year’s one even taking place on Sonic’s birthday. Admittedly, these showcases don’t quite rival the hype of a Nintendo Direct, but they’ve still offered some neat updates on whatever <em>Sonic</em> related projects were in the pipeline.</p>
 <p data-characters="861" data-current-count="861" data-injectable="true">The second half of 2024 is slated to be a big one for the franchise since not only is there <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/sonic-x-shadow-generations-locks-in-an-october-launch-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a remaster of <em>Sonic Generations</em> coming out in October</a>, but <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/jim-carrey-returns-for-sonic-the-hedgehog-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the third live-action movie is scheduled for December</a>. And both of these projects will prominently feature fan-favourite Shadow the Hedgehog, who’s making quite the comeback this year. Admittedly, Sega debuted a new trailer and further details on <em>Sonic X Shadow Generations</em> during Summer Game Fest this month. As much as I want to see even more of that game, we’ve probably had our fill for the time being. However, details on the third movie are shockingly slim; there hasn’t even been a proper trailer for it, meaning we know next to nothing about its general plot. A brief trailer was shown to attendees at CinemaCon in April, but it was never uploaded afterwards for everyone else to see.</p>
 <p data-characters="578" data-current-count="578" data-injectable="false">Even if a Sonic Central had taken place this month, though, it’s unlikely it would’ve included a movie trailer based on previous showcases. The first movie had already premiered before the first Sonic Central ever aired, and the second movie’s debut trailer was shown during The Game Awards 2021. As such, any June Sonic Central may have teased the upcoming movie, but not shared any major news about it. Although this only begs the question of when and where Sega and Paramount intended on talking about the movie, especially with it coming out in six months.</p>

            <p>Xbox's Matt Booty has spoken more on the closure of Tango Gameworks earlier this year, and, while he did not name names, it appears that a change in leadership at the Hi-Fi Rush studio was a factor in Microsoft's decision.</p>
<p>In conversation with <a href="https://variety.com/2024/gaming/news/xbox-studios-matt-booty-podast-game-pass-fallout-studio-closures-1236038120/">Variety's Strictly Business podcast</a>, the Xbox executive was asked about the closure of Tango Gameworks, and whether Microsoft had tried to seek another buyer for the studio.</p>

</figure>
<p>"I won't get into the real sort of nitty gritty details on you know, what went into the decision, mostly out of respect for the people there, just because you know, there was a lot of work that went into delivering Hi-Fi Rush, which was a great game and you know did well for us," Booty began.</p>
<p>"I think the thing to be considered is that for us, it's as much a forward looking situation as much as it is looking back at one certain game... There are a lot of things that go into success for a game. You know, what leadership do you have? What creative leadership do you have? Is the team the same team that shipped something successful previously?</p>
<p>"And we have to look at all of those things together and then ask ourselves, are we set up for success going forward? And while there may have been factors and situations that previously led to success, they may not all still be in place as you look at what you're doing going forward."</p>
<p>Booty seemed to be referring - at least in part - to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shinji-mikami-leaving-tango-gameworks-after-12-years">departure of Tango Gameworks founder Shinji Mikami last year</a>. Mikami established Tango Gameworks in 2010, with the studio going on to develop The Evil Within series and Ghostwire: Tokyo. Prior to this, he worked at Capcom on the Resident Evil series.</p>
<p>Booty also seemed to suggest closing down Tango Gameworks wasn't the only option Microsoft considered. He gave examples of previous Xbox-owned studios that have since gone independent, such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/activisions-skylanders-crash-bandicoot-studio-toys-for-bob-going-independent">Toys for Bob</a>, which now has a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spyro-studio-toys-for-bob-secures-deal-with-microsoft-for-its-first-independent-game">publishing deal in place with Microsoft</a>.</p>
<p>"I think back to a studio called Twisted Pixel in Texas that we acquired and then for a sort of change in goals, it wasn't a perfect match anymore, but that studio today is still thriving," Booty continued. "We wanted to set them up for success. So we absolutely look at what the possible business options are to keep a studio open or to keep you know, perhaps have it change hands. And it's just one of the things, of course, that we look at across the board."</p>
<p>Booty closed: "Sometimes those things come together, sometimes they don't."</p>

<p>As well as Tango Gameworks, Redfall and Dishonored developer Arkane Austin and Mighty Doom studio Alpha Dog Games were also impacted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-shuts-slew-of-bethesda-studios-including-redfall-hi-fi-rush-developers">Microsoft's closures in May</a>.</p>
<p>Many were quick to condemn the company's decision to shutter these studios, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arkane-lyon-boss-leads-widespread-condemnation-of-bethesda-closures">Arkane Lyon boss Dinga Bakaba calling it a "fucking gut stab"</a>.</p>

			<p>New Final Fantasy VII glitches continue to be discovered over 27 years after the game's release on the original PlayStation.</p>
<p><strong><em>(There will be some spoilers below, so avoid reading if you have never played Final Fantasy VII and don't want to get anything spoiled.)</em></strong></p>
<p>The new glitch, showcased in a new video shared by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@4-8Productions">4-8 Productions</a> on YouTube, allows players to retain Aerith in the party even after the events at the Forgotten Capital. What makes this glitch fascinating is the complex procedure to activate it, which essentially requires the user to "confuse" the game so that it doesn't know exactly at what moment the story actually is, only to rectify it at the Icicle Inn location, the first location Cloud and his companions visit after the Forgotten Capital, to keep Aerith in the party.</p>
<p><iframe title="HUGE FFVII Discovery Brings Aerith Back To Life!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/May-fRmdWNA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The events at the Forgotten Capital also mark the end of Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, the second entry in the remake trilogy released earlier this year on PlayStation 5. Built on some of the mechanics introduced in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-fixed-doors-and-flying-ninjas/">Remake</a>, Rebirth greatly expands them, doing away with the predominant linearity of its predecessor to present one of the best JRPGs released in recent times. You can learn more about the game by checking out Kai's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/">review.</a></p>

FromSoftware's Soulsborne games are notoriously difficult to beat, but creator Hidetaka Miyazaki has said it would "break the game itself" to turn down the challenge.
</p>
<p>
In an interview with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/article/2024/jun/21/hidetaka-miyazaki-fromsoftware-elden-ring-shadow-erdtree">The Guardian</a>, Miyazaki discussed how high difficulty is not only creatively part of the game, but also has led to its success.

</p>
<p>
"If we really wanted the whole world to play the game, we could just crank the difficulty down more and more. But that wasn't the right approach," he said. 
</p>
<p>
"Had we taken that approach, I don't think the game would have done what it did, because the sense of achievement that players gain from overcoming these hurdles is such a fundamental part of the experience. Turning down difficulty would strip the game of that joy - which, in my eyes, would break the game itself."

<p>
Of course, difficulty is subjective, and Elden Ring's new expansion Shadow of the Erdtree does not add any further accessibility options to the game.
</p>
<p>
However, in an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-creator-hidetaka-miyazaki-on-originating-the-soulslike-genre">interview with Eurogamer</a>, Miyazaki said: "this is not something I'm opposed to in the slightest," adding "we're going to continue to look into it and see how we can do those features in our future titles."

</p>
<p>
Shadow of the Erdtree is released today and, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-is-fromsoftwares-largest-expansion-ever">Miyazaki previously told Eurogamer</a>, its difficulty is relative to the end of the base game.

</p>
<p>
"We wanted to provide these challenging encounters and these menacing threats, and in order to do that, we wanted to give the player a lot of freedom of approach," he said. "We wanted them to feel free in how they choose and when they choose to approach and tackle these hardships.
</p>
<p>
"So players who look for that sort of challenge in our games will find a challenge on equal footing in the DLC as well."
</p>
<p>
Difficulty was a key point in our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-review">Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree review</a>.

</p>
<p>
"It's true that this distinct type of FromSoft-engineered frustration is an indispensable part of the Souls experience - to hurl yourself repeatedly against a seemingly immovable object until through sheer luck and serendipitous timing, you somehow prevail," it reads.
</p>
<p>
"There is real palpable joy and pride and relief in that - we've all felt it, and with the blessing of hindsight, suddenly all of that failure feels like it was worth it. In other cases they're genuinely instructional, with real lessons learned. This, however, feels like difficulty for difficulty's sake, turned up to eleven, perhaps because with the added expectations of a DLC having something extra-absurd to conquer even though it technically doesn't require finishing the core game."

            <p>When the makers of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cloudpunk">Cloudpunk</a> revealed their next game would be set in the same cyberpunk city as their sci-fi delivery sim, my ears were pricked. When they showed you'd be running a noodle bar and fishing in the slums instead of flying a hovercar around, I went into full wishlisty mode. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nivalis">Nivalis</a> (named for the cyberpunk city in question) was due to come to PC some time this year. But plans have changed. If, like me, you're intrigued by the promise of a life under a neon canopy, you might have to wait. The release date has been pushed into next year. As compensation, here, the creators have put out another trailer to remind you what's coming.</p>

<p>"Nivalis will be launching in Spring 2025!" say developers Ion Lands <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1488490/view/4169851371521463458?l=english">in a Steam post</a>. "Our city has taken on a life of its own, growing and evolving in ways we are eager to share with you... Ensuring that Nivalis provides the best possible experience is our priority. Your patience and support are invaluable as we navigate through this creative journey."</p>
<p>Fair dos, I'll hang about. It's still a vague date but at least it's narrowed down to a season. And there are some things in the new trailer we haven't seen before, such as the  pixellated subway map screen, or the little robot fella asking the player if they sell lube (oo-er). But apart from that it seems like another pitch for chill times in a cool <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world</a>. There are no more hints about the serial killer that is supposedly on the loose, as mentioned in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sumptuous-cyberpunk-life-sim-nivalis-will-have-boat-rides-and-serial-killers">previous videos</a>. We'll have to wait and see what's up with that. </p>
<p>All in all it still seems good fodder for folks seeking to resettle in a futuristic city and explore some glowing streets. I got some of that desire out of my system by wandering the sidewalks of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, of course. But something about the noisy voxels of Nivalis makes the city look even more low-life-high-tech. It helps that every car is flying, which essentially pedestrianises the entire city, hopefully making its alleyways and towers more labyrinthine and intricate. Ah, maybe I'm just yearning for that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bernband-gifs">Bernband sequel</a>. Oh well.</p>
