<p>During the <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/251105e.pdf">latest financial briefing</a>, Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa touched on the ways Nintendo builds relationships with its consumers. As part of this, he revealed some updated data about the player numbers within the company's ecosystem as of 30th September 2025.</p>
<p>There are currently <strong>400 million</strong> Nintendo Accounts, and in terms of active Switch Online memberships, there are <strong>34 million users</strong>. Nintendo mentions how there are also <strong>128 million</strong> "annual playing users", further noting:</p>
<p>"The number of annual playing users refers to the number of Nintendo Accounts, out of all Nintendo Accounts registered to a Nintendo Switch or Nintendo Switch 2 system, that used Nintendo Switch or Nintendo Switch 2 software one or more times during the 12-month data aggregation period. The count does not include use of services such as Nintendo eShop. Past usage data is collected when hardware is connected to the internet, so the results are revised retroactively."</p>

<p>Nintendo says it will continue to bring its entertainment to an "ever-wider audience". In the same briefing, the president noted how the company is extending beyond dedicated video game platforms with movies and videos, character merchandise, mobile apps, and real-world experiences such as the Nintendo Museum, theme parks and annual Live events.</p>
<p>There were no specific updates attached to this data about future plans for Switch Online content or the Nintendo Classics library going forward, but the company has been regularly updating this subscription service with retro games, extra bonuses and even special apps. Next year, it will bolster the service with the Virtual Boy library.</p>
<p>Nintendo Accounts and the Switch Online service also give users access to online play and other features such as GameChat. You can see all of this in action in the video above.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nyt-connections-hints-today-878-%E2%80%94clues-and-answers-for-wednesday-november-5.1344037/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>You’ve made it (so far) to the middle of the week, but whatever tribulations you’ve been through, you still need to overcome today’s challenge. The NYT Connections puzzle for today is a tricky one, but that’s where I come in. Below, I’ve shared the best NYT Connections hints you need to wrap your puzzle up nicely and quickly.</p>



<p>Read on to get the NYT Connections solutions you need for today.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-november-5">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (November 5)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #878:</p>



<ul>
<li>KNIGHT</li>



<li>COAT</li>



<li>BUTCHER</li>



<li>BAKER</li>



<li>FLACK</li>



<li>KNIFE</li>



<li>CANDLESTICK</li>



<li>MAKER</li>



<li>FRANKLIN</li>



<li>FOREST</li>



<li>BOW</li>



<li>BLOW</li>



<li>SPOIL</li>



<li>WRENCH</li>



<li>BOTCH</li>



<li>ROPE</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>Think of verbs that describe messing something up—whether it’s a recipe, a plan, or a performance.</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em>These are the classic implements you’d find in a whodunit board game. Colonel Mustard would know.</em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>Last names only—each belongs to a legendary artist whose vocals defined a genre and an era.</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>Each word completes the phrase “rain_____” to form something familiar, poetic, or practical.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, November 5.</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-for-today-november-5-878">NYT Connections Answers for Today, November 5 (#878)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– BLOW, BOTCH, BUTCHER, SPOIL</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – CANDLESTICK, KNIFE, ROPE, WRENCH</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – BAKER, FLACK, FRANKLIN, KNIGHT</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – BOW, COAT, FOREST, MAKER</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

<p>The Mario and Zelda movies are just the start</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure data-uuid="5bc86a535252d"><a title="Super Mario Movie" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5bc86a535252d/super-mario-movie.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Nintendo's movie business is already booming following the release of the Mario Movie in 2023, which was a global box office hit.</p>
<p>Since then, it's announced a live-action <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Zelda</a> film, and more recently lifted the lid on <strong>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</strong> (a follow up to the first animated Mario Movie). It's also got Nintendo Pictures and Nintendo Stars helping out with the expansion of video and movie content, and Shigeru Miyamoto has been working closely with the current movie projects.</p>
<p>If you are wondering what the plan is beyond this, the company's <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/251105e.pdf">latest financial briefing</a> has now teased there's even more on the way with a simple graphic. The aim is to build a framework for a "consistent release cadence":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Following up on the release of The Super Mario Bros. Movie in 2023, we have The Super Mario Galaxy Movie scheduled for release in 2026, and the live-action movie of The Legend of Zelda planned for 2027.</p>
<p>We are continuing to prepare for the ongoing release of movies in the future."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As noted in the graphic above, the next movie is The Super Mario Galaxy Movie, due out in April 2026. This will be followed by The Legend of Zelda movie, which is scheduled for 2027. The main characters for the Zelda movie have been cast, but we don't know much else about it at this stage.</p>

It's even led to the Japanese firm decreasing its overall sales forecast for this particular system.</p>
<p>If you are wondering how long the original family of Switch systems will be supported for, ultimately, it comes down to certain market factors. And even though it's selling less overall, sales are still maintaining a steady pace even after the Switch 2's launch.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067pmovnk&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>838k</span></a></p>

<p>Here's what Nintendo's president Shuntaro Furukawa had to say about <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/251105e.pdf">the company's support of the original Switch</a> going forward:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"While our business focus will shift to Nintendo Switch 2, Nintendo Switch has maintained a steady sales pace even after the June launch of its successor. While taking consumer demand and the business environment into consideration, we will continue sales of Nintendo Switch hardware."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, there's no end-of-life date or anything similar (<em>at least for now</em>), and the original hybrid system will still be available to purchase in the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>Nintendo has previously confirmed future support of the system with upcoming releases such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tomodachi_life_living_the_dream">Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/rhythm_heaven_groove">Rhythm Heaven Groove</a> (both due out in 2026), and even a major update scheduled for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/animal_crossing_new_horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a>.</p>
<p>In other words, there's still more than enough time <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/switch-is-poised-to-be-nintendos-best-selling-console-of-all-time">for the Switch to topple the DS</a> as Nintendo's best-selling system of all time. The only console ahead of it at that point would be Sony's PlayStation 2, <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/11/sorry-nintendo-but-it-doesnt-look-like-switch-will-overtake-ps2-as-the-best-selling-console-of-all-time?utm_campaign=related-articles&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_source=nintendolife.com&amp;utm_content=in-article">but the two devices are currently about six million sales apart</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Nintendo isn’t planning on stopping movie adaptations of its games. Even more so, according to a new sales report, it’s going to be a more common thing.</p>



<p>For the longest time, video game adaptations were a curse on Hollywood. It never seemed to work out, no matter what form it took, from animated (like Final Fantasy) to live-action (like Max Payne). However, the 2020s proved to show it off in style, having massive successes like Sonic the Hedgehog, Fallout, Arcane, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-last-of-us-tv-show-receives-high-praise-from-critics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Last of Us</a>. One of those hits was Illumination’s The Super Mario Bros. Movie, which raked in more than <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/super-mario-bros-movie-record-breaking/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one billion dollars</a> at the box office. With a sequel and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-delays-the-legend-of-zelda-live-action-movie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">live-action Zelda film</a>, it’s on one heck of a hot streak. Fortunately, it doesn’t seem like it wants to slow down at all.</p>



<h2 id="h-nintendo-involved-in-multiple-movies-based-on-company-ip-in-development">Nintendo Involved in Multiple Movies Based on Company IP in Development</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Universal</figcaption></figure>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/251105e.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a sales report from Nintendo Japan</a>, the company talked about its success with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-10-million-sales-units/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a> and its plans for the future. One big part of its strategy is multimedia, with a big push for films. Nintendo states that it’s currently involved in multiple projects on its IP in various stages. No specifics were given as to what franchises those are, but they’ll be releasing after The Legend of Zelda in 2027.</p>



<p>Furthermore, Nintendo plans to be heavily involved in all of the films, from production to financing. Given how well the collaboration worked with Mario, having the creators on the team always leads to a better adaptation. It’ll be interesting to see what the future for Nintendo’s films will look like, whether it be in-house, like it teased with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75JEwjP_GD8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Close to You</a>, or licensed. Either way, we may see series like Metroid or Animal Crossing make it onto the silver screen soon.</p>

<p>Nintendo's systems haven't always had the best third-party support, but the Switch 2 has got off to an incredibly strong start with developers and publishers you might not have even expected to see once upon a time now bringing major IP to this new hardware.</p>
<p>The firm has <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/11/nintendo-highlights-strong-third-party-relationships-ahead-of-switch-2-reveal">acknowledged this strong support</a> once again in its <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/251105e.pdf">latest financial results briefing</a>, with Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa mentioning how the Switch 2 officially has the "largest third-party software lineup" ever for new Nintendo hardware.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Not only have we already seen multiple hit first-party titles, but we have also had many software publishers on board from the very beginning, resulting in the most extensive launch-year lineup out of any of our dedicated video game platforms."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although it's early days in the system's life, Furukawa further notes how software publishers have already released a "rich lineup of titles" catering to both "gamers and families". Attached to his comments is a graphic, highlighting the many third-party games that have been released and announced for the Switch 2 so far. This also includes some indie hits.</p>

<p>As you can see, there are games such as CD Projekt Red's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a> and some upcoming games Switch 2 players can look forward to next year include <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami-3-and-dark-ties">Yakuza 3 Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties</a> from SEGA, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> from Capcom, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elden-ring-tarnished-edition">Elden Ring</a> from Bandai Namco.</p>
<p>As we've already highlighted, Nintendo's first-party library for the Switch 2 has also got off to a strong start with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> shifting 9.57 million units, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> has hit 3.49 million units. There's also plenty of other upcoming first-party titles to look forward to for the remainder of 2025 including <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a>, which is out this week, and then there's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> in November and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_4_beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> in December.</p>

<p>As we've now seen, Switch 2 sales have seemingly exceeded Nintendo's expectations, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/switch-2-sells-over-10-million-units-nintendo-increases-forecast-even-further">after shifting 10.36 million units</a> (as of 30th September 2025) and becoming the "fastest-selling Nintendo hardware to date". This has also reportedly resulted in a slump in Switch sales, with Nintendo cutting back its forecast of the original hybrid system.</p>
<p>Nintendo's president Shuntaro Furukawa <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/251105e.pdf">has now revealed</a> how 84% of Nintendo Switch 2 players transitioned across from the original Switch systems. This was not only "early adopters" of the original Switch hardware, but also consumers who began playing the Switch at "various points of its lifecycle".</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067pmovnk&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>838k</span></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Consumers who purchased Nintendo Switch between its launch in 2017 and the launch of the Nintendo Switch 2 have been uniformly migrating to Nintendo Switch 2."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As you can see in the slide below, 16% of Switch 2 players are completely "new players". Below this is a breakdown of Switch 2 owners and the time frame when they purchased the original Switch, according to Nintendo's internal data.</p>
<figure data-uuid="7e14691bdbb61"><a title="Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7e14691bdbb61/switch-2.large.png"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Nintendo's original Switch system <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/switch-is-poised-to-be-nintendos-best-selling-console-of-all-time">has now sold more than 154 million units</a>, which shows there are still plenty of players out there who have not yet made the shift across to the Switch 2, but likely will at some stage during the new unit's lifecycle.</p>
<p>Furukawa also notes how this data illustrates how existing Switch players are "smoothly transitioning to the Nintendo Switch 2", and allowing Nintendo to maintain relationships with players "across platform generations". Admittedly, it should probably come as no surprise that many of Switch 2's early adopters are existing Switch players, but it's still interesting to see the exact percentage.</p>

              <p>It doesn’t matter if you get your workouts in running the road, climbing at a rock gym, or just lifting weights. Fitness buffs of all kinds have a good reason to use a fitness tracker. It can provide you with useful metrics, help establish healthy habits and keep you motivated to stay active.</p>
<p>Fitness trackers can vary a lot in price, but you can often find some of the good ones at steep discounts. Right now, Amazon happens to have the Fitbit Charge 6 on sale for 38% off: The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5344/">band normally goes for $59, but the ongoing sale brings it down to an even $99</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5344/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Built-in GPS</h2>
<p>One of the most important features in a good fitness tracker, particularly for runners, is <strong>GPS</strong>. You can track mileage and pace right on your wrist instead of carrying your smartphone around, recording it there. The Fitbit Charge 6 is equipped <strong>with over 40 different exercise modes</strong> to take advantage of. Activities range from running to kayaking to cycling and more.</p>
<p>You can monitor your heart rate all throughout your day to get an idea of where you resting heart rate is at, then measure the intensity of your workouts based on how much it’s going up. Use this data to get a handle on your effort levels so you can adjust accordingly to meet your goals. Heart rate monitoring using the ECG app and sensor can also be used to detect irregular heart rhythm, which may be caused by atrial fibrillation (AFib). It can also provide<strong> insight regarding blood oxygen levels, skin temperature, and more</strong>.</p>



<p>You can even use your Fitbit Charge 6 for stress management purposes: The fitness tracker can breakdown for you a stress management score, calculated by analyzing your heart rate along with some other factors. The tracker can walk your through guided breathing sessions which can help build healthier habits in handling stress.</p>
<p>The fitness tracker isn’t just for when your active, but inactive too. The watch can measure how productive your sleep is each night in recharging you and allowing you to take on the day. The Fitbit Charge 6 assigns you a sleep score by tracking your light, deep, and REM sleep in unison with your sleeping heart rate, nailing down how consistent your night’s rest is. You can even set an alarm window for waking up, in which the tracker can vibrate to wake you up when you are in the optimal sleep stage for feeling refreshed when it’s time to get up in the morning.</p>

              <p>The kids’ electric scooter market is blowing up with super cheap options from unknown brands that skimp on safety certifications and build quality. You see them everywhere online, they tempt you with super low prices but without the testing or engineering that prevents accidents.</p>
<p><strong>Segway Ninebot built a reputation on safe, reliable personal transportation</strong>&nbsp;and the <em>eKickScooter C2 Pro</em> brings that same commitment to kids aged 6 to 14. Right now, Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5343/">has dropped the price from $279 down to $229, hitting an all-time low</a> for a scooter that parents can trust and kids will actually enjoy riding.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5343/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Safety Features to Give Parents Peace of Mind</h2>
<p>The kick-to-start system avoids the most common cause of kids’ scooter accidents: sudden, unexpected acceleration. The<strong> throttle doesn’t kick in until your child gets the scooter up to 3 mph</strong>, and removes the possibility of the motor engaging while they are still getting on or adjusting their position. This alone turns the scooter from a potentially very hazardous toy into something kids can safely control from the first ride.</p>
<p>The UL-2272 certification covers the battery system, charging components and electrical circuits, all ensuring that <strong>the scooter will not overheat, catch fire, or have electrical failures</strong> common in uncertified models. TUV Rheinland’s testing process includes drop tests, water resistance evaluation and sustained load testing that goes far beyond what discount brands bother with.</p>
<p>The scooter features<strong> three riding modes that let you match its performance to your child’s skill level</strong> and the riding environment. Safe Mode limits speed and acceleration for beginners still learning balance and control. Standard Mode opens up more speed while maintaining manageable acceleration curves. Sport Mode unleashes the full 12.4 mph top speed for experienced riders tackling longer distances or slight inclines. The <strong>150W motor delivers enough torque to handle hills</strong> that would stop weaker scooters, supporting up to 132-pound riders.</p>



<p>The adjustable handlebar extends to<strong> three different heights to fit kids</strong> from elementary school through middle school. After all, a 6-year-old and a 14-year-old have much different heights and arm lengths, and this scooter adjusts to fit both in and out of the box. Proper handlebar height is important for both control and safety-too low, and kids have to hunch over uncomfortably; too high, and steering precision suffers.</p>



<p>On one charge,<strong> it provides 9.3 miles of range</strong>&nbsp;which easily equates to several days of neighborhood rides or trips down to your friend’s house. Charging time is 4 hours, so if your kid plugs it in after getting home from school, then it’s ready to go for the next day’s adventures. Range will vary based on rider weight, terrain, and riding mode, but even conservative real-world use yields 7 to 8 miles, enough for most kids’ typical journeys.</p>
<p>The integrated Bluetooth speaker adds the dimension of entertainment that kids will be seriously appreciative of. Pair the scooter with a smartphone and ride while streaming music, with LED lights pulsating and changing colors in time with the beat. Voice assistant compatibility lets kids control music playback hands-free, keeping both hands on the handlebars where they belong.</p>
<p>At $229, you’re getting a scooter backed by Segway’s engineering expertise and actual safety certifications, not just marketing claims.</p>

                <p>There has been no shortage of unique games this year, but one of the strangest has definitely been Hotel Barcelona, the latest project from Suda51 and Swery, which puts a new spin on "grindhouse" horror. The 2.5D side-scrolling roguelike tasks players with surviving in a hotel full of serial killers inspired by '80s slasher flicks. It's a wild premise befitting the legacies of its creators, and fans who want to experience it for themselves can pick it up now on PC and console--including a $30 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FJYKWL9Z,B0FJYHWPPB&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">physical version</a> available for PS5 and Xbox Series X. However, there's also an upcoming $120 Collector's Edition launching on April 17, 2026 that's packed with tons of collectibles and other extras.

That's a common trend with games developed by Suda51 and Swery; however, their titles tend to become cult classics thanks to their memorable characters and unique spins on familiar gameplay genres. While critics have noted that Hotel Barcelona can be a frustrating roguelike, others have complimented it for its slasher-movie vibes, tight combat, and bizarre setting.</p><hr><p><strong>Sign up for GameSpot's Weekly Deals Newsletter:</strong></p><hr><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/legend-of-zelda-hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-nintendo-switch-2-exclusive-preorder-guide/1100-6534713/">Hyrule Warriors: Age Of Imprisonment Launch-Day Delivery Still Available At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-officially-licensed-wireless-controllers-zelda-super-mario-pokemon-deals/1100-6535215/">Get Zelda-Themed Switch 2 Controllers For As Low As $25 For A Limited Time</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-xbox-elite-series-2-wireless-controller-deal-holiday-2025/1100-6535861/">Xbox Elite Series 2 Controller On Sale For Lowest Price This Year</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-xbox-wireless-controller-best-deals-black-friday-2025/1100-6534446/">Xbox Wireless Controllers Discounted To $40 In Early Black Friday Sale</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/8bitdo-pro-3-wireless-controller-nintendo-switch-2-recommendation/1100-6533157/">8BitDo Pro 3 Nintendo Switch 2 &amp; PC Controller Discounted To New Low Price</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-batman-classic-tv-series-batmobile-building-set-amazon-deal/1100-6535836/">Lego Classic TV Series Batmobile Gets Rare Discount At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/digimon-the-movies-4-6-blu-ray-collection-up-for-preorder-at-amazon/1100-6535809/">Digimon The Movies 4-6 Blu-Ray Collection Up For Preorder At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/astro-bot-ps5-best-official-playstation-figures-plush-collectors-box/1100-6535705/">Adorable New Astro Bot Collectibles Are Waiting To Be Rescued By You</a></li>   </ul> </div>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bose-quietcomfort-ultra-priced-like-an-old-model-amazon-quietly-dumps-its-anc-headphones.1343956/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The premium headphone market overflows with active noise cancellation options from Sony, Apple, Sennheiser, and countless others, but <strong>Bose is still the brand that essentially invented consumer ANC</strong> and continues to push the technology forward. The <em>QuietComfort Ultra</em> is the top of the line from Bose and marries its most advanced noise cancellation with class-leading spatial audio capabilities that few competitors can match. Right now, Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5342/">has dropped the price from $429 down to $329, the all-time low for Bose’s best headphones</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5342/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Three Modes That Adapt to Your Environment</h2>
<p>Bose QuietComfort Ultra has three different listening modes that redefine the way you interact with the world around you: <strong>Quiet Mode</strong> with full noise cancellation, puts you in a personal bubble of quiet that rejects airplane engines, traffic noise and chatty coworkers. All of this occurs via a series of outward-facing microphones that detect ambient noise and inward-facing processing that generates inverse sound waves to nullify noise. <strong>Aware Mode</strong> turns the tables, piping environmental sound back in through the headphones so you can hear announcements, conversations, or oncoming traffic without ever having to take your headphones off. <strong>Immersion Mode</strong> melds maximum noise cancelation with Bose Immersive Audio-their spatial audio technology that envelops your head with three-dimensional space.</p>
<p><em>CustomTune</em> technology tailors the sound profile to your ears: When you first don the headphones, they play a brief tone and measure how sound reflects off of your unique ear shape. It then <strong>adjusts frequency response to compensate for how your ears naturally emphasize</strong> or diminish certain frequencies. Two people listening to the same headphones will hear slightly different tuning optimized for their individual anatomy, ensuring that you get the most accurate sound reproduction possible.</p>



<p>The microphone system stands out for good reason: in practice, it really does deliver clear phone calls. It’s<strong> powered by six microphones that collaborate to lock in your voice and filter out background noise</strong>, wind and more. You can take calls from a busy street or a windy park and the person on the other end hears you clearly without competing noise.</p>



<p>Comfort is essential when you are wearing headphones for hours on end: The <strong>ear cushions employ soft, conforming foam</strong> that doesn’t develop pressure points, and the headband evenly distributes weight around your head. Materials feel high-quality with a refined finish; professional enough to use in work settings. The<strong> 254-gram weight puts these headphones right in the middle of premium over-ear headphones</strong>, light enough to comfortably wear but substantial enough to feel well-built.</p>
<p>With noise cancellation on, you can get up to <strong>24 hours of battery life</strong> which means multiple days of use between charges. Toggling on Immersion Mode with spatial audio reduces that to 18 hours, still likely more than enough for a week’s listenings for most people. A 15-minute charge gets you 2.5 hours of playback, which is enough to top off at lunchtime and make it through the afternoon.</p>
<p>For $329, you’ll get tech worth upwards of $400, backed by decades of expertise from Bose itself.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/apple-backs-this-anker-macbook-pro-charger-and-its-5-times-cheaper-on-amazon-than-its-official-site-2000641232</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/apple-backs-this-anker-macbook-pro-charger-and-it%E2%80%99s-5-times-cheaper-on-amazon-than-its-official-site.1343950/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Buying a charger directly from Apple is like paying a luxury price for basic functionality. A 70W USB-C power adapter from Apple’s official store costs $59 and if you want a USB-C cable to go along with it, you’re adding another $19 to $29 depending on the length. That’s close to $90 before tax for slower charging speeds than what this Anker charger delivers.</p>
<p>This <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5341/">Anker option packs 100W of power and includes a 5-foot cable, all for just $21 during this limited-time deal</a>, down from the usual $27. This isn’t some sketchy third-party accessory either: it’s from Anker, a brand that’s become synonymous with reliable charging gear and officially available in Apple Stores too.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5341/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Power That Matches Your MacBook’s Appetite</h2>
<p>The 100W output on this charger means you’re getting enough juice to fast-charge even the most power-hungry MacBooks. Apple’s 16-inch MacBook Pro with the M1 Max chip reaches 100% battery in just 1 hour and 20 minutes with this charger and matches the performance of Apple’s 140W charger in most charging scenarios. The difference comes down to the power delivery protocols: both chargers support USB Power Delivery 3.0, which intelligently negotiates the right amount of power for your device.</p>
<p>When you plug in a device, Anker’s PowerIQ 3.0 technology automatically detects what that is and adjusts the power output accordingly. Plug in your iPhone, and it will pass on the appropriate 20W for fast charging. Swap for a Samsung Galaxy S25 and it will push full power the phone can handle. Connect a Dell XPS or HP Spectre laptop, and it will negotiate the optimal charging speed. That makes this single charger compatible with a wide array of devices, replacing multiple other chargers and helping to cut down on the cable mess in your bag. It<strong> comes with a 5-foot USB-C-to-USB-C cable which supports a full 100W power transfer</strong>, meaning you do not need to buy a separate high-wattage-compatible cable.</p>



<p>Standard chargers jut out awkwardly in bags and catch on clothes and scratching other items. This Anker charger folds flat, creating a smooth profile that slides easily into laptop sleeves or even jacket pockets. The compact size measures roughly 2.5 inches on each side and about an inch thick, <strong>taking up less space than Apple’s 96W brick and significantly smaller than their 140W charger</strong>.</p>



<p>ActiveShield technology runs 24/7 and <strong>performs more than 3 million temperature checks daily</strong> on the charger. The moment it starts running hot from extended use or environmental elements, it automatically adjusts power output to cool things down. That prevents overheating damage to both the charger and your devices, with a considerable extension of their life span. The system is completed by protection against overcharging, short circuits, and power surges for increased peace of mind when leaving devices plugged in overnight or during long work sessions.</p>
<p>Apple wants $59 for a slower 70W charger that doesn’t include any cable. Their 96W charger will set you back $79 without cable as well. This Anker setup gives you more power than either one, throws in a quality cable, and costs $21. You could get backups for home and office at this price and still come out spending less than one Apple charger.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/lenovo-thinkpad-with-ryzen-7-chip-priced-like-a-mid-range-laptop-and-its-not-a-refurb-2000641221</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lenovo-thinkpad-with-ryzen-7-chip-priced-like-a-mid-range-laptop-and-it%E2%80%99s-not-a-refurb.1343941/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The ThinkPad has been the go-to business laptop for decades and for good reason: from CEOs to engineers, pros swear by them. You need a machine that can handle back-to-back video calls, crunch spreadsheets without lag, run multiple applications at once and still have juice for the commute home. The <strong>Lenovo ThinkPad E16 G2</strong> delivers all of that and more and packs premium specs into a proven design.</p>
<p>Right now, Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5340/">has dropped the price from $1,299 down to just $899, which marks an all-time low for this powerhouse laptop</a>. This isn’t some refurbished unit or stripped-down configuration: you’re getting a brand-new machine <strong>with 32GB of RAM, a 1TB SSD, and a Ryzen 7 processor</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5340/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Business-Grade Performance</h2>
<p>At the heart of this laptop is an <strong>AMD Ryzen 7 7735HS processor which boasts 8 cores and 16 threads</strong> to tackle your everyday tasks with much ease. With a base clock of 3.2GHz that boosts up to 4.75GHz when needed, this chip doesn’t break a sweat with demanding workloads. Run AutoCAD while streaming a training video and responding to Slack messages? No problem. The processor includes 4MB of L2 cache and 16MB of L3 cache which means frequently accessed data stays close to the CPU for faster retrieval.</p>
<p>The 32GB of DDR5 RAM gives you enough headroom to keep dozens of browser tabs open, work across multiple documents and run virtual machines if your job requires it. <strong>DDR5 is the latest memory standard</strong>&nbsp;and offers faster data transfer rates than DDR4 and better power efficiency. Match this with a 1TB PCIe NVMe SSD, and you have storage that’s fast enough to <strong>boot Windows 11 Pro in seconds</strong> and load large files almost instantly. The terabyte lets you store years of documents, presentations, and project files at your fingertips without being forced to resort to external drives or constant cloud uploads.</p>



<p>The <strong>16-inch display uses a WUXGA resolution of 1920×1200</strong>, which, in turn, provides more vertical space than the standard Full HD screens. The extra height you get when reviewing a long document or working with spreadsheets amounts to fewer scrolls, which in turn means better productivity. The IPS panel displays consistent colors from a variety of viewing angles, while the 300 nits of brightness make it possible to work well even in bright office environments or near windows. Integrated AMD Radeon 680M graphics handle everyday visual tasks and can even manage light gaming or basic video editing if you need a break.</p>



<p>Security features run deep on this ThinkPad: The fingerprint reader built into the power button uses biometric authentication for quick login while keeping unauthorized users out. The TPM 2.0 chip encrypts sensitive data and prevents the system from booting if anyone tampers with the hardware. A physical privacy shutter covers the 1080p webcam when you’re not using it, eliminating concerns about unauthorized viewing.</p>
<p>Connectivity covers all the bases with a <strong>mix of USB-A and USB-C ports supporting up to 10Gbps</strong>. Two USB-C ports support Power Delivery 3.0 and DisplayPort 1.4, so you can charge the laptop and connect an external monitor via the same port. The HDMI 2.1 port supports 4K display at 60Hz, perfect for presentations or doing a dual-monitor setup at your desk.</p>
<p>At $899 for early Black Friday, you’re getting a laptop that would normally cost over $1,200.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/govee-clears-out-it-led-smart-light-bulbs-at-practically-giveaway-pricing-just-9-5-each-2000641067</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/govee-clears-out-it-led-smart-light-bulbs-at-practically-giveaway-pricing-just-9-5-each.1343929/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>You don’t have to stick to basic, boring white bulbs anymore and you definitely don’t need to change the entire wiring in your home to add smarter lighting. <em>Govee</em> makes the upgrade easy with its wide range of smart bulbs, and we just spotted a solid pair going for less on Amazon.</p>
<p>Currently, you can grab a <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5338/">2 pack of Govee LED Smart Light Bulbs for just $19, which is a little over $9 per bulb</a>. The only thing to note is that this deal is currently <strong>exclusive to Prime members</strong>. If you already have Prime, you’re good to go. If not, you might want to consider signing up, especially with the holiday season coming up.</p>
<p>Amazon usually rolls out some of its biggest discounts for Prime users during Black Friday and Cyber Monday. The retailer also offers a 7-day free trial, which gives you access to the deal (and free shipping) without any immediate commitment. After the trial, it’s going to run you around $15 a month, but you’re likely going to make that money back quickly through exclusive discounts and free shipping if you order often!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5338/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Millions of Colors to Choose From</h2>
<p>For less than $20, you’re getting a pair of smart light bulbs that are easy to install and can be controlled remotely via Govee Home App or smart assistants like Alexa or Google Assistant. Each bulb offers a <strong>brightness of up to 1000 lumens</strong>&nbsp;which is equivalent to a traditional 75W bulb. You can adjust the brightness from 1 to 100%, plus choose from over 16 million colors. These are also tunable between warm white and cool daylight (2700K to 6500K), so you can shift the vibe of your space from focused to relaxed within seconds.</p>



<p>The Govee Home app gives you access to up to 54 scene modes for your Wi-Fi light bulbs, and you can even create a fun lighting schedule for your day. Maybe go for a brighter setting during the day, and slowly wind down with a cozy, warm light; the options are endless.</p>
<p>There’s also a music sync feature that lets the bulbs change colors based on sound detected by your phone’s microphone. Just keep in mind that you’ll need a stable 2.4GHz Wi-Fi connection to get started, and these are not compatible with smart switches.</p>
<p>Want more bulbs? The 4-pack and 8-pack bundles are also on sale for $39 and $79.</p>

                <p>There are a lot of questions about the future of Xbox as a brand, when games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-outer-worlds-2/" data-ref-id="5000-533237">The Outer Worlds 2</a> and even its signature shooter, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/halo-campaign-evolved/" data-ref-id="5000-700149">Halo</a>, is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-is-coming-to-playstation-for-the-first-time/1100-6535696/" data-ref-id="1100-6535696">coming to PlayStation 5</a>. Microsoft is reportedly working on the next generation of Xbox, but the outlook doesn't look promising. However, Xbox's perceived decline doesn't mean that consoles are dead, according a prominent video game analyst.</p><p>Rhys Elliott's <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/octobers-top-playstation-games-by" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Alinea Insight newsletter</a> has shared the estimated sales for PlayStation 5 games in October 2025, and the two big winners were <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-6/" data-ref-id="5000-687940">Battlefield 6</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ea-sports-fc-26/" data-ref-id="5000-686587">EA Sports FC 26</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ghost-of-yotei/" data-ref-id="5000-645132">Ghost of Yotei</a>, with 3.2 million, 3 million, and 2.7 million in sales, respectively. The trio's nearly combined 9 million in sales led Elliott to remark, "AAA games, live services, and single-player alike, are still thriving on console. The 'CoNsOlE iS DeAd' narrative is getting annoying. Xbox as a console is dying, yes. But let's not extrapolate that too far, eh?"</p><p>Publishing Xbox games on PlayStation 5 has already paid dividends for Microsoft. Several of Microsoft's formerly exclusive titles <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-games-are-dominating-ps5-sales-charts-but-another-game-reigned-supreme/2900-6827/#1" data-ref-id="2900-6827">dominated the PlayStation sales charts</a> earlier this year.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/minecraft/" data-ref-id="5000-73990">Minecraft</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v/" data-ref-id="5000-108839">Grand Theft Auto 5</a> both placed in the top 10, at fourth and seventh, respectively. That's thanks in part to a continuous flow of new content via Minecraft expansions and GTA Online. Additionally, EA Sports took three of the top 10 slots between FC 26, FC 25, and Madden NFL 26. Take-Two's NBA 2K26 took the fifth slot with 564,000 copies sold for the month.</p><p>Alinea Insight's top 10 best-selling PS5 games for October 2025 and their estimated sales are reproduced below.</p><ol><li>Battlefield 6 - 3.2 million</li><li>EA Sports FC 26 - 3.0 million</li><li>Ghost of Yotei - 2.7 million</li><li>Minecraft - 635,000</li><li>NBA 2K26 - 564,000</li><li>EA FC 25 - 350,000</li><li>Grand Theft Auto 5 - 338,000</li><li>EA Madden NFL 26 - 261,000</li><li>Little Nightmares 3 - 245,000</li><li>Digimon Story: Time Stranger - 241,000</li></ol>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/govee-clears-out-its-color-floor-lamp-now-cheaper-than-a-budget-lamp-on-amazon-2000641217</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/govee-clears-out-its-color-floor-lamp-now-cheaper-than-a-budget-lamp-on-amazon.1343911/</guid>

              <p>There’s just something magical about how the right lighting can completely turn a room around – turn a cold corner into a cozy reading nook or make your living space seem like it’s pulled from a design magazine. Good lighting doesn’t just brighten things up: it sets the mood, creates atmosphere and, honestly, just makes you want to spend more time in your own home. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4546/">Usually $99, Amazon has slashed the price of the Govee RGBIC floor lamp to just $69</a>, which happens to be an all-time low for this <strong>#1 bestselling floor lamp</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4546/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Make Your Home Smarter</h2>
<p>The Govee floor lamp packs some seriously impressive tech into its sleek black design: W<strong>ith 1000 lumens of brightness</strong>, this lamp delivers enough light to properly illuminate a bedroom or living room without needing multiple fixtures. That’s <strong>roughly equivalent to a 75-watt incandescent bulb</strong> but with infinitely more flexibility. The RGBIC technology is where things get interesting: unlike basic RGB lamps that display one color at a time, <strong>RGBIC allows multiple colors to appear simultaneously across different sections of the lamp</strong>.</p>
<p>The lamp is integrated perfectly with Alexa for complete voice control. Forgot to turn off the lamp while getting into bed? Just ask Alexa to do that. Want to dim the lights for movie night without getting up from the couch? Voice commands, of course! The Govee Home app <strong>gives you access to more than 16 million color combinations</strong> which sounds kind of excessive until you realize just how regularly you’ll actually adjust the settings to suit different occasions. Dinner party? Warm amber tones.</p>



<p>Another feature that makes this more than just a simple lamp is the music sync: It <strong>pulses in real time to whatever you’re listening to</strong>, changing colors to go with the beat. Throw on some upbeat music, and it’s an instant dance party. This works via the app’s microphone detection, so nothing too complicated in terms of setup-just turn on music sync mode and let it do its thing. It’s great for entertaining small groups or just adding an element of fun to your solo dance sessions.</p>
<p>Attention should also be turned to the design itself: This is a<strong> corner lamp which means it’s specifically shaped to tuck into those awkward spaces</strong> that most furniture can’t fill properly. The tall and slender profile takes up very little floor space while maximizing vertical lighting coverage. <strong>About 62 inches tall</strong>, it reaches high enough to cast light across an entire room rather than just illuminating a small radius around its base.</p>



<p>Setup takes minutes, not hours: Plug it in, download the Govee Home app, connect it to your WiFi and you’re ready to start customizing. The app contains dozens of <strong>preset scenes</strong> designed by Govee’s team—things like “Ocean,” “Sunset,” and “Aurora”—so you don’t have to spend time creating custom scenes if you’d rather just pick something that works. But if you do want to get creative,<strong> DIY mode lets you tap into specific colors</strong> for different segments of the lamp and save your creations for later use.</p>
<p>At $69, you’re getting smart home integration, music reactivity, millions of color options, and enough brightness to actually function as primary lighting – all for $30 less than usual.</p>

  <div>
      <div><p>The newest crowdfunding campaign by the <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="6d78830c-46d2-4911-8370-fd1532625bb8" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/dungeon-dudes-talk-dungeons-of-drakkenheim-on-dd-beyond-what-to-expect-and" rel="nofollow">Dungeon Dudes</a> has gone live. The aptly named <em>Dungeons of Drakkenheim: Daggerheart</em> aims to adapt the award-winning campaign to Darrington Press' fantasy TTRPG. It was fully funded in just 13 minutes.</p>

<h2>The <em>Dungeons of Drakkenheim: Daggerheart</em> Campaign</h2>

<p>According to the official campaign page, <em>Dungeons of Drakkenheim: Daggerheart</em> will bring every faction, intrigue, and horror of the original campaign to Darrington Press' <em>Daggerheart</em> system.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dungeons-of-drakkenheim-daggerheart-contaminated-cards.jpg?itok=Hf9NT5Fq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dungeons-of-drakkenheim-daggerheart-contaminated-cards.jpg?itok=mPt53uEy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This will not be a simple conversion. Joining the Dungeon Dudes' team on this project is <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/daggerheart-review-narrative-forward-yes-and-ttrpg-that-is-force-to-be-reckoned" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Daggerheart</em></a> designer, Mike Underwood. This is to ensure this adaptation is built from the ground up to retain the excitement and intensity of the original <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dungeons-of-drakkenheim-now-available-on-dd-beyond" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons of Drakkenheim</em></a> experience. Said experience is a sandbox-style campaign designed for characters at levels 1-10.</p>

<p>For enterprising GMs, the <em>Dungeons of Drakkenheim: Daggerheart</em> campaign will include official mechanics for the game's contaminations, mutations, and anomalies. This is because the titular Drakkenheim setting is a wasteland ravaged by an eldritch storm of otherworldly magic. These can be used as intended in this campaign, or can be adapted into your own home game of <em>Daggerheart</em>.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>One of these mechanics is the new Contaminated Domain cards. As your characters' contamination rises, they lose equal levels of Hope, a vital resource in <em>Daggerheart</em>. The trade-off is access to new card abilities, which you must give the GM Fear to use. Fear a GM can use to make the next challenge more harrowing.</p>

<p>The pledge tiers for <em>Dungeons of Drakkenheim: Daggerheart</em> are as follows:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Digital for $30:</strong> A PDF of the campaign guide, character sheets, and a set of miniature STLs</li>
	<li><strong>Core Book for $60:</strong> Everything in the Digital tier, a physical campaign book, a poster set, and a set of resin miniatures</li>
	<li><strong>Digital Deluxe for $70:</strong> Everything from the Digital tier, digital card deck, digital GM cheat sheets, and VTT access on Demiplane and Roll20</li>
	<li><strong>Core Set for $170:</strong> Everything from the Core Book and Digital Deluxe tier, a physical GM Screen, a set of resin dice, a card deck, and an STL file for a Fear Tracker</li>
	<li><strong>Deluxe Set for $295:</strong> Everything from the Core Set tier, a physical Special Edition campaign book, a premium dice tray, and a unique set of gemstone dice</li>
</ul><p>At the time of writing, the <em>Dungeons of Drakkenheim: Daggerheart</em> campaign has raised&nbsp;<span><span>$123,612, more than six times its initial funding goal. The campaign ends on November 28..</span></span></p>

As part of an update that’s currently on the Steam Deck’s Beta and Preview channels, the handheld can “complete all active downloads in a new display-off low-power mode before going to sleep,” <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fnews%2Fapp%2F1675200%2Fview%2F771930569635267984" rel="sponsored">Valve says</a>.</p><p>I’m glad this change is in the works; I download a lot of games and updates on my Steam Deck and I have often wished that I didn’t have to leave the display on while doing so. <em>The Verge</em> asked Valve about this two years ago when the Steam Deck OLED launched, and the company seemed to think Deck was good enough without it.</p><p>“We burn a substantial amount of power when you’re downloading,” hardware engineer Yazan Aldehayyat said at the time, suggesting to us that players might not want to accidentally leave a hot Steam Deck in their bag if they mistakenly think it’s asleep. Valve’s solution announced today seems to solve some of those concerns.</p><p>With the update installed, when you press the power button while your Deck is downloading something, you’ll see a new dialog that asks if you want to keep downloading but have the screen off. If you choose Continue, your Deck will enter the low-power mode. “While in this mode, if you press a button or move Steam Deck, a new status screen will be shown with download progress,” Valve says. “From here you can fully wake Steam Deck or let it continue downloading with the screen off.”</p><p>The feature is on by default when your Steam Deck is plugged in. You can also choose to enable it while running on battery in settings, though if your Steam Deck falls below 20 percent battery, your device will go into full sleep mode.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/813864/valve-steam-deck-screen-download-games-low-power-screen-off]]></content:encoded>

              <p>Star Wars fans, it’s a great time to bring some important pieces of the galaxy far, far away into your own space. LEGO introduced its 25th Anniversary Star Wars collection to celebrate some of the most iconic ships in the saga, and if you’ve ever wanted your very own Millennium Falcon model, now is a great time to grab one at a discounted rate.</p>
<p>Amazon has dropped the price <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4190/">of LEGO Star Wars Millennium Falcon to $67, which is 20% off its regular $84 price</a>. It’s part of the brand’s special anniversary lineup, and the level of detail here is impressive. Such exclusive sets don’t really stay on sale for long, so it’s best to get your orders in sooner rather than later. The deal is open to both Prime and non-Prime members, but Prime members will also enjoy free shipping on their orders.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4190/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Build Your Own Starship Collection</h2>
<p>This collectible build-and-display model lets you build a mid-scale brick recreation of one of the most iconic ships, and comes with 921 pieces in total. It hits that sweet spot; not too massive, but not so simple that you’re done before you’ve even settled in. LEGO packs it with details like the cockpit, satellite dish, and dual cannons. Even better, there’s a buildable stand to place the ship on. It includes a nameplate and a special 25th Anniversary LEGO Star Wars brick. You can even position the Falcon at a dynamic angle for a more realistic, mid-flight look.</p>



<p>The set also fits nicely into the Starship collection by LEGO, so you can always add more ships down the line if you’re planning to build out a full display. Putting it together won’t be too complicated, as it comes with a handy instruction book that takes you step by step through the entire build. The instruction book is quite detailed on its own, but if you need extra help, you can also use the LEGO Builder app.</p>
<p>Once completed, the Millennium Falcon measures just over 5 inches high, 9.5 inches long, and 7.5 inches wide. Place it on your bookshelf or your desk – it’s sure to impress anyone who sees it.</p>
<p>Just note that there’s no telling how long the discount will last, so it’s best to get your orders in soon.</p>

                <p>Roguelite is one of the hottest subgenres in gaming right now. From Balatro to Drop Duchy, developers have integrated cyclical mechanics into all sorts of other genres. Independent studios eSolu and Team Mojo Games are adding another game to the subgenre with Odds Chronicles.</p><p>Odds Chronicles combines grid-based combat, a roguelite run structure, and dice mechanics to create its overall package. Each roll of the dice will give your team different resources, including attributes like strength and magic.</p><p>Dice-based roguelites and roguelikes, including standouts like Dicey Dungeons, have been around for some time, but new takes on rolling the dice are welcome. Bringing dice mechanics into a turn-based grid tactics game is a nice way to build off the SOCOM-like percentages that decide whether or not you'll land your attacks.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLu87b8jN58" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MLu87b8jN58" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>We don't have much to go on besides the reveal trailer, but the gameplay and visuals look polished enough to make Odds Chronicles stand out among a sea of other roguelites. The tactical roguelite will launch on Steam and Epic Games Store in 2026, with versions for PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, and Xbox Series X|S arriving later.</p>

                <p>As you work your way through Tian Wen's questline in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a>, you'll eventually begin a quest called Market Correction, which tasks you with finding and sabotaging a cache in the Buried City. This quest is relatively straightforward in execution, but finding the precise spot where the cache is located might prove a bit tricky--especially in the midst of chaotic battles with the ARC and other raiders who may be working on the same quest.</p><p>When you're ready to complete Market Correction, you can follow the steps below to round up the cache at Marano Station and be one step closer to finishing up Tian Wen's expectations for you.</p><h2>Where to find the cache at Marano Station in Arc Raiders</h2><p>Market Correction takes place in the Buried City map. You won't need to extract to complete the quest, so feel free to load in using a Free Loadout if you're worried you might not make it back alive.</p><p>Your destination is Marano Station, which is located on the northwestern side of the map in the Outskirts area. This whole side of the map is filled with debris and walls for cover, so you can sneak your way into Marano Station without too many worries.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4596469-arcraiders_20251103203704.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4596469" data-ratio="0.56110434429557" data-width="2463" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4596469-arcraiders_20251103203704.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4596469"></a><figcaption>Marano Station is located in the northwestern corner of Buried City.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4596469-arcraiders_20251103203704.jpg"></figure><p>When you arrive, you'll be looking for a set of canisters against a wall at the station. There are two different sets of these near each other, but you need to visit the ones in the north. </p><p>When you've discovered the correct canisters at Marano Station, interact with them once to identify the cache. Afterward, interact with them a second time to sabotage the cache. Doing so will complete the quest for Tian Wen.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4596472-arcraiders_20251103203717.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4596472" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4596472-arcraiders_20251103203717.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4596472"></a><figcaption>You'll find the cache in the canisters here.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4596472-arcraiders_20251103203717.jpg"></figure><p>You're now free to extract (or die trying). The Northern Station beside the nearby Library is likely to be your best bet. Passing through this point of interest will let you do some looting, too, which isn't a bad idea given that you may be using a Free Loadout and don't have much to lose by running into aggressive raiders.</p><p>If you're curious about what else is coming up, check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-full-quest-list/1100-6535922/" data-ref-id="1100-6535922">every quest in Arc Raiders</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 is due out on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC in just ten days from the time of this writing, on November 14, 2025. Now that <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-launches-game-ready-driver-black-ops-7-ffvii-rebirth-adds-frame-generation/">graphics card drivers are already being pushed ahead</a> of its arrival, Activision has already put out a launch trailer for the game, and more importantly, has finally put out a PC specs chart, including a small word on the specs for handheld PCs.</p>



<p>The new trailer is mostly a cinematic look at the various modes you get in Black Ops 7, with action shots of the campaign, the multiplayer, and zombies.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 | Launch Trailer (PC Features Spotlight)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8Ry41LBsSuQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The PC specs are the more intriguing part of today's reveal, if only because they're not too demanding. Here's the minimum specs:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>OS:</strong>&nbsp;Windows 10 64 Bit (latest update)</li>



<li><strong>CPU:</strong>&nbsp;AMD Ryzen 5 1400 or Intel Core i5-6600</li>



<li><strong>RAM:</strong>&nbsp;8 GB</li>



<li><strong>Video Card:</strong>&nbsp;AMD Radeon RX 470 or NVIDIA GeForce GTX 970 / 1060 or Intel Arc A580</li>



<li><strong>Video Memory:</strong>&nbsp;3 GB</li>



<li><strong>Storage Space:</strong>&nbsp;SSD with 115 GB&nbsp;available space at launch</li>
</ul>



<p>The recommended specs:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>OS:</strong>&nbsp;Windows 11 64 Bit (latest update)</li>



<li><strong>CPU:</strong>&nbsp;AMD Ryzen 5 1600X or Intel Core i7-6700K</li>



<li><strong>RAM:</strong>&nbsp;12 GB</li>



<li><strong>Video Card:</strong>&nbsp;AMD Radeon RX 6600XT or NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 or Intel Arc B580</li>



<li><strong>Video Memory:</strong>&nbsp;8 GB</li>



<li><strong>Storage Space:</strong>&nbsp;SSD with 115 GB&nbsp;available space at launch</li>
</ul>



<p>And the specs for players that want to play at 4K:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>OS:</strong>&nbsp;Windows 11 64 Bit (latest update)</li>



<li><strong>CPU:</strong>&nbsp;AMD Ryzen 5 5600X or Intel Core i7-10700K</li>



<li><strong>RAM:</strong>&nbsp;16 GB</li>



<li><strong>Video Card:</strong>&nbsp;AMD Radeon RX 9070XT or NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 / 5070</li>



<li><strong>Video Memory:</strong>&nbsp;16 GB</li>



<li><strong>Storage Space:</strong>&nbsp;SSD with 115 GB&nbsp;available space at launch</li>
</ul>



<p>Here's the full specs chart:</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 PC specs. Image credit: Activision</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The most unfortunate part of this specs chart is how little is said about PC handheld optimization. On the <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/ca/en/blog/2025/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-pc-trailer-specs-preloading-handheld-systems">Call of Duty blog</a>, Activision writes, "<em></em><em>Black Ops 7</em>&nbsp;ships fully tuned for supported PC handhelds, including the ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X. The developers enhanced UI legibility, scaled every screen for smaller displays, and optimized the game to deliver smooth performance without sacrificing image quality. With native control support, it’s easy to drop in and start playing right away."</p>



<p>That's nice to hear but it lacks any real specifications about how the game will run on PC handhelds, like the recently released ROG Xbox Ally X (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-this-is-an-xbox/">which you can check out our review for here</a>). Hopefully, we'll get a better sense of how it runs ahead of launch, though, with how close we are to that, it seems PC handheld users will either get a great experience on launch, or the lack of details here is a sign of poor performance to come.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This year <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/box-office-demon-slayer-infinity-castle-biggest-anime-opening-1236516498/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Demon Slayer: Infinity Castle</em> </a>and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/chainsaw-man-movie-reze-arc-box-office-weekend-premiere/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Chainsaw Man – The Movie: Reze Arc</em></a> played spoiler at the box office in their respective opening weekends (for the pocket-watching pundits among us), aweing moviegoers with the indescribable spark of magic animation. Anime has legs and is worth taking seriously as a new direction in cinema. Instead of addressing the 2D elephant of a lesson in the face, Hollywood said, “You know what the world really needs? More live-action anime films.”</p><p>According to an exclusive report from <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/11/chloe-zhao-manga-kodansha-studios-1236605962/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Deadline</a> (on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/kodansha.us/post/3m4qpg6tpu32x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">manga day</a>, no less), Chloé Zhao, two-time Oscar winner behind<em> Nomadland</em> and Marvel’s <em>Eternals</em>, and Nicholas Gonda are teaming up with manga publisher <a href="https://aftermath.site/heres-the-dumb-shit-you-have-to-put-up-with-to-read-manga-these-days" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kodansha</a> to head up a global studio called Kodansha Studios. Kodansha Studios, in turn, will exist for the express purpose of creating “premium, live action movies and television series” based on manga from Kodansha. To break this down in comic book movie terms, Kodansha is pulling a DC Studios by having Zhao and Gonda become their <a href="https://gizmodo.com/james-gunn-head-of-dc-movies-and-tv-warner-bros-1849701460" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">James Gunn and Peter Safran</a>, guiding a <a href="https://gizmodo.com/report-david-zaslav-pushed-back-on-ta-nahesi-coates-black-superman-movie-for-being-too-woke-2000628090" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new era of live-action anime films</a> to a cinematic golden age. All the while, ensuring quality control, fostering healthy communication between international directors and manga creators, and developing solid scripts to bring their work to light. Hopefully, this will make the phrase “live-action anime film” less of a punchline than it has been over the past decade by utilizing Kodansha's manga catalog.&nbsp;</p><p>On paper, all of it sounds lovely, set against the haphazard wild west of <a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-one-piece-yu-yu-hakusho-anime-live-action-netfl-1850050620" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">random-ass live-action Hollywood adaptations</a> that have seen the light of day and are looming menacingly over the horizon. But it's hard not to reflexively recoil when the Deadline piece namedrops “beloved manga” like Katsuhiro Otomo’s <em>Akira</em>,<em> </em>and go, “God dammit, they’re gonna try doing it again.”</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="The Impact of Akira: The Film that Changed Everything" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IqVoEpRIaKg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>If there is any anime that could be considered Hollywood’s Moby Dick, it is <em>Akira</em>. Still, Kodansha Studios' mere existence essentially shows that, despite decades of false starts, studio reshuffles, and directorial ghosting—such as <a href="https://gizmodo.com/warner-bros-gives-up-on-akira-remake-but-hollywood-wont-2000621686" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warner Bros. shelving its version</a> in the early 2000s, <a href="https://gizmodo.com/jordan-peele-nope-akira-adaption-references-film-1850048374" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jordan Peele</a> politely declining, and <a href="https://gizmodo.com/taika-waititi-still-plans-on-directing-akira-eventuall-1839207999" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Taika Waititi</a> eventually withdrawing after years of development hell—<em>Akira</em> remains Hollywood’s promised-yet-elusive cash cow. With Kodansha Studios declaring its raison d’être as “premium live-action projects” (whatever that means), the thought that <em>Akira </em>might be their flagship effort feels like creative ambition and more like comedic arrogance. Should <em>Akira </em>prove to be the hill Kodansha Studios chose to die on, with the promise of guaranteed success because it’s popular, it’s hard not to stifle a laugh at the thought of it still attempting to see the light of day.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="RARE // MAKING OF AKIRA DOCUMENTARY FROM 1988 // ENGLISH SUBS" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BXsar5rpgwg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Tokyo Movie Shinsha’s 1988 <a href="https://gizmodo.com/akira-35-year-retrospective-impact-1850645834" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Akira</em></a> isn’t just a sci-fi anime film. It’s a miracle. A once-in-history convergence built on unheard-of budget, artistic labor, and technical muscle that animated over 160,000 cels and hand-painted matte backgrounds with the kind of obsessive artistry that <a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/news/latest/2020/6/8/akira-anime-film-producer-corrects-30-year-fact-on-how-much-the-groundbreaking-film-cost-to-make?srsltid=AfmBOorrcZSOtdh698GQTcySSmgOi-xMhlmUSUnrM1vhjt7qmmXVFb0E" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">no studio today could bankroll</a>. The film isn’t just looked back on as lightning in a bottle but as a global flag-planting moment that declared anime as a cutting-edge art form worth taking seriously. Threatening to recapture it in live action isn’t just misguided—it verges on being creatively bankrupt. Undeterred by taste, history, hubris, or the sheer impossibility of doing it justice.&nbsp;</p><p>To quote YouTuber Cosmonaut Marcus in his succinctly titled video, <a href="https://youtu.be/f9I-s2UwxZk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Why I Hate Live-Action Anime Adaptations</a>, “If you agree to adapt an anime into a live-action TV show or movie for Hollywood, then it means that you are already disrespecting the source material because in any great animated work, the beauty goes beyond the story or the characters, usually it's good because it's animated.”&nbsp;</p><p>While I’m <a href="https://aftermath.site/bet-kakegurui-netflix-live-action-anime" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a bit of a sicko</a> who likes some live-action adaptations on their own merits, I agree with the latter half of Marcus’ take. Roughly 90 percent of why anime fans like the medium is the moving drawings. So reading this news in concert with Sony, through its <a href="https://gizmodo.com/sonys-potential-kadokawa-acquisition-could-tighten-its-grip-on-anime-and-manga-2000526376" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fucked up homunculus merger with Kadokawa</a>, also plans to <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/anime-movies/sony-is-stepping-up-its-plans-for-more-live-action-movie-adaptations-of-anime-and-manga-properties/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ramp up its live-action efforts</a>, despite their direct financial success from <em>Demon Slayer</em> and <em>Chainsaw Man</em>, has me both fucking exasperated and side-eyeing Kodansha Studios playing follow the leader.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Tokyo Movie Shinsha</span></figcaption></figure><p>It’s not like Kodansha hasn’t had successes with already-made anime adaptations of its works; they're special because they're animated beautifully, filling in the gaps in manga panel artistry for anime fans without losing their artistry. And Kodansha’s library has proven to yield some of the most memorable anime films, like <em>Weathering With</em> <em>You </em>and <em>A Silent Voice</em>—<em>anime</em> films being the operative word.&nbsp;</p><p>Playing devil's advocate, there are exceptions to the rule of live action adaptations not being an entire crapshoot, but mainly as a reflection in fans' eyes in retrospect as cult classic hits with the likes of Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt-led<em> </em><a href="https://gizmodo.com/all-you-need-is-kill-anime-movie-trailer-edge-of-tomorrow-warner-bros-2000575528" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Live Die Repeat</em></a> and The Wachowskis’ <em>Speed Racer</em> (pound for pound <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwh9ETdhrf4&amp;t=2980s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the best live action anime film of all time</a>). There’s even been pretty decent live-action ventures in the past, like <a href="https://kotaku.com/what-we-loved-no-really-about-alita-battle-angel-1832758443" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Alita Battle Angel</em></a>, and that Netflix adaptation of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLfE-WiHAWU&amp;pp=ygUdbGFzdCBzYW11cmFpIHN0YW5kaW5nIG5ldGZsaXjSBwkJAwoBhyohjO8%3D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Last Samurai Standing</em></a> looks promising. But for every success, there’s also monumental failures from leveraging Kodansha’s catalogue for live-action works—your Scarlett Johansson-led <a href="https://www.wyomingnewspapers.org/?a=d&amp;d=WYWPN20170501-01.1.7&amp;srpos=1&amp;e=-------en-20-WYWPN-1--img-txIN%7CtxCO%7CtxTA-isaiah+colbert+ghost+in+the+shell-------0------" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Ghost in the Shell</em></a>.</p><p>Should Zhao and Gonda prove masterful international directors and original mangaka matchmakers, bringing underappreciated gems into the mainstream with “premium” live-action projects for works like all power to them. Works less likely to make folks reflexively throw their arms up like hearing “live action <a href="https://kotaku.com/my-hero-academia-netflix-live-action-anime-bnha-movie-1849883927" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>My Hero Academia</em></a> or live action <a href="https://gizmodo.com/naruto-live-action-film-lionsgate-1851047617" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Naruto</em></a>,” not helping themselves by going for big-spectacle, fantasy-laden shonen hits with an even larger margin for error, for the disrespect Marcus mentioned earlier, to bring it to live action and look shit. If the first of their projects is <em>Akira</em>, <a href="https://gizmodo.com/gachiakuta-doesnt-just-redefine-shonen-anime-it-anoints-itself-as-the-next-big-thing-2000622249" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Gachiakuta</em></a><em>,</em> <em>Fire Punch</em>, or <em>Shangra La Frontier</em>, because they’re popular fantastical works, then all good will for Kodansha Studios is lost.</p><p>If Kodansha Studios instead invests in showcasing its creative skills through greenlighting live-action series and films based on more realistic sleeper hits in seinen and shojo genres, like <em>Princess Jellyfish</em>, <em>Blue Period</em>,<em> Hajime no Ippo</em>, or (<a href="https://gizmodo.com/vinland-saga-creator-makoto-yukimura-looks-back-on-writing-his-pacifist-viking-epic-2000664303" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gulp</a>) <em>Vinland Saga,</em> then, and only then, can it flirt with its strength as a studio capable of delivering on its promises for all its so-called premium projects. Do that, and I can have faith in prospective Kodansha Studio live-action adaptations of series like <em>Knights of Sidonia</em>, <em>Land of the Lustrous</em>, <em>To Your Eternity</em>, <em>Tower Dungeon</em>, and be less gun-shy about them possibly tackling <em>Akira</em>.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/i-owe-my-workday-to-criterion-24-7"><h3>I Owe My Workday To Criterion 24/7</h3></a><p>If you’re going to have cotton candy, you have to eat your vegetables too.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/europa-universalis-v-review-impressions-paradox-pc-eu5"><h3>How Am I Supposed To Review Europa Universalis V</h3></a><p>There is simply too much video game here, and it's always in motion</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-halo-white-house-trump-vance"><h3>And Also, Who Even Cares About Halo And Lord Of The Rings These Days</h3></a><p>"All of these things do have a feeling of dragging and resuscitating a corpse"</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/kodansha-studios-akira-anime-live-ation-chloe-zhao-nicolas-gonda]]></content:encoded>

Responding to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SBCGaming/comments/1om4iv2/arduboy_fxc_announced/">Reddit users commenting on the increased price</a> over the older $79 Arduboy FX, Bates says that $99 is “actually more than I want to charge but the tariff situation means this is the only way to stay in business.” But he also says a slightly cheaper Standard edition with green buttons will soon be available through Amazon with free shipping.</p><p>The Arduboy FX-C’s specs remain relatively basic with the same ATmega32u4 processor found on the <a href="https://store-usa.arduino.cc/products/arduino-micro?srsltid=AfmBOoq0SnxAgtXlFTwcfPhhW6ggBcVhVRXNkJz9QT_IXRMkVv5hywEi">Arduino Micro</a>, a 128×64-pixel OLED screen that can only show white pixels – no grayscale or anti-aliasing – and six buttons. And while the Arduboy FX included enough storage to hold 200 preloaded games, the new FX-C expands that to <a href="https://community.arduboy.com/c/games/35">accommodate 300 titles</a>, making the open source handheld even more accessible for those who just want to use it to play games, and not dive into developing their own.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><form><div><h2>The Verge Daily</h2><p><span>A free daily digest of the news that matters most.</span></p></div></form></div></div></article></div></main></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/813661/arduboy-fx-c-handheld-console-arduino-usb-c-multiplayer]]></content:encoded>
