<p>A Modern Warfare Remastered Mod called “H2M” has been “leaked” following a Cease and Desist from Activision.</p>



<p>Activision <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/activision-shuts-down-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-remastered-mod-aday-before-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">issued the Cease and Desist letter yesterday</a>, just a few hours before the Mod was set to go live. Taking to the Mod’s official Twitter account, the creators said, “Today, our team members received a Cease &amp; Desist order on behalf of Activision Publishing in relation to the H2M-Mod project. We are complying with this order and shutting down all operations immediately and permanently.”</p>



<p>However, a few hours after the announcement that its creators would abide by the Cease &amp; Desist, the Mod files “leaked” across several Discord servers. Around 800 people were playing the Mod at the time of writing, with thousands believed to have downloaded it.</p>



<p>The Call of Duty community has understandably put Activision under fire following its decision to issue a Cease &amp; Desist. Following a strong week of promotion of H2M by its creators, Modern Warfare Remastered became a top-selling title on Steam for days on end for the first time in nearly eight years. As a result, the community has questioned why Activision issued the C&amp;D just hours before its release, as the Mod was in development for years.</p>



<p>A petition to let the H2M Mod “live in peace” has already <a href="https://www.change.org/p/let-h2m-mod-live-in-peace" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">accumulated over 7000 petitions</a> at the time of writing.</p>



<p>It’s not entirely clear how Activision will handle the Mod being pushed online, but we’ll keep our readers updated if we hear more.</p>



<p>What do you think of the whole H2M mod situation? Let us know in the comments below.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-valve-deadlock-steam-gabe-newell<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There is much we can take away from <a href="https://aftermath.site/valve-deadlock-verge" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the recent furor</a> around Verge reporter Sean Hollister’s decision to do his job by revealing basic information about a new Valve game tens of thousands of people are playing, but it’s worth zooming out to examine how we got here. Valve isn’t just any company, and that goes a decent portion of the way toward explaining why people showed up with pitchforks and torches drawn to defend a game that hasn’t even been announced yet. On this week’s Aftermath Hours, we talk about that.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>We begin by surveying the aftermath (lol) of the drama surrounding <em>Deadlock</em>, Valve’s new hero shooter that hasn’t been officially announced yet, and one brave (read: normal) reporter’s decision to, well, report on it. Why, in an industry where regularly unreliable leakers amass hundreds of thousands of followers, did so many people object to a journalist writing about a game to which they obtained legitimate access and which they did not break any NDAs to write about?&nbsp;</p><p>Then we talk about the <a href="https://aftermath.site/helldivers-2-flamethrower-nerf-controversy-live-service" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">live service death spiral</a> that<em> Helldivers 2</em> now finds itself in a mere six months after receiving near-universal praise upon launch. At what point does live service, as a model, become destructive? Are games – and gamers – worse because of it?&nbsp;</p><p>Lastly, we discuss some cool games we’ve been playing, like <em>Crush House</em>, in which players must please reality TV-addled masses, and <em>Doom</em>, which might catch on someday.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we, like Valve, can spend years quietly working on dozens of interesting projects that ultimately never see the light of day.</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation:</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>I think about this compared to <em>Grand Theft Auto</em>. People in that community love when there are leaks. They love leakers. They follow them. They deify them, even though a lot of them are just lying. Like Chris was saying, there’s this different perception of Valve – that they’re a little mom ‘n’ pop shop that needs to be defended, even though they are, as I wrote about a couple weeks ago, <a href="https://aftermath.site/yanis-varoufakis-technofeudalism-valve-steam-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one of the pioneers of technofeudalism</a>. That’s about as far as you can get from being a mom ‘n’ pop shop, at least structurally and in terms of what you have wrought through your actions.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>That’s another question, too – and I think we were talking about this in Slack: this idea that Valve deserves it to be stuck to them in a way that other indie companies wouldn’t. This made me think a lot about, when you’re a journalist, you kinda weigh the consequences of your actions and public vs private, etc, and would you do this if it were not a Valve game? Maybe not. But I don’t know that that’s necessarily because Valve is a bad guy and you’re taking him down a peg as it is just the news value and the consequences.</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>But also I do think that it is a consequence of the strange dichotomy of having a low headcount to a company with a lot of resources – and the way that they have this sort of culture of exceptionalism. I highly recommend watching the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9aCwCKgkLo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">[People Make Games] documentary on the internal workings of Valve</a> and the contradictions in there, because it explains so much. It’s like special kid syndrome. It’s like libertarian special kid shit where people say “I don’t think 98 percent of people could work at Valve.” </p><p>That’s such an unwell thing to say. I think that’s incredibly wrong. I think that’s patently, provably wrong. There are very talented people who work at Valve, but the idea that they’re this sort of elite group of people – that they’re geniuses – is sort of baked into the foundations of the company. Whether or not that’s still the case or true, I hope for reform internally.&nbsp;</p><p>But it’s interesting to see even the audience for games turn when we were talking about <a href="https://aftermath.site/savetf2-you-can-finally-play-team-fortress-2-again-for-now" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how bad Valve fucked up on <em>Team Fortress 2</em></a>, like, a month ago. I think everyone has it in them to understand the contradictions of these two realities. But how much of the gaming industry are they skimming off of [with Steam], and what does that mean consequentially for the newsworthiness of any game they make?&nbsp;</p><p>On top of that, the development of Valve games is not the same as the development of an indie game. If you blow up the spot of an indie game that’s less consequential, you’ll be more perceived as a dick. But practically speaking, Valve is a company that people make conspiracy charts about whether or not a game is coming out. That is a materially different condition of newsworthiness. And maybe Valve wanted to do this [with<em> Deadlock</em>] so they don’t have to deal with this shit. I hope that’s the case, because that’s probably healthier for everybody involved.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> I was thinking about it, and there is this relationship people have to Valve, where they put the company up on a pedestal and have this almost parasocial relationship with it. They feel like they need to defend it. It is somehow their friend. And at first I was like, well, it’s kinda weird that they have that in this era where parasociality is otherwise about putting faces to names and being on camera – people making themselves presentable and accessible.&nbsp;</p><p>But I think that being so opaque – making it so hard to see into the black box – kind of serves Valve’s mythology. It serves the notion that they are geniuses. We don’t see many Valve folks get on camera and talk. We don’t hear them say things that are dumb or potentially wrong. So everyone is like “Yeah, they’re geniuses, because look at their output.” Steam is a huge success, and the only games they release, for the most part, are good. But that’s because they have all the time and money in the world to make sure they’re good. They can afford to just cancel everything else.&nbsp;</p><p>But holistically, when you have very little communication and all your output is that good, you end up in this place where people say “Yeah, they must be the best. They must be these unassailable, untouchable geniuses.” When in reality, it’s a product of circumstance and them refusing to talk.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-gets-extensive-preview-of-nvidia-rtx-effects-and-performance/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>With game reviews of Black Myth: Wukong finally out (including <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/black-myth-wukong-a-compelling-journey-into-chinese-tradition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ours</a>), NVIDIA is also taking the opportunity to share all the details of the game's full ray tracing implementation ahead of the launch on Tuesday 20.</p>
<p>First and foremost, thanks to multi-bounce ray-traced indirect lighting, natural colored light bounces up to twice throughout Black Myth: Wukong, creating more realistic indirect lighting and occlusion. A unified algorithm provides more accurate lighting of scenes and objects, making each scene as immersive as possible.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/black-myth-wukong-full-ray-tracing-comparison-full-resolution-multi-bounce-ray-traced-indirect-lighting-off-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>

<p>Compared to screen space reflections, ray traced reflections more closely mirror their surroundings, include bounced details, and are rendered at full resolution, accentuating the world and enhancing immersion. As seen in the comparison below provided by NVIDIA, still puddles offer a mirror-like surface of the surrounding area with greater detail when ray tracing is enabled.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/black-myth-wukong-full-ray-tracing-comparison-reflections-on-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>

<p>NVIDIA also revealed to have worked with Game Science to implement a world-first technique called ray traced particle reflections in Black Myth: Wukong. It renders order-independent transparencies for large sprite sets using two-level ray tracing, efficiently rendering the game's particle system in real-time reflections. You can see in the comparison below that fire is not reflected at all when ray tracing is disabled.</p>

<p>Ray traced caustics are not unheard of in games, but they are still very rare. This technology simulates the real-world effect of light rays being reflected and refracted by water, curved surfaces, and objects, creating unique light patterns on nearby surfaces such as riverbeds. Once again, ray tracing improves realism and immersion in Black Myth: Wukong.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/black-myth-wukong-full-ray-tracing-comparison-caustics-on-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>

<p>Last but not least, the game supports ray traced shadows, which add a pleasing richness to the fantasy environments with contact hardening and softening, self-shadowing, and higher levels of detail free of aliasing. Nearby objects project full and grounded shadows, and even fine details of distant and nested structures can be resolved for a more realistic image. Check out the comparison below.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/black-myth-wukong-full-ray-tracing-comparison-shadows-off-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>


<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/black-myth-wukong-full-ray-tracing-comparison-shadows-on-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>

<p>NVIDIA also offered a preview of the game's performance. According to the benchmarks shared, owners of the most powerful graphics card, the GeForce RTX 4090, can run the game at 4K with DLSS Super Resolution set to Performance Mode, DLSS Frame Generation enabled, and full ray tracing set to the maximum while nearly reaching 100 FPS. The RTX 4080 SUPER achieves 74 average FPS, while the 4070 Ti SUPER registered 66 FPS in the test.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>The Game Ready driver will be distributed next week, presumably before the official launch. As a reminder, the Black Myth: Wukong GeForce RTX 40 Series <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-geforce-rtx-40-series-bundle-announced-by-nvidia-dlss-3-comes-to-wuthering-waves/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bundle</a> can be purchased until August 20 (the release day). If you do not own a powerful enough PC, there's always the GeForce NOW <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-breaks-2000-games-milestone-will-support-black-myth-wukong-at-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">option</a> for cloud streaming.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/welcome-to-night-vale-rpg-comes-to-backerkit-this-october.955416/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/welcome-to-night-vale-rpg-comes-to-backerkit-this-october<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A year ago, Night Vale Presents and Renegade Game Studios announced an official <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/welcome-to-night-vale-ttrpg-announced" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Welcome to Night Vale</a> RPG. Since that announcement, details and developments have been bare. Thankfully, the publisher has given Night Vale fans a major update, including a launch date for the game's crowdfunding campaign.</p>
<h2>The <em>Welcome To Night Vale</em> RPG Backerkit Campaign</h2>
<p>According to an official newsletter by Renegade Game Studios, the <em>Welcome to Night Vale</em> RPG will be produced by a crowdfunding campaign on Backerkit. This is an understandable strategy given the built-in fanbase as well as the success of similar projects such as <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/magnus-archives-ttrpg-fully-funded-within-30-minutes" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>The Magnus Archives</em></a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/old-gods-of-appalachia-ttrpg-backed-in-11-minutes" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Old Gods of Appalachia</a> RPG campaigns.</p>

This is notable since this marks the first time Essence20 is being used for an RPG not based on a Hasbro toy property: <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/gi-joe-quartermasters-guide-to-gear-review-right-tool-for-job" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>GI Joe</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/power-rangers-beneath-helmet-review-herolife-balance" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Power Rangers</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/transformers-enigma-of-combination-review-new-meaning-of-teamwork" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Transformers</em></a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/my-little-pony-dark-skies-over-equestria-review-changeling-mischief" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>My Little Pony</em></a> respectively.</p>
<p>Given Essence20's focus on wild dice swings and numbers-lite player expression, it can feasibly work for a <em>Welcome to Night Vale</em> RPG. The satirical science fiction podcast debuted in 2012, and it spotlights a small desert town where all conspiracy theories are true.</p>
<p>It is a strong central conceit. One that is used for running gags and surreal standalone stories involving secret police, cults with unknowable powers, bizarre local events, and mysterious lights in the sky.</p>
<p>Since the podcast's debut, <em>Welcome to Night Vale </em>has seen several spin-offs. A live show debuted in 2015, which was produced into satirical albums including <em>The Haunting of Night Vale</em> and <em>The Thrilling Adventure Hour</em>. In addition, novels set in the Night Vale universe have been published, the most recent being 2020's <em>The Faceless Old Woman Who Secretly Lives In Your Home. </em></p>
<p>The <em>Welcome to Night Vale</em> podcast spans more than 250 episodes with episodes being uploaded biweekly to this day. The Backerkit campaign for the <em>Welcome to Night Vale</em> RPG goes live October 1.</p>

From the hand-drawn visuals to the cryptic lore tablets, and from the silent protagonist to the largely underground opening levels, I figured it would tickle the same part of my brain that adores the likes of Hollow Knight. But Beyond Brave seems to put a far heavier emphasis on grounded combat--more than I'm used to when it comes to a metroidvania. In the hour demo I played, I never quite got used to it, but the Slavic folklore-inspired world seems interesting and I want to try the game some more if only to see more of it.</p><p dir="ltr">In Beyond Brave, you play as the titular Marko, a warrior who fits the strong-and-silent archetype for a metroidvania protagonist to a T. When his village is attacked by Entropy, he and his fellow warriors attempt to fight back and immediately fail. Left alone, Marko has to continue on his own, delving into twisting caverns that snake beneath his town, returning to the surface to buy new items or forging ahead through previously unreachable locales once he unlocks a new traversal ability.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4351695-ss_dbaa7c62ff4c0ce9deab08010498b8461463cc0a.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4351695" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4351695-ss_dbaa7c62ff4c0ce9deab08010498b8461463cc0a.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4351695"></a><figcaption>Marko isn't too great at jumping.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4351695-ss_dbaa7c62ff4c0ce9deab08010498b8461463cc0a.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"We love games as a storytelling medium," Studio Mechka head Boyan Vasilev told me. "They are a great way of telling a story to someone across the globe in the universal language of play, and what better story to tell than the one you grew up with, right? We are borrowing themes from multiple Slavic fairy tales to create a unique universe with its own rules, characters, and lore. The main theme, however, is that of the underdog and his journey to becoming a hero. Marko starts as the youngest and weakest--at least at first--of his very-accomplished brothers, who are both already famous heroes, and so Marko has to prove himself along the way. The world, on the other hand, tells a more tragic story. The player will discover the hows and whys of Zagora: how it rose to glory and how it fell from grace and into ruin. It is the story of the people who inhabited it, akin to the rise and fall of the Roman Empire."</p><p dir="ltr">I didn't do a lot of backtracking and ability-unlocking in the first hour. Most of my time was spent fighting bosses and slowly cutting through horde-filled hallways. Getting around was tough--Marko isn't acrobatic at all to start, seemingly lacking any advanced movement techniques to aid in early traversal. He can't bounce off of the environment from the start like Hollow Knight's Knight, for instance, nor can he wall-jump like Super Metroid's Samus. I really struggled with the early platforming segments, frustratingly dying on what would be easy jumps in other games--falling into spiked pits I could not bounce out of or being unable to get enough distance on a jump unless I leaped at the exact moment. These were challenges I'd expect later in a metroidvania once I'd unlocked enough abilities to have a chance of recovering from a mistake, or find in a different genre of game altogether (like a platformer). Instead, I had to irritatingly die at the same point multiple times. Getting past enemies felt a lot harder too. I couldn't easily maneuver past them or embrace my tried-and-true strategy of taking the high ground. I couldn't bounce off a boss' head like Hollow Knight's Knight or shoot down at enemies who couldn't reach me like Metroid's Samus.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4351696-ss_4caca8fa771cfc6dce7d71c57969f75754b44ff1.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4351696" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4351696-ss_4caca8fa771cfc6dce7d71c57969f75754b44ff1.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4351696"></a><figcaption>You rarely have to use the backstep once you unlock abilities that let you attack from a distance.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4351696-ss_4caca8fa771cfc6dce7d71c57969f75754b44ff1.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">That isn't to say Marko is helpless. Far from it. He's slow but hits pretty hard. And interestingly, he starts the game with a backward dodge. It's not very fast and you can't use it in the air, but it's valuable for getting out of trouble. I never quite got into a familiar pattern with it in the hour I played, but the few times I managed to pull off a successful backstep and then follow up with a forward lunge were incredibly satisfying.</p><p dir="ltr">"When designing the game and the core mechanics, we want to do something interesting that is more physical and combat-oriented," Vasilev said. "Originally we had a forward roll; Marko could dodge under attacks or obstacles, and it created new traversal methods, which was interesting in itself, but nothing great. The backstep dodge, on the other hand, is something that is mostly combat-oriented. We are addressing a problem that we found in similar games where combat is often clunky and unnatural, mostly because if you want to back away from an enemy or danger, you have to turn around and run away. With the backstep, you can back away from something without actually turning your back, and you can then follow up with a strike on your own, all without changing direction. This makes combat flow a lot more naturally, as you are exchanging blows with your enemy instead of running, and of course, it looks pretty cool."</p><p dir="ltr">In my time with the demo, I did unlock an aerial dash that made platforming so much easier. More upgrades like this await, and even though Marko primarily can only get around the world at the start by slicing his way through everything, he will be able to more easily jump past threats in later parts of the game.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4351698-ss_aa2cc59b32e0db895a4c2730c4f13778eb102b77.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4351698" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4351698-ss_aa2cc59b32e0db895a4c2730c4f13778eb102b77.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4351698"></a><figcaption>Marko will return to the surface on occasion to unlock new abilities or buy items.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4351698-ss_aa2cc59b32e0db895a4c2730c4f13778eb102b77.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"Having a sense of progression is very important for us because it ties directly with how accomplished the player feels when playing," Vasilev said. "As Marko progresses through Zagora, he picks up a lot of movement upgrades, including acrobatic jumps, pogo--striking objects below you in order to stay in the air--teleportation, throwing multiple weapons, and more. The world, on the other hand, evolves with Marko, and as he gets further into the ruined kingdom, the decay becomes more and more apparent and the path requires more and more acrobatics to get across."</p><p dir="ltr">Vasilev confirmed my suspicion that Beyond Brave becomes less linear over time. Though there are spaces to explore at the start, the opening hour of Beyond Brave feels railroad-y and too linear. I wasn't a fan of feeling like I was being funneled in a specific direction at all times and look forward to seeing a world that opens up and affords me the chance to get lost and uncover surprises.</p><p dir="ltr">"I like to think of the game as a giant maze; you only realize how truly lost you are when you are almost at the center," Vasilev said. "In that sense, the game opens up the more you play, and the more your abilities improve, the more options you'll have. The correct path isn't a singular road with a magnitude of branching dead ends, but instead is a multitude of choices that expand, loop around and open other possibilities that just happen to arrive at the same destination."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4351697-ss_eb3d50c6708a5a2499b23efb710aa41abd793974.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4351697" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4351697-ss_eb3d50c6708a5a2499b23efb710aa41abd793974.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4351697"></a><figcaption>My favorite boss fight in the demo was against Vila, a nymph-like entity I had to endure to defeat.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4351697-ss_eb3d50c6708a5a2499b23efb710aa41abd793974.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The game will have unorthodox boss fights too. I found one in the demo: I stumbled into a field where a genie-like nymph emerged from a container and attempted to drown me with repeated bursts of pressurized water. The speed at which her blasts were flung at me increased over time, and it was impossible to actually attack (or if it was, I could not figure out how to do so). But as time went on, the boss' health bar slowly depleted--it was a test of endurance and dodging ability, not combat prowess. It was a lot of fun, and I enjoyed it far more than the traditional boss fights--like a rampaging goat and tongue-whipping frog--that felt like encounters I'd seen in plenty of games before. They weren't boring, but they felt overly familiar for the metroidvania genre in terms of how to beat them. And, surprisingly, the backstep mechanic never felt necessary to overcome them. Perhaps later boss battles lean into the mechanic more, but early on, it seems like only normal enemies are built around the backstep. Meanwhile, the endurance trial against the nymph was something I'd never faced in a metroidvania game before.</p><p dir="ltr">"The Samodiva--similar to a nymph--you encountered is essentially a guardian of nature," Vasilev told me. "They are creatures that will act out in violence against anyone who threatens the natural order of their habitat, even if just trespassing. The Samodivas in Slavic folklore are not inherently malicious, and we tried to convey that through the fight mechanics. There are other interesting encounters in the game that use similar non-traditional gameplay and combat approaches. For instance, we have a boss that is entirely themed around sounds and sound waves. These encounters are essential to the story, too, conveying the complexity of the world and how not everything is black and white, not everyone you fight is a foe, and not every problem can be solved with the blade."</p><p dir="ltr">Even if I only saw one example, those types of fights are what I'm most looking forward to in Marko: Beyond Brave. Perhaps if I get the hang of the timing of the backstep, I'll come to love and appreciate the traditional combat encounters too. The few times I managed to pull it off, the game felt really good. But I'm also worried about how I'll manage with a combat system that seems built around a manner of defense that isn't a shield, forward dodge, or parry (because that's what I'm used to, and I am a creature of habit). I'm more than willing to give the game a chance to change my mind, though.</p><p dir="ltr">Marko: Beyond Brave is set to launch for PC on September 17.</p>

                <p>Skyblivion, the ambitious mod that looks to port and remaster <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/" data-ref-id="5000-22229">The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion</a> into the more-modern engine used by its sequel, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim/" data-ref-id="5000-92151">Skyrim</a>, is looking better than ever. The volunteer development team behind the project recently dropped a new 20-minute gameplay video highlighting two of the game's side quests for fans to salivate over.</p><p dir="ltr">While Skyblivion will feature some original quests (with original voice acting), the two quests highlighted in the gameplay video are existing Oblivion quests, Fingers of the Mountain and Killing Fields. They are largely as fans remember, albeit with a new coat of paint thanks to the remastered visuals coming as part of the mod. One quest, the Killing Fields, rewards a powerful and unique sword, Chillrend. It is just one of the weapon quest rewards that has been remade in order to offer "more unique and diverse weapons throughout Skyblivion," according to the video.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQohYRzybBg" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hQohYRzybBg" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Described as the "ultimate fan-made experience," Skyblivion looks to offer the best of what both Skyrim and Oblivion have to offer, according to the mod's <a href="https://skyblivion.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">website</a>. As such, Skyblivion will bring back gameplay systems seen in Oblivion--spell crafting, classes, underwater combat--and integrate them into Skyrim's engine.</p><p dir="ltr">All of Oblivion's items have been remade in the Skyrim engine, and there have additionally been updates to some of the game's cities, dungeons, and forts with improved layouts and enemy encounters. While much of the game is a detailed and faithful recreation of Oblivion, there is some new content, including new quests, monsters, and a reimagined lockpicking minigame. Many of the game's menus and UI are getting an overhaul to be more user-friendly, and many feature new artwork made to look right at home in the original game. There are even new pieces of region-specific music to "complement" Oblivion's original soundtrack.</p><p dir="ltr">The project has been in the works for over a decade at this point, with work to port Oblivion to Skyrim's engine beginning around the time Skyrim first launched. Remastering the game's visuals began in 2016, and there are currently more than 80 volunteers working to see the project to completion, according to the project's website.</p><p dir="ltr">Skyblivion is currently on track to release in 2025 for free. Once the mod is released, the team will work to address bugs and deliver updates requested by the community before beginning work on porting all of Oblivion's DLC, including the Shivering Isles expansion, to Skyblivion.</p><p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, fans are still waiting for more <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6492383/" data-ref-id="1100-6492383">news about The Elder Scrolls 6</a>. Bethesda, the game's publisher, said last year that the project had only recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-6-is-officially-in-early-development-but-more-info-is-still-years-away/1100-6517354/" data-ref-id="1100-6517354">entered early development</a> and that more news wouldn't be coming anytime soon.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-factions/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Much of The Veilguard appears to center around factions, specifically in one you create alongside a group of companions. However, during character creation, players will have an opportunity to select one of the six main factions in the game as a starting point. It’s part of your backstory. Here’s a look at the Dragon Age: The Veilguard factions!</p>



<h2 id="h-every-faction-in-dragon-age-the-veilguard">Every Faction in Dragon Age: The Veilguard</h2>



<p>Supposedly, the game will feature a reputation mechanic that affects how much each faction likes Rook. Your choices during character creation, specifically your faction origin, influence this metric greatly. However, your actions in the world will also change their outlook and willingness to help. Here are all six of the factions in Dragon Age: The Veilguard:</p>



<ul>
<li>Antivan Crows</li>



<li>Grey Wardens</li>



<li>Lords of Fortune</li>



<li>Mourn Watch</li>



<li>Shadow Dragons</li>



<li>Veil Jumpers</li>
</ul>



<p>Furthermore, alongside choosing one of the game’s factions as your starting point, which determines who you were before meeting Varric and becoming part of The Veilguard, each of the game’s companions stems from one of the factions.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-do-factions-vary-in-dragon-age-the-veilguard">How Do Factions Vary in Dragon Age: The Veilguard?</h2>



<p>Depending on which faction you select as your starting origin, you’ll receive different buffs, unique dialogue, and perhaps even different quests and pathways to select from in the game’s quests. There’s still a lot of mystery surrounding each of the game’s factions, along with how they interact with each other and the game world, however.</p>



<p>That said, they all play a role in the overarching story of The Veilguard. Our player character will interact with all six at some point in the story, either asking for their assistance or recruiting their members to your party.</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/the-plucky-squire-is-clever-charming-mix-of-2d-and-3d-gameplay</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-plucky-squire-is-clever-charming-mix-of-2d-and-3d-gameplay.955353/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-plucky-squire-is-clever-charming-mix-of-2d-and-3d-gameplay<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Sometimes, a video game feels like it was made just for you. That’s never true, of course, unless you’re a solo developer making your own indie game, but I reckon you know the feeling. It happens when a game just speaks to you, when the art, music, and gameplay feel tailor-made to your taste and you can’t keep a smile off your face while you’re playing it. That’s how I felt playing The Lucky Squire, the first game from All Possible Futures.</p><p>You step into the shoes of Jot, the titular Plucky Squire, a… well, squire of great renown who defends the land of Mojo, a place of unbridled creativity, from the malevolent Humgrump. Jot’s also something of a writer, and his skill with a quill means he turns his adventures into books that people adore. World-saving hero, beloved author? What more could a guy want?</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>The Plucky Squire PlayStation Showcase 2023 Trailer</h3></div></output><p>The first thing you’ll notice about The Plucky Squire is its look. It’s quite literally set in a children’s storybook, with areas mapped to each page. When you move on, the page will turn, taking you to the next area or revealing a bit more of the story, and each “level” in The Plucky Squire is its own chapter. It’s a charming setup, but a great conceit is only half the battle. The Plucky Squire pulls everything together with beautiful sprite art that evokes childrens’ books you might find on the shelves of your local library. Everything is bright, colorful, and gorgeously animated. Seriously, I think this is one of the prettiest games I’ve ever seen. I mean, just look at it.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Seriously, I think this is one of the prettiest games I’ve ever seen.</p></div><p>My three-hour demo started by sending me on a quest to help my wizard friend, a sunglasses-wearing, Merlin-from-The-Sword-in-the-Stone-looking dude named Moonbeard get some beeswax so he could press some more vinyls. What can I say? He likes to DJ. A suitably humble origin story, but every hero’s journey begins somewhere. The Plucky Squire starts off playing like the top-down Zelda games of yesteryear; Jot’s armed with little more than a sword, a rolling dodge, his wits, and a cunning hat with a quill fit for the Bard. You’ll cut down small goblins and bugs, but it feels as good as it looks.</p><h3>Master of Magics</h3><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>But that’s not all that Jot or The Plucky Squire is. There’s platforming segments that wouldn’t be out of place in a Mario game, and to nab the beeswax that Moonbeard needs, you’ll have to face down a honey badger in a boxing match that looks like it was plucked (get it? Do you get it?) straight out of Punch-Out. All right, Plucky Squire. I see you. Needless to say, Jot lands the knockout blow, because that's what heroes do.</p><p>Yes, everything’s coming up Jot until Humgrump starts causing trouble again. And that’s when things truly get wild. See, Humgrump has figured out that all the world’s a stage and you’re merely players. The story’s been written, which means he’s destined to lose every time he and Jot throw down, and he’s not a fan. Not one bit. Lucky for him, and unluckily for Jot, Humgrump’s a wizard. That means magic, and he uses it to kick Jot out of the book and into the real world.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Suddenly, I wasn’t playing a 2D game anymore; I was playing a 3D game. The beautiful sprite art? Replaced by equally gorgeous 3D models that look like they’re visiting from the Switch remake of Link’s Awakening. I had to get home to Jot’s storybook, which meant platforming around Sam’s, the kid who owns this particular copy of The Plucky Squire, desk, all while avoiding Sam’s pet beetles.</p><h3>Mightier Than the Sword</h3><p>Jot may not be as powerful in the real world as he is in his storybook, but he soon picks up a new trick from a friendly bookworm named Page: the ability to enter any piece of paper as his sprite self, A Link Between Worlds-style, provided it has a portal to let him in, and bring objects into the book from the real world, and vice versa. Armed with the power to enter and exit the book and turn the pages at will when he’s on the desk thanks to a pair of special gloves called the Turn Gauntlets, you head back into the storybook.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>The Plucky Squire Screens</h3></div></output><p>And this is where The Plucky Squire really, and I mean really, gets interesting. Humgrump used his magic to really mess with the story of the book, but that’s not going to stop Jot. He's a writer, which means he can manipulate the words on the page, and by doing so, change the book, too. Can’t get to what you need in this forest? Swap the word “forest” for “ruins,” and you’ll be able to maneuver more easily. A huge bug blocking your path? Switch the word “huge” for “tiny” and you’ll get past him in no time.</p><p>What makes The Plucky Squire so delightful and unique are how all of these mechanics come together to create fun, interesting scenarios. Here’s an example: at one point, I needed to make it daylight on a page so I could get around the frogs who come out at night to sing. Now, I like a good chorus of frogs at night as much as the next man, but they were blocking the paths I needed to access. So I exited the book, went back to a previous page, grabbed the word “daytime,” turned back to the page I needed, jumped back into the book, and replaced “night” with “daytime” to let the sunshine in and move them out of the way. Of course, that caused new problems, but between my ability to enter and exit the page in multiple places and Jot’s skill as a wordsmith, I managed to get to the next page.</p><h3>A Real Page-Turner</h3><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>And the special, one-off section where I played Punch-Out against the honey badger? Stuff like that is everywhere. Once, in need of a bow, I jumped into a Legally Distinct Magic Card on Sam’s desk to do battle with an elven archer. She was certain I was in league with Humgrump, but I managed to convince her otherwise. The cool part, though, was that the whole sequence played out like a turn-based battle in an RPG. And later, when I had to use the bow to take out the bugs? I was essentially playing a lightgun game. All of these sections were fun and unique, and none overstayed their welcome. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>All of the special, one-off gameplay sections were fun and unique, and none overstayed their welcome. </p></div><p>Of course, the core gameplay is no slouch either, whether you’re platforming around Sam’s desk or fighting goblins in the storybook. Oh, and did I mention that you can use the currency you find in the world to upgrade Jot with things like the ability to throw his sword or use a spin attack or buy concept art? Because you can, though there’s not enough to buy everything, at least not in the sections I played, which will hopefully open up interesting build choices in the full game. And then there’s the delightful supporting cast, from the funky-yet-wise Moonbeard to Jot’s friends, the powerful trainee witch Violet, who should probably believe in herself a little more, and the totally radical mountain troll, Thrash, who… well, just seems like he’s there to have a good time. Oh, and Minibeard, a mini version of Moonbeard who doles out puzzle advice. Minibeard rules.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>If I had to sum up my time with The Plucky Squire in two words, I’d go with “charming” and “unique.” You can pick out The Plucky Squire’s influences, but what I played was so well put together that it never stopped feeling like anything other than itself and its excellent sense of pacing meant it never overstayed its welcome. It’s a game that immediately clicked with me, and when my time with the demo was over, I was a little sad. It’s rare to find something that feels this unique, and I can’t get over the feeling of wonder I had while playing it. I hope All Possible Futures can maintain that feeling throughout the full game.</p><p>As any good writer will tell you, a good story takes time, and I’m more than willing to wait for All Possible Futures to write the final words and lay down their quill. In the meantime, I’ll be pouring over the chapters I’ve read, looking for things I missed, trying out the other upgrades, and just enjoying the vibe, waiting until the time comes to turn the next page.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It always feels like the video game voice acting community doesn’t receive enough credit for the work they produce. Without voice actors, where would the iconic characters we love so much stand today? They’d be long-forgotten, for the most part. With that in mind, let’s take a look at the Dragon Age: The Veilguard voice actors!</p>



<h2 id="h-all-voice-actors-in-dragon-age-the-veilguard">All Voice Actors in Dragon Age: The Veilguard</h2>



<p>As of right now, there’s a rather large cast of characters in Dragon Age: The Veilguard. There are a total of 17 characters with voice actors attached to the project currently, with more likely to come thanks to expansions and post-launch content. For now, here’s the voice acting cast:</p>



<ul>
<li>Miranda Raison – Cassandra Pentaghast</li>



<li>Claudia Black – Morrigan</li>



<li>Brian Bloom – Varric Tethras</li>



<li>Erika Ishii – Rook</li>



<li>Ali Hillis – Lace Harding</li>



<li>Jessica Clark – Neve Gallus</li>



<li>Bryony Corrigan – Rook</li>



<li>Jee Young Han – Bellara</li>



<li>Nick Boraine – Emmrich Volkarin</li>



<li>Gareth David-Lloyd – Solas</li>



<li>Ike Amadi – Davrin</li>



<li>Jin Maley – Taash</li>



<li>Zach Mendez – Lucanis Dellamorte</li>



<li>Alex Jordan – Rook</li>



<li>James Lewis – Strife</li>



<li>Jeff Berg – Rook</li>



<li>Mika Simmons – Queen Anora</li>
</ul>



<p>You’ll note multiple voice actors assigned to the role of “Rook.” That’s the main character, and during character creation, you can select from one of four available voices—two male and two female.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-many-voiced-companions-does-dragon-age-the-veilguard-have">How Many Voiced Companions Does Dragon Age: The Veilguard Have?</h2>



<p>In total, there are seven recruitable companions in Dragon Age: The Veilguard. They all include a unique voice, backstory, likes and dislikes, and fighting style to set them apart from each other. You’ll have an opportunity to build the party of your dreams as you found The Veilguard in a lengthy single-player campaign.</p>



<hr>



<p>Now that we know the official release date of Dragon Age: The Veilguard, it’s time to start delving into more of the game’s story, characters, and mechanics. We’ll have more about the game for you soon!</p>

Essentially, this chest armor empowers your abilities as you use them, so when you can quickly recharge them via the Prismatic Super, it can make you even deadlier. Feel free to give this roll of the Exotic a skip, as most of the essential stats are incredibly low.</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Mobility: 22</li><li dir="ltr">Resilience: 7</li><li dir="ltr">Recovery: 6</li><li dir="ltr">Discipline: 6</li><li dir="ltr">Intellect: 10</li><li dir="ltr">Strength: 17</li><li dir="ltr">Total: 68</li></ul><h3>Mechaneer's Tricksleeves (Exotic Hunter gauntlets)</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4351669-destiny22024-08-1619-04-24.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4351669" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4351669-destiny22024-08-1619-04-24.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4351669"></a><figcaption>Mechaneer's Tricksleeves</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4351669-destiny22024-08-1619-04-24.jpg"></figure><p>Mechaneer's Tricksleeves rarely show up in Xur's inventory, so this is a rare chance to get Hunter gauntlets that offer a wide range of buffs for sidearms.

These were nerfed a bit a while back, but ideally, you'll still get out four grenades if you're quick enough, turning a battlefield into an active volcano. The stats on this Exotic are a bit odd because while they do boast high discipline and resilience, mobility is too high and recovery is extremely low. It's not the worst we've seen, and if you're building a grenade-centric Warlock loadout, these Sunbracers could still work decently.</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Mobility: 17</li><li dir="ltr">Resilience:

For his rotating selection of Exotic weapon catalysts, he'll sell two each week. His selection will contain older catalysts that are found through random drops prior to The Witch Queen expansion, and he will not have catalysts associated with quests, Exotic missions, Season Pass Exotics, campaign Exotics, preorder Exotics, raid Exotics, or dungeon Exotics.</p><p>Xur will also have three random Exotic weapons available for sale, in addition to Hawkmoon. Xur will still sell Legendary armor and weapons, as well as engrams that can yield any item in those pools at random. Like other vendors, Xur also has his own reputation track now and the more you spend, the more reputation rewards you'll earn, including an Exotic Cipher after every rank reset.</p><p>Additionally, Xur's loyalty program kicks in after you spend 47 Strange Coins, granting you a Strange Favor buff. This lasts for 11 days and can be stacked up to three times--once per week--giving you a chance to earn a bonus Strange Coin from activities that reward you with the currency. Xur is present every weekend in Destiny 2, starting with the daily reset at 10 AM PT / 1 PM ET each Friday.</p>
