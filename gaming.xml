            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gog-preservation-program-warcraft-delisting<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>GOG has announced that&nbsp;<em>Warcraft&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Warcraft 2&nbsp;</em>are to be delisted from its storefront, but don't worry; the recently-announced Preservation Program has had its terms updated to account for occasions like this.</p>

<p>In a press release, GOG confirms that the two real-time strategy games will be removed from its store on December 13th, probably in light of the&nbsp;<em>Warcraft&nbsp;</em>remasters that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warcraft-2-remaster-leaked-rumor" rel="nofollow">leaked ahead of</a>, and were then confirmed during, the franchise's recent 30th-anniversary showcase.</p>

<p>However, in that same press release, GOG also announces a new feature for its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gog-preservation-program" rel="nofollow">recently-revealed Preservation Program</a>, an initiative that pledges to keep games updated for modern systems whether or not their developers are still supporting said games.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warcraft-gog-preservation-program-delisting.jpg?itok=ggjhTDv1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warcraft-gog-preservation-program-delisting.jpg?itok=_eOnWInZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Warcraft&nbsp;</em>may be getting delisted from GOG, but you're in luck if you did happen to buy it via GOG's store.</figcaption></figure><p>GOG says that from now on, if a game joins the Preservation Program, it will be supported with updates and compatibility patches "even if it gets delisted from [GOG]".</p>

<p>Thankfully, since "from now on" begins today, that new feature will cover the two original&nbsp;<em>Warcraft&nbsp;</em>games, so if you did happen to buy them via GOG, you don't need to worry about them suddenly losing compatibility or support.</p>

<p>In fact, if you've yet to pick up the original&nbsp;<em>Warcraft&nbsp;</em>titles <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/warcraft_bundle" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">on GOG</a>, then you can currently do so using the discount code MakeWarcraftLiveForever, which knocks "2 USD, 2 EUR, 1.5 GBP, or 8 PLN off" your order.</p>

<p>It'll only work with those currencies, but as GOG points out, you can simply change your currency at the bottom of the store page if you're not currently working within one of the supported currencies.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warcraft-gog-preservation-program-snow.jpg?itok=2bzo0wgv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warcraft-gog-preservation-program-snow.jpg?itok=S0dA5ZlS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You could be entitled to a discount right now if you pick up the first two&nbsp;<em>Warcraft&nbsp;</em>games on GOG.</figcaption></figure><p>That code's only available to be used once for each user, though, so once it's gone, it's gone. Bear that in mind before you pick up the bundle.</p>

<p>Given that Activision Blizzard doesn't seem to be making the same promise of eternal compatibility and support for its own remastered&nbsp;<em>Warcraft&nbsp;</em>titles, you may want to grab these games via GOG if you're looking for peace of mind. We'll bring you more on this, and all other things GOG, as we get it.</p>

<p>Tencent has acquired another new game studio, Chinese studio Kuro Games. </p>



<p>First reported by <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2024/11/tencent-acquires-majority-stake-in-kuro-games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Youxi Putao</a> — then found by <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2024/11/tencent-acquires-majority-stake-in-kuro-games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gematsu</a> — , Tencent has purchased 37% of the Wuthering Waves developer’s shares. When adding it to the 24.4% it already owned, the new acquisition gives the company 51.4% of the shares, and a controlling stake in the company.</p>



<p>The purchase also makes Tencent the only external shareholder of the company.</p>



<p>According to Kuro Games’ internal memo to staff, the studio will continue to work independently. It was iterated that “operational strategy will remain unchanged”. An example used in the memo was Tencent’s ownership in Riot Games and Supercell.</p>



<p>“Based on our past collaborative experiences with Tencent, we firmly believe that this external shareholder change will provide Kuro with a more stable external environment, further benefiting our future independent operational strategies and long-term development,” the internal memo reads via machine translation.</p>



<p>“Over the past decade, our original intention of creating games has never changed, and it will remain unchanged in the next decade. We will continue to love our players, our games, and our team.”</p>



<p>Kuro Games is set to release Version 2.0 of Wuthering Waves on January 2.</p>

<p>"Nowhere is safe from having its economy meticulously managed in minute detail by discerning comrades," explains the announcement release. I for one welcome our new socialist overlords. It's high time we sceptre-kissing Brits learned the importance of a properly joined-up sewage system. Looking at you, Thames Water. Here's a trailer.</p><!--more-->

<p>Aside from the USA and the British Isles, the DLC includes maps based on Austria, the Czech Republic, East Germany, France, Estonia and North Korea. "Every map will differ in terms of overall size and the challenges the local topography brings, and they will also come with pre-generated towns, cities, and infrastructure," the announcement release explains. "This will require players to mold and shape their nations over time in order to create a new wave of top-notch Soviet Republics."</p><p>I still haven't played Workers &amp; Resources, but I've greatly enjoyed reading Sin's articles about it. In <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/workers-resources-soviet-republic-review">her review of the 1.0 version</a> from June 2024, she paints a simultaneously appealing and terrifying picture of a game where setting up a recycling service or demolishing a mine requires you to implement a whole infrastructure of specialised workers, vehicles and buildings (there are also plenty of options to simplify the simulation, if desired).</p>
<p>"I could recite a litany of frustrations and wishes, but it would be dwarfed by the novella about how absorbing and fascinating Workers &amp; Resources is," Sin wrote. "I love its conceptual commitment to a planned economy that its genremates observe de facto but don't examine. Its complex models and processes built for the joy and satisfaction of watching them come together. Its foundations in Slovak history and experience, and its refusal to be like anything else."</p>
<p>Sin also has a piece from a couple years back <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-rally-point-ostriv-workers-resources-and-where-town-builders-ought-to-go-next">exploring how Workers &amp; Resources deviates from the liberal American idea of town-building epitomised by SimCity</a>. I imagine she'd be keen to see how the game stacks up when you actually transport it to North America, though I suspect there are mods that do this already. Sort of feels like the logical endgame here is to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1Sq1Nr58hM">go to space</a>. There are probably mods for that too.

</p><p>The Worlds Map DLC is out on 13th December via Steam, GOG and the Epic Games Store, and will be localised into the same languages as the base game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-talking-s-about-us-half-life-2-mod-blacklists-a-handful-of-youtubers-as-anticitizens-and-blocks-them-from-playing<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>There is some spiteful drama in the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/half-life">Half-Life</a> modding scene this week. The developers of a heavily criticised mod for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/half-life-2">Half-Life 2</a> are intentionally blocking a small number of YouTubers from playing that mod, using Steam IDs to effectively blacklist and ban specific people from running it. Instead of launching the game as expected, these players will see the first-person shooter crash, alongside an error message that reads: "STOP talking SH1T about us". This is an act of revenge for previous criticism of the mod, say the affected videofolks, who are described in the mod's code as "anticitizens".</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The mod is called <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/hl2-overcharged">Half-Life 2 Overcharged</a> and it is described by its creators as an "overhaul modification" with "brand new gameplay and post-processing features". It adds new Combine and alien enemies, plus a bunch of weapons. It was originally released in 2022 and attracted some ridicule from Half-Life modding fans for being underbaked. The enemy AI was broken, crashes were frequent, the weapons were underwhelming or needless, and there were plenty of lighting and graphical issues. </p>
<p>A lot of these problems were meticulously pointed out in videos by YouTubers like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-v4twgwLR4p-g0mihJsLCw/about">"noclick"</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@RadiationHazardYT">"Radiation Hazard"</a>, who specialise in the Half-Life games and play a lot of mods for Valve's classic shooters. They didn't show any mercy in their judgement of this one, calling it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6xhEXs9M3c">"overhyped"</a>, for example, and cutting down the mod in what you might call a typical YouTuber style. </p>
<p>In the two years since that original release the mod saw some updates, and the YouTubers followed along, tracking changes and sometimes doing follow-up videos to address <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLkRD5mhAtQ">whether or not the bugs had been fixed</a>. Some things did get fixed, yes, but many other problems persisted, and new issues even came up, such as strange ragdoll behaviour and vanishing enemies. </p><p>With the recent release of a 2.0 version, the video makers set out to cover the mod once again, only to discover that it would simply crash. An error message would appear, reading: "STOP talking SH1T about us". And any attempt to make the game run was unsuccessful. </p>
<p>"The developers used my Steam ID to somehow block me from playing the mod," said one of the affected players in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcvsbZ18izA">a video calling out the modders</a>. "There is a line of code somewhere that was specifically written to block my account from playing this mod."</p>
<p>Sure enough, the mod appears to have been hardcoded to include a list of four "anticitizens" who will be unable to play, according <a href="https://x.com/Comrade_Waluigi/status/1863354606757069134">to this tweet that exposes the modder's code</a>. </p>
<p>Of course, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect">Streisand effect</a> is now in full swing and <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/hl2-overcharged">the mod's page on ModDB</a> is inundated with dozens of comments saying "The sun is leaking" - a reference to one of the mod's most recurring lighting glitches. I probably wouldn't have even heard of this mod if the creators had not been this bitter about the poor reception.</p><p>This is a very niche example of the act of blacklisting, which occurs in traditional games criticism as well. Kotaku has been <a href="https://kotaku.com/a-price-of-games-journalism-1743526293">blacklisted by Bethesda</a> in the past, for example, presumably for not writing positively enough about their games. We at RPS have never been told overtly by any publisher or developer that we're on a blacklist (why would they admit to that, after all?) but we can tell when it happens; a company becomes chronically uncommuncative, they are not forthcoming with review code, or refuse to answer our queries. Still, even the most bullish of developers have never actually programmed their games to boot out specific critical voices. That is  wild behaviour and, as you can see, it also backfires. No, smart devs save their codey shennanigans to <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/8256405.stm">catch pirates in funny ways</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Battlestate Games’ Nikita Buyanov has posted a series of images on social media showcasing Terminal, the potential final map in Escape from Tarkov. For months, talk about the spearhead extraction shooter has been centred around the last step that players are waiting for – the ability to <strong>escape </strong>from Tarkov.</p>



<p>Alongside the images, which showcase a dark and brooding map, Buyanov wrote: ‘The place where it all ends?’</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-end-of-all-things">The End of All Things</h2>



<p>When Escape from Tarkov finally hits a 1.0 release, it’ll be delivered with the ability to finally escape from Tarkov. That has been the goal for the last decade or so, and it’ll be a way to finally ‘complete’ the game.</p>



<p>The ultimate endgame objective was teased today on social media by Nikita Buyanov, the head honcho at Battlestate Games:</p>



<figure><p>
https://twitter.com/nikgeneburn/status/1863505672601534943
</p></figure>







<p>Escaping from Tarkov is something that has only ever been possible by powering down and stepping away from the desk – but soon, players will be able to do that after firmly completing the game. The only issue is that we have no idea what that’ll look like. Could it be some kind of ‘prestige’ system, allowing players to complete the game over and over again to earn new rewards?</p>



<p>Nobody knows.</p>



<p>The images showcased by Buyanov don’t reveal too much. It’s an industrial area, which we knew already based on the ‘port’ setting on the map, but something that’s never been seen before is a <strong>submarine </strong>docked in the port. Players have already theorised that’s how we’ll finally escape from Tarkov. </p>



<p>What do you think of Terminal? Do you want to finally break free of Escape from Tarkov? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

					<p>I've played a lot of ARPGS throughout the years, from spending a disgusting amount of time in Path of Exile to dipping my toes into Diablo. However, all of them have that same feel that makes them enjoyable and has a unique aesthetic to the ARPG genre that isn't really seen in other genres. <a href="https://wccftech.com/wayfinder-upcoming-echoes-update-changes-it-into-a-premium-game-with-offline-option/">Playing Wayfinder surprised me</a> because it doesn't feel like an ARPG to me, at least in the classic sense of the genre. Instead, to me, it felt more like the kind of game you'd see ported to mobile as a MOBA. It gave me similar vibes to Smite in terms of camera angles and movements, with a cartoonish art style similar to Fortnite or even Palia. Because of these factors, I found it very difficult to get immersed in a game like this.</p>
<p>While for a lot of people, the color scheme and vibrancy of Wayfinder is bound to draw people in, it just didn't for me. Instead, it was a game where I had to turn the brightness all the way down, as it was giving me a headache. This is definitely more of a 'me' problem, as I am sensitive to flashing lights and bright colors, but it was pretty excessive. In some ways, the game reminded me of Borderlands, especially when you were charged with taking out Goblins. Although the combat style is vastly different from something you'd see in Borderlands, the layout and environments felt similar to that of Tiny Tina's Wonderlands.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/wayfinder-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>When you first open the game, you are hit with a lot of vibrant colors as the story is explained to you. Unfortunately, the story wasn't that memorable, and it wasn't something that I took an interest in during my time playing Wayfinder. For me, I bypassed the vast majority of the story and just tried to get stuck into the combat and exploration of the game, as that was what drew me in the most.</p>
<p>Wayfinder kind of suffers from a feeling of being generic. While the gameplay aspect is a lot of fun, there isn't much that is original. When I was first told about the game and the Critical Role collaboration, I was expecting something more akin to Divinity: Original Sin. Maybe I put my expectations a bit too high. I was expecting more of a roleplay element where you could have more impactful interactions with people and form bonds with the characters you meet, but that didn't seem like much of an option. The characters I spoke to were very well-developed, and they had hefty backstories, but it was hard to find any information about the character you're playing when in discussion with others. There's not really any witty banter or sprinkles of personality that showcase who the character is, regardless of who you choose.</p>
<p>Getting into the nitty-gritty of the content, I found myself really enjoying the combat system of Wayfinder. I chose to play as Ness, the typical edgy-looking rogue. The character designs are all pretty stereotypical, but this didn't bother me too much. The playstyle was fun, albeit it was nothing overly new. Although the combat was a lot of fun and was easy to get stuck into, parrying was difficult. The parry window was very short, but it also shared a stamina bar with dodging and blocking. This made it very difficult not to take damage, as you may be able to dodge one attack and block another, but you could very quickly run out of stamina before being able to parry the third. My main issue with this was that the enemies often came thick and fast, or they'd be joined by a much stronger enemy, making an easy fight very tense and challenging. Despite that, the combat provided a much-needed thrill in the game, and it was fun being able to Shadow-step through enemies to destroy them.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/wayfinder-gear-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The gear system was a bit confusing, and I felt that it wasn't explained very well. While the gear was easy to find in your inventory, you'd find that you could also pick up gear for the other Wayfinders available to play. This made it a bit confusing for me at first, as I assumed any gear I'd pick up would be for my specific character. The upgrading system available was also a bit finicky to get used to, and you're immediately thrown into dungeons to collect resources that you have no idea how to use.</p>
<p>Overall, my experience with Wayfinder was pretty average. Unfortunately, nothing about the game stuck out, and there wasn't much that felt unique or groundbreaking. While the dungeons were a lot of fun, and the combat was the main thing that drew me in, it wasn't enough to keep me playing. Hopefully, as the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1171690/Wayfinder/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">game continues to get updated</a>, new content and features will be added to improve the game.</p>

<p>There was nothing that stood out from the game, and the story didn't particularly grab me. The main selling point for me was the combat and dungeon-crawling, which was quite fun. However, Wayfinder still needs some work to give it that extra sparkle.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/visions-of-mana-director-quits-ouka-joins-square-enix<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Visions of Mana&nbsp;</em>director Ryosuke Yoshida has quit NetEase's Ouka Studios in order to join Square Enix following reports of extensive layoffs at the former.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/YoshidaBeer/status/1863418476637118944" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a message on social media platform X</a>, Yoshida said that he quit Ouka Studios on October 31st, but that he's "grateful to the development team and NetEase for their support" in creating and releasing&nbsp;<em>Visions of Mana</em>.</p>

<p>Describing the process of making the game as "a very good experience", Yoshida then says he "joined Square Enix in December", pledging to "do [his] best to make a game that many people can enjoy".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/visions-of-mana-director-square-enix-combat.jpg?itok=qtg12jgr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/visions-of-mana-director-square-enix-combat.jpg?itok=y0G5Rvvi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Visions of Mana</em>'s director has jumped ship to Square Enix.</figcaption></figure><p>The&nbsp;<em>Visions of Mana&nbsp;</em>director's&nbsp;message drew responses from the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/Bucky_cm/status/1863423587774025919" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>community manager John "Bucky" Buckley</a>, who said he's "looking forward to seeing what [Yoshida does] next", as well as <a href="https://x.com/nhamaguc/status/1863419145943208328" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Square Enix's Naoki Hamaguchi</a>, who welcomed Yoshida to the company.</p>

<p>Yoshida's decision comes a few months after a report claiming that Ouka Studio, the developer of&nbsp;<em>Visions of Mana</em>, was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/visions-of-mana-layoffs-netease-report" rel="nofollow">hit by huge layoffs</a> on the day of the game's release.</p>

<p>According to that report, "all but a handful" of developers at Ouka were laid off, and parent company NetEase was planning to close down the studio. Of course, Yoshida doesn't confirm or deny this report, but the timing of his departure seems appropriate if it's true.</p>

<p>Ouka's apparent shutdown may also be coming from the same place as NetEase's recent <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/worlds-untold-netease-pause-shutdown" rel="nofollow">decision to pull funding</a> from ex-BioWare writer Mac Walters' studio Worlds Untold, leading said studio to "pause operations" while it seeks an alternative source of funding.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/visions-of-mana-director-square-enix-val.jpg?itok=BEuHYcP6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/visions-of-mana-director-square-enix-val.jpg?itok=GihojmDB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Yoshida's decision to leave&nbsp;<em>Visions of Mana</em>'s development team appears to have come at the right time.</figcaption></figure><p>It's also possible that Square Enix's willingness to hire Yoshida speaks to a desire for the studio to make a followup to&nbsp;<em>Visions of Mana</em>, so this might not be the last we hear of the franchise.</p>

<p>Of course, Square Enix itself hasn't been having the best year. Back in September, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-16-rebirth-profits-square-enix" rel="nofollow">the studio admitted</a> that both&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XVI&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth&nbsp;</em>"did not meet [its] expectations", and in April, it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/square-enix-140m-loss-shakeup" rel="nofollow">declared a $140m loss</a> amid a major internal project shakeup.</p>

<p>As for&nbsp;<em>Visions of Mana&nbsp;</em>itself, the game is currently available for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2490990/Visions_of_Mana/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/visions-of-mana/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/visions-of-mana" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

The biggest changes are the welcome removal of microtransactions and the ability to play offline. But the paid app also introduces a number of gameplay additions, including a new location where you can hang out with K.K. Slider, and the option to import custom designs from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/19/22339896/animal-crossing-new-horizons-review-one-year-nintendo-switch">the Switch game <em>New Horizons</em></a> into <em>Pocket Camp Complete</em>. Here’s how it works:</p><p>While you can start up a fresh game if you haven’t played before, <em>Complete</em> seems largely designed so that existing players won’t lose all of their campground progress for good, making it an interesting solution for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/1/23330632/free-to-play-gacha-games-closures-dragalia-lost-kingdom-hearts">an ongoing problem with mobile and live service games</a>. Unfortunately, at launch the game seems to be having issues with save transfers, which Nintendo has acknowledged. “The issue may be occurring due to a high number of users attempting to use this service,” <a href="https://x.com/Pocket_Camp/status/1863524631493382480">the company says</a>. If you’re having issues, you can check out the support page <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/15997/kw/nintendo%20account#s3q4">right here</a>.

<p>Visions of Mana Director Ryosuke Yoshida has announced that he joined Sqaure Enix this December.</p>



<p>The announcement came from Yoshida’s X (formerly Twitter) <a href="https://x.com/YoshidaBeer/status/1863418476637118944" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">account</a>, where he said, “On a personal note, I quit NetEase Ouka Studios on October 31st. We were a new studio, but we were able to release Visions of Mana. I am grateful to the development team and NetEase for their support. It was a very good experience. Thank you all. I am happy to announce that I joined SQUARE ENIX in December.”</p>



<p>Visions of Mana was released on August 29, 2024, by Square Enix and received generally favorable reviews according to review aggregated Metacritic. The game sold approximately 40,000 units in Japan in its first on the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5, but Square Enix is yet to announce wider sales numbers.</p>



<p>Before joining Square Enix, Ryosuke Yoshida worked on Devil May Cry 5 at Capcom as a game designer.</p>

<p>Square Enix did not expand on why the game had been withdrawn from sale on the Nintendo eShop, nor give any indication of when it will return. </p>
<p>"Triangle Strategy is temporarily unavailable to purchase on Nintendo Switch eShop," wrote Square Enix. "Those who have already bought the game will be able to download it.</p> <div>

<p>A similar issue happened with Square Enix's RPG <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/octopath-traveler">Octopath Traveler</a> back in March. That too was temporarily delisted after it switched publisher between Nintendo and Square Enix.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/triangle-strategy-sells-800k-globally-in-two-weeks">Triangle Strategy sold 800k copies globally in its first two weeks</a>, 200k of which were sold in Japan and Asia alone.</p>

For the six months ending September 30, Nintendo sold 4.72 million Switch units, down from 6.84 million in the previous year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the software side, The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom has sold 2.58 million copies, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe saw a 2.31 million increase, Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door reached 1.94 million, and Luigi's Mansion 2 HD sold 1.57 million copies during the April to September 2024 period.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In other news, Nintendo confirmed that the upcoming Switch 2 will be backward-compatible with original Switch games and will support Nintendo Switch Online. Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa revealed this at the company’s Corporate Management Policy Briefing, though further details about the successor's full features are expected after its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/analysts-say-nintendo-switch-2-announcement-now-unlikely-before-end-of-2024">official announcement</a>, which is slated for before March 2025.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">What is Cyber Monday?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Traditionally, Black Friday was the in-store shopping frenzy, while <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-friday-vs-cyber-monday">Cyber Monday focused on online deals</a>. While those lines have blurred, Cyber Monday remains the top event for online-focused retailers like Amazon, Newegg, Dell, HP, and Lenovo. Even traditional retailers like Best Buy, Target, and Walmart roll out exclusive online-only offers. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-cyber-monday-best-deals-2024">Xbox</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-ps5-playstation-cyber-monday-deals-2024">PS5 deals</a> are also now live.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Many of the same deals from Black Friday normally return for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/events/cyber-monday">Cyber Monday 2024</a>, including some that sold out or expired.

            <p>
December brings a shiny new Mewtwo card to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket">Pokémon TCG Pocket</a>, if you're a subscriber to to the game's Premium Pass. 
</p>
<p>
The Pokémon TCG Pocket Premium pass costs £7.99 ($9.99) and allows you to open an extra card pack per day, as well as gain access to exclusive premium missions and rewards. 
</p>
<p>
The latest of these rewards are now live, as of 1st December - perhaps suggesting a monthly addition going forwards. Subscribers can simply log in to claim their Mewtwo promo, plus some cute Pikachu card accessories, anytime from now until 31st December.
</p>
<p>
For those who aren't subscribers, you're not missing a card that's going to change the game's meta. This is the same Mewtwo with the same stats and attack as in the game already, albeit with different card artwork. It looks snazzy, though.
</p>

<p>
Fancy a promo card but aren't a subscriber? Well, the game's ongoing Venusaur drop event is live now until 13th December. You'll need to participate in solo AI battles for a chance at promo cards including a special version of Venusaur that does look rather lovely indeed.
</p>

<p>
Of the two dozen promo cards currently in the game's files, only two remain unreleased. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-cards-joining-pokemon-tcg-pocket-leak-ahead-of-december-events">Promo versions of Bulbasaur and Magnemite are expected by fans to become available from a Wonder Pick event</a> beginning next week. 
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pocket-new-booster-packs-available-before-end-of-year">Pokémon TCG Pocket will add the ability to trade cards</a> with other players at the start of 2025, its developer has confirmed. Before then, the game will also be refreshed with the launch of new booster packs due "by the end of the year".

			<p>A new version of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-remaster-video/">Bloodborne Remaster Project</a> was released online a few days back, introducing new visual improvements in Central Yharnam and a few more areas.</p>
<p>Version 0.75, which can be downloaded for free from Nexus Mods, introduces some visual improvements via more gparam edits for each area, parallax occlusion mapping for certain surfaces in Central Yharnam, Cathedral Ward and a few other areas, and some upgraded textures.</p>
<p>Shortly following the release of the new version of the Bloodborne Remaster Project, the developer behind the project, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@fromsoftserve" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fromsoftserve</a>, shared a new video on YouTube providing a look at the current state of development. Needless to say, the future is definitely looking good for the project, as the visual upgrades it will continue to bring wouldn't have looked amiss in an official remaster.</p>
<p><iframe title="Sony won't remaster Bloodborne, but I will" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Zz5Nta-DB_Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>If it weren't for the quick development of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/shadps4-playstation-4-emulator-the-last-guardian/">ShadPS4 emulator</a>, Bloodborne would have continued to be playable only on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4. Unfortunately, despite the huge demand, Sony doesn't seem interested in officially bringing the game to PC anytime soon, so playing the game via the emulator seems like it will be the only way to go for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>Bloodborne is now available on PlayStation 4 worldwide. The game can also be played on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 5 Pro, with some minor visual improvements.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/im-much-more-excited-for-avowed-after-hearing-the-team-say-that-what-makes-rpgs-special-is-missable-content<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>‘Confident’ game design is one of those slightly fluffy critic words I sometimes find myself reaching for tenuously, knowing that - sigh - I’m going to have to do all sort of detestable nonsense like ‘back up my vague assertion with concrete examples that are useful to the reader’ if I do. Yuck. If there’s one type of design that deserves the accolade, though, it’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>s that are assured enough in the richness of their worlds to not feel the need to signpost every discovery.</p>
<p>It’s a feedback loop of charitable feelings: the game is saying "we think you’re smart enough to find this stuff on your own". "You’re right!" you respond. "I <em>am</em> smart! And anyone who recognises that must be one smart cookie". Joy abounds, it rains Tunnock’s Caramel Wafers, hedgehogs jig gracefully in the street, and all is right with the world. So, I must say, I’m quite pleased to hear <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/avowed">Avowed</a>’s environment region director Berto Ritger sing the virtues of missable content to <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/obsidians-new-first-person-rpg-avowed-channels-baldurs-gate-3-in-one-key-way-the-core-of-rpgs-that-makes-them-special-is-missable-content/">GamesRadar</a>.</p>

<p>The "core of RPGs that makes them special is missable content, to be honest, and it makes the experience feel so much more personal to how you play the game," Ritger says. You might find something special, but a mate finds something else instead. "It creates a very interesting dialog about the game," Ritger says, "and it makes your experience feel more personal to you."</p><p>For Avowed specifically, they’re aiming to allow for this with vertical environments. "We want to draw your attention to things we want you to engage with," says Ritger. "Like the lighthouse is very tall, and so everybody's going to see a big, tall thing and want to go climb. And so we want to support that as well. And you can do that, and you can jump off into the ocean, if you like. And so we try to draw your attention that way."</p>
<p>The irony of me just now saying that I like games that trust my intelligence, then Ritger saying “gamer brain make want climb big tall thing” is not lost on me. But he’s right, dammit.</p>
<p>This approach to design does, of course, raise a bit of a Schrodinger’s Cat: how am I supposed to enjoy content I don’t know is there? But the example I always find myself going back to is the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> renegade/paragon conundrum. It’s well documented that something like 90% of players chose to play as paragon Shepard, which sounds like an enormous waste of resources on the surface, but it was having the option to deck a reporter that made your restraint feel all the more heroic.</p>
<p>On the development side, it’s also a matter of resources - which, as Larian’s Sven Vincke <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-devs-tease-future-non-dd-games-say-morale-is-super-high-were-doing-our-own-thing-again">has pointed out before</a> to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/baldurs-gate/i-call-it-chaos-at-scale-for-the-first-anniversary-of-baldurs-gate-3-we-spoke-exclusively-to-swen-vincke-about-the-past-present-and-future-of-larian-studios/">PC Gamer</a> - can be a hard sell to publishers:</p>
<blockquote><p>If you see it, it'll scare you, as a shareholder, as a publisher, the very first thing you will try to do is get it under control—you will try to scope it, you will try to box it, you will try to control it, which is exactly the opposite of what we want to do. Because it's like, why are we spending a million dollars on a dragon, which nobody's ever going to see, except like five people who made that obscure choice? Because if they see it, they have to be happy too. So that's why I put the bloody dragon there, because that's the logical consequence of the things that they've done.</p></blockquote>
<p>How well Avowed will actually make good on this promise, and how much of this talk is easy piggybacking on excitement for another game that does wot Baldur’s Gate 3 done, we’ll have to wait and see. It looks like the game might have bigger issues, too. “There's also a broken-up sluggishness to it all,” is how Edwin <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/avoweds-rickety-combat-feels-like-the-undoing-of-its-lush-fungal-world">felt about combat</a>. “Animations don't flow together very charismatically, which lends a curious, stuttery cadence to the ducking and diving.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/02/loco-motive-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Loco Motive is a brand new point and click adventure that turns to the classics for its inspiration, providing an intriguing murder mystery for players to solve aboard a lavish locomotive – hey, that’s the name of the game! This is a detective story where none of the three main player characters are proper detectives. Instead, the case of a murder on a train is left to be solved by Arther Ackerman, an estates attorney, Herman Merman, a novelist who fancies himself as a detecitive, and Diana, an inexperienced agent.</p>
<p><iframe title="Loco Motive - Launch Trailer | OUT NOW on PC &amp; Nintendo Switch" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tptsZ7UD5GQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Loco Motive takes place on a luxury train called the Reuss Express, owned by the Unterwald family. This family made its fortune in trains, and is headed by the matriarch Lady Unterwald. At her ripe old age, she has decided to pass on her legacy but, before the big reveal of who her heir will be, she is murdered! Cue panic and subterfuge as the guests on the train try to figure out what is going on, while the murderer tries to keep away from the spotlight. It is not an original idea for a murder mystery – Murder on the Orient Express might even be considered the most famous of them all – but the premise is a classic for a reason.</p>


<p>You first step into the shoes of&nbsp;Arthur Ackerman, who had been tasked by Lady Unterwald to update and maintain her will. Arthur is a bit of innocent soul who loves nothing more than bureaucracy and sorting paperwork. He can also be a bit bumbling but is definitely the most lovable and endearing of the three characters. That may be because you play as him for the largest portion of Loco Motive, meaning you get to know him better.</p>
<p>Then there’s Herman Merman, a novelist who thinks he is a detective and has an over inflated ego. He is also a memorable character, mostly because he shouts his name a lot, though he can be grating and was unlikeable at times too. You spend the least amount of time with Diana, a first time field agent. She’s a likeable character too, especially as she learns how to work in the field. Of the three, Arthur will be the favourite of the majority.</p>


<p>What is great across all three characters, and the supporting cast, is the voice acting. Each character has a distinct personality because of the voices they have been given and it elevates the experience of Loco Motive. This in turn makes the comedy of Loco Motive stand out too, with absurd situations made funnier because of the excellent delivery by the actors.</p>
<p>A point and click adventure has to have puzzles in it that are headscratchers – something a little bit obtuse, but that can ultimately be worked out by a player. For the majority of Loco Motive, the puzzles toe that particular line, encouraging out of the box thinking to figure out solutions. There were a couple of puzzles though that did really stretch the thinking, eventually leading to needing help from the hint service, making you wonder how you would have solved the problem without clicking items randomly to get the right result.</p>
<p>As a clever twist, the hint service is incorporated into the world of Loco Motive. It is a service run by an actual detective who you call up and he gives advice. The first time you call for a hint for a specific puzzle he will give a small clue, laying the breadcrumbs to nudge you in the right direction. Keep asking and the clues pretty much point out the answer. Having Herman call this detective is fun, as Herman does not like him.</p>

<p>Loco Motive has a very good art style, one that will be familiar to those who have any experience with 2D point and click adventures of yesteryear. You do not have to worry about trying to click on everything in a scene to see if you can interact with it, as you can highlight all of these items in a room, meaning there’s less wasted time.</p>
<p>There are a couple of moments when Loco Motive can fall down slightly, such as the hint system not being available to help with a couple of scenarios, and an instruction box on how to switch between characters not disappearing from the screen. Within the narrative, some characters will discuss things with you about situations that are yet to come to pass, which can lead to some confusion about what to do next.</p>

            <p>Last week, Brendy left a note in our weekly Maw liveblog about <a href="https://kernelmethod.org/notes/qud_worldmap/">a player-made map</a> of Caves Of Qud, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/caves-of-qud-review-early-access">reportedly excellent</a> sci-fi roguelike RPG that lets you "chisel through layers of thousand-year-old civilizations", represented as 2D <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dwarf-fortress">Dwarf Fortress</a>-esque layouts. Glancing over that map as a newcomer to the game, my eye was caught by the creator's casual mention that Caves Of Qud is technically 2,147,483,646 levels deep.</p>
<p>"Is Caves Of Qud <em>really</em> 2,147,483,646 levels deep?" I asked Brendy, like a wide-eyed child asking whether there is such a thing as dog heaven. Brendy wasn't sure. (About Caves Of Qud, I mean, not dog heaven.) So I put the question to one of the developers, Freehold Games co-founder Brian Bucklew. In brief, the answer is yes, but with some significant caveats.</p><!--more-->
<p>In fact, Caves Of Qud is bottomless. The game's world is partly procedurally generated, adding more levels as you descend, and the only real constraint is hardware. "You can go, in practical terms, till your computer's storage fills up with zones you've visited," Bucklew told me over email. The game is designed with a certain depth in mind, he added, but if you insist on burrowing further, the systems for generating encounters, treasure and so forth will strive to support this. "The designed max is about 50 levels deep but beyond that it is effectively limitless, and some of the parameters like rarity of encounters continue to grade with depth up to the maximum integer sizes."</p>
<p>Unearthing strange items is, of course, one of the principle incentives to keep digging. "I'm not sure the deepest place players have been," Bucklew went on. "But advanced players abusing the endgame absolutely go at least hundreds of levels deep using tools like spiral borers, typically to farm for extremely rare occurrences in the deep caves, like finding cryogenic clones of yourself, duplicating your inventory, and doing that several times."</p><p>The challenge is that Caves Of Qud's code grows more erratic with depth, as though the critical workings were being crushed and suffocated by the sheer weight of rock. While poking around for stories about Qud spelunking, I've stumbled on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cavesofqud/comments/17u459b/how_deep_down_can_you_go/">Reddit threads</a> about zones where every room contains a merchant, together with more routine complaints about laggy performance.</p>
<p>Bucklew acknowledges that obsessive delvers will face a variety of technical hiccups. "This is factually true and I've received several bug reports and performance reports from players doing this," he said. "One of the key performance cases for the new UI was a save game from a player who had transformed into a crystalline monstrosity and descended at least 500 levels deep and duplicated their inventory 8 or 9 times, and was running into performance issues stepping on a stack of yet another clone with thousands of items."</p>
<p>I'm not sure I personally have the patience, or leftover lifespan, to play 2,147,483,646 levels of Caves Of Qud. But I do love the idea of a world without a bottom: there's something both harrowing and comforting about the knowledge that you can always keep digging. I also love terrain generators that misbehave when you roam too far, as with <a href="https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/minecraft-java-edition/discussion/2891447-how-to-get-to-the-far-lands-easy-fast-and-without">the horizon-wide walls of Junji Ito-ass geology</a> encountered in certain editions of Minecraft. It's as though you were slowly transiting between the realms of two gods - the god of art, craft and intentionality, and the god of luck, white noise and decay.</p>
<p>Anyway, Caves Of Qud <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/333640/Caves_of_Qud/">leaves early access on 5th December</a>, and seems likely to entertain even if you confine yourself resolutely to the surface. Prodigious catacombs aside, it's got mushroom infestations, goat-charming, spider possession, and "a novel’s worth of handwritten lore". The existing version is already one of our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">best roguelikes</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
