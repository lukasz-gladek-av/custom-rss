<ul>
<li><u>Emergency Countermeasure</u>: Cooldown is decreased from 90 to 45 seconds.</li>
</ul>
<p><b><u>Vanguard</u></b></p>
<p>????&nbsp;<i>For too long, Vanguard’s role was to be a vessel for the squad’s healing perks. With these changes, we want to reinforce ranged/melee hybrid playstyle for him. But we are not entirely done with Vanguard changes. We would like to take a closer look at his ability.</i></p>
<ul>
<li><u>Grapnel Launcher</u>&nbsp;damage now scales based on difficulty.</li>

<ul>
<li>????&nbsp;<u>Tenacity</u>: The perk has been reworked.</li>
</ul>
<p>Old:&nbsp;<i>“After killing 10 enemies within 5 seconds, Diving Kick’s Damage increases by 40% for 15 seconds.”</i></p>
<p>New:<i>&nbsp;“After a Ranged kill Majoris-level or higher enemy, Diving Kick’s Damage increases by 130%. Cooldown 15 seconds.”</i></p>
<p>????&nbsp;<i><b>Change from PTS:</b>&nbsp;Fix interaction between Shock Wave perk and Tenacity caused by double damage scaling.</i></p>

<li><b>Extreme Challenge:&nbsp;</b>Increased Extremis enemies spawn cooldown.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Gameplay QoL</h3>
<ul>
<li>Increased netcode damage cap.</li>
</ul>
<p>????<i>&nbsp;This change is going to open a huge can of worms for gameplay balancing, but it has to be done. The game damage numbers should not be restricted by net code and should be accurate all of the time. We will be monitoring which builds and perks combinations will become problematic. It’s pretty clear that some damage buffs combinations from multiple sources are already insane (looking at you Blocking Power Fist). For now, have fun.</i></p>
<ul>
<li>Sniper damage buff from Cloak Ability lasts a little bit longer to fully affect entire burst and full auto weapons.</li>
<li>Improved sound indication for unparriable attacks.</li>

<li>Fixed: Player can’t use gun strike on Lictor after perfect dodge in some rare cases.</li>

These appear as both Battle Challenges and Hyrule Challenges. Beating these will be how you unlock two new weapons, the Greatsword of Light and the Spear of the Upper Guard. There’s also some new attacks for you to learn to clear that screen of enemies.</p>


<p>Beyond that, update 1.0.2 does also bring a bunch of bug fixes and improvements.</p>
<p>Here’s the full (web browser translated and touched up) patch notes for Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment Update 1.0.2:</p>
<h2>Add new challenges and rewards</h2>
<div>
<h3>Adding a new challenge</h3>
<p>Multiple <strong>“Battle Challenges” </strong>and <strong>“Hyrule Challenges” </strong>will be added as elements after clearing the main story.<br>
New “dangerous species” such as Bokoblin and Sludgelikes have appeared. ” “Scra Attack” such as “Boko Slash”, which is activated using materials obtained from “Bokoblin (Dangerous Species)”, has been significantly improved compared to previous materials.</p>

</div>
<div>
<h3>New weapons added</h3>
<p>The “Greatsword of Light”, a special great sword blessed by Raura with the protection of the power of light, and the “Spear of the Upper Guard”, a spear given to the elite directly under King of Hyrule, will be added. These new weapons can be equipped with mysterious golems and warriors of various races.</p>
<p><em>You can get it by clearing the battles added in this update.</em></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>New dedicated sync strike</h3>
<p>A dedicated sync strike will be added to Zelda and Karamo. Zelda chases the boomerang thrown by Karamo with the power of time. If you can press [X] at the right time, you will succeed in catching the boomerang and the attack will become powerful.</p>
<p><em>You can learn it by clearing the Hyrule Challenge added in this update.</em></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Fighting with Block Golems</h3>
<p>It will be possible to activate the sync strike with the block golem. Its powerful rotating attack kicks Zako and cuts the week point gauge of the strong enemy.</p>
<p><em>In addition to the battles added in this update, it can also be activated in existing battles where Block Golems appear.</em></p>
</div>
<ul>
<li>In addition to the above, the following will be added as new battles.
<ul>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Game Improvements</h2>

<li>Added a warning sound before the end of the effect of the unique skills “Limit Break” and “Inexhaustible Battery”</li>
</ul>
<h3>Battle</h3>
<ul>
<li>Changed to be able to select characters and weapons in “training room”</li>
<li>Changed to display a preview of the recovery amount when selecting “Special Carry-on Food” and “Spare Battery”</li>
</ul>
<h3>Departure preparation screen</h3>
<ul>
<li>From the “Friends” screen of preparation for departure, change to fly to “Tweet Challenge” with the [Y] button</li>
</ul>
<h3>Hyrule Map</h3>
<ul>
<li>Add the tutorials displayed on the Hyrule map to the list</li>
<li>Visualize the area division on the ground on the Hyrule Map</li>
<li>Changed to display a preview of the area that can be recovered when the cursor is adjusted to the liberation battle</li>
</ul>
<h3>Hyrule Challenge</h3>
<ul>
<li>On the list of Hyrule Challenges, the items that can be cleared have been changed to yellow.</li>
<li>Adjust the display of the clear status of the Hyrule Challenge</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bug fixes</h2>
<p>Several problems have been fixed, including the following.</p>
<ul>
<li>The unique skill “Golem Launch” is not affected by some special effects and enhancements.</li>
<li>The tweeting challenge “Defeat 〇〇 enemies with Zonaugear” is not counted even if the conditions are met by strong attacks and air battles in Zonaugear.</li>
<li>Even if the secret function “Autoguard with a certain probability and the enemy is electrocuted/freeze/flaming” is activated by Deggama’s attack, and even if the enemy is automatically guarded, it will not be in the state of attributes assumed by the enemy.</li>
<li>If you “Switch Characters” from the pose menu, the enhanced state may be released.</li>
<li>When you select “Retry” after a specific operation, the BGM may not sound after that.</li>
<li>Inability to proceed in Ososowaku communication occurs</li>
<li>When a communication disconnect occurs in Share communication, the attack will not hit a specific enemy.</li>
<li>When playing the screen split 2P, if you select “Retry” after a specific operation, you may return to “Hyrule Map”</li>
<li>In the screen split 2P play, when Matsuba and sync strike are activated, the camera rotation operation is reversed.</li>
<li>Some screen display problems</li>
</ul>
<p>We rather enjoyed Age of Imprisonment, as the latest in the Hyrule Warriors spin-off series, and as a canonical prequel to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/05/11/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review/">Tears of the Kingdom</a>. Dom said, “This is a playful and enjoyable piece of Legend of Zelda lore, and one that will be essential for fans of the series, but it doesn’t break the same ground as Breath of the Wild, Tears of the Kingdom, or even Age of Calamity.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p><span>Here’s a reminder to turn your television down and not yell so much when playing games online. Over this past weekend, police in Northern California received reports of possible gunshots and arrived on the scene to discover, thankfully, that it was just someone playing games too loudly with their window open.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span><a href="https://www.actionnewsnow.com/news/chico-police-respond-to-loud-video-game-mistaken-for-gunshots/article_456898e1-4925-41f0-a71e-fee8a012852a.html">As reported by <em>Action News Now</em></a>, police in Chico, California, received a call from a local resident who claimed to have heard “threatening words” as well as “pop sounds” that sounded an awful lot like gunshots. <em>ANN</em> says a heavy police presence arrived at the scene around 5:30 p.m. on Saturday to investigate.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Police discovered that the situation wasn’t dangerous at all, just annoying. Apparently, a gamer in Chico was playing a video game at a very loud volume with their window open. No other details were shared about the incident.&nbsp;</span></p>  <p><span>Neither the report nor the police confirmed which game it was, but I’d assume a recently released FPS like <a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review-campaign-is-it-good-zombies-multiplayer-2000645198"><em>Black Ops 7 </em></a>or <em>Battlefield 6.</em> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ActionNewsNow/posts/police-confirmed-that-reported-gunshot-sounds-in-chico-on-saturday-night-were-ac/1258647912960506/">Over on the news network’s Facebook page</a>, commenters are also curious if it was <em>BF6 or CoD.&nbsp;</em></span></p> <p><span>It’s a silly story with a not-horrible ending, which isn’t always the case <a href="https://kotaku.com/swatting-the-hip-new-griefing-trend-sends-the-cops-5838927">when gamers and police get involved.</a> We’ve seen far too many cases of <a href="https://kotaku.com/fatal-call-of-duty-swatter-pleads-guilty-to-51-charges-1830434368">SWAT teams being called on random gamers and Twitch streamers</a> by assholes. </span><span>Thankfully, it seems that if a SWAT-like team was called, it didn’t escalate into something more serious. </span></p> </div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/guy-played-video-games-so-loud-the-cops-showed-up-2000647237]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Call of Duty’s Skill-Based Matchmaking model (SBMM) has long been the source of <strong>much debate </strong>and contention in the wider industry. It’s believed that these days, Activision’s studios want to punish you for being good at your game while trying to shoehorn players into matches with those closest to their current performance metrics, which makes things ‘sweatier’ for almost everyone on a streak.</p>



<p>It’s why people feel that a single good game in Call of Duty leads to you being ‘punished’ by SBMM. In a recent video, Charlie Olson, one of the original creators of the Call of Duty SBMM algorithms as we know them, took a dive into these very topics and debunked some of the SBMM-related conspiracy theories circulating Black Ops 7.</p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-7-sbmm-is-all-over-the-place">Black Ops 7 SBMM is All Over The Place</h2>



<p>In a new video shared by Charlie Olson of Invokation, the ‘Dark Art of SBMM’ was explored. Olson is credited with creating the current (or close to) <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-sbmm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SBMM model for Call of Duty</a> during a ten-year stint at Raven Software. He left a few years back to focus on his own company, but has remained in the realms of SBMM, MMR, and multiplayer gaming.</p>



<p>In the 40-minute video, Olson runs through the technical know-how behind MMR and SBMM, explaining why the systems are viewed both positively and negatively by the wider gaming community, even <strong>beyond </strong>Call of Duty.</p>



<p>Here’s the full walkthrough:</p>

<iframe title="The Dark Art of SBMM" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NpCmr8a9uuE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>Towards the end of his run-through of all things matchmaking, Charlie Olson addressed some of the ‘conspiracy theories’ that have surfaced in Call of Duty since Black Ops 7 was released midway through November.</p>



<p>On October 9, Treyarch posted on social media that ‘open matchmaking’ was confirmed to be coming to Black Ops 7, prompting many to fear that the game would be a casual crapfest. This is what Olson addressed first:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Some players are leaving because they thought this tweet meant SBMM had been completely removed from the game, and then they felt betrayed by the inclusion of one standard matchmaking playlist, and then blamed it for stealing ‘fodder’ from the open playlist.</p>



<p>What’s really going on here is there aren’t enough casual players at launch to make open matchmaking the pubstomp that was expected or promise. If open lobbies are sweaty, it’s because it’s mostly sweats playing.</p>



<p>Open matchmaking really does have minimal skill consideration and you can be sure that standard matchmaking isn’t pulling too many players yet, because most casual players just want the one or two modes they’re most comfortable with.</p>



<p>If you’re looking for noobs to stomp, my advice would be to try the open TDM playlist, that’s probably the best place to look.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He then jumped into the outright conspiracy theories surrounding SBMM in Black Ops 7. This core conspiracy theory suggests that Activision’s studios <strong>LIED </strong>about removing SBMM in open matchmaking.</p>



<p>Olson suggested that the evidence people are using to back up this theory is to be expected:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>This usually comes with three pieces of ‘evidence’. One, open lobbies are sweaty. Two, wait times are longer than in the beta. Three, connections are worse than in the beta.</p>



<p>But those are <strong>just trade-offs from bringing back persistent lobbies</strong> for launch, assuming they don’t want low-pop playlists to starve.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Olson wrapped with predictions, suggesting that Black Ops 7 will ‘get sweatier’ and that the player count will mirror XDefiant’s performance before the game bombed out.</p>

<p>GTA 5 can be nominated for the GOTY category in the Steam Awards 2025, thanks to the Enhanced Edition releasing this year. </p>



<p>Rockstar’s Grand Theft Auto 5 has been one of the most relevant titles in gaming for over a decade. The first iteration of the title was released for the PS3 and Xbox 360, with newer versions released with each successive generation of consoles and PCs. Now, the latest version of the game is up for the Game of the Year award on Steam. </p>







<h2 id="h-you-can-nominate-gta-5-for-goty-for-steam-awards-2025">You Can Nominate GTA 5 for GOTY for Steam Awards 2025</h2>



<p>The nomination window for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamawards/nominations/2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Steam Awards</a> is now open and will be live until December 1, 2025, 10:00 AM Pacific. During this time, players will be able to nominate games across 11 categories, including Game of the Year, VR Game of the Year, Labor of Love, Best Game on Steam Deck, Better With Friends, Outstanding Visual Style, Most Innovative Gameplay Award, Best Game You Suck At,  Best Soundtrack Award, Outstanding Story-Rich Game, and Sit Back and Relax. Winners will be announced on January 3, 2026, at 10:00 AM Pacific. </p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://gameranx.com/updates/id/557864/article/apparently-grand-theft-auto-v-is-eligible-for-steams-goty-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gameranx</a>, players have the option to nominate GTA 5 for GOTY in the first category. For those who don’t know, Steam Awards work differently from other award shows. Instead of a panel of judges deciding the nominations, Steam Awards selects nominees solely through player votes. Which means, theoretically, if players vote to nominate GTA 5 for GOTY and it receives the most votes again once the nomination period is over, it can win GOTY. The only reason it is eligible for this award is that GTA 5 Enhanced Edition was released on Steam on March 4, 2025.  </p>

<p>Available on <strong>27th November 2025</strong>, the update will add new weapons, a brand new Sync Strike for Zelda and fan-favourite Korok Calamo, and other goodies. Being typically coy there, Nintendo! The game already has a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/admin/campaigns/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-walkthrough-guide"><em>ton</em> to unlock</a>, including maxing out characters and finding all of those pesky Koroks, even if it's a little brisker than <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hyrule_warriors_age_of_calamity">Age of Calamity</a>.</p><div><figure data-videoid="hKPW8QbGdv8" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hKPW8QbGdv8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ythKPW8QbGdv8" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hKPW8QbGdv8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hKPW8QbGdv8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed6474b2gunlry&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>

<p>Well, head over to <a href="https://www.gamecity.ne.jp/zelda-fuuin/jp/update/">the Japanese website</a> and you'll see exactly what else we'll be getting — along with some extra challenges, new enemies, and more powerful materials, you'll also be able to team up with the Block Golem for <em>another</em> new Sync Strike.</p>
<p>A handful of new battles are also getting added on Thursday, including one which is apparently titled "A serious battle with Rauru". <em>Hmmm</em>.</p>

<p>There are also some <a href="https://www.gamecity.ne.jp/zelda-fuuin/jp/update/">additional patch notes</a>, which aim to fix functionality and a few bug fixes. We'll post the official translation when they're out there, but a couple of tweaks include adding tutorials that appear on the map are added to the list, previews of areas you can reclaim will show up, and a preview of the amount of health you can recover is now shown.</p>
<p>The previous Hyrule Warriors game also got a handful of updates <em>and</em> an Expansion Pass which brought with it an "expanded roster". So don't expect anything of that scale here.</p>
<p>Nintendo promised that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-already-has-free-updates-planned">it had free updates planned</a> for the game after launch. And free stuff, whatever it is, we'll take. Especially as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">we really enjoyed</a> this canon prequel to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Tears of the Kingdom</a>.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/demonschool-credits-something-different</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/demonschool-credits-try-something-different-list-full-staff-duties.1364143/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Demonschool&nbsp;</em>developer Necrosoft says that it tried "something different" for the credits sequence in the game, opting to list the full duties carried out by staff rather than a brief description of each person's role.</p>

<p>Over on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/brandon.insertcredit.com/post/3m6fuipkh4k2u" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a>, Necrosoft director Brandon Sheffield says the team used a format of "name, title, lengthy description of what they did" for each staff member's credit on&nbsp;<em>Demonschool</em>.</p>

<p>This means that, rather than simply reading "art lead", a credit might outline that a staff member "did most of the 3D modeling and rigging as well as creating most backgrounds", or that they "created most avatars and poses, all overlays and menu art, [and] the game logo".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/necrosoft-demonschool-credits.jpg?itok=cqBDsfge 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/necrosoft-demonschool-credits.jpg?itok=WQKF_MDr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Demonschool</em>'s credits are serious about giving staff members their due.</figcaption></figure><p>Sheffield says he wants to make sure that those who choose to watch&nbsp;<em>Demonschool</em>'s credits (which, he acknowledges, won't be everybody) will "come to understand how each person participated", and that doing things this way might help staff members to elucidate their roles during job interviews in future.</p>

<p>He also says that, in addition to&nbsp;<em>Demonschool</em>'s core team, Necrosoft credited "everyone who ever touched the game in any way". Sheffield acknowledges this means the credits for&nbsp;<em>Demonschool&nbsp;</em>are long for a small team, but to that, he says "why be stingy?".</p>

<p>It's refreshing to see an indie team being so upfront about its credits, especially in an era where specific studios and staff members often <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gaming-business-roundup-july-12th" rel="nofollow">aren't credited</a> in major <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/original-metroid-prime-developers-omitted-from-remastered-credits" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">releases</a> on which they worked. Whether or not this style gets adopted across the world of indie gaming remains to be seen, but I sure hope it does.</p>

<p>As for&nbsp;<em>Demonschool</em>, if you're unfamiliar with it, the game is a tactical RPG that combines the minutiae of school life with a strategic puzzle-style combat system in which you must battle demons between your own world and theirs.</p>




<p>The game was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/demonschool-persona-inspired-tactics-rpg-announced" rel="nofollow">revealed back in 2022</a>, but was subsequently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/demonschool-release-date-september-2025" rel="nofollow">delayed numerous times</a>, most recently due to Necrosoft wanting to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hollow-knight-silksong-indie-delays" rel="nofollow">avoid a clash</a> with then-hotly-anticipated Metroidvania&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>.</p>

<p>Happily, however,&nbsp;<em>Demonschool&nbsp;</em>is finally out, and you can take a look at it right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1900250/Demonschool/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10007754" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/demonschool/9p7d4xfj2xwf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/demonschool-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/light-your-outdoors-up-with-the-govee-christmas-lights-2-for-just-130-today-2000647131</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/govee-christmas-led-lights-go-for-peanuts-holiday-decor-basically-comes-free-thanks-to-exceptionally-low-black-friday-pricing.1364137/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Holiday shopping is on the rise, and if you haven’t grabbed a fun string of Christmas lights to brighten up your outdoor and indoor space, today is a good time to make the move.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5918/">Govee, a brand that offers some of our favorite smart lighting solutions out there, is now offering its outdoor-friendly, 164-foot Christmas Lights 2 for $130 on Amazon</a>. That’s after a sweet, straightforward 35% discount on the retail price of $200, thanks to an early Black Friday deal.</p>
<p>These are already high in demand on regular days, and the current discount makes them an even more popular pick. It’s best to grab yours before the stock disappears for good, which could be any moment now.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5918/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>AI-Generated Light Show</h2>
<p>These aren’t your average, golden string lights. The string comes with 500 LEDs, each of which has a built-in IC chip to realize single control. Govee adds white LED beads to the color mix for a brighter setting with high color accuracy. There are 16 million color options to choose from (you read that right), meaning you can have a different one every single day of the year and still have plenty left to explore. Go with neon green in the morning, red in the evening, and wind down with a subtle golden at night; the possibilities are endless.</p>
<p>If plain, solid colors start to feel boring, especially during festivities, there are over 130 animated lighting effects for every possible occasion. For instance, the Thanksgiving option features warmer colors for cozy gatherings and hearty meals, while the Christmas one brings brighter colors to lift the energy of the whole house instantly. You can switch colors and patterns, plus create your own effects when feeling a bit creative. Not sure what to go for? Share your vision with the Govee AI Lighting Bot, and it’s going to create one based on your preferences. You can even upload some images to give it an idea of the vibe you’re hoping to achieve. Say something like “Give me a dancing Christmas effect”, and wait for the ultimate showdown.</p>



<p>As for the installation, setting the lights up is fairly straightforward. The 164-foot length is enough to line the roof, wrap around your Christmas tree, or frame the main door. It’s ideal for most homes, but if you need another size, these lights also come in 66ft, 99ft, and 328ft size options. The prices vary, but almost all the options are going for less right now. Once you have the lights up, you can manage them using the dedicated smartphone app or through your voice with Alexa and Google Assistant. You can ask the voice assistants to turn the lights on/off, change the patterns, adjust the brightness, and more, without even getting up from your couch.</p>
<p>Finally, Govee has designed the lights to be both waterproof and dustproof. They can handle extreme weather conditions (rain, harsh sunlight, snow) like a champ, so nothing is going to dim that spark, pun intended.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5918/">The current Black Friday deal brings the price down to just $130, which is quite affordable considering all the features you’re getting.</a> Even though these are labelled as “Christmas lights”, you can use them all year round for every occasion, whether it’s birthdays, anniversaries, or even just casually at home. The brand is also offering plenty of its other top-rated lighting solutions for less, so now is a great time to stock up on both indoor and outdoor smart lights. Just be sure to act fast, as early deals tend to wrap up quickly.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Dan Houser has been on a media cycle to promote his new book. Obviously, gaming questions and quandaries are being thrown his way, and the Rockstar Games co-founder has opened up on AI usage in gaming, how he’s using it for his new game, and how it’s not all that.</p>



<p>AI is everywhere. You can’t get away from it. We’ve gone from harmless ChatGPT prompts to full-blown AI use across all media. AI’s use in gaming is causing a constant stir, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dan-houser-left-rockstar-games-due-to-disagreement-with-brother-over-companys-direction-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dan Houser</a> has discussed how his new game with Absurd Ventures is using it, and why it’s not as useful as it seems.</p>

<figure><figcaption>GTA 6 likely features AI. Credit to Rockstar Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>In an interview on the Sunday Brunch talk show, Houser was asked about his new book, called ‘A Better Paradise,’ aptly all about AI and an aspiring developer creating the perfect computer game:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“We are making a game, set in the same world, but not exactly the same story. We’ve begun work on that about 18 months ago, and that’ll be another few years in development.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The Rockstar co-founder was asked about the use of AI in his upcoming game. He’s very candid about using it, but offers some pushback on the technology:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“We are dabbling in using AI, but the truth is it’s not as useful as some of the companies would have you believe yet. It’s not going to solve all of the problems.”</p>
</blockquote>







<p>The progression of AI and whether he thinks it’s moving faster than it ever has before also came up:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“In specific areas, yes, and in other areas when we have a whole field of areas we need technology for, and AI is great at some of the tasks and can’t do the other tasks yet. So people will claim that is [AI] can solve every problem, but it really can’t yet. As far as I understand it, it’s a hold all term for future computing, and it’s not really doing a lot of the stuff yet. But if we all give it all of our money, it might do it in the future.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What do you think about the use of AI in gaming? Is it going too far? Or is this merely the beginning of a gradual transition to an era fueled mostly by AI tools and development?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The developers of Splitgate 2 have announced that the beta season will end on December 4, 2025, and the game will relaunch later that month. </p>



<p>For those unaware, the developers of Splitgate 2 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/splitgate-2-developers-say-its-going-back-to-beta/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed earlier this year</a> that they will be “going back to beta” to rebuild significant parts of the game. It seems the developers have now spent enough time retesting the title and are confident enough to bring it back to the market. </p>



<h2 id="h-splitgate-2-beta-ends-on-december-4">Splitgate 2 Beta Ends on December 4</h2>



<p>The beta end date for Splitgate 2 was revealed through a new update on their <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2918300/view/590662508143970096" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam page</a>. The announcement shows that the Beta Season &amp; active Battle Passes will be ending, alongside seasonal “rank” progress on December 4. Moreover, the beta servers will be taken down on the same day to prepare for the relaunch later that month. Details for Splitgate 2’s final beta playlist are live, and it kicked off on November 22. </p>



<p>The final Beta playtest for Splitgate 2 features Karman Station, a new power weapon, and some party modes. Karman Station was the first map ever made at 1047 games and features thoughtful adjustments to fit the modern sandbox. The final beta will also bring back the Rail Gun and will focus on a Party Mix playlist featuring updated versions of Team SWAT, Team Fiesta &amp; Shotty Snipers with more to come.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-has-going-back-to-beta-changed-splitgate-2">How Has Going Back to Beta Changed Splitgate 2?</h2>



<p>The developers also spoke about how the beta has helped the title, revealing that they have “rebuilt the entire foundation around what makes Splitgate special: portals, movement, and pure gunplay.” Factions have been removed entirely, and abilities have been reimagined as power-ups. Classic roundless modes like King of the Hill, Domination, and Team Deathmatch are back and added Classic Arena. </p>



<p>Moreover, the developers have introduced new maps, new weapons, reworked the menus, and refined systems based on Player feedback. They have also added portal overloading and EMPs, which change how map control works. Equipment has been streamlined for combat clarity, controller feel has been tuned, critical bugs have been fixed, and countless optimizations have been made. </p>



<p>In other news, the Splitgate 2 devs have <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/splitgate-2-devs-beg-fans-give-us-one-more-chance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">begged fans for one more chance</a> at their relaunch. Additionally, 1047 Games held <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/splitgate-2-developer-holds-another-round-of-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">another round of layoffs</a> to go back to beta.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">I ain't got time to bleed.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/helldivers-ii">Helldivers 2</a> is finally getting a minigun and other weapons fans have long-called for as part of the jungle-themed Python Commandos Warbond.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Due out December 2, the Python Commandos Premium Warbond adds new armor and weapons to Arrowhead’s explosive third-person action game. As well as the new minigun, which Helldivers 2 has been crying out for since launch, the warbond includes a chainsword and a flame dog.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But it’s the minigun that’s the star here, and this, coupled with the jungle theme rekindles memories of the original Predator movie, in which Jesse Ventura fired a minigun called ‘Old Painless’ at hapless enemy soldiers as well as a Yautja, while uttering the iconic line: “I ain't got time to bleed.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, if you’re fighting back against the Automatons, perhaps Helldivers 2’s new minigun will give off Terminator 2 vibes. After all, Arnold Schwarzenegger was partial to the occasional minigun, wasn’t he? At least he kept those cops alive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a post on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/25/helldivers-2-python-commandos-premium-warbond-airdrops-dec-2/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PlayStation Blog</a>, Katherine Baskin, Social Media and Community Manager at Arrowhead, leaned into the long overdue arrival of the minigun with a fun, in-universe message to players:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The Ministry of Defense received thousands of requests from squad commanders for a minigun and we’re excited to finally give our Helldivers access to the M-1000 Maxigun! Belt-fed with ultra-high ammo capacity, this one is sure to make those bugs bleed."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The AX/FLAM-75 “Guard Dog” Hot Dog, meanwhile, is a drone equipped with a flamethrower “to coat your foes in the fires of freedom before returning to your backpack to refuel.” And then there’s the CQC-9 Defoliation Tool, which very much looks like a chainsword that the Emperor of the grimdark 41st millennium would approve of.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The new primary weapon is a combination assault rifle and grenade launcher called the AR/GL-21 One-Two. “Heavy to wield, but the damage dealt is heavy too, making your primary slot more versatile than ever with two guns in one,” Arrowhead explained. check out images of all the new weapons in the slideshow of screenshots, below.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Helldivers 2: Python Commandos Premium Warbond Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The armor, too, leans into the Predator vibes. The RS-20 Constrictor light armor set is the official uniform for the League of Patriotic Arm Wrestlers, “so it’s guaranteed to give your squad bigger and more rippling biceps to intimidate the enemy.” Arrowhead! You son of a bitch!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And here’s a fun Rambo reference: “but if you’re carrying the team, maybe you need the RS-40 Best of Prey: a heavy armor set patterned after legendary Helldiver, Ronald Mambo and his famously powerful and burly physique.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Both of these armors are equipped with the Rock Solid passive, which makes your Helldiver more steadfast against staggering and ragdolling attacks.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/25/a690f335c0e8fdde0e351c3824da84fbcc85f82a-1764080654886.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">You’ll also have two capes and coordinating player cards available: Foe Rent Asunder, which is pre-tattered to give a battle-worn appearance, and Mark of the Constrictor, for Helldivers "who strangle out any anti-democratic behavior they encounter." Lovely stuff.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>If you're hunting for the best offers this week, we're actively rounding up the strongest Black Friday deals on video games, tech, and more.

<p>But, for now, I'd like to celebrate 20 years of Most Wanted — it launched in Europe on 25th November 2005, and 10 days earlier in North America — by talking about why it's so damn good, and that comes down to the simple fact that it focuses intensely on street racing and pursuit skills at a <em>driving level</em>, rather than utilising pursuit tech or special powers (à la Hot Pursuit) to bring cop chases and illegal racing activities to life in a thoroughly exciting and organic-feeling way.</p>

<p>Of course, Hot Pursuit came later, and in practice, its focus on gadgets worked really well, within the confines of what it was doing. However, in the street racing world of Most Wanted, on the streets of Rockport, and facing off against its 15 rival racers (all of whom you're charged with taking down, whilst also developing a troublesome relationship with the local fuzz), pure racing skills, timing, slick handbrakes, and last-minute misdirections are where it's at. And it's deliciously entertaining all the way for it.</p>
<p>In the races here, you get to indulge in street-set circuit and point-to-point efforts that like to hammer home that you aren't just racing, you're breaking the law. You cheeky sod. So you've got these awesome movie-like vibes straight out of the gate framing the action — something that racers don't often bring to the table outside this franchise — before the cops then show up like clockwork to make everything feel x100 cooler than it already did.</p>
<p>There's so much opportunity within this racing triangle of you versus your rivals versus the cops that no two races ever come off the same when the law gets involved. I mean, why win anything straight-up and boring style, when you can mess with some po-po at the same time?</p>
<p>Video games, and especially these days with battle passes and all that jazz, come with so much baggage, so many distractions. Most Wanted, though, has you locked and loaded, aware of your objective and on the streets racing without any of that nonsense in double quick time. This is a game where the thrill of a close thing, speed multiplied by danger, and driving super-boosted and turbo-charged with style is the order of the day, but it's also a game that gives you racing that works competitively when it has to. Indeed, the one fly in the ointment of the Gamecube version was that it had no online play, which was a shame given how well this one plays with other folk.</p>

<p>It's the sort of upper-echelons type of arcade racer that nails the <em>feel</em> of things deliciously. It strikes a sexy balance in the handling of its roster of 37 vehicles that sits exactly where it should do, in a magical spot between sim and all-out arcade silliness.</p>
<p>It's a feeling that Need for Speed games get right more than most. Hot Pursuit nailed it, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/need_for_speed_underground_2">Underground 2</a> nailed it, and Most Wanted gets it bang on, too, and it gives these games a timeless quality that's rare in the genre, meaning that even now, booting up your GameCube to have an anniversary race or two, it's not lost any of its ability to draw you in. <em>Just one more race, and then I'll write that goddamn anniversary post.</em> That sort of thing.</p>
<p>It helps, too, that the GameCube got such a good port, besides the omission of online. I was very impressed in 2005, and actually preferred the look of this one to my Xbox copy, as it didn't have that awful yellow filter that I mentioned. The less said about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/need_for_speed_most_wanted">the awful DS port</a> the better (I could have not said anything at all but where's the fun it that?), as some things are just a bridge too far, but the GameCube version got it spot on, and continues to do so, in its fluidity, wonderfully slick controls and in graphics that, while aged for sure, still bring it home and get the job done in 2025.</p>
<p>Now. With that being said, I would love to know, on this 20th anniversary of my favourite NFS, what your favourite NFS game is from the abridged selection below. So, make sure to give the poll a vote and sound off down below if you feel...well...if you feel the need. Innit.</p>

<hr>
<p><em>Got a favourite that's not in the list here, or just straight-up disagree with anything about Most Wanted, be sure to let us know in the comments!</em><em><br></em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Developer Straight4 Studios and publisher GIANTS Software have released Project Motor Racing today on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S. Players can jump in today and get a feel for the 70 cars across 13 classes and 28 tracks available at launch.</p>



<p>More tracks, cars, brands, and more will be added in post-launch updates, but right off the top, Project Motor Racing has a lot for players to dig their tires into, especially as it's <a href="https://wccftech.com/project-motor-racing-arrives-this-november-with-full-modding-support-on-day-one-new-trailer-showcases-career-mode/">arriving with full modding support,</a> which was announced this past June. And that's not just modding support for PC players, it's for console players too, thanks to the official GIANTS Editor and the UGC Portal allowing for mods to be easily integrated for all players.</p>



<p>Straight4 Studios and GIANTS Software also released a new launch trailer, which you can check out for yourself below.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Project Motor Racing | Release Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3bdKDsJcNUw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The single-player "<em>survival-style career</em>" mode lets players experience the intensity and the real-life consequences that come with professional racing, and how quickly a star-studded dream career can turn into a nightmare.</p>



<p>"<em>Project Motor Racing was created by people who love this sport and shaped by a community that cares just as much</em>," said Ian Bell, chief executive officer at Straight4 Studio, in a press release. "<em>We hope it gives racers the same sense of connection and excitement it gave us - something true to the sport we all love</em>."</p>



<p>On top of Project Motor Racing arriving with a bunch of cars and tracks to dig into, players will also be able to play it with <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-in-project-motor-racing-prologue-go-wayback/">full DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation support</a>, as it is one of this week's titles added to the list of games supporting NVIDIA's upscaling tech.</p>



<p>"<em>By combining Straight4’s racing expertise with our proven modding ecosystem, we’re creating a platform that can grow, evolve, and stay authentic through its community</em>," added head of publishing at GIANTS Software, Boris Stefan. "<em>This launch is just the starting grid for our ambitions</em>. <em>We’re committed to growing Project&nbsp; Motor Racing into a defining name in the genre</em>."</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/best-new-tabletop-games-at-pax-unplugged-2025</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-best-new-tabletop-games-at-pax-unplugged-2025.1364101/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Every year I make the short (relatively speaking) jaunt from Brooklyn down to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania for what I consider to be just about&nbsp;<em>the</em>&nbsp;best gaming convention of the year: PAX Unplugged. Last year, I put together a <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/best-new-games-at-pax-unplugged-2024" rel="nofollow">roundup of my fave games</a> I tried, and yes, you guessed it, I'm doing it again! From sneak peeks to new releases that shot right to the top of my "must-play" list, these were my favorite new Tabletop games (and one bit of accessory) I saw at PAX Unplugged 2025.</p>

<h2>Dice Words - Kosmos</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pax-unplugged-dice-words.jpg?itok=d7mrNiN5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pax-unplugged-dice-words.jpg?itok=0chqZXRi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>If there's one thing I love more than just about any other type of party game, it's word games! I'm a regular word puzzle freak (go ahead and quote me on that one), and so it shouldn't come as a surprise that I was seriously take in by&nbsp;<em>Dice Words</em>.</p>

<p>This mechanically-simple game puts your word-smithing to the test, and I think it's fair to elevator pitch it as: Yahtzee meets Scrabble. What?! That's right, in this game you're trying to make the best word you can out of seven dice you roll, and if you don't have the letters you need, you can re-roll them! Fun, visually appealing with its throwback ice machine lettering -&nbsp;<em>Dice Words</em>&nbsp;is the real deal.</p>

<h2>Frosted Blooms - Synapses Games</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pax-unplugged-frosted-blooms-board-game.jpg?itok=Ct4BtzLg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pax-unplugged-frosted-blooms-board-game.jpg?itok=7tUC7F_I 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Designed by absolute legends&nbsp;Bruno Cathala and Ludovic Maublanc,&nbsp;<em>Frosted Blooms&nbsp;</em>puts you in the shoes of a Dutch master gardener, trying to create the most beautiful field of tulips possible. Can I just say - as an aside - how nice it is to see such a strong, rich tradition of "very gentle themes" still going strong in the gaming industry? It's just so nice.</p>

<p>Anyway, I got the chance to try out a sneak peek of&nbsp;<em>Frosted Blooms</em>, and I have to say the gameplay loop is so rewarding. You draft tiles of different shapes, and play a card as you place your tile which immediately scores based on flowers you connect. It's clean, simple design that somehow skirts the line between think-y and vibe-y -- in other words: there's plenty of strategy here, but not enough to burn your brain. I loved it!</p>

<h2>Botany - Dux Somnium Games</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pax-unplugged-botany.jpg?itok=ASulAnOI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pax-unplugged-botany.jpg?itok=EAXn-40Z 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><em>Botany</em>&nbsp;is a game where you take on the role of an expert flower hunter out to find the rarest and most beautiful flora in the world. Set during Victorian times, this game immediately caught my eye with its gorgeous visual presentation and elegant, heightened theme.</p>

<p>In an expo hall full of neon colors (which, don't get me wrong, we love... and of which we'll see plenty in this list), this tonally beautiful game with its subdued presentation probably made me stop in my tracks harder than anything else on the floor.</p>

<h2>Gretchen's Garden - Lookout Games</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pax-unplugged-gretchens-garden.jpeg?itok=vmDbYITz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pax-unplugged-gretchens-garden.jpeg?itok=LCm4-gPd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Everyone's talking about succulents - those easy-to-grow, hard-to-kill plants that are super trendy right now. Well, now that I'm back from frantically over-watering my succulents that I've let wither on the windowsill, let's chat about&nbsp;<em>Gretchen's Garden</em>, a brand new tableau-building game coming out next year from Lookout Games!</p>

<p>In&nbsp;<em>Gretchen's Garden</em>, you're building up a tableau of pots and plants, watering them each round, and converting that water (in the form of water tokens) into leaf tokens to score points! You can even snip clippings from your opponents' plants, giving a bit of player interaction that we don't always see in this type of game! Keep an eye out for this one, I got to playtest a few rounds of it and I was left wanting more!</p>

<h2>The Massive-Verse Fighting Card Game - Solis Studios</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pax-unplugged-massive-verse.jpg?itok=s7ZOv2PA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pax-unplugged-massive-verse.jpg?itok=2pk7xEcK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Looking for a fun, quick, hard-hitting 1v1 card game where you throw everything you've got at your opponent? Of course you are! And that's why you should check out&nbsp;<em>The Massive-Verse Fighting Card Game</em>. Featuring eight characters from the&nbsp;<em>Massive-Verse</em>&nbsp;world, this game plays like an analog fighting game, where you'll try to outwit your opponent as you each lay down a card at the same time.</p>

<p>Some cards strike hard, others defend, and some help you power up to unleash special abilities! It's a think-y little fighting game, where you can really get in the weeds (in a good way) trying to figure out what your opponent will do next. I got a chance to playtest this one with Chris Solis of Solis Studios and, believe it or not, he whooped me! So fun, and the Starter Pack has everything two players need to jump into the action while fitting in your back pocket!</p>

<h2>Mountain Goats Legacy - Allplay</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pax-unplugged-mountain-goats-legacy.jpg?itok=_NxBILbT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pax-unplugged-mountain-goats-legacy.jpg?itok=ezHtpblF 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Now we're talking some&nbsp;<em>serious</em>&nbsp;sneak peeks, as I got the chance to playtest the absolutely incredible&nbsp;<em>Mountain Goats Legacy</em>. A new legacy version of the beginner-friendly classic&nbsp;<em>Mountain Goats</em>, this is a game about getting your cute little goats up a mountain by rolling dice and using said dice to advance your goat meeples (geeples?). Get to the top of the mountain and you score some points, but as soon as another goat makes it up there - they boot you back down to the bottom!</p>

<p>That was all present in the original game, but what makes&nbsp;<em>Mountain Goats Legacy&nbsp;</em>so special is the way each session slowly adds twists to the gameplay. In our first session (I got to try out four different scenarios), we had a simple rule that let us change how we use one of our dice. In the next scenario, a new "courage" mechanic gave us something to do with un-spent dice. And in the following scenario... an earthquake rumbled and completely switched up the numbers on the board, totally transforming how you play the game!</p>

<p>This one's not launching for a bit, but I'll be keeping an extremely close eye on it - as it was hands down one of the most fun gaming experiences I had in all of PAX Unplugged 2025!</p>

<h2>Re;MATCH - Brother Ming Games</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pax-unplugged-re-match.jpg?itok=ZE2gAKnF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pax-unplugged-re-match.jpg?itok=HGtALXYA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Wow... just... wow! This is one of those games you play that, even when playtesting in the middle of a crowded convention floor, makes time kind of stand still for a moment.&nbsp;<em>Re;MATCH</em>&nbsp;by Brother Ming games is a fast-paced fighting game using a truly unique mechanic I've never seen in this kind of fighting game: marbles!</p>

<p>Combining marble puzzle mechanics like you'd find in&nbsp;<em>Potion Explosion</em>&nbsp;with card-based fighting, you play as one of six vibrant characters out to claim victory over your opponent. In the game, you'll pull clusters of marbles on your side of the drop tower to activate special abilities, gain the support of cheering fans, and pull off powerful attacks.</p>

<p>I played against Ming himself, and aside from being one of the most genuine, cool dudes at PAX, you can tell he's also got a ton of pride of this expertly crafted, ingenious game. <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/brotherminggames/rematch" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">It launches soon on Kickstarter</a>, and I can't wait to get back to the marble tower.</p>

<h2>Song of the Wildkin -&nbsp;Bōken Games</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pax-unplugged-song-of-the-wildkin.jpg?itok=_JFoZjpp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pax-unplugged-song-of-the-wildkin.jpg?itok=B0yXF5no 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>It's hard for any game to make a big impression while still in early prototype form -- the medium is truly a tactile one, where you want to be able to see, touch, and experience the game in its most final state. So you can understand my surprise when I was truly blown away by&nbsp;<em>Song of the Wildkin</em>, which as you can see from the images above is still very much in its early stages of production! But blown away I was, as I dove into this fantasy world full of anthropomorphic animals battling strange creatures on map tiles.</p>

<p>With an absolute powerhouse of designers and artists behind it (Andrew Bosley, the illustrator of<em> Everdell </em>and Paul DeStefano,&nbsp;<em>Oathsworn</em>'s writer, to name a few), this game sparkles with energy and evocative illustrations (even in these early days stages). Coming in 2026, and boasting over 30 hours of cooperative campaign gameplay,&nbsp;<em>Song of the Wildkin</em>&nbsp;is one to watch.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Tabletop Things RPG Tiles</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pax-unplugged-tabletop-things.jpg?itok=Lm_rxE6d 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pax-unplugged-tabletop-things.jpg?itok=JOFMgjyO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Breaking the tide of board games in this list for a second, I had to drop a shout out to Tabletop Things. These locally produced (in their own small shop in New Jersey) RPG tiles set the standard for affordable, 3D RPG terrain. I was immediately taken by the sculpts on these, and love the bright, evocative colors used.</p>

<p>As you can see from the images above, Tabletop Things really leans into the modularity of dungeon tiles while still ensuring that all the pieces they produce have a lot of character to them. These aren't bland, gray corridors -- each piece pops in one way or another. In my opinion, they add a sort of dream-like quality to the table, with a bit of whimsy in their design and color choices.</p>

<h2>Wispwood - CGE</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pax-unplugged-wispwood.jpg?itok=PH0rxxYE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pax-unplugged-wispwood.jpg?itok=UIdSUU47 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Finally, let's dive into an upcoming game from&nbsp;CGE,&nbsp;<em>Wispwood</em>! This tile-laying game gives the genre a unique spin with a sort of tile rondel that forces you to place a wisp tile in a specific shape/formation. If you can't, you have to fill it a space with a tree card. But at the end of each round, your trees go away, and your wisps remain.</p>

<p>This creates a fun interplay and balance of getting the right wisps on your board when you can, while setting yourself up for success next round, too! I only tried a bit of a walk-through of this game, but I knew it was one my gaming group would love - so this is shooting right to the top of my list to try out as soon as it comes out.</p>

<h2>PAX Unplugged 2025 Wrap Up</h2>

<p>That wraps things up for this year's PAX Unplugged 2025 -- thanks so much to PAX Unplugged for having me, and thanks to all the incredible game creators, publishers, developers, artists, and more who showed off their new games with so much passion and excitement. If PAX Unplugged 2025 is any indication, next year's going to be a BIG one for tabletop gaming!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>This Anker charging bundle has become the <strong>#1 bestselling charger on Amazon over Black Friday</strong> and the pricing explains the overwhelming popularity immediately. Apple asks for $20 for a single 20W charger that doesn’t even include a cable and forces separate purchases that drive total costs upward quickly.</p>
<p>At <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3718/">$11, down from $18, you’re getting here two complete 20W Anker chargers + two USB-C to USB-C cables</a> in a single package that costs less than one official Apple charger alone. Anker’s good reputation as an <strong>Apple-approved accessory manufacturer</strong> sold in the Apple Stores instills confidence that these chargers meet quality and safety standards without paying Apple Tax premiums.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3718/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>20W Fast Charging That Meets Apple’s Official Specs</h2>
<p>This 20W power output provides the <strong>fastest charging speed supported by the USB-C ports</strong> of the iPhone 15, 16, and 17 models-just like Apple’s own charger specifications. Compared to the old 5W adapters that came packaged with earlier iPhones, this wattage offers noticeably quicker charging: by up to 50% for most devices.</p>
<p>You will be able to charge your iPhone 17 to about 50% in roughly 30 minutes when paired with a 20W charging system. For phones supporting fast, seamless top-ups during daily routines or during stopovers at home between activities, the charging speed works just as well with iPads, Samsung phones, and other USB-C devices equipped with Power Delivery fast-charging protocols.</p>



<p>The compact<strong> dual-port design includes both USB-C and USB-A outputs</strong> to charge two devices at once with no compromise in speed and without occupying multiple wall outlets. A configuration like this proves to be a real asset in homes where wall outlets remain scarce and several family members fight for a chance to charge their devices.</p>
<p>Charge your iPhone through USB-C while powering AirPods, Apple Watch, or older Lightning devices via the USB-A port with the appropriate cables. The intelligent power distribution ensures that both ports deliver optimal charging speeds rather than splitting power inefficiently, which would slow both devices down.</p>



<p>Anker has several safety features including <strong>overvoltage protection</strong> to prevent excessive voltage from damaging connected devices, temperature control that reduces power output if overheating occurs, and short circuit protection to shut off power during fault conditions. Such protections count because many no-name low-cost chargers have inadequate safety implementations and poses the risk of fire or even device damage through poorly regulated power delivery.</p>
<p>The <strong>included 5-foot USB-C-to-USB-C cables</strong> are long enough to support comfortable device use while charging, from floor outlets to desks or bedside tables, without tight stretching. The length of the cable balances portability for travel and practicality for daily use at home, where often 3-foot cables can be frustratingly short.</p>
<p>At $11, the Anker 2-pack includes four pieces in total: two 20W dual-port chargers and two 5-foot USB-C cables, all at 41% below retail this Black Friday. Apple sells its single 20W charger sans cables for nearly double which makes Anker’s value proposition for buyers needing more than one charging point absurdly favorable.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsung-tab-s10-fe-drops-to-record-low-for-pennies-might-be-time-to-offload-that-ipad-now-2000647199</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/samsung-tab-s10-fe-drops-to-record-low-for-pennies-might-be-time-to-offload-that-ipad-now.1364089/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Samsung and Apple battle relentlessly across every product category from smartphones to laptops to tablets, with each company trying to outdo the other on features, performance, and ecosystem integration. The <strong>Galaxy Tab S10 FE launched just months ago</strong> as Samsung’s direct challenge to standard iPads and offers comparable performance and features at more aggressive pricing.</p>
<p>The <em>Fan Edition</em> designation indicates this model <strong>prioritizes value over bleeding-edge specs</strong>, and positions it as the sweet spot in Samsung’s tablet lineup where you get flagship features without paying flagship premiums. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5676/">At $359, down from $499, this 128GB/WiFi model has hit a record-low price</a> on Amazon for Black Friday that undercuts not just the standard iPad but also Samsung’s own higher-tier Tab S10 models.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5676/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Display Quality That Rivals iPads</h2>
<p>The <strong>10.9-inch LCD display at 2304 x 1440 resolution</strong> contributes to sharp visuals above the standard iPad resolution while matching the pixel density of more expensive tablets. You get an <strong>on-screen refresh rate of 90Hz</strong> that results in notably smoother scrolling, animations, and gaming compared to the 60Hz screens still common on tablets from rivals in this price range. This higher refresh rate makes daily interactions feel more responsive and fluid and reduces the subtle lag that plagues lower-refresh screens when you scroll rapidly through long documents or social media feeds.</p>



<p>The<strong> included S Pen stylus is a significant added value</strong> and allows handwriting, drawing, and precise input sans separate purchases like the Apple Pencil, which adds $129 to iPad prices. The pressure-sensitive tip and low latency make writing experiences that truly feel like pen on paper, rather than plastic on glass and encourages actual note-taking and sketching rather than awkward finger drawing</p>
<p><strong>Powered by the Exynos 1580 processor</strong>, it delivers ample performance for all multitasking, gaming and media consumption needs without thermal throttling and battery draining, issues that plagued mid-range tablet chips from yesteryear. It’s <strong>optimized by Samsung for smooth performance</strong> across productivity apps such as Microsoft Office, creative tools such as Adobe apps, and entertainment platforms such as Netflix, YouTube, and mobile games.</p>



<p>The<strong> IP68 rating for water resistance speaks to the exceptional durability</strong> for tablets that are normally kept away from water exposure. It certifies submersion up to 1.5 meters in water for up to 30 minutes, covers everything from kitchen spills to poolside use to bathroom entertainment without anxiety. Protection extends the tablet’s life by surviving accidents that would destroy unprotected devices.</p>
<p>It features a large-capacity cell and efficient power management<strong> for a battery life of up to 20 hours of mixed-use</strong>&nbsp;and covers several days of normal use between charges. Super Fast Charging reduces downtime when recharging becomes necessary, providing hours of use from brief charging sessions. The starting storage configuration is 128GB, <strong>with microSD expansion supporting up to 1TB additional capacity</strong> to ensure ample room for apps and documents.</p>
<p>At $359, the Galaxy Tab S10 FE gives you a 10.9-inch 90Hz display, Exynos 1580 processor, included S Pen with AI features, IP68 water resistance, a 20-hour battery, and expandable storage at 28% below retail this Black Friday. Fan Edition positioning delivers the optimal balance of features and pricing that makes premium tablet capabilities accessible without iPad premiums or flagship Galaxy pricing.</p>

        <p>Long ago, in the golden era of Talea, the Emperor kept the lands peaceful, and the people prospered. After passing away without naming a successor between his twin sons, a civil war raged between the North, Logos and the South, Mythos – fighting for who would take control of the throne. The townsfolk lived in fear from the atrocities being carried out in the conflict. In a bid to stop the destruction, a part of the empire’s military became Talea’s dedicated protectors.</p><p>From the everlasting darkness of war, these people were the beacon of light that brought people hope. The Lumen were born, and as guardians in their provinces, they ensure the safety of the residents of Talea, both the people and the Animon.</p><p>Since ancient times, people have long studied the Animon. Not much is known of their nature to this day. They’re made of Anivis, an energy that flows through the whole world, and they possess the ability to affect emotions and interact with the very soul of every living being. Catch the Animon and become inseparable partners as you harness their elemental powers and battle alongside each other with your Holoken.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Catching Animon</strong> – Test your skills with the Holoken and catch Animon in the field to recruit them to your party or initiate an incredible and exciting battle against them to prove your mettle! Every Animon can perform their own abilities and skills, and victory is achieved through using the best strategy with your team.

If you’re feeling adventurous, you’ll be able to experiment with ingredients to help nurture your Animon.</li><li><strong>The Anispace</strong> – The Anispace is a place that exists and doesn’t exist at the same time. A space detached from the world as we know it. Here is where you’ll find your Animon after you capture them and where you’ll be able to train your Animon for battle.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-in-project-motor-racing-prologue-go-wayback/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The latest PC games to support NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation are Prologue: Go Wayback!, which launched last Thursday <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2943740/Prologue_Go_Wayback/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Steam Early Access</a>, and Project Motor Racing, due to launch <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/299970/Project_Motor_Racing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Steam</a> today.</p>



<p>The former is a single-player, open world, emergent, survival roguelike game created by PUBG creator Brendan Greene and his team at PLAYERUNKNOWN Productions. In Prologue: Go Wayback!, players can traverse a new wilderness space of around 64 square kilometers that is generated every time they play. They can chart a path across rugged terrain, overcome the elements and write their own exploration story as they attempt to reach the distant Weather Tower. The game has a year of content updates already planned, after which it will launch its 1.0 version. Players with a GeForce RTX 50 Series GPU can activate DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation to get the highest possible frame rates. GeForce RTX 40 Series users can boost their FPS with DLSS Frame Generation, and all other users can enhance performance with DLSS Super Resolution, which leverages NVIDIA's latest transformer AI model. </p>



<p>Prologue: Go Wayback! is the second of a series of game projects planned by PLAYERUNKNOWN Productions, the ultimate goal being Artemis, a massive multiplayer sandbox game that is still many years out. You can read our exclusive interview with Brendan Greene <a href="https://wccftech.com/playerunknown-qa-fortnite-and-others-just-look-like-ip-bubbles-to-me-the-metaverse-has-to-be-different/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>



<p>As for <a href="https://wccftech.com/project-motor-racing-arrives-this-november-with-full-modding-support-on-day-one-new-trailer-showcases-career-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Project Motor Racing</a>, it's the new racing simulation game developed by Straight4 Studios and published by GIANTS Software. The game offers racing fans 28 tracks spanning multiple eras and over 70 faithfully replicated cars across 13 racing classes. Project Motor Racing includes a single-player career mode, a multiplayer mode where you can compete against others and navigate races packed with four classes, all of which are attempting to win their respective categories simultaneously. GeForce RTX 50 Series players can use DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation to get maximum performance. GeForce RTX 40 Series players can increase their frame rates with DLSS Frame Generation, while all other users can activate DLSS Super Resolution to enhance image quality using NVIDIA's most recent transformer AI model.</p>



<p>Earlier this month, the city builder game Whiskerwood <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2489330/Whiskerwood/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was launched on Steam Early Access</a> by Minakata Dynamics and Hooded Horse. Its twist is that you do not manage humans, but mice who toil under cat overlords. A free demo is available, and both the demo and the full game support NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution and DLAA.</p>

              <p>The 57-inch Odyssey G9 ultrawide monitor commands attention and premium pricing,<a href="https://kotaku.com/samsung-57-odyssey-curved-gaming-monitor-240hz-1ms-is-800-off-hardcore-gamings-holy-grail-at-a-record-low-2000646508"> even when sales roll around</a>, but not everyone wants or can accommodate a display that dominates entire desks and requires dedicated space planning.</p>
<p>Standard-sized desks deserve premium gaming monitors too, and the <strong>32-inch Odyssey G55C delivers flagship features</strong> in dimensions that fit normal workspaces without sacrificing immersion or performance. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5925/">At $199, down from $329, this QHD curved gaming monitor has hit a record-low price</a> on Amazon for Black Friday and became the <strong>best-selling model across Samsung’s entire Odyssey lineup</strong>. That combination of 1000R curvature, 165Hz refresh rate, and genuine HDR10 support at this aggressive discount explains why it’s so popular.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5925/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>1000R Curvature That Matches Human Vision</h2>
<p>This <strong>2560 x 1440 QHD resolution packs 1.7 times more pixel density than standard 1080p displays</strong>&nbsp;and makes for noticeably sharper visuals where text stays crisp and game details remain clear during fast motion. As it is a sweet spot in resolution, it offers meaningful visual improvement over Full HD without the extreme GPU horsepower that 4K displays require to maintain high frame rates in demanding games.</p>
<p>Modern mid-range graphics cards handle QHD gaming comfortably at high settings, something that often forces compromise between visual quality and smooth performance if using 4K. Its wider aspect provides more horizontal screen real estate, which benefits both gaming and productivity by allowing the display of more content simultaneously, whether tracking enemies in competitive shooters or managing multiple windows during work sessions.</p>



<p>The <strong>aggressive 1000R curve radius comes closer to the natural curvature of human peripheral vision</strong> than, say, gentler curves at 1800R or even flat panels, making for immersive viewing that wraps content around your field of view. That tight curvature puts every part of the screen an equal distance from your eyes when properly positioned, minimising eye movement required to scan across the display while maintaining consistency in focus between centre and edges.</p>
<p>Racing games are dramatically better-the curved display creates peripheral awareness of oncoming corners and competitors. First-person shooters pick up situational awareness with better peripheral enemy detection. The effect of immersion proves most pronounced during longer gaming sessions, where the curved display pulls you into game worlds more effectively than flat monitors do, which maintain psychological distance between viewer and content.</p>



<p>The <strong>165Hz refresh rate ensures smooth motion rendering</strong> that eliminates the choppiness plaguing 60Hz displays when the game’s camera pans fast or the character is moving at incredible speeds. In competitive games, high refresh enables reduced motion blur and better target tracking to give you clear views of enemies in movement and quicker reaction capability when events catch you by surprise.</p>
<p>The <strong>response time of 1ms MPRT complements</strong> the high refresh by making sure pixel transitions are done fast enough to prevent ghost trails behind moving objects. FreeSync from AMD Radeon synchronizes display refresh with your GPU’s frame output and removes screen tearing for fluid visuals without the stutter that occurs when refresh and frame rates desync.</p>
<p><strong>HDR10 support extends the color range</strong> and contrast ratio beyond what standard dynamic range displays are capable of showing, revealing details in both shadows and highlights that SDR crushes into solid blacks or blown-out whites. Game scenes gain dramatic impact through deeper blacks, brighter highlights, and more saturated colors, making virtual worlds feel more alive and realistic.</p>
<p>At $199, the Samsung Odyssey hits that perfect sweet spot between immersion and practicality for standard desks, while the feature set compares well to premium monitors available for as much as twice the price.</p>

              <p>Valve’s cheapest Steam Deck model just got cheaper. The<span><a href="https://kotaku.com/valve-steam-deck-pc-console-switch-horizon-zero-dawn-re-1848628507"> Steam Deck LCD 256GB</a> will be 80 percent off for Black Friday 2025, making it somehow $20&nbsp;<em>less</em> than the portable gaming console that Nintendo released back in 2017.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck">Normally $400</a>, Valve’s three-year-old PC gaming handheld will be 20 percent off through December 1, making it just $320 to pick up compared to a new Switch after Nintendo raised the prices earlier this year over tariffs. It’s also $100 less than a Switch 2, which runs games like <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> better, but doesn’t have access to Steam’s ever-growing library of new weekly indie hits like this year’s<em> Megabonk</em>.</p> <p>Valve also ran this promotion for the LCD Steam Deck ahead of the <a href="https://kotaku.com/autumn-2025-steam-deck-sale-cheap-pc-gaming-handheld-2000627631">Autumn Steam Sale back in September</a>, suggesting to me that it’s looking to clear out stock as it focuses production on the superior but more expensive OLED models. The Steam Deck is out matched on specs by more recent PC gaming handhelds like the Rog Xbox Ally X and Lenovo Legion Go 2 but still offers the most bang for your buck.</p>

 <p>It might struggle with some newer high-end blockbusters, but even games like <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>can run <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-steam-deck-performance-worth-it-1851777121">surprisingly well</a>. Plus, Steam remains the day-one launch pad for Early Access games and all of the big hits from <em>Vampire Survivors</em> to <em>Balatro</em>.</p>

 <h2>The Steam Deck 2 is still just vaporware</h2> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-deck-2-amd-magnus-apu-ps6-xbox-1851786832">As for a&nbsp; Steam Deck successor</a>, well, it doesn’t sound like Valve is planning on launching one anytime soon. “We’re really interested to work on what’s next for Steam Deck…the thing we’re making sure of is that it’s a worthwhile enough performance upgrade to make sense as a standalone product,” Valve software engineer Pierre-Loup Griffais <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/valve-says-it-has-a-pretty-good-idea-of-what-steam-deck-2-is-going-to-be-explains-why-its-holding-off-for-now">told <em>IG</em>N</a> earlier this month.</p>

 <p>That echoed comments he made back in 2023 tempering expectations of a hardware revision anytime soon. “I don’t anticipate such a leap to be possible in the next couple of years, but we’re still closely monitoring innovations in architectures and fabrication processes to see where things are going there,” he said.</p> <p>Sounds like nothing’s changed. The current Steam Deck should be Valve’s default at least for a couple more years.</p>
