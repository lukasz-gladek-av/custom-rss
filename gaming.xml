            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/war-thunder-to-get-path-traced-global-illumination-frame-generation-and-omm-ser-support.1238559/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Gaijin Games has outlined a series of major technical improvements coming to War Thunder with the Leviathan update. Chief among them is easily the addition of Path Traced Global Illumination, or PTGI, an update to the existing ray tracing implementation <a href="https://wccftech.com/war-thunder-adds-raytracing-and-hdr-on-pc-and-xbox-one/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">originally introduced several years ago</a>.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://warthunder.com/en/news/9596-development-graphics-improvements-in-the-leviathans-update-en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">newly published blog article</a>, the studio explained:</p>



<p><em>It’s important to keep the game visuals improving. Ray tracing already improves shadows, reflections and ambient occlusion. But now it is time to improve global illumination. There’s a new option now, which when enabled, replaces ambient occlusion. We call it Path Traced Global Illumination or PTGI. Back in 2018 (time flies), when we introduced Global Illumination (GI) to War Thunder, it was a big visual leap, but technology keeps improving, and now we can do it even better.</em></p>



<p><em>PTGI is simulating light, bouncing around in the scene, and calculates the lighting on surfaces which are indirectly lit. For example, in shadows, indoors or valleys. The old GI does a great job with this very topic, but it has its limitations. It works on a much more simple and inaccurate representation of the world, and it has a limited range.</em></p>



<p><em>The first usually shows as light leaking. This is when light appears where it should not be. PTGI cleans all of these leaks up and makes the lighting in interior areas much more consistent with the rest of the scene. Also, PTGI embraces light more as it can simulate its bounces on a larger scale.</em> <em>Another very notable difference is that as the old GI is working on a simplified scene, many times it thinks the surface should be lit by the sky, when it shouldn’t. As a result, the indirectly lit areas having a blue tint on them — more than there should be.</em></p>




<figure></figure>





<figure></figure>




<p>PTGI is surely more costly in terms of performance than the previous implementation, but War Thunder users will also get frame generation support from NVIDIA, AMD, and Intel: </p>



<ul>
<li>NVIDIA DLSS Frame Generation, working on NVIDIA GeForce RTX 40 Series and above GPUs when DLSS is enabled</li>



<li>AMD FSR Frame Generation, working on AMD Radeon RX 5000 Series and above, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 20 Series and above, and Intel Arc, when FSR is enabled</li>



<li>Intel XeSS Frame Generation, working on Intel Arc GPUs when XeSS is enabled</li>
</ul>



<p>Beyond these additions, Gaijin is also working on optimizing the game further, both on the CPU side and the GPU side, especially with ray tracing or path tracing enabled. Additionally, the developer announced that it will add support for Opacity Micro-Maps (OMM) and Shader Execution Reordering (SER), two features currently available to developers via the DirectX Preview <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-agility-sdk-directx-shader-execution-reordering-opacity-micromaps-support-huge-ray-tracing-improvements-on-nvidia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released a month ago</a>. Of course, you'll need hardware that supports OMM and/or SER to actually benefit from these features; NVIDIA graphics cards have supported both since the RTX 40 Series.</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-edge-of-eternities-preview</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/magic-the-gathering-edge-of-eternities-preview.1238547/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s been a month since Magic players were able to dive into the realms of Final Fantasy and its casts of memorable characters, but now it is time to look at the stars and prepare to blast off with the trading card game’s next set, Edge of Eternities. IGN recently had a chance to check out some new cards and get a breakdown of the set’s new mechanics players will get to play around with when the set launches on August 1 (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/444201D0-E247-4164-B254-C36E737E7C06?" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>preorders are available now</u></a>). </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Edge of Eternities Important Dates:</strong></h2><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>July 18: Full Card Image Gallery</strong></li><li><strong>July 25-31: Edge of Eternities Prerelease Events</strong></li><li><strong>July 29: MTG Arena Release Date</strong></li><li><strong>Aug. 1: Worldwide Tabletop Release</strong></li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">From spaceships to alien races, this new release marks a drastic departure from the more high-fantasy aesthetic that Magic is known for, but at its core, this is still very much a Magic: The Gathering set. One thing the team wants to make very clear is that Edge of Eternities is science fantasy, not science fiction, which means you can expect to see both flying space whales and spaceships. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As it is still early days in the spoiler cycle, Wizards is still keeping a vast majority of the set’s contents under wraps, but we do have confirmations that some of Magic’s scariest creatures will be making their appearance around the Blind Eternities. Once again, Eldrazi, residents of the Blind Eternities, will be causing havoc for players with the reveal of ‘Anticausal Vestige’. For six mana reads “When this card leaves the battlefield, draw a card, then you may put a permanent card with mana value less than or equal to the number of lands you control from your hand onto the battlefield tapped” with Warp 4 (more on Warp in a moment). More exciting, however (and I admit I am partially biased towards this next one because I love them and have decks of them), it looks like Slivers are making their return! We got to see a new alternate showcase art version of the Sliver Overlord, and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GloP4xJhkUU" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>narrative that Wizards has been releasing</u></a> for the set also implies the return of these fury-enducing creatures, which I can’t wait for. After all, being a hivemind and all, what good would only a single Sliver do?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Edge of Eternities also sees reprints of the highly requested and sought-after Shock Lands - special dual-colored lands. These lands will allow you to tap for one of two colors of mana, and while similar cards normally come in tapped, by taking a little damage, Shock Lands will enter untapped, meaning you can use them right away!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Compared to some of the more recent sets, Edge of Eternities takes it easy with only four new mechanics -<em> Void, Warp, Station,</em> and <em>Lander Tokens</em>. Station was first revealed during <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/feature/collecting-edge-of-eternities" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>MagicCon Vegas</u></a> and is similar to Crewing vehicles, whereby tapping creatures grants a benefit; however, Station has some important differences. Firstly, tapping creatures to Station something can only be done on your turn at sorcery speed, doing so will put a counter on that card based on the total power of the creatures you tapped, and once a threshold is met, the card will gain access to new abilities. While we have seen examples of Starships that include the Station mechanic,  Wizards has now revealed a new land type, planets, that will also benefit from this mechanic. Each of the five main colors will feature their own speciality planet that when stationed will have some pretty powerful effects, such as blue’s ‘Uthros, Titanic Godcore’ that by default will tap for a single blue but when its Station 12+ requirement is met, for a Blue and tapping Uthros will add a blue mana for each artifact you control.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Magic: The Gathering - Edge of Eternities Preview</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Next up is Warp, an alternate casting option for the cards with it. By casting a card for its Warp cost, which looks to be less than its normal casting cost, it will enter the battlefield and then get exiled on the next end step. The twist with these cards is that they can then be cast at a later time for their normal cost from exile. From what it looks like, many of these cards with Warp will have “when they enter” trigger effects, allowing you to take advantage of that effect twice. However, being able to play these cards from exile is only available if they are sent to exile due to paying the Warp effect, so if another card exiles them instead, they are gone for good and can’t be played.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Paired with Warp, Void provides players with new options to enhance the effects of the cards it appears on. By playing a card with Void after a non-land permanent has left the battlefield or a card has been played for its Warp cost (referred to as spell warped), then the Void card’s effect will be strengthened. I’m intrigued by the sort of synergistic opportunities that may arise between various Warp and Void cards.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lastly, there are the Lander tokens that are being introduced in this latest set. By paying two colorless mana and sacrificing the token, you can search your library for a basic land and put it into play tapped. Right off the bat, I can already see how cards that generate these Lander tokens will prove to be powerful additions to any Landfall deck, and coming off of Final Fantasy, cards like ‘Tifa Lockhart’ whose power doubles whenever a land comes into play will be able to easily take advantage of the additional lands dropping in. For even more utility, if you are playing a deck with ‘Wandering Minstrel’, this would make the lands that the Lander tokens bring out, come out untapped instead of tapped, letting you use them right away! Talk about mana ramp!</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Magic: The Gathering - Edge of Eternities - Card Preview</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Outside of the mechanic like Warp, with cards like the newly revealed Cosmogoyf (“This creature’s power is equal to the number of cards you own in exile and its toughness is equal to that number plus 1”) and Sothera, The Supervoid (“Whenever a creature you control dies, each opponent chooses a creature they control and exiles it. At the beginning of your end step, if a player controls no creatures, sacrifice Sothera, then put a creature card exiled with it onto the battlefield under your control with two additional +1/+1 counters on it”) gives me the sense that Wizards is aiming to make your exile zone into a resource all of its own. If that ends up being the case, cards with Flashback or something like Agatha’s Soul Cauldron that let you exile cards from graveyards could easily make a card like Cosmogoyf super scary. We will have to see how much they lean into messing around with exile (hopefully, there won’t be too many “exiled this way” cards so you have to keep track of what cards get exiled with what). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Edge of Eternities continues to push Magic: The Gathering into new dimensions with this space fantasy adventure. Who knows what other mysteries lie in wait out near the Blind Eternities and what horrors await players? This peak at the set has given us a taste of starting to concoct new deck ideas, and over the next month, more and more will be revealed. In the meantime, be sure to enjoy the amazing cards from the recent Final Fantasy set, including keeping your eyes open for the cards <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-cards-best-sellers"><u>everyone seems to want</u></a> and are <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-magic-the-gathering-best-cards-to-chase-and-buy-today"><u>chasing after</u></a>.

Intriguingly, Naughty Dog makes it clear that it sees the new Chronological Exprience option as something extra, rather than a replacement for the game's original storytelling that was "very intentional and core to how our studio wanted Part 2's themes and narrative beats to impact players." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Naughty Dog even goes as far as to say that new players are recommended not to use the Chronological Experience option for their first run through the game, and instead experience Part 2's story in the way it "was originally developed."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Described as a "fascinating new way to enjoy this chapter," the game's new Chronological Experience option comes hot on the heels of The Last of Us TV series' divisive second season, and just days after it was confirmed that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/naughty-dog-chief-neil-druckmann-to-step-away-from-hbos-the-last-of-us-ahead-of-season-3-to-focus-on-game-development">franchise creator Neil Druckmann would no longer play a part in the HBO adaptation's future</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Through the new Chronological mode, we believe players will gain even deeper insight into Part 2's narrative," Naughty Dog's Jonathon Dornbush <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/07/08/introducing-the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-chronological-experience-out-today/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a> today. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Players will be able to see how Ellie being gifted a guitar flows so neatly into her learning to play, for example, while the journey through Seattle will showcase the fascinating parallels between Ellie and Abby's crisscrossing journeys. You'll see just how close they come into running into each other, how their actions impact each other, and more."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/08/d53d3c94ca9939437864e11c5c862cb5ad9fd971-1751988631007.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Last of Us meets Uncharted.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Chronological Mode was worked on by Naughty Dog in collaboration with co-development partner Nixxes, and once completed will award new PlayStation trophies, as well as a couple of bonus outfits. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Today's update adds costumes for Joel dressed as Uncharted hero Nathan Drake and Tommy as, appropriately, his brother Sam Drake. Finally, a smattering of additional bug fixes and performance improvements are also included.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Next up for Naughty Dog, and Neil Druckmann, will be the studio's upcoming sci-fi project <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/naughty-dog-heads-to-space-with-intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-the-game-awards-2024">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a>.

                <p dir="ltr"><a dir="ltr" href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ready-or-not/news/">Ready or Not</a> developer VOID Interactive faced backlash in June for "censoring" the game to comply with the console certification process. The developer has defended its choices as not fundamentally altering Ready or Not's violence or its grim tone, but instead making minimal alterations to <a dir="ltr" href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ready-or-not-censoring-content-to-get-certified-for-console-release-upsetting-fans/1100-6532917/">ensure compliance with the requirements of other platforms</a>. In the wake of the backlash, VOID Interactive has released a new statement that clarifies exactly what content has been altered, going as far as to include "before" and "after" images to illustrate changes.</p><p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1144200/view/526472884483263337?l=english" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">statement</a> emphasizes that no major changes have come to Ready or Not's shootouts. Players can still sever the limbs of foes with gunfire and it still includes plenty of blood and guts. However, players can no longer dismember the dead bodies of enemies. Elsewhere, the update removes nudity, softens an allusion to child sexual-abuse material, and replaces a convulsing NPC with a sleeping one. The statement elaborates, "The effects of gore and violence -- key to the game’s immersive realism -- have not been toned down...we’ve only made changes where absolutely required, and only to the letter of the regulations -- no further."</p><p dir="ltr">The statement has not halted the backlash. Portions of the game's community has continued to review bomb Ready or Not. While the overall rating is steady at "very positive," recent reviews have plummeted to "mostly negative." Multiple reviewers claim the changes have had a dramatic effect on the game's tone. One says, "It now feels like just another generic tactical shooter, weighed down by clunky AI and stripped of the atmosphere that set it apart." Other reviews find the controversy incredibly silly, with one reviewer advising the aggrieved to "touch grass."</p><p dir="ltr"><a dir="ltr" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1144200/Ready_or_Not/" rel="noreferrer nofollow ">Ready or Not</a> is still on discount as part of the Steam Summer Sale.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/islanders-new-shores-review-desire-lines</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/islanders-new-shores-review-desire-lines.1238532/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Islanders</em>! Very much an underseen gem of a game when you consider the amount of cozy, pastel, pseudo-wholesome games you can come across in one sitting. Still, its addictive, albeit temperamental gameplay loop is enough to feast on for a while, and that’s in spite of its sneaky scoring mechanics. Seems like UK-based developers Coatsink think so as well, which is why <em>Islanders: New Shores</em> is here to build bridges to new worlds.</p>

<p>In tandem with Thunderful Publishing, <em>Islanders: New Shores</em> ups the ante with new islands and reinforced mechanics. It’s still the same minimalist city builder that became a hit to begin with, but Coatsink and new developer The Station have paid attention to how it all fares in magnification, as opposed to the quick bursts that the original <em>Islanders </em>relished in so thoroughly. The result is a game looking to the future, as <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/06/islanders-new-shores-launches-july-10" rel="nofollow">a hefty roadmap was published pre-release to show what's in store for <em>New Shores</em>.</a></p>

<p>Gameplay is as follows: you are presented with small, deserted islands, and a choice between what is essentially two booster packs. Pick one, and you’re given a handful of resources and buildings you can place around the island, ranging from houses and facilities to nature generation and manipulation. If you’re able to reach a score threshold before you exhaust the booster pack, you unlock another pack, and if you do it enough times on one island, you’re able to travel to the next island to do it over again.</p>



<p>Despite the game saying you can travel to the next island as soon as you reach said threshold, there’s no worthwhile reason to do so. The main objective of the game is to accrue as many points as possible, and there’s no bonus for simply dipping – on the contrary, in fact, as those numbers add up into fairly hefty chunks in the aftermath. It’s also where most of <em>Islanders</em>’ magic is shown off, and in <em>New Shores</em>, that’s only been exemplified even more.</p>

<p>Once the final possible piece is laid down, there’s a chance for the HUD to remove itself, and the game simply orbits around your current island, lights coming on as the day dims, and it soothes. Compared to the original <em>Islanders</em>, <em>New Shores</em> is much warmer and moodier, bringing with it a photo mode which, while heavily restrictive in opportunities present at time of writing, extracts enough of what’s possible in-game.</p>

<p>It’s quite an achievement to let macrocosms hit so thoroughly, but <em>New Shores</em> manages to do it every time, even as the islands get bigger and more robust. While citing inspirations like <em>SimCity </em>and <em>Bad North</em> for the original <em>Islanders </em>release in 2019, part of me believes that 2021’s <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/loop-hero" rel="nofollow"><em>Loop Hero</em></a> may have played a hand in how <em>New Shores</em> presents itself.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Early on in your adventure, you’ll have to unlearn the possibility of letting aesthetics and efficiency share the limelight, a harsh lesson that may make or break how you perceive the game’s flow sometimes. Despite many of the pieces in <em>New Shores</em> having the potential to stack into each other like it’s <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/tetris-effect" rel="nofollow"><em>Tetris</em></a>, a lot of the time, the game will not allow it without wasting precious space.</p>

<p>The other trick you’ll have to learn is how houses and mansions differentiate from each other, as in what is incidentally an ingenious little nugget of class commentary, the two do not intermix well at all. The mansions yearn for diamonds, markets, and monuments, while the houses need distractions, taverns, and circuses. You’ll need to frame this into muscle memory, as in a rather horrific oversight, the game doesn’t present a glossary or index of items and bonuses you can come across.</p>

<p>One could argue that it would impede on <em>Islanders</em>’ minimalist nature as a whole, but <em>New Shores</em> clearly wants to strike bigger and bolder strokes, especially as time goes on in its “Endless” mode. Each new island brings a new biome, that new biome bringing a new building alongside it, as well as potential bonuses to build around. These can range from ancient rocks, which provide hefty point bonuses when broken, to the biome literally rising from the ground with each new point threshold.</p>



<p>With that said, that last prospect of the biome rising from the ground? That has a chance to just kill your run completely. It's a very,&nbsp;<em>very&nbsp;</em>rare occurrence, but it's possible for the game to simply not give you the space or choice of resources to move on to the next threshold, which is utterly deflating. Despite the rarity of this anomaly, it's worth keeping in mind how little&nbsp;<em>Islanders&nbsp;</em>focuses on the next step, instead how it all stands. It's like the&nbsp;<em>Wallace &amp; Gromit&nbsp;</em>sketch with the train-tracks, only I'm not laughing.</p>

<p>It’s a mechanically mesmerizing experience, even if its pacing and progression lets it down by awkwardly heaving it in front of you. The amount of time you can spend on some of these islands trying fruitlessly to slam buildings into tricky spots like groceries in bags, and knowing that the next island presented is going to double that time in one go. Endless mode, despite those bursts of magic, is an endurance test that will turn your God-given powers into sloppy slaps of building placement that are ruined by fatigue.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The other big miss is the sound design, lacking a real aural achievement to go alongside its little touches. The music never felt like it fit in with whatever you were planning to create, the plodding and plonking of fake glockenspiel and kalimba sticking out like a sore thumb, when the ambience does so much more to add to the aesthetic than it ever could. Plop a few houses down and listen to the bustle, how it dances with the wind, and that’s <em>New Shores</em> right there.</p>

<h2><em>Islanders: New Shores&nbsp;</em>Review | Final Verdict</h2>

<p>It’s easy to call <em>Islanders </em>addictive, and <em>New Shores</em> even more so. Coatsink and The Station clearly have what’s necessary to make its mechanics a lock-on for long stretches of mucking about, but this exercise of expertise is hamstrung by the extra weight. As it stands, <em>New Shores</em> is going to move to fresh lands, as the roadmap promises, and honestly, given what’s shown so far? It’s worth it to jump on the boat now. The future's a bonus.</p>

The mode takes Abby and Ellie’s stories and interleaves them in chronological order rather than the nonlinear story of the original version of the game, which used timeskips and flashbacks. </p><p>In addition to Chronological Mode, the patch also includes new achievements and skins to use in <em>Part II Remastered’s</em> roguelike game mode No Return. Now you can dress up Joel and his brother Tommy like Naughty Dog’s other pair of visually indistinct, emotionally constipated brothers; Nathan and Sam Drake. Naughty Dog does still recommend that first timers play <em>TLOU Part II</em> normally before tackling Chronological Mode but that, “the team’s hard work has paid off with a fascinating new way to enjoy this chapter.” Chronological Mode will give players a new reason to pick up the game <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/645923/the-last-of-us-renewed-for-season-3-just-ahead-of-hbo-return">while awaiting the next season of the show</a> which will <a href="https://www.theverge.com/hbo/673868/the-last-of-us-season-2-finale-hbo">dive into events from Abby’s perspective</a>. Season 3 though, will proceed without Neil Druckmann as co-lead. Druckmann, co-director of both <em>The Last of Us</em> games and creative director at Naughty Dog, recently announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/696939/the-last-of-us-co-creator-neil-druckmann-is-stepping-back">that he’s taking a break from the show</a> to focus efforts on the studio’s games including the recently announced, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24320197/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-naughty-dog-trailer-game-awards-2024"><em>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</em></a><em>.</em></p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/701060/the-last-of-us-part-ii-chronological-mode-season-three-hbo]]></content:encoded>

But what’s got me the most jazzed about the second season isn’t just watching my adopted anime children <em>Scooby-Doo</em> their way out of an <em>X-Files</em> jam; it's poring over its animator’s rough draft key animations on Twitter.&nbsp;</p><p>While it isn’t rare for animators for shows like <a href="https://aftermath.site/gquuuuuux-finale-gundam" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Mobile Suit Gundam GQuuuuuuX</em></a> to <a href="https://x.com/gojooni/status/1937541488973643806" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post illustrations on social media</a> following the release of a new episode to drum up excitement (and marketing) for their anime and <a href="https://x.com/HideMatsubara/status/1937543228494102568" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bid farewell to their co-workers</a>, the folks at Science Saru have made it a tradition to have its animators post snippets of the production materials they worked on in new episodes.&nbsp;</p><p>These key animation production materials—whose rough versions are called <a href="https://sakuga.fandom.com/wiki/Genga" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Genga </a>and cleaned-up versions are called <a href="https://sakuga.fandom.com/wiki/Nigen" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nigen</a>—are essentially a behind-the-scenes look at how the anime sausage is made. It’s similar to looking at the version history Google Doc of a stellar review with all the <a href="https://x.com/SHUTOENOMOTO/status/1857189960685949072" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">strikethroughs, moved graphs, and editor comments</a>. Only with ningen do you get to see what the chiseled granite of animation looked like in its final stages before <a href="https://gizmodo.com/netflix-animation-anime-interview-power-house-sam-deats-adam-deats-david-how-2000517324" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">color shading and compositing</a> come into play making the fluid animation (<a href="https://sakuga.fandom.com/wiki/Sakuga_Wiki" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sakuga</a>) of anime episode what it looks like upon release.</p><p>What’s interesting about Science Saru animators posting various keyframes—whether they’re simple running cycles, head turns, <a href="https://x.com/dancing_stew/status/1940847223060983966" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">character acting</a>, or action scenes—is that many of them last no longer than four to eight seconds. Still, each keyframe plays a crucial role in making every part of <em>Dan Da Dan</em>’s animation shine—whether it's in its opening theme or within the episodes. Essentially, looking at Science Saru’s team's piecemeal work on new episodes is like watching a street artist sign their name on a giant mural. Plus, by checking out their keyframes in isolation, I get to geek out over small animation details I might not notice in the chaos of the final episodes, like when Momo (my favorite character) makes a goofy face in the middle of a fight.&nbsp;</p><p>While I’ve meticulously set my Twitter algorithm to show me posts from Science Saru animators whenever a new episode drops, folks who also love behind-the-scenes animation details can visit websites like <a href="https://sakugabooru.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sakugabooru.</a> This site not only functions as a database for a wide range of anime shows, tagging various techniques and styles, but also links back to the animator’s Twitter accounts if people want to follow a creator’s work. I find this especially helpful in avoiding the trend where anime fans credit streaming platforms like Netflix and Crunchyroll for the animation quality, rather than recognizing the studios and animators who put in the effort to give those shows their shine and just desserts.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-layoffs-microsoft-vested-unvested-shares-stocks"><h3>Xbox’s ‘Golden Handcuffs’ Are Screwing Over Laid Off Workers</h3></a><p>'Unvested shares' are something I didn't even understand last week but this week have been floored by</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/hideaki-anno-is-animes-ultimate-wife-guy"><h3>Hideaki Anno Is Anime’s Ultimate Wife Guy</h3></a><p>Moyoco and Hideaki Anno might dethrone Sailor Moon and Hunter X Hunter’s creators as anime’s it couple.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/sid-meiers-colonization-pc-windows-game"><h3>Sid Meier’s Colonization Is The American Video Game</h3></a><p>No game has told the American story better, whether intentionally or not</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/dandadan-anime-sakuga-science-saru]]></content:encoded>

Even though a player may be capable of dealing enough damage to kill a Tormented boss in just a few blows, there are instead multiple periods where players are forced to endure various mechanics while the boss becomes invincible for a set amount of time.</p><p dir="ltr">The immunity phases are especially annoying (and have been basically since the game's launch) for the Echo of Lilith boss fight due to her attacks causing a stacking debuff that will eventually one-shot players. Add on the fact that the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-season-8-players-are-fed-up-with-its-bugged-lilith-boss-fight/1100-6532596/" data-ref-id="1100-6532596">Lilith fight has been bugged</a> recently so that she sometimes never leaves her invulnerability phase, and players are largely fed up with having to wait to deal damage despite being strong enough to kill bosses outright.</p><p dir="ltr">What specific changes to Diablo 4's endgame bosses, or when they may arrive, are still a mystery, as Fletcher didn't elaborate further. However, Fletcher recently had this to say on social media following Blizzard's recent Diablo 4 Season 9 Campfire Chat livestream.</p><p dir="ltr">"Just know, your warcries of wanting more change aren't going unnoticed," Fletcher <a href="https://x.com/PezRadar/status/1938720086338216264" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said</a>. "The team has been cooking on some of the biggest changes that really hit home on things people have been asking for and more. We will share more as we get closer."</p><p dir="ltr">Diablo 4 Season 9 started July 1 and will run through September 23. Blizzard has not yet outlined more concrete plans for Season 10, but players can hope that some of the bigger changes Fletcher is alluding to will arrive around then.</p><p dir="ltr">In the meantime, players have recently discovered an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-now-has-a-very-easy-to-replicate-infinite-damage-bug/1100-6533026/" data-ref-id="1100-6533026">easy Diablo 4 infinite-damagebug</a> for the Sorcerer that will likely be fixed soon. In addition to changes for Diablo 4, Blizzard has also teased <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cryptic-diablo-2-anniversary-tweet-is-giving-fans-hope-for-new-content/1100-6532876/" data-ref-id="1100-6532876">Diablo 2 news</a>, which fans are hoping is new content for the classic ARPG.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Time Flies has a simple and humorous premise. Players control a fly and must complete a long bucket list over a short life span. The game has been buzzing around since its reveal in 2022, but it’s finally landing later this month.</p><p>Developed by Playables designers Michael Frei and Raphaël Munoz, creators of similarly sparse abstract games such as <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/kids/standing-out-by-blending-in">Kids</a> and Plug &amp; Play, this hand-drawn black-and-white adventure tasks players with buzzing around a house to complete a checklist. This includes learning an instrument, becoming wealthy, or getting drunk. Goals are both explicit and obscure, and the challenge comes in figuring out how to accomplish them as a tiny fly before its brief life expires.</p><p url="https://youtu.be/FzAwgAIXn28?si=njDmdSiVMyocZEPZ" width="640" height="360" responsive="1" show_suggested="1" privacy_mode="0" autoplay="0" show_player="1" start_at=""><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FzAwgAIXn28" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>The fly's average life expectancy ranges around 60 seconds, though this varies based on your physical location (which you’ll enter at the game’s start). Dying means starting the whole game anew, though your progress hastens as you learn how to complete tasks more quickly. Time Flies’ description succinctly sums up the thematic core of the experience: “Make the best of the time you have left, because we’re all going to die.”</p><p>“Flies are pretty annoying, and we’ve been listening to one every day for the past four years of game development,” says Michael Frei in a press release. “Please do your part and Wishlist the game now, I really need therapy.”</p><p>We played Time Flies during Summer Game Fest 2022, and were amused and engrossed during our short time with it.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>There’s a new update for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-last-of-us-part-2-remastered">The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered</a>, which adds a new way to play through the game’s story with the chronological mode.</p>
<p>The new feature is added today in patch 2.1.0 for PS5 and patch 1.5 for the game on PC via Steam and Epic.</p>


<p>The Last of Us Part 2 was released with a story that plays out non-linearly, showing Ellie and Abby’s stories in a jumbled up order that also blends in flashbacks alongside the present-day story.</p>
<p>“Through the new Chronological mode,” Naughty Dog’s Jonathan Dornbush writes, “we believe players will gain even deeper insight into Part II’s narrative. Players will be able to see how Ellie being gifted a guitar flows so neatly into her learning to play, for example, while the journey through Seattle will showcase the fascinating parallels between Ellie and Abby’s crisscrossing journeys. You’ll see just how close they come into running into each other, how their actions impact each other, and more.”</p>
<p>The studio still recommends playing the game as it was originally put together, but this gives a potentially fresh perspective. If you do play this way, however, you will be able to unlock two new skins that dress Joel up as Nathan Drake and Tommy up as Sam Drake, made available for the No Return roguelike survival mode.</p>

<p>That this update even exists is an unusual one, coming half a decade after the game’s original launch on PS4, and in some ways it feels like this echoes <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2015/12/04/going-back-to-beyond-two-souls-on-ps4/">the chronological story mode added to Beyond: Two Souls</a> for its PS4 remaster. It’s also strangely timed to release this after Season 2 of HBO’s The Last of Us adaptation, which inherited the non-linear story of the game. Surely if there was a time to reconsider how the tale was to be unspooled, it would have been through the TV series? Certainly, this could have helped with some of the most…. disliked narrative points in both game and TV show.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered Review –&nbsp;Is it worth upgrading?" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s7rBjOlu5NQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Looking back at The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered’s release for PS5, Gamoc said, “The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered refines and improves a much misunderstood masterpiece. It’s hard not to be amazed at how good this game still looks, and it comes with a new mode and some behind the scenes stuff to enjoy. It’s not as big a step from the original release as TLOU Part 1 was, and so feels like a less noteworthy release, but the price for upgrading from PS4 is reasonable for what you get. For those who haven’t played it, this will be the best version to play, even if it’s just for No Return to add some more longevity without all the incredibly intense emotional stress of the main story.”</p>

<p>Say hello to 'Ninsight'</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Ninsight" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/602666d8c3dbf/ninsight.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Ninty Media</em></figcaption></figure><p>Ninty Media, the team behind magazines such as The Vita Lounge, Switch Player, and Ninty Fresh, has launched a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/nintymedia/ninsight-the-new-nintendo-switch-2-magazine">Kickstarter campaign</a> for a new venture called 'Ninsight'.</p>
<p>With the first issue shipping globally in August, Ninsight aims to provide the latest Nintendo-themed news, reviews, and talking points in a premium, 80-100 page magazine with zero adverts. At the time of writing, over half of the Kickstarter's £5,000 goal has been achieved with 16 days remaining.</p>
<p>According to the overview, the move over to Ninsight was due to rising costs in maintaining production for Switch Player. Moving over to a new model which focuses on fewer releases and higher-quality content will hopefully result in a more viable business long-term.</p>

<p>You can offer up a pledge right now if you wish, with digital copies of the magazine costing £4 and physical versions costing £7. A premium edition at £20 will also include an art print of the cover art and a poster. Backers of the premium edition will also get an enamel pin badge and their names in the mag.</p>
<p>So if you miss the days of NGamer and ONM, then this might well be worth a punt. We'll certainly be keeping a close eye on it!</p>

			<p>Ahead of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/thq-nordic-digital-showcase-returns-on-august-1st/">THQ Nordic Showcase</a> that will take place at the beginning of next month, developer <a href="https://wccftech.com/gothic-remake-qa-alkimia-talks-about-expanding-the-classic-rpg/">Alkimia Interactive</a> has published its latest 'Making Of' video going behind the scenes on the development of the Gothic Remake, this time focusing on the studio's approach to the game's art style.</p>



<p>"<em>We also decided very early on, we are not making an HD version of the art style of the original, that's not our goal</em>," says the game director and studio head at Alkimia Interactive, Reinhard Pollice, at the top of the video. Pollice and the studio's art director, Daniel Candil, continue to elaborate on how they were working with opposing forces in developing this remake, as they wanted to make it look grounded and realistic, while also properly displaying the more fantastical and magical elements of Gothic.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The Gothic 1 Remake was first announced all the way back in 2019 with a surprise teaser demo being released for players to check out. It wasn't until <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-gothic-remake-is-happening-after-all-and-itll-be-grittier-than-the-demo/">2020, however,</a> that we knew for sure that the remake was in development, and it has been in the works ever since. </p>



<p>In <a href="https://wccftech.com/gothic-remake-killing-floor-3-and-titan-quest-ii-to-launch-by-march-2025-alongside-three-unannounced-games/">May 2024</a>, we learned that the remake was meant to be out by March 2025, though all we've received so far this year is a new demo that debuted during the year's first Steam Next Fest event in February 2025. Alkimia Interactive has even taken <a href="https://wccftech.com/gothic-remake-gets-demo-update-following-communitys-feedback/">feedback from players who checked out the demo</a> and committed to making several significant changes. </p>



<p>Currently, there's still no proper release date set for the Gothic Remake, though it's entirely possible that we'll finally learn of when it'll be on store shelves during the upcoming THQ Nordic Showcase in August.</p>

You don’t even have to change any of the details, like the character’s name or hometown. Just mash through that screen. Doing so will complete a challenge. </p><p>Next, hop over to the challenge menu and look for an exclamation mark indicating a completed challenge. Open up that marked challenge and claim your reward of $5,000 in-game dollars. Then just shoot over to the shop menu and visit the “Secrets” section to find <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://tonyhawkgames.fandom.com/wiki/Bam_Margera#Tony_Hawk's_Pro_Skater_3_+_4&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://tonyhawkgames.fandom.com/wiki/Bam_Margera#Tony_Hawk's_Pro_Skater_3_+_4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bam Margera</a></span>. He costs $5,000 to unlock, and if you’ve created a character—like I <em>told</em> you to—you’ll have all the money you need to buy Bam. </p><p>Now he’s a playable skater in your game and you can play all of <em>THPS 3+4</em> as West Chester’s famous jackass. </p><p>I find it very interesting that the game locks Bam behind such a relatively small amount of money and makes it so that most players will quickly stumble into $5,000 early on. Even the reward text for creating a character seems to reference the skater, telling players not to spend it all in one place, before teasing that maybe they should do that. </p><p>If I were a conspiratorial person, I’d ponder this scenario: <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tony-hawk-activision-bam-margera-added-thps-3-4-remake-1851772278&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tony-hawk-activision-bam-margera-added-thps-3-4-remake-1851772278">Tony Hawk reportedly pushed for Bam Margera</a></span> to be added to the game very late in the process. That could have meant it was tricky to add him to the full roster, so they added him as a secret character, but they really wanted people to be able to play as him. It’s been nearly two decades since Bam was in a <em>Tony Hawk </em>game! So the devs set his price to something pretty low and made it easy to unlock him within minutes of booting the game, effectively making him a playable character right from the moment you start.<br></p><p>Regardless, you’ve probably stopped reading this blog ages ago because you went to unlock him<em>.</em> So I’ll just keep thinking about this grand conspiracy alone. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/thps-3-4-bam-margera-how-to-unlock-easy-fast-tip-guide-1851785804]]></content:encoded>

That doesn’t detract from the original experience, nor does it make it any less the ‘canonical’ version of the story.” Sure, disembodied voice. Devoid of all other context surrounding this game and franchise, it just sounds like a neat way to experience a story the second time around. If it were an unlockable mode that becomes available after you finish the game for the first time, maybe I could buy into that. People have made <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9TZQ2eKkdY&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9TZQ2eKkdY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube videos</a></span> based on this very idea. However, the Chronological Experience didn’t just fall out of a coconut tree.

This is why the flashback-heavy format is so crucial to the story it tells, and is one of the many reasons HBO’s show feels like a fundamental misunderstanding of the story it’s adapting. Denying the player cathartic, easy answers is a core part of <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>, and laying out its story in the most straightforward, literal way feels like capitulating to an audience that already didn’t like the story you told in the first place, whether they knew why Abby killed Joel early on or not. There are plenty of criticisms to be thrown at <em>Part II</em>, but you can’t say it wasn’t deliberate in the experience it was trying to convey.

            <p>
Activision has pulled the PC Game Pass version of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-ww2">Call of Duty: WW2</a> offline while it investigates an unspecified "issue" some reports claim is a remote code execution exploit that's left some players grappling with app pop-ups, PC shut downs, and even screens full of pornography.
</p>
<p>
Call of Duty: WW2 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-game-pass-games-list-this-month-price-6400">made its PC Game Pass debut at the end of June</a>, but the celebrations were short-lived. The shooter has now been taken offline, affecting both the Game Pass and the PC Microsoft Store release, but not those available elsewhere, including Steam and Battle.net.
</p>
<p>
As to why this has happened, Activision's <a href="https://x.com/CODUpdates/status/1941286795565728085">official response</a> is vague, only saying the game was "brought offline while we investigate reports of an issue". However, there's evidence from the community that the newly released version of Call of Duty: WW2 may be vulnerable to remote code execution exploits, enabling an attacker to run malicious code on a player's PC.
</p>
<p>
Call of Duty streamer Wrioh, for instance, posted to social media with claims of being "hacked". An <a href="https://x.com/wrioh75753/status/1940597447467979053">accompanying video</a> showed their gaming session being interrupted by a pop-up text window proclaiming to have "just RCE'd your ass", before it's revealed Wrioh's desktop wallpaper has been changed to an image of a <a href="https://labusinessjournal.com/advertorials/most-influential-intellectual-property-attorney-mm/">beaming lawyer</a>.
</p>
<p>
In <a href="https://x.com/vxunderground/status/1940639088576811516">another post</a>, the VX-Underground malware and cybersecurity research collective (thanks <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/call-of-duty/call-of-duty-ww2-pulled-from-pc-following-reports-of-remote-code-exploit-trolling-players-with-notepad-pop-ups-pc-shutdowns-and-desktop-wallpaper-of-a-lawyer/">PC Gamer</a>) shared additional images of a purported CoD: WW2 RCE attack, including an in-game error message featuring the phrase, "Your PC is now mine". In an accompanying message, VX-Underground referenced an "unpatched RCE exploit" and claimed, "Someone is trolling gamers with Notepad pop ups, PC shutdowns, and gay pornography."
</p>
<p>
VX-Underground member Smelly then <a href="https://x.com/vxunderground/status/1940889734269501446">provided an "educated guess"</a> as to what's happening in Wrioh's video. "The concern in this particular case," they summarised, "is that this means an attacker is capable of deploying information stealer malware, a RAT (remote administration tool), or ransomware. Thankfully, it appears this attacker is primarily interested in memeing and fucking with people." There's a little more technical detail in the full post.
</p>
<p>
Call of Duty: WW2 for PC Game Pass and the Microsoft Store has now been offline since the weekend, with no sign of its imminent return and no update from Activision. While RCE vulnerabilities have been associated with numerous other games in recent years, including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-patches-a-security-vulnerability-that-could-give-hackers-full-console-takeover">Nintendo's Mario Kart 8</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-finally-fixes-cs-go-exploit-that-could-give-hackers-control-of-pcs">Valve's Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</a>, perhaps the most notable example is FromSoftware's Dark Souls series. It took over ten months for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dark-souls-remastered-finally-gets-its-online-features-back-on-pc">Dark Souls Remastered's online support to be restored</a> after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dark-souls-online-servers-are-down-following-reports-of-a-security-issue">being pulled in 2022</a>, so Call of Duty: WW2 fans will likely be hoping for a speedier resolution.

<figure><a title="Mario Kart World Rainbow Road" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/053a632e731bd/mario-kart-world-rainbow-road.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> has only been out for a month, but as you'd expect, speedrunners are already aiming to destroy race track times in the game's Time Trial mode, and a familiar face is already dominating the competition on one particular track (thanks <a href="https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/611310/mario-kart-world-rainbow-road-record-twitch">Polygon</a>!).</p>
<p>Twitch streamer and <strong>Geometry Dash</strong> expert <a href="http://twitch.tv/technicaljl">Technical</a> is the current world record holder in the new iteration of Rainbow Road after spending over a hundred hours perfecting the course and tricking his way to the best time.</p>
<p>In Time Trial mode, Rainbow Road is broken up into four sections, with each section taking over a minute on average for your garden variety Mario Kart World player. Yet Technical has managed to complete the entire course in 3:39:987, and he's currently on top.</p>
<p>The world record has been in flux ever since the game's release, with the leader changing 34 times over the course of the past month. Technical is the very first person to break the four-minute barrier, which means the game is well and truly on at this point. Have a watch below.</p>

<p>This <em>should</em><em>n't</em> be a huge surprise, however; Technical is also the world record holder for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/mario_kart_8">Mario Kart 8</a> <em>and</em> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_kart_8_deluxe">8 Deluxe</a>'s Rainbow Road (<a href="https://mkwrs.com/mk8dx/display.php?track=Rainbow+Road&amp;m=200">on 200cc</a>). So you could say he's a bit of an expert at the multicoloured course.</p>
<p>Many thought hitting the sub-four minute mark would take a lot longer than it has, but many players have been extremely close to breaking that barrier, but a combination of track length and a late-race trick have proven difficult.</p>
<p>We'll be keeping an eye on this over the coming months — and likely years. Perhaps 3:55 is the next milestone?</p>
<p><em>What do you think of the new Rainbow Road? Let us know in the comments</em>.</p>

		<p>The last things you want to hear from one of your friends and colleagues is "hey, I'm in the ER." This happened to <em>me</em> a few weeks back when my five-year-old broke her arm—which, thank <em>god</em>, we're nearly over with—and then today, as Rob informed Chia and I that he had, quoting a Discord message, "tripped on a fucking ottoman." Simultaneously, Chia said they had<em> sun sickness.</em> (It's been extremely hot in many places over the past few weeks.) So, we're a little battered and bruised at <em>Remap</em> this week. So, look: thanks for the patience.</p><p>-pk, who is trying to decide whether to take his kids to <em>Superman</em> this weekend, a movie they claim they want to see but may be too scary</p><hr><figure></figure><ul><li><strong>PODCAST: </strong><em>Remap Hotline</em> – I had to sit this one out, because a weekend family reunion in Minnesota became a friend reunion in Wisconsin, which also lead into...well, it was a lot. I had a good time, but I also really enjoy these question bucket episodes, so my thanks to Rob and Chia for holding it down.</li><li><strong>STREAM:</strong> <em>Peak</em> – This was supposed to be Chia, Janet, and I, but now it's going to be me playing <em>and</em> producing, so wish me luck. The setup looks right, but I won't know for sure until we're hitting the big red button, you know?</li><li><strong>ARTICLE:</strong> <em>Remap Recommends</em> – This will probably just be me and Rob this week, as Chia continues to recover. </li><li><strong>STREAM</strong>: <em>TBD</em> – This kinda depends on how everyone feels in the next 24 hours lol</li><li><strong>PODCAST: </strong><em>Remap Radio</em> – We missed the Xbox news. Time to dive in. I might have to track down a breakfast burrito before we record, though.</li><li><strong>ARTICLE: </strong><em>Letter Series </em>– Often, these prompts are driven by what Rob and I are talking bout privately.
