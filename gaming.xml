		<p>Capcom is reviving another of their classic franchises with Onimusha: Way of the Sword set to come out in 2026!</p>
<p><iframe title="Onimusha Way of the Sword Reveal Trailer The Game Awards 2024" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9xQa_iW958E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Onimusha series has lent on a blend of Japanese history blended with supernatural elements for its setting, built around third-person hack and slash combat for the gameplay.</p>
<p>Debuting on PS2 in 2001, the series flourished through the generation with a string of sequels, a tactics spin-off on GBA and a fighting game. The most recent main new entry was Onimusha: Dawn of Dreams in 2006, so Way of the Sword will mark two decades since that point. We did have a remaster of the original in 2018, though.</p>
<p>Games have come a long, long way since then – just see Capcom’s mastery of the remake and remaster in recent years – so it will be fascinating what parts of the original concept they retain, and what they update and overhaul.</p>

			<p>The First Berserker: Khazan, the action role-playing set in the Dungeon and Fighter universe, will launch in late March on PC and consoles.</p>
<p>The latest cinematic trailer, shown during today's The Game Awards Show 2024, confirmed that the game will be released on March 27th, 2025, on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. In addition, a playable demo will be released in a little over a month, on January 16th, to allow players to get a taste of the experience before release.</p>
<p><iframe title="The First Berserker: Khazan | Release Date Trailer | Begin Your Vengeance on March 27, 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9QGALVsiwYY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The First Berserker: Khazan will be an action role-playing game that will be worth the time of those looking for a challenging experience with some similarities with the Souls series. In the past few months, I had the opportunity to try out the game, and I was thoroughly <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-first-berserker-khazan-closed-beta-hands-on-preview-setting-up-for-greatness/">impressed</a> by it, especially by its combat mechanics, so much so that it has become one of my most anticipated games launching in 2025.</p>
<p><em>The longer playtime of The First Berserker: Khazan Technical Closed Beta Test also allowed me to appreciate combat more. While it is undeniable that the stamina-based combat system is very reminiscent of the Souls series, the Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice and Nioh series influences are more prominent. For starters, the evade maneuver doesn't have a whole lot of invincibility frames, making it a little risky to use in close-quarter. The parry, called Brink Guard, on the other hand, is a much more effective defensive technique as it is generally easy to pull off and allows Khazan to stay on the offensive since there's a small cancel window at the end of each move that allows going into the guarding stance immediately, and it restores stamina while depleting the enemy's. An instant evade technique called Brink Evade, is also in, but it seems to interrupt the flow of combat when used to avoid attacks that could be parried.</em></p>

			<p>Today, a new entry in the Onimusha series, Onimusha: Way of the Sword, was announced for PC and consoles.</p>
<p>The first new entry in the series in a very long time was revealed today with an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0auCmtj2K6g&amp;t=1s">intense trailer</a> shown during The Game Awards show which showed how the game will retain the unique atmosphere of the first few entries in the series but feature vastly different gameplay.</p>
<p><iframe title="Onimusha Way of the sword  Trailer 4K - THE GAME AWARDS 2024" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0auCmtj2K6g?start=1&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As Onimusha: Warlords, a remaster of the first entry in the series, did not exactly set the world on fire, the announcement of Onimusha: Way of the Sword comes as an almost complete surprise. In case you haven't played the remaster, you can learn more about this remaster in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/onimusha-warlords-feudal-japan-evil/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>Onimusha: Warlords is a game from another era and the remaster, despite its many enhancements, sadly highlights how the experience hasn't aged too well. This doesn't mean that the game isn't good, as many of its ideas, such as combat, leveling system and puzzles, only required a few small tweaks to be truly excellent. The fact that it's a game from 2001 is clear when playing the game, but Onimusha: Warlords can still provide a sweet, albeit short, experience.</em></p>
<p>Onimusha: Way of the Sword launches on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S sometime in 2026.</p>

            <p>Well here's one I didn't see coming: a new Onimusha game. It's called Onimusha Way Of The Sword, and is the first new game in Capcom's samurai action-horror series since... well, that upcoming VR entry doesn't count, and nor does the Warlords remaster in 2018. So, 2012? Maybe 2006, if you rule out the Unity browser game? Cor.</p><!--more-->

<p>On the off-chance that you've never played an Onimusha game, and possibly weren't alive back in 2006, it's basically <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resident-evil">Resident Evil</a> but with a samurai and set in Japan. That was true of the first one, anyway. Later instalments took... interesting liberties. Onimusha 3 had Jean Reno in it for some reason. One thing they all share is more of a combat focus than the Resis. You don't need to find ammo for a katana, after all. But they certainly aren't hack-and-slash games.</p>
<p>The Way Of The Sword trailer doesn't reveal much, but it seems to suggest a back-to-basics approach, as you might expect from a series that hasn't had a mainline instalment in almost two decades. It appears to be set in feudal times, and a bunch of demons are causing a ruckus in the woods. There are scenes of swordplay, including a few vicious finishers and some dramatic parrying. If it's cleaving close to formula, there should be RPG elements as well.</p>
<p>It's out in 2026. Any old Onimusha players in the haus? I think I fell off the series around about the time Jean Reno showed up.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/%E2%80%98it-was-always-about-her%E2%80%99-cdpr-reveals-why-ciri-is-the-lead-in-the-witcher-4.1060158/</guid>

<p>At The Game Awards in Los Angeles, CDPR revealed The Witcher 4 with a lengthy CGI trailer, rewarding the fans who have waited almost a decade to see what’s next for the monster-slaying series.</p>



<p>At the heart of the trailer sat Ciri, Geralt of Rivia’s ward and the protagonist of the upcoming title. In an interview, CD Projekt Red explained why Ciri is leading this single-player title, stressing that, ‘It was always about her.’</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-an-amazing-layered-character">‘An Amazing, Layered Character’</h2>



<p>In an interview <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-4-developer-cd-projekt-explains-why-it-went-with-ciri-over-continuing-with-geralt-as-protagonist?utm_source=threads,twitter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">with IGN</a>, The Witcher 4’s executive producer, Małgorzata Mitręga, explained why Ciri is heading up The Witcher 4, one of the most ambitious games that CDPR has ever made:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It was always about her, starting from Saga when you read it in the books. She’s an amazing, layered character. And of course, as a protagonist we said goodbye to Geralt previously. So this is a continuation. I guess for all of us it’s like she was meant to be. That was always her.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The director of The Witcher 4, Sebastian Kalemba, expanded on that:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>She’s actually about to become the Witcher. </p>



<p>She’s about to actually form her own codex, but on her own terms. The way she actually deals with the monsters, the way she deals with quests, the adventures, it’s her own unique way. And also I think that she gives more room to be able to tell different stories here and there. </p>



<p>Of course, we want to give the opportunity for the player to explore more nuance because this is what we do. But she deserves that.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It was confirmed that she was always intended to be the protagonist of The Witcher 4. In Blood and Wine, The Witcher 3’s final expansion, Geralt of Rivia effectively retired, so for the true fans of the franchise, Ciri’s arrival as the next game’s main character makes complete sense.</p>



<p>The team at CDPR revealed that Ciri’s story was settled for The Witcher 4 almost ten years ago.</p>

<p>Dying Light: The Beast received a new gameplay trailer at The Game Awards 2024. No concrete date has been announced, just a window for the summer of 2025.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The game serves as a spin-off from Techland’s popular zombie franchise. Check out the synopsis:</p>



<p>“<em>After 13 years of enduring experiments, you escape and hunt down your captors to seek retribution, only to discover there’s far more at stake. While the region is not as populated as it once was, there are still people and factions here, as well as plenty of horrors. Some will ask for your help, others will want to kill you. And that’s not to mention the mysterious creature that’s turned the woods into its personal hunting grounds.</em>“</p>



<p>The adventure stars Kyle Crane, an individual who saved several people when the virus spread across the world. However, after several years in captivity and undergoing various experiments, Kyle’s DNA has completely fused with zombie DNA, allowing him to transform into a beast. That’s where the game’s subtitle comes from.</p>



<p>The game is structured with an open world and we’ll have various types of landscapes such as forests, industrial complexes and small villages. It will be possible to play alone or in co-op for up to 4 people and, yes, the mechanics of day and night will be present.</p>

There are also a few moments of combat that appear to be in-game, showing off the third-person action against different supernatural monsters, like fungus-infected samurais and giant monsters. A few different big monsters are shown near the end of the trailer, including a large boar looking enemy walking around on two legs.</p><p>Onimusha is historically a hack-and-slash action series, using historical figures to retell parts of Japanese history, with a healthy dose of the supernatural injected, of course.

The last mainline entry in the series was Onimusha: Dawn of Dreams in 2006, with only a mobile game and a remaster released since.</p><p>Check out our list of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-game-awards-2024-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6077/" data-ref-id="2900-6077">The Game Awards announcements</a> to see everything revealed during the award show.</p>

            <p>
It's been six years since developer Ghost Town Games gave the world a sequel to its smash-hit culinary caper <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overcooked">Overcooked</a>, so you might very well be wondering what it's been up in the time since. Well, all is now revealed, with Ghost Town having unveiled its brand-new co-op adventure Stage Fright - which is being published by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/no-mans-sky">No Man's Sky</a> studio Hello Games.
</p>
<p>
Hello Games' announcement describes Stage Fright as a mix of "Overcooked style chaotic moments [and] escape room style cooperation" that's designed for two players. It's playable either as a classic couch co-op adventure or by teaming up online.
</p>
<p>
There's not much to share in the way of specific gameplay details, but we do known Stage Fright takes place in a "magical and spooky" setting - "think <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/luigis-mansion">Luigi's Mansion</a> meets Overcooked" - and that it promises a "really charming story" that's "touching, with a real heart".

<p>
"The codename of Stage Fright was Project Attic," Hello Games continues, "because [Ghost Town members] Phil, Oli, and Gemma have been in the attic at the top of their house working on this new game for the last five years, joined by a small team of talented contributors... They have so many stories of the joy Overcooked has brought to families and partners and friends (as well as near divorces). They really want to create more of those moments."
</p><p>
Hello Games says it'll be lending Ghost Town its behind the scenes experience and support as development continues. "But if we're honest," it adds, "it really appeals to us to have fun working with a bunch of creative people we just love spending time with." 
</p>

            <p>
Capcom has revealed a new Onimusha game is in development.
</p>
<p>
Shown at tonight's The Game Awards, Onimusha: Way of the Sword is set to launch in 2026 - so there's quite a wait.
</p>
<p>
A short clip of gameplay was shown, which appears to eschew the Resident Evil-esque fixed perspectives of the first game for full 3D combat.

<p>
As for the story, it's unclear who the protagonist will be, though he does bear a resemblance to the first game's Samanosuke.
</p>
<p>
Still, there's a good glimpse at some bloody slicing and dicing, as he battles samurai zombies and collects those precious golden orbs. I just hope it can stand apart from the likes of Sekiro, Phantom Blade Zero, and the Nioh games.
</p>
<p>
The first Onimusha game was released on the PS2 in 2001, which was remastered in 2018 for Switch, PS4, and Xbox One (with a PC release a year later). 
</p>
<p>
That was the last release in the series, while the last new console game was Onimusha: Dawn of Dreams in 2006. It's been a long wait for fans, then.
</p>
<p>
Still, will Capcom appease fans with a return to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dino-crisis">Dino Crisis</a> next?

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/it%E2%80%99s-finally-happening-we%E2%80%99re-getting-a-new-virtua-fighter.1060119/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/13/its-finally-happening-were-getting-a-new-virtua-fighter/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Is it me, or is The Game Awards really good this year? It’s made all the better because one of the key announcements was the upcoming arrival of a brand new entry in the Virtua Fighter series. Seriously, if you lived on the Sega side of the street, you never needed to bother with Tekken, because Virtua Fighter was – to my mind anyway – vastly superior. The fact that it’s going to go up against the fantastic Tekken 8 means that 3D-fighting fans are really eating well right now.</p>
<p><iframe title="NEW VIRTUA FIGHTER Project | World Premiere Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pmeGL2JP9N0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The teaser trailer was a particularly teasy trailer, as it only gave us a few details. First amongst them was that once again it’s the Ryu Ga Gotoku studio that’s working on this new entry in the Virtua Fighter series. You might know them as the team behind the huge Yakuza/Like A Dragon series, and given that Yakuza’s own combat was a hand-me-down from Shenmue, which in turn fed from Virtua Fighter, made them the perfect team to take the series’ reins.</p>
<p>Thus far, we’ve only seen Akira and Sarah Bryant going at it in a sandy cityscape, with Akira sporting a new undercover look – that’s a fedora and trenchcoat if you were wondering – before then shifting perspective to point us towards an upcoming VF Direct where we’ll learn (hopefully) all the most important details.</p>
<p>Fans of the series – myself included – have been waiting patiently ever since the original launch of Virtua Fighter 5. While it leapt through the past couple of generations, and is still very playable on modern consoles, there’s little to no online community right now, so I’m hoping that with the new title coming a few more people will hop in so I can practice poking them with Lion’s silly pointy fingers.</p>

<p>The VF Direct will take place on December 13th at 12am ET. Stay tuned for more as we have it</p>

		<p>The first of two big and bold game reveals, Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio has revealed Project Century, which seems to be a Like a Dragon game that takes us back to 1915 Japan.</p>
<p><iframe title="Project Century Reveal Trailer The Game Awards 2024" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JanPitSWd94?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Project Century is set in a particularly interesting point in time, both as newer technologies like record players filter into society, but also as more and more morsels of Western culture could filter through to Japan.</p>
<p>Of course, you know what was around back then? Gangs. Fisticuffs. Smoking. Looking cool.</p>

			<p>At The Game Awards 2024, Saber Interactive announced Turok: Origins, an upcoming co-op game based on the classic IP. In this title, players will become Turok warriors to face off against ferocious dinosaurs and a terrifying alien threat that seeks to destroy all humanity. However, they'll be powerful enough to take them on with devastating attacks powered by weapons and abilities. They may also harness fallen enemies' DNA to upgrade their arsenal.</p>
<p>In Turok: Origins, players will join the fight either alone or as a team against a variety of dinosaurs, creatures, and bosses that take to the ground, sky, swamps, and caves to push their skills to the limit. Engage in intense combat, where players must use everything at their disposal to ensure success, including melee attacks, special abilities, and fine-tuned weapons. Throughout the game, they'll unlock and upgrade advanced weaponry to dominate battles and neutralize foes. Plasma rifles, ray guns, snipers, bows, shotguns, and more are all at disposal.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, it will be possible to extract DNA from fallen enemies and the environment to unlock game-changing powers that evolve the Turoks' suit in real-time. Each DNA power not only enhances the character's look but also offers upgradable skills and abilities to give the players an edge in combat.</p>
<p>In the game's missions, players journey across deadly worlds on various planets. From ancient temples and wasteland canyons to dense jungles, each location is said to hold pieces of an unforgettable story packed with twists and turns.</p>

			<p>One of the biggest events in gaming is taking place tonight, where many developers, gamers, actors, and more gather to watch the nominated games win their deserved awards and see major announcements about upcoming games. One of the games that people have been eagerly awaiting and will get to see tonight is <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-and-mafia-the-old-country-to-be-shown-at-the-game-awards-2024/">Borderlands 4</a>, where people will finally get a proper glimpse into the upcoming title. Up until this point, there has been a very minimal amount of detail given to Borderlands fans, other than the initial announcement that the game is indeed happening. The game doesn't have a release date yet, and the teaser for the game was only a couple of seconds long. Tonight, those interested in the beloved franchise will get to see a trailer never-before-seen, set to preview at<a href="https://thegameawards.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> The Game Awards</a>, which you will be able to see below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Borderlands 4 - First Look Trailer | PS5 Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R8CaRnf0zO0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This trailer is precisely what the Borderlands fans needed, as it fills in a little bit more of the details, as the eagerly awaiting fans only had access to a couple of pictures of concept art of the environments, which was showcased at PAX West, where the developers set down to talk about the game in the Gearbox Main Theater. The conversation was filmed and<a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2238145538" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> uploaded on Twitch</a>, which is still available for you to watch now.</p>
<p>At the moment, the release date still isn't known, but the game is set to be released in 2025. The trailer was announced by the Founder of Gearbox Software, Randy Pitchford. The game is available to be wishlisted on Steam, the Epic Games Store, Xbox Series X|S, and PlayStation 5.</p>
<p>This game includes new Vault Hunters for you to play as, with many different weapons to choose from and utilize as you get to explore a brand-new planet that a terrifying leader is ruling. Compared to the other games in the franchise, Borderlands 4 is set to have the most expansive and diverse Vault Hunter skill tree out of all of the released games and gives players the most options for customization with their builds.</p>
<p>Borderlands 4 will include new traversal mechanics, which will allow you to get types of loot in every nook and cranny, with the option to summon a vehicle on almost any part of the terrain to be able to travel the planet named Kairos.</p>
<p>Like previous games, Borderlands 4 will allow you to fight solo or in co-op, depending on what your preference is. If you choose to go with co-op, you'll be able to play with up to three other people.</p>

<p>“Borderlands 4 is a mayhem-fueled looter shooter, jam-packed with billions of weapons, outrageous enemies, and intense co-op action,” says the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1285190/Borderlands_4/">Steam page</a>. “Break free from a dangerous hidden planet as one of four new badass Vault Hunters.” Oh! Nobody told me they were badasses. That changes everything.</p>
<p>You’ll be vault hunting solo or with up to three other players in co-op, and there'll also be skill trees and dynamic movement abilities, touts Steam. You’ll be collecting many, many guns with “death-dealing firepower”, which feels like a superfluous description. I suppose maybe you’d need to say that if there was also non-lethal firepower. There are a lot of guns. I’ll withhold judgement. There’ll also be “free-form combat and exploration, pulse-pounding boss fights, infinitely varied loot drops, and an eclectic cast of unforgettable characters new and old.”</p><p>Great. Great. It’s great. I’m sure it’s great. Steam lists the game as “coming soon”, although the trailer reckons 2025. Who to trust in these uncertain times? Ah well, a little uncertainty makes it exciting. I mean, comparatively speaking anyway.</p>

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-long-dark">The Long Dark</a> creators Hinterlands have announced The Long Dark 2, another helping of open-ended wilderness survival. Actually titled Blackfrost: The Long Dark 2 - a travestying of naming conventions that is surely more harrowing than any post-apocalyptic winter - it's out in early access in 2026, and introduces urban environments together with a "Will to Live" sanity system and co-op multiplayer. Here's the trailer.

<p>
And here's some backstory, care of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1586260/BLACKFROST_The_Long_Dark_2/">the just-launched Steam page</a>.
</p>
<blockquote><p>
Experience the Quiet Apocalypse as survivors in the northern industrial city of Harmont and its vast environs. A year has passed since the Aurora first appeared in the sky, rendering all technology inert, with survivors just starting to emerge to face their new reality in its aftermath. Surrounded by a majestic, rugged wilderness, encounter the remnants of an isolated society still coming to terms with how the world has just been forever changed. How will you choose to survive?
</p></blockquote>
<p>
In case the mention of co-op has you screaming, fashioning yourself a wolfskin pelt, and fleeing to the hillside caves, it looks like single-player is still the heart of the game. But you'll potentially have a lot more company, as players must decide whether to join communities of NPC survivors. Co-op players, meanwhile, will "lean on each other and combine your skills and efforts to eke out another day of existence in the hostile environment". I'm not sure whether this means there are unique co-op mechanics. If my co-op partner dies, can I eat them and knit their entrails into a scarf? 
</p><p>
And then there are the new urban areas. "Cities and towns offer new opportunities, and new hazards to your survival, introducing a fresh take on the established survival formula," the Steam page explains. "The wilds are dangerous, but sometimes the city is where the real threats lie." I assume they're not talking about boy racers at the traffic lights.
</p>
<p>
The new Will to Live system complicates the already-steep challenge of keeping yourself fed, watered and uninjured. It "adds elements of psychological survival to the mix, introducing Resilience and its sub-stats to the well-established mechanics," according to the Steam page. "Manage your doubts and fears, and find comfort in the small things if you want to survive."
</p>
<p>
You might be wondering what this "blackfrost" stuff is. It's one of the new hazards, a radioactive substance emitted by a distant reactor complex. It's not clear how exactly it affects you, but you'll want to avoid it. Ditto the "Aurora Storms" and "extreme weather events".
</p>
<p>
There's also a new  Permalife system which sounds like a narrativised respawn feature, in that it  "turns every death into a new adventure". The Steam page phrases it thusly: "Accumulate new risks and fears for your survivor as you move through the world and succumb to various hazards. Face your fears, overcome their downsides, and strengthen your Survivor's story in the world. Make your mark." If you don't like the sound of this, the old Permadeath mode is still an option.
</p><p>
I never played much of The Long Dark. It was for me The Short Dark, in that I struggled to make it past the first hut. Perhaps I'll fare better with the help of a friendly player in the sequel? Or perhaps, I'll just end up padding their stomach?

<p>A new game in the Onimusha franchise has been announced. The latest title in the saga, the remaster of Onimusha: Warlords, was released in October 2018. The new title is called Onimusha: Way of the Sword. The game seems to have soulslikes mechanics.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The announcement took the gaming community by surprise, after all, it was believed that the franchise would never return. However, relatively recent indications pointed to the contrary.</p>



<p>A few years ago, Capcom was the victim of a hacker attack that ended up leaking several of its projects. Among them, a new Onimusha had been mentioned. In addition, the publisher licensed the franchise for Netflix to make an anime.</p>



<p>Few details about the game have been released so far. All we know is that it is being made on the RE Engine and will be released on consoles and PC in 2026.</p>

<p>Arrowhead has announced — and released — a brand new major update for Helldivers 2 known as Omens of Tyranny.</p>



<p>“The time has come, Helldivers. The War has changed,” the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/553850/HELLDIVERS_2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">description reads</a>. “These are dark times for freedom-loving citizens everywhere. Our galaxy grows cold from the embrace of old enemies returning and darkens with the threat of new horrors emerging.”</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Helldivers 2 - Omens of Tyranny | PS5 &amp; PC Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Zk0XkX0U_m0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>In Omens of Tyranny, a new faction called The Illuminate “returns” to challenge the Helldivers.</p>



<p>“They are advanced, highly intelligent beings wielding powerful technology that appears to average citizens like a kind of dark magic,” Arrowhead said. “The Illuminate have emerged seemingly out of nowhere. Even though we don’t know the true origin of the invasion, we have no choice now but to suppress three factions in the Galactic War.”</p>



<p>In addition to the new faction, new areas to fight are being added to the game along with a new vehicle known as the Fast Recon Vehicle (FRV). The entire squad can travel in the FRV together, making sure no one is left behind as they spread democracy.</p>

<p>Ryu Ga Gotoku has published a first look at Project Century, a new and developing title. It’s an action-packed game set in Japan in 1915, and the trailer showcases intense, visceral combat and a stunning world. It’s an early introduction to what is only one of the studio’s upcoming projects.</p>



<p>Check out the trailer below.</p>

<h2 id="h-project-century-unveiled">Project Century Unveiled</h2>



<p>Not much is known about Project Century, but the first glimpse we’ve had of the developing title looks stellar:</p>

</p></figure>







<p>Most recently, Ryu Ga Gotoku was responsible for the delivery of the Like a Dragon series and standalone games like Lost Judgment. It looks like Project Century follows very much in that vein.</p>
