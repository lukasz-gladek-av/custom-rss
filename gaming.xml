The publisher and distributor announced the news on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2673080/view/491590284956666227?l=english">Steam</a> (thanks <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/wario64.bsky.social/post/3mema6bshls25">Wario64</a>) earlier today.</p>
<p>From <strong>31st March 2026</strong>, you'll no longer be able to purchase the game digitally. However, if you already own it (physically or digitally) or buy it before 31st March, you'll be able to redownload and play it at any point.</p>
<p>No reason for the delisting was given, but it's likely due to licensing rights expiring, similar to what happened with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/bill_and_teds_excellent_retro_collection">Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Retro Collection</a> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/12/bill-and-teds-excellent-retro-collection-is-about-to-be-delisted-on-the-switch-eshop">a few years back</a>.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067ijsnxw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>Here's Limited Run Games' statement in full:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We wanted to give you an early heads-up that the Jurassic Park Classic Games Collection will no longer be available for purchase on digital storefronts after March 31, 2026.</p>
<p>If you already purchased the game, don’t worry — you’ll still be able to redownload and play it anytime.</p>
<p>In the past, we learned how important it is to provide plenty of notice for changes like this, so we’re committed to being as open and transparent as possible.</p>
<p>Our goal is to give fans every opportunity to grab the game before it’s too late. Thanks for understanding!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jurassic Park: Classic Games Collection came to Switch on 22nd November 2023, so by the time it gets removed from the eShop, it'll have only been out for around two years and four months. The games included are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jurassic Park (NES)</li>
<li>Jurassic Park (Game Boy)</li>
<li>Jurassic Park (SNES)</li>
<li>Jurassic Park (Genesis / Mega Drive)</li>
<li>Jurassic Park Part 2: The Chaos Continues (SNES)</li>
<li>Jurassic Park Part 2: The Chaos Continues (Game Boy)</li>
<li>Jurassic Park: Rampage Edition (Genesis / Mega Drive)</li>
</ul>
<p>So, the Collection perhaps <em>isn't</em> the best showing for the iconic dinosaur franchise, but it's a time capsule of 8 - and 16-bit games made in the wake of the 1993 movie's huge success. We acknowledged this as much in our review, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/jurassic-park-classic-games-collection">scoring the selection a 6/10</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Ubisoft developers are striking outside the company’s Paris offices this week. Over 1,200 of them, according to union reps. They’re dancing, too, as they call on the <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> maker to reverse its controversial return-to-office policy and call for <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-earnings-layoffs-delays-canceled-ai-2000661869">accountability from its top executives</a>, including co-founder Yves Guillemot.</p> <p>“At this stage, it seems clear to us that Yves Guillemot has no knowledge or understanding of his company or its employees,” Solidaires Informatique union representative at Ubisoft Paris Marc Rutschlé <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/at-least-1200-ubisoft-workers-strike-in-response-to-recent-restructuring">told <em>Gamesindustry.biz</em></a>.&nbsp;“The company is continuing its cost reduction and layoff plan. Our teams are already working under pressure, often understaffed. After several years without pay rises (or very small increases), we understand that once again, employees will not receive a raise this year.”</p>

 <p>On February 10, the first day of the this week’s strike, speakers were blaring the 2014 Game Boy chiptune banger “<a href="https://soundcloud.com/kenobit/kenobit-disco-sanwa-2014">Disco Sanwa” by Kenobit</a>. Developers danced even in the rain while protesting the direction of the company.</p>   <p>The three-day strike this week includes developers at Ubisoft Milan as well and comes after the French publisher announced a new emergency pivot that included delaying some big games and cancelling many others. In addition to a fresh cost-cutting program that amounts to another 200 layoffs, and annual raises that have shrunk during hard times, Ubisoft is calling for employees to go back to being in the office full-time by the end of 2026.</p>

 <p>That message, delivered by CEO Yves Guillemot in an internal email and recent townhall meetings, <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-stock-restructure-layoffs-cancel-delay-2000662684">has gone over like a lead balloon</a>, not least of all because of the person who’s delivering it. Despite saying the company needs to change and evolve, Guillemot and his brothers, who founded it back in the 1980s, remain in charge thanks in part to a $1 billion bailout by Tencent.</p>

 <p>One employee in Canada <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-montreal-lead-fired-david-michaud-cromp-work-from-home-linkedin-2000665081">was fired for the way he criticized the new policies</a> in work channels, which Ubisoft said violated the company’s code of conduct. Unlike France, Ubisoft’s major Canadian studios in Montreal, Quebec, and Toronto are not unionized. Ubisoft’s smaller mobile gaming team in Canada briefly unionized earlier this year <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-halifax-shutdown-unionized-rainbow-six-mobile-2000657752">but was subsequently shut down</a>. The company said the closure had nothing to do with the labor organizing.</p> <p>Unions <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/stjv.fr/post/3mejkg2umyl2q">blamed this week’s walkout</a> on the “arbitrary decision of the CEO who doesn’t even dare talking to employees anymore.”</p>

The game, which puts players in control of a god-like hand to master real-time strategy, town management, and simulation, also lets players become one of their villages' many NPCs to explore, fight, explore dungeons, and more.&nbsp;</p><p>There's a taste of all that and more in the new trailer, and you can check it out below:&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y_Jph0SH_l4"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y_Jph0SH_l4" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>"Masters of Albion is a bold reimagining of the God Game genre, from the creator who defined it," the trailer's description reads. "Revel in the freedom of true Godhood. In Masters of Albion, there is no single solution. Build whatever, wherever. Hire whoever, wherever. Kill or carry, crush or coax. You are the ultimate power."&nbsp;</p><p>Notably, Masters of Albion will be Molyneux's final game, as he and 22 Cans said <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?si=wgxWrMJrTAOFcIlB&amp;v=CSLGKKAuZwo&amp;feature=youtu.be">when the team announced it during Gamescom 2024</a>. Molyneux, who is the mind behind Populous and Black and White, as well as Fable (the original), said Masters of Albion is "the culmination of my life's work" back when the game was first announced.&nbsp;</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/bolder-braver-bloodier-ci-games-digs-into-lords-of-the-fallen-2-combat-in-new-developer-deep-dive/</link>
            <guid>1432870</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>CI Games</strong> is getting ready to release its third <strong>Lords of the Fallen</strong> game with <strong>Lords of the Fallen 2</strong>, sometime later this year, which we last got a look at during <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/lords-of-the-fallen-ii-gets-first-look-at-gameplay-in-new-trailer/">The Game Awards 2025</a></strong> with a new gameplay trailer. Outside of CI Games' chief executive officer, <strong>Marek Tyminski</strong>, promising that this <a href="https://wccftech.com/lords-of-the-fallen-ii-wont-be-politically-correct-will-feature-attractive-females-skimpy-armors/">fantasy action game won't be "<em>politically correct</em>"</a> and that it will feature female characters in revealing armour, in a new developer deep-dive, game director <strong>James Lowe</strong> promises that the combat will be <strong><em>"bolder, braver, bloodier</em>."</strong></p>



<p>A quick rundown on the series, if you're confused as to why the game with the '2' at the end of it is actually the third in the franchise. In 2014, CI Games released <strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/265300/Lords_Of_The_Fallen_2014/">Lords of the Fallen</a>,</strong> an action RPG that failed to really make a big splash. Almost a decade later, the studio decided to reboot the series and released <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/lords-of-the-fallen-frustration-your-side/"><strong>Lords of the Fallen (2023)</strong></a>, which, despite its myriad of issues at launch, fared far better. The game's commercial success was enough to drive CI Games to make a sequel, which brings us to Lords of the Fallen 2, due out sometime in 2026, not to be confused with <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-lords-of-the-fallen-2-0-is-a-massive-improvement-over-the-launch-version/"><strong>Lords of the Fallen 2.0</strong></a>, which refers to the massive overhaul update CI Games put out almost two years after the 2023 reboot to fix it.</p>



<p>Getting back to today's combat deep-dive, as part of the studio's Lifting the Veil series on its official YouTube channel, CI Games put out a nearly 42-minute video discussing and showcasing how it is improving and updating combat in Lords of the Fallen 2, trying to address players' concerns from its predecessor while also introducing new elements for the sequel.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Lords of the Fallen II: ‘Lifting the Veil’ Ep. 8 Dev Update | All-New Combat Gameplay" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nlPH5v0vT6A?start=134&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Some of the highlights about combat that Lowe discusses alongside lead systems designer <strong>Daniel Regan</strong>, producer <strong>Alex Harkin</strong>, and creative strategist <strong>Ryan Hill</strong> include how the team is doubling down on things players loved from the 2023 reboot, like dual-wielding, a great emphasis on players' speed and maneuverability, and a slew of new animations to make combat feel more varied than it did in 2023.</p>



<p>It's not just a greater variety in animations, but in weapon choices, as CI Games is focusing on letting players swap seamlessly between melee attacks to spell casting and back, while also trying out the barrage of new weapons.</p>



<p>The panel discussion is altogether an honest conversation about how the studio is trying to improve and fix the mistakes it made in previous entries. It's clear that CI Games wants to make this game hit in a way that its previous games never did, which is ultimately an exciting proposition for anyone looking forward to checking out this upcoming action RPG.</p>



<p>Another point that Lowe references in the panel is wanting to "<em>respect the player's time</em>," which was something that he told Wccftech that he and the team wanted to focus on back in December 2025, when we got to <a href="https://wccftech.com/respect-the-players-time-lords-of-the-fallen-ii-game-director-james-lowe-discusses-key-principles-defining-the-game-interview/">sit down with him for an interview</a> following its gameplay showcase at The Game Awards. </p>

And, according to Takuto Edagawa, the game's director, it sounds like we'll be spending a <em>lot</em> of time rebuilding this abandoned island with our Pokémon.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-pokopia-will-take-20-40-hours-to-beat-on-average-and-theres-more-after-the-credits-says-director">IGN</a>, Edagawa — who works at Koei Tecmo and previously worked on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dragon_quest_builders_2">Dragon Quest Builders 2</a> and directed the <strong>Monster Hunter</strong>-like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/wild-hearts-s">Wild Hearts</a> — said that the main aim of the game "is typically not to go to the end roll", meaning the credits.</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytRLc1VHm8D80" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fkorlgq&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>"The whole concept is to create the world with Pokémon and live with the Pokémon. However, as an average, it'll be about <strong>20 to 40 hours</strong>, but it would really depend on how the players play the game", he told the outlet.</p>
<p>That makes it sound like a pretty chunky game, even if you just focus on the main stuff. And for reference, the Dragon Quest Builders games, which Pokopia seems to be closely-aligned with, are a little longer at 40-50+ hours.</p>
<p>And, as you probably expect from a game like Pokopia, there's a <em>lot</em> more to do than just "roll credits", which Edagawa confirms: "There's more things to experience after the end roll... I believe that players are encouraged to and will be motivated to continue to play the game."</p>

<p>Unsurprising stuff, but that confirms we'll be booking out our March to sit down and thoroughly dedicate ourselves to island rebuilding and repopulating.</p>
<p>When our very own Ollie Reynolds got to play Pokopia, he came away extremely surprised and impressed, and for cosy gamers, he had this to say: "I get the feeling that it's going to scratch an itch for anyone disappointed that we probably won't be getting a brand new Animal Crossing anytime soon."</p>

<p>No one saw the huge rebranding of Overwatch coming in 2026, and the revised identity comes with plenty of actual new identities. We’re taking a look at every new character, the voice actors behind the fresh-faced heroes, and more.</p>



<p>Aside from the rather unfortunate business surrounding <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/overwatchs-anran-set-for-redesign-after-community-backlash/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Overwatch’s Anran undergoing a redesign after community backlash</a>, the new cast of characters has been well-received, particularly a certain flying feline.</p>



<p>Props to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/blizzard/" id="1092" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Blizzard</a>.</p>







<h2 id="h-all-overwatch-heroes-added-in-2026">All Overwatch Heroes Added In 2026</h2>



<p><strong>Blizzard has added five new Heroes to the rebranded Overwatch in 2026: Anran, Domina, Emre, Jetpack Cat, and Mizuki.</strong></p>



<p>There were the first new faces of 2026, with a few more to be added throughout the year. They range from expert warriors to…a cat…with a jetpack. More cats, please.</p>

<h2 id="h-who-voices-anran-in-overwatch">Who Voices Anran In Overwatch?</h2>



<p><strong>Farheea Andersen is the voice actor for Anran in Overwatch.</strong></p>



<ul>

</ul>



<p>The Twitch streamer and content creator was given the honour of playing Anran for Overwatch, and to be fair to her, she didn’t hold back in her assessment of Anran’s original design, citing the character as an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/overwatch-anran-actor-bags-on-ozempic-chic-design/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">‘Ozempic Chic Character Design.’</a></p>



<p>This is believed to be Andersen’s debut role in gaming, movies, and TV.</p>



<h2 id="h-who-voices-domina-in-overwatch">Who Voices Domina In Overwatch?</h2>



<p><strong>Overwatch’s Domina is voiced by Taj Atwal.</strong></p>



<p>Atwal is a British actress who has racked up acting credits across a multitude of TV shows, from Line of Duty to Hullraisers. It’s not her first foray into voice-over work, though, as she played Dr. Neema Chandra in Surgeon Simulator 2!</p>



<h2 id="h-who-voices-emre-in-overwatch">Who Voices Emre In Overwatch?</h2>



<p><strong>Actor Kerem Erdinc has confirmed on social media that he is the voice of Emre.</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming: </strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/overwatch-2026-roadmap-all-overwatch-2026-content-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Overwatch 2026 Roadmap—All Overwatch 2026 Content, Explained</a></li>
</ul>



<p>In an <a href="https://x.com/KeremIsWhelmed/status/2021461358743855562?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X post</a>, he said: “The best thing about being the voice actor for Emre is people just let me pick him in the lobby. Gotta show up for the squad if I’m the one taking Emre for a spin. First match of the night, play of the game? Oh yeah, me and Emre were made for each other.”</p>



<p>Erdinc has plenty of other video game work under his belt, including <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/delta-force/" id="878" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Delta Force</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/ready-or-not/" id="1170" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ready or Not</a>, Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty, and much more.</p>



<h2 id="h-who-voices-mizuki-in-overwatch">Who Voices Mizuki In Overwatch?</h2>



<p><strong>The masked Mizuki is represented by Julian&nbsp;Cihi.</strong></p>



<p>Unless the facts are wrong, that seems to be Cihi’s debut into the world of video gaming voice-over work, too! Before grabbing the role of Mizuki with both horns, Cihi has appeared in several shows, such as Only Murders in the Building.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[No Man’s Sky Remnant Update Adds Gravity Manipulation and Hauling to the Game]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/no-mans-sky-remnant-update-adds-gravity-manipulation/</link>
            <guid>1432780</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Hello Games</strong> has just released <strong>Remnant</strong>, another free update for <strong>No Man's Sky</strong>. The patch (6.2) introduces gravity manipulation mechanics, extensive vehicle customization, and industrial waste processing facilities.</p>



<p>The headline feature of Remnant is arguably the <strong>Gravitino Coi</strong>l, a new Multi-Tool upgrade <strong>that fundamentally changes how players interact with the game world</strong>. This device allows travelers to magnetize, carry, and launch objects, creating entirely new gameplay possibilities through physics manipulation.</p>



<p><strong>No Man's Sky players are now able to grab and fling various items scattered across planets</strong>, including golden artifacts discovered in planetary ruins. However, the developers believe the tool's most creative application is actually in combat, where <strong>it enables players to capture and throw Sentinel Drones</strong>, effectively turning enemies into projectile weapons against each other, which sounds very fun indeed. Additionally, combat supplies dropped by defeated enemies can now be consumed directly, and the Gravitino Coil interacts with Sphere Creator objects that players have placed in their bases.</p>



<p>The patch introduces <strong>extensive customization options to the off-road Colossus vehicle</strong>. Players can now equip custom modules and technologies, including superelastic wheels, tracked treads, and specialized off-road gear designed to handle any terrain type. Visual customization has also expanded with new paint finishes that can be layered alongside traditional color choices. However, <strong>the most striking addition is the Mechanical Legs upgrade: arachnid-like spider legs that provide hydraulic crawling</strong>. No Man's Sky players can earn the Mechanical Legs by completing the new Remnant expedition, which <strong>features a cross-country hauling experience</strong> where players register for waste transportation missions. </p>



<p><strong>New industrial facilities have appeared in scrap worlds</strong>, offering players the opportunity to extract materials and earn rewards by collecting waste. The system revolves around gathering radioactive crates, explosive canisters, and toxic barrels, though all of them require careful handling due to their hazardous nature. Specialized processing units enable the safe containment and disposal of these dangerous materials, turning environmental cleanup into a potentially profitable venture. </p>



<p>Beyond gameplay additions, cloud rendering has seen significant technical improvements, including enhanced lighting, improved edge stability, and performance optimizations. These changes are particularly noticeable during dawn and dusk sequences.</p>

<p>Hello Games is very excited about what's coming this year, especially since <strong>it marks the tenth anniversary of No Man's Sky's original launch</strong>. The game stumbled at first, as we all know, but recovered miraculously well. At this point, every update (<a href="https://wccftech.com/no-mans-sky-breach-update-adds-expedition-encourages-players-spacewalk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">they come in every two to three months</a>) is just gravy.</p>

			<p>For the second year in a row, <strong>Xbox</strong> has revealed the games awarded with its signature stamp of excellence in the <strong>Xbox Excellence Awards</strong>. The awards list 20 titles in four categories, though several of them are repeats, which means only <strong>55</strong> individual titles have made the cut this year. Of those 55, included are titles like <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/arc-raiders-everything-we-know-about-the-latest-hot-extraction-shooter/">ARC Raiders</a>, Battlefield 6, Helldivers 2, </strong>and <strong>Hollow Knight Silksong,</strong> all of which made the cut as some of the best-selling games on the Xbox platform in 2025.</p>



<p>The games are listed alphabetically in the <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2026/02/11/xbox-excellence-awards-2025/">Xbox Wire post</a> announcing the winners, so we don't know which title actually ranked first in any of the categories, which are: Store Rating, Player Engagement, Daily Active Users, and Units Sold.</p>



<p>Interestingly, no individual title made it in all four categories. <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-team-vows-no-more-back-to-back-releases-after-black-ops-7-flop/">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a></strong> and <strong>Borderlands 4</strong> were the only titles to make three out of four lists, with any other repeats only making it on two out of four lists. While Borderlands 4 missed out on the Store Rating list, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 missed out on the Player Engagement list.</p>



<p>On the Units Sold list, other notable inclusions besides the aforementioned titles are Borderlands 4, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-celebrates-10-million-shadow-of-the-erdtree-5-million-nightreign/">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>,</strong> <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-large-scale-iceborne-sunbreak-sized-expansion-summer-2026-capcom/">Monster Hunter Wilds</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-dominates-us-game-sales-in-april-2025-with-oblivion-remastered-and-active-player-numbers-with-call-of-duty/">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a>.</strong> You can check out the full chart below.</p>

  </picture><p>The report also confirmed a change in work environment by CEO Chris Cocks regarding AI integration. Cocks has been <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/hasbro-ceo-chris-cocks-expresses-support-of-ai-in-dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow">very vocal </a>about the use of AI in various Hasbro products. While he doesn't explicitly name any specific company or brand, he does confirm integrating AI at Hasbro has been a "clear success."</p><p>The report explains the current application of this highly controversial and ethically fraught technology has been in non-creative contexts. AI tools are being used in areas like finances, supply chains, and in general productivity. Cocks also specifies the choice lies with specific teams whether or not to use these tools, emphasizing, "people make the decisions and people own the creative outcomes."</p><p>This appears to be in line with Wizards of the Coast's stance against the use of generative AI in Dungeons &amp; Dragons' products. Ever since the discovery of Gen AI artwork in the <em>Bigby Presents: Glory of the Giants</em> supplement, they have explicitly <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/wizards-of-coast-clarifies-stance-on-ai-artwork-in-their-books" rel="nofollow">banned Gen AI</a> use in all their books. Although, reports on AI's use of productivity enhancement is being <a href="https://hbr.org/2026/02/ai-doesnt-reduce-work-it-intensifies-it" rel="nofollow">seriously contested</a>.</p><p>A second area of note in the Hasbro earnings report is a shift from <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> to a digital-first brand. The report states that 60% of D&amp;D revenue has been from digital sales, bolstered by the ongoing use of the digital platform, <em>D&amp;D Beyond.</em> This aligns with recent decisions regarding digital exclusive content for the game.</p><p>Recently, D&amp;D Beyond has hosted more partnered content, official support for third-party books. These include <em>Crooked Moon</em> and <em>Dungeons of Drakkenheim</em> as well as more bespoke supplements for various settings like Critical Role's Exandria and <a href="https://marketplace.dndbeyond.com/category/DB8XTUXUM?pid=DB8XTUXUM" rel="nofollow">Keith Baker's Eberron</a>. There has also been a push of digital exclusive content like <em>Astarion's Book of Hungers</em> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dd-beyond-digital-supplement-lorwyn-first-light-brings-fey-mischief" rel="nofollow"><em>Lorwyn: First Light</em></a>.</p><p>While the Hasbro earnings report doesn't say anything about phasing out physical book releases, it is clear the company's focus will remain on these digital offerings going forward.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
