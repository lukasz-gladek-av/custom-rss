</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Much in the same way that I started this year by telling my loved ones I would cut down my portion sizes in 2026 to attend to my ageing body, Zenimax Online Studios began the year by saying <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-elder-scrolls-online-is-ditching-yearly-expansions-and-folding-its-premium-content-into-the-base-game-but-its-also-gaining-a-battle-pass">they would be releasing smaller updates for Elder Scrolls Online</a> to refresh the MMO's creakier content.</p>
<p>Both Edler Scrolls Online and I shall end 2026 leaner and able to climb stairs without our knees popping.</p>
<p>But, in announcing its move from Expansion-sized chapters released every 12 - 18 months to smaller Season updates released every three months, it wasn't clear what this meant for new zones. Would the world of Tamriel stay locked at its current size, with additional areas being too large a thing to add in a Season update?</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Many players have expressed concern that we're not doing zones anymore," game director Nick Giacomini tells me in a follow-up interview, "That's not true. We are. We are doing zones, and we're going to talk more about that very soon."</p>
<p>While Giacomini won't be drawn on exactly where may be added to Tamriel next, he said "I think players will be happy when they see what's coming in the next twelveish months."</p>
<p>Though, he does say players should expect changes on what to expect from a new zone. "With [zones], like everything, we're asking ourselves instead of just 'Here's a zone, exactly the way that you've experienced zones [before],' we're taking a look at it at a fundamental level. What can we change here to make this more interesting, exciting and in line with what players want, so it'll be a different flavour."</p><p>Explaining the miscommunication, executive producer Susan Kath says "We had 45 minutes to deliver a huge amount of information, much of which is difficult to convey when we can't actually show it yet." One area players are wanting more information is around Tamriel Tomes, the MMOs new battle pass system. "It would be a heck of a lot easier if I could just be like, 'Here, I'm in the game. Let me show you exactly what I mean by this'," continues Kath. They will be adding clarifying details in live streams, AMAs, and explanatory posts in the coming months.</p>

</figure>
<p>While Giacomini won't talk about what or how new zones will be added to Elder Scrolls Online, he will say how the team plan to enrich the world of Tamriel. In the same stream when they announced the move to Seasons, Giacomini and Kath explained that Orsinium, Thieves Guild, Dark Brotherhood, and the Imperial City will be folded into the base game. Previously these locations and their associated quests were all held back as premium content.</p>
<p>This broadening of the base game, Giacomini argues, will lead to more opportunities for all players. "It gives us more flexibility. When we wanted to make something available for all players in the past that meant, we had to design within these base game zones. And while those zones are big, you're doing yet another series of quests in Auridon, or what have you. This enables the design team to explore more."</p><p>Now a quest can be made available to all players that takes them from Auridon to the Imperial City with a stop off in Orsinium without the designers needing to worry about what expansions a player has bought. Giacomini says before the team would ask themselves, "If we do, that means only X percent of players are going to be able to participate."</p>
<p>Again, Giacomini falls short of saying what these news quests will be, but he points to what was said in the announcement stream. "We talked about Western <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a> being folded in as well. Chronologically, that's much later than Somerset. But it makes sense, because we're going to be releasing something within the Skyrim areas, and we want to allow as many players as possible to participate."</p>
<p>This broader canvas upon which to draw new questlines sounds promising, bringing new life to old areas. We still have to wait and see how well Zenimax Online Studios delivers on its promises for these smaller updates. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-elder-scrolls-online-smaller-expansions-are-not-in-any-way-a-result-of-last-years-layoffs">Giacomini and Kath say that the team's capacity to deliver wasn't impacted by last year's layoffs</a>. The truth of that will be proved in March with the launch of Season Zero.</p>

            <guid>1409992</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The multi-functional, portable Anker MagSafe Charger Stand powers your iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods simultaneously in one location. This compact cube connects to an outlet via a single USB-C AC adapter connection and can be easily placed on any available desktop or nightstand. On top of the stand is a fold-down charger for an Apple Watch, and on the bottom of the unit is a designated area for wireless charging cases for AirPods. Plus, you can fold up the entire unit and take it with you if needed.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6773/">Go to Amazon to purchase the Anker 3-in-1 Multi-Device Wireless Charging Stand for just $97, saving $53 and reducing the price by approximately 35% from the original $150.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6773/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2><span>Set it on your desktop, charge everything, and forget about it </span></h2>
<p><span>The design of Anker’s 3-in-1 multi-device wireless charging stand allows you to place your iPhone in a horizontal position to view your screen, and place your Apple Watch on top of the unit and your wireless charging case for AirPods at the bottom, all in a relatively uncluttered manner. In addition, the iPhone portion of the unit is adjustable, allowing you to view your screen in both portrait and landscape orientations. Also, the stand is collapsible and can fit in a small drawer or travel pouch when collapsed.</span></p>
<p>As part of the Anker MagSafe wireless charging system, the unit supports MagSafe-compatible iPhone models with up to 15 watts of fast wireless charging. The internal magnets ensure the iPhone lines up correctly and that you don’t have to slide it around to find the optimal charging spot every time. The charging dock for your iPhone holds it steady in either portrait or landscape orientation, allowing you to view your screen while it charges.</p>



<p>Support for Apple Watches is extensive, covering most models. The raised platform for the watch allows the bands to hang naturally, and the back of the watch rests on the charging surface, eliminating the need to bend your watch straps into awkward positions. The base of the unit includes a pad specifically designed for wireless charging cases for AirPods, providing a specific charging location for your earbuds rather than forcing you to share the space with your iPhone.</p>
<p>A major advantage of this wireless charging stand’s travel-friendly design is that it can be used even when you don’t have access to multiple outlets. Closed, the unit appears to be a standard small black plastic box with a single USB-C port on the side so that it won’t snag on anything else in your backpack or carry-on. When opened next to a bed or on a small table, it eliminates the need for three separate charging stations while requiring only a single outlet.</p>
<p>Ready-to-go out-of-the-box accessories make using the Anker 3-in-1 MagSafe Wireless Charging Stand a breeze. Included with the unit are the 3-in-1 charging dock, a 30-watt USB-C wall adapter, and a five-foot-long USB-C to USB-C cable. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6773/">For the low price of $97, reduced from the original $150, you’re receiving a compact charging dock that wirelessly charges your iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods with a single cable.</a></p>

            <p>The release date for Bungie's upcoming extraction shooter Marathon has seemingly leaked via an Xbox Store pre-order trailer.</p>
<p>According to this trailer, Marathon will be released on 5th March. There was also mention of a Deluxe Edition.</p>

<p>"Scavenge, buildcraft, and take on greater PvPvE challenges - culminating with the derelict Marathon ship hanging above."</p>

<p>Back in December, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/six-months-after-being-delayed-indefinitely-bungies-troubled-marathon-finally-gets-release-window-and-price">Bungie confirmed Marathon would be released sometime in March</a>, though at this time it didn't give a specific day.</p>
<p>After announcing its March release window, Marathon's art director and veteran Bungie developer Joseph Cross announced his departure from the company. "I'm incredibly proud of the visual world we built for Marathon. Getting support at this scale for something a bit different is rare, and the art team at Bungie is the best in the biz. I'll be enjoying playing the game as a fan with all of you," Cross said last month.</p>
<p>"Massive thank you to everyone who has supported through all of it."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marathon-art-lead-departs-bungie-of-his-own-volition-ahead-of-games-new-release-date">Cross confirmed his departure from the studio was his own decision</a>, after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-admits-marathon-includes-artwork-used-without-permission">it was discovered the extraction shooter used artist Antireal's work without permission</a>.</p>

            <p>It's safe to say <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hytale">Hytale</a> is 2026's biggest indie hit so far, with the game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/long-awaited-minecraft-a-like-hytale-has-already-sold-enough-to-fund-the-next-two-years-of-development-and-its-not-even-out-yet">securely funding the next two years of development</a> before it was even out into early access last week. It seems the idea of a proper competitor to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/minecraft">Minecraft</a> was a golden one, but that isn't stopping modders and passionate tinkerers from putting Minecraft <em>inside</em> Hytale.</p>
<p>On 17th January, X/Twitter user <a href="https://x.com/iamcxv711">iamcxv7</a> (Sadat Sahib/ssquadteam <a href="https://github.com/ssquadteam">on GitHub</a>) posted he'd gotten Minecraft running in Hytale's world map through "pure pixel data manipulation," which sounds pretty bonkers and signals the new blocky sensation may have a bright future ahead when it comes to modding and all sorts of experiments.</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

<p>The achievement was also shared <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hytale/comments/1qflbs7/got_minecraft_030_running_in_hytale_map/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">on Reddit</a>, where the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hytale/comments/1qflbs7/comment/o05iv7j/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">full explanation of the process</a> was explained: "No GPU, no OpenGL calls - just pure CPU-based 3D rendering". In short, no one who's really into software and creative problem-solving knows what he's saying, but it's all impressive if you're aware of the basics. At the time of writing, the game "runs entirely server-side at 35 FPS with a resolution of 320x240," so this isn't a trick of playing a short gameplay video via Hytale and calling it a day. It is an old version of Minecraft (0.30) though. That doesn't exactly make it any less impressive, however.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Edinburgh fire crews rushed to the <strong>Rockstar North</strong> offices on Monday at 5 am BT after a reported "<em>explosion in a boiler room</em>," according to <a href="https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/25776012.gta6-dev-rockstar-north-building-taped-off-boiler-explosion/">The Herald</a> and <a href="https://www.edinburghlive.co.uk/news/edinburgh-news/edinburgh-fire-crews-rush-ongoing-33257244.amp">Edinburgh Live</a>. Fire crews stayed on the scene at the <strong>Grand Theft Auto VI</strong> developer's office for three hours, working to secure "<em>structural damage</em>" to the building. No casualties have been reported as a result of the incident.</p>



<p>A spokesperson for the <strong>Scottish Fire and Rescue Service</strong> <strong>(SFRS)</strong> said, "<em>We were alerted at 5.02 am on Monday, 19 January to attend an incident on Holyrood Road, Edinburgh</em>," in a statement to The Herald. "<em>Operations Control mobilised three fire appliances and specialist resources to the scene, where firefighters worked to secure structural damage at a commercial building</em>. <em>There were no reported casualties and crews left the scene at 9.21 am</em>."</p>



<p>It's unclear what caused the reported explosion at the Rockstar North offices, as the situation continues to be investigated by Police Scotland, and the area reportedly remains cordoned off. Beyond the lack of reported casualties, no injuries have been reported either, a thankful result likely due to the fact that the incident happened so early in the morning.</p>



<p>While thankfully, no one was hurt from the incident, it's unclear how far the reported "<em>structural damage</em>" goes, and what other damage the fire caused to the building and the interior offices. Neither Rockstar or Take-Two Interactive have published a statement regarding the incident, though with Rockstar North being the lead studio for Grand Theft Auto VI, it's likely we'll hear something from Rockstar or Take-Two soon, even if it is just a statement directed towards the company's shareholders and not players, <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delayed-to-november-2026/">to say whether or not the incident will result in yet another delay fro GTA VI.</a></p>



<p>It's also perhaps the most unlikely way anyone thought we'd see the Rockstar North offices back in the news, as the Edinburgh office has been the center of a different story for the last few months. Back at the end of October 2025, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-developer-accused-union-busting-after-firing-dozens-of-employees/">Rockstar fired 34 workers</a></strong>, several from the Rockstar North offices, with others scattered across the UK and an additional three in Toronto, <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-rockstar-reaffirms-claims-fired-employees-dismissed-for-distributing-confidential-information/">alleging the workers had been leaking confidential information</a>. </p>



<p>The workers and their union, the Independent Workers of Great Britain (IWGB), deny the allegations and instead accuse Rockstar of union-busting. The <a href="https://wccftech.com/rockstar-hit-by-legal-claim-issued-by-iwgb-refusing-to-meet-fired-workers/">IWGB has filed legal claims against Rockstar</a>, and most recently had <a href="https://wccftech.com/uk-judge-denies-fired-rockstar-employees-interim-pay-iwgb/">its bid for interim relief for the fired workers <strong>denied</strong> by a UK judge</a>. </p>



<p>The firings have led to several protests outside of the Rockstar North offices, and Rockstar and Take-Two offices across the globe, including in Paris, New York, and at the Rockstar Toronto offices in Canada, where <a href="https://wccftech.com/cwa-canada-toronto-game-developers-protest-at-rockstar-toronto-in-solidarity-with-fired-workers/">Wccftech spoke with one of the workers fired from Rockstar Toronto and the CWA Canada media union that organized the demonstration</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Scottish police and fire crews have been called to Rockstar North's Edinburgh HQ to respond to reports of an explosion, an incident that police describe as "ongoing".</p><p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gta/explosion-reported-at-rockstar-north-studio-as-police-cordon-off-gta-development-building-3306152/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dexerto</a>, the explosion was reported at around 5am local time today, with a spokesperson confirming that the call resulted in the mobilization of "three pumps and four of our specialist appliances".</p><p>At time of writing, the incident hasn't been closed yet; Edinburgh fire and police services are still on the scene "with other agencies", although specialist fire crews departed around four hours after the fire began. Additionally, there have been "no reported casualties", so thankfully, it sounds like nobody's been hurt.</p><figure role="group">

<p>At present, it's thought that the explosion was caused by some kind of boiler issue; Dexerto says that "reports from the area" point to a boiler room as the source of the blast, so it sounds as though the damage was accidental, although it's hard to say this early on.</p><p>Just in case you need a reminder, Rockstar North is the studio responsible for <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em>, which is currently scheduled to be released <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/grand-theft-auto-6-delayed-november-2026" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e57d7053-b3ca-42ed-afdb-4ef5c5958b99" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">in November this year</a> after two <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/grand-theft-auto-vi-release-date-delay" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="fbc88268-1772-45bc-9881-7e2e1cd1ca6d" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">delays</a> pushed it back from its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/grand-theft-auto-6-trailer-released-early-following-leak-coming-in-2025" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="6fad3f9b-bebd-4488-8603-3fe30fd9ffe3" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">original 2025 release window</a>.</p><p>The game is one of the most hotly-anticipated releases on the calendar this year. It'll follow two protagonists, Jason and Lucia, and it'll be set in the fictional state of Leonida, which is based on Florida (which means you'll be able to visit Vice City once again).</p><p>It's unclear whether the explosion will hamper <em>GTA 6</em>'s development any further. Let's hope that operations resume as normal and that employees are able to return to work safely.</p>
<p>This explosion also comes just a couple of months after Rockstar <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rockstar-union-busting-accusation-gta-6" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="2fb963bf-6dd1-47b3-bfbd-3f16511b3076" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">fired a number of employees</a> who were involved in union activity, a move that parent company Take-Two insists wasn't motivated by union-busting.</p><p>Following that decision, hundreds of Rockstar employees <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rockstar-employees-letter" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="419ae453-4f41-4d14-ac9c-25d978963601" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">banded together to write an open letter</a> demanding the terminated employees' reinstatement, although it doesn't sound as though Take-Two acceded to that demand.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <title><![CDATA[Animal Crossing: New Horizons added just enough to suck me back in]]></title>
            <link>https://www.theverge.com/games/863747/animal-crossing-new-horizons-update-3-0-switch-2-quality-of-life</link>
            <guid>1409965</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Animal Crossing</em> has always been anti-instant gratification. By design, you have to take your time, wait for days to pass in real time, and complete a seemingly endless list of chores to build a meaningful life with your animal friends. The slowness is part of its appeal. But with <em>New Horizons</em>, some of that slowness became tedious: crafting its many items one at a time, painstakingly building cliffs and rivers by hand, picking up and placing objects one by one.</p><p>As I gathered when I <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/845242/animal-crossing-new-horizons-3-0-update-switch-2-edition-features">previewed</a> it last month, the newly released, free 3.0 update for <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em> addresses those issues with quality-of-life fixes that still fit the spirit of <em>Animal Crossing</em>. It’s a small update in terms of content — there’s just enough here to give you a reason to revisit the game if you’ve been looking for one, and not much more than that — but major in reducing friction where there wasn’t meant to be any.</p><p>Separately, there’s also the new Switch 2 Edition, which noticeably improves <em>New Horizons</em>’ performance and ups its resolution. Otherwise, it doesn’t add anything that important — but for $4.99, it doesn’t really have to.</p><div><p id="nintendo-switch-2-edition"><h2>Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</h2></p></div><p>The main appeal of the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition is the performance upgrade. On the original Switch, <em>New Horizons</em> would start to struggle as you placed more and more decorations around your island, sometimes to the point of severe frame rate drops. It meant that building out your island could also make it progressively less playable. My island is a pretty bare construction zone, so when I downloaded the Switch 2 upgrade, I visited several highly decorated Dream Addresses to test it out.</p><p>Anecdotally, I can say that there’s a significant improvement in how <em>New Horizons</em> runs, at least to my eye. All the Dream Addresses I visited were so busy with decor, from thickets of trees to loads of furniture covered in custom designs, that there were completely inaccessible areas — and I didn’t see any significant lag or choppiness like I’d expect on the original Switch version. It’s a boon for maximalist decorators, especially those of us who still want our islands to be functional amid chaotic and cluttered builds.</p><p>For me, that alone is worth the $5 upgrade. (If you don’t own the game already, the Switch 2 version is $65 to the original Switch’s $60.) Otherwise, the Switch 2 Edition doesn’t add anything you <em>need</em> to have. Nintendo did show a side-by-side comparison of the game’s improved resolution in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nODHyw3lgs&amp;t=1s">trailer for the upgrade</a>, but I didn’t really notice the difference (with the caveat that simple visual fidelity is not particularly important to me in most games). The new megaphone, which lets you use the Switch 2’s microphone to call the names of villagers and locate them, didn’t work well for me; I saw Fuchsia, walked a short distance away so she was out of frame, and called her name, but got no reply.</p><p>And then there are the Joy-Con mouse controls, which are available when decorating interiors, creating custom designs, and writing messages on the bulletin board. I’m sure there’s someone out there who will find the mouse controls useful or intuitive, but I am not that person. First of all, I originally played this game on a tiny Switch Lite screen and I’m really enjoying this new world of playing it on a TV, so forgoing my Pro Controller to slide the right Joy-Con around on my couch cushions is not a compelling proposition. But I also found that the sensitivity of the mouse controls actually made it harder for me to be precise about item placement.</p><div><p id="3-0-update"><h2>3.0 update</h2></p></div><p>The free 3.0 update, which is available on both the Switch and the Switch 2, feels like the bigger upgrade on the merits of the quality-of-life tweaks alone. I <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/845242/animal-crossing-new-horizons-3-0-update-switch-2-edition-features">wrote last month</a> that this update might actually get me to finish decorating my island, and I’ve already spent hours doing exactly that.</p><p>The most impactful change is one so minor, it wasn’t even called out in the update’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nODHyw3lgs&amp;t=1s">announcement trailer</a>: you can strafe.</p><p>Before, when you were decorating or terraforming or even gardening, you’d have to constantly reorient yourself. If you were building a cliff while facing north, for example, you’d have to build one block of the cliff, move a little bit to the right, then turn to face north again without accidentally walking too far north and missing your mark. I would usually do a little circle to position myself and make sure I was aiming the tool in the right place, and even then, I’d frequently be a <em>little</em> bit off and accidentally destroy the bit of cliffside I’d just built. It was so awkward and clunky that I cleared out my entire island in order to redesign it and then… stopped playing the game for four years.</p><p>Now, you can press L and your character will hop into place in the grid, and while holding L, you can move in any direction without changing the direction you’re facing. You still have to do all your terraforming by hand, but the process has been completely streamlined. Press L to line yourself up, build the cliff, move one space over to build the next piece. That’s it. I’ve used it to build and destroy cliffs and rivers, dig up rows of plants, lay down new paths, and even count how many spaces in the invisible grid I would need for a particular project. I’m actually having fun with construction now that the act of doing it isn’t a massive pain.</p><div><p>Resetti is now my best friend</p></div><p>On top of that, Resetti is here to help you clean up your island in what’s possibly the only process in this game that can be described as instantaneous. He can “reset” the entire island, just the beaches, or individual areas you walk to and designate for him, sending the furniture to your storage so long as you have room. (And you <em>will</em> have room, since there are two new storage upgrades to unlock with a new max of 9,000 items.) I used his services to instantly pick up and put away the dozens of copies of the “wheat field” furniture item I’d used to decorate a rural area of my island, which I’d wanted to change but didn’t have the willpower to do manually.</p><p>Plants can now be stored, which allowed me to finally dig up and put away a bunch of bushes that were in my way. And while Resetti doesn’t clean up trees, bushes, or planted crops, he <em>does</em> pick up and put away flowers (or he’ll throw them away if you ask), which in my case saved me from what would’ve been an hour or more of digging up and moving flowers around. Resetti is now my best friend.</p><p>The 3.0 update is a designer’s dream, really. And it’s mostly thanks to those small changes and additions; the new Slumber Island feature, with which you can create up to three separate islands in a dream world, is a sandbox for hardcore decorators to play around in without having to demolish their main islands after all this time.</p><p>Outside of that, the new content is mostly just an excuse to revisit the game, rather than anything as groundbreaking as, you know, strafing. The main addition is a hotel on the pier. It isn’t novel; you’re tasked with decorating some hotel rooms, it introduces a handful of new furniture and clothing items to collect, and the hotel itself attracts tourists to your island to provide a bit of variety. It feels like an extension of the 2021 <em>Happy Home Paradise</em> DLC, which I really enjoyed.</p><p>A few days ago, some of my islanders informed me it had been three years and 11 months since I’d spoken to them. At that time, I really didn’t think I’d be back. But with the hotel, 3.0 gave me just enough of an excuse to return to <em>New Horizons</em>, and the quality-of-life updates are giving me a reason to stay a while.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6NjY1MTI2"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Kallie Plagge</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/863747/animal-crossing-new-horizons-update-3-0-switch-2-quality-of-life]]></content:encoded>

              <p>Although the INIU Ultra Slim 45W Portable Charger is only about the size of a credit card and fits in a back pocket, it has a 10,000 mAh battery, a built-in USB-C cable, and dual USB-C outputs, along with a single USB-A output. It also features protection against overcharging and automatically turns off when the device goes dormant, so you won’t waste electricity. Plus, it’s approved for flight travel by many airlines, so you don’t have to leave it behind on vacation.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3991/">You can purchase the INIU Ultra Slim 45W Portable Charger today from Amazon for $20. This is a savings of 17% off the usual $24 price tag.</a></p>

The 45-Watt output allows you to quickly recharge many newer smartphones and small tablets.

<p>Tides of Tomorrow has been delayed to April 2026, just over a month before its previous release date. </p>



<p>Digixart and THQ Nordic’s next title was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tides-of-tomorrow-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> back in June 2025 during a PlayStation State of Play event, where the developers spoke a bit about the game’s unique multiplayer system. The title received a release date for February 2026, but that has been delayed to April due to feedback from the demo; more details below. </p>







<h2 id="h-tides-of-tomorrow-gets-a-new-release-date">Tides of Tomorrow Gets a New Release Date</h2>



<p>A new <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/2678080/announcements/detail/493840283288472149" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">press release</a> from the developers of Tides of Tomorrow reveals that the game is now set to release on April 22, 2026, for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. The developers considered renaming the title to Tides of the Day After Tomorrow, but decided against it. Instead, they are now delaying the release to work on the feedback they received from the demo. </p>



<p>Tides of Tomorrow’s demo and ongoing beta received extensive feedback, prompting the devs to delay the game. The additional time will be used to “respond to player input and implement improvements.” The extra time will allow the developers to “ensure the best possible experience for the upcoming narrative-driven adventure.” </p>



<p>While players wait for the upcoming title, they can check out the 40-minute <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3951580/Tides_of_Tomorrow_Demo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">demo</a> on Steam, which lets them explore a location from the game’s opening act. As this is a narrative-driven adventure, the demo can be replayed to uncover new gameplay, storylines, and consequences. The game also features a unique multiplayer experience where players can follow a friend or a favourite streamer, and the system will generate a tailored experience by combining your choices with theirs.</p>

Still, if that isn't an issue for you, than this is the best value going for the latest Ultra Premium Collection online right now. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're looking to just chase cards, however, I'd also recommend checking out how much some of the best single chase cards are going for right now, to pick up individually.

            <guid>1409941</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Games Workshop has published a Warhammer lore explanation for the existence of female Custodes following a new miniature range announcement on Friday.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">During a preview livestream, the British company behind tabletop wargames Horus Heresy and Warhammer 40,000 revealed new models for the Adeptus Custodes, a faction made up of genetically-engineered, functionally immortal transhumans who work as the Emperor’s bodyguards on Terra. The Custodes are not Space Marines. Indeed, they are bigger, faster, and more powerful than the average Space Marine. And, as we shall explore, they are created in a very different way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Games Workshop showed off new, eye-catching Custodes models during the livestream, and alongside the male types are female types. While female Custodes had been mentioned in previous Warhammer 40,000 material, and even starred in an official Warhammer animation, their debut in miniature form was enough to set off complaints online from some who accused Games Workshop of retconning the established lore. These people believe the Custodes should remain male only because, they insist, this is what the lore had set out. Some also accuse Games Workshop of pandering to a "modern audience" with the female Custodes, echoing the so-called “anti-woke” rhetoric.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/19/custodes-image2-0ixb1sbgx4-1768821269708.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Female Custodes are now in-game. Image credit: Games Workshop.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps mindful of this reaction, Games Workshop had a <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/kcuvmezh/new-custodes-your-questions-answered/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lore article</a> ready to go following the reveal. In it, the company explained how female Custodes are made possible and how they differ from Space Marines, which remain male only. The gist, according to this article, is there is no retcon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Lore wise, Space Marines are made from human males, willing aspirants or unwilling conscripts on the cusp of adolescence,” Games Workshop explained. “They are subjected to a series of horrific trials, and the strongest emerge as remorseless killers, their humanity stripped away so they can serve as living weapons in the Emperor’s armies. There are no female Adeptus Astartes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Custodes are not Space Marines. Other than the obvious point that they are both towering, gene-enhanced warriors, the similarities pretty much stop there. Custodes are taken as infants and recrafted by ancient science.The process is arcane and bespoke to each individual. The Emperor himself retained oversight of the process (at least until that whole Horus Heresy thing went down).”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/19/image6-6-u7wp04o8ym-1768821383328.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: Games Workshop.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Games Workshop also addressed the belief that all the Custodes are made from the sons of Terran noble houses, as set out by Custodes lore established for the 8th Edition of Warhammer 40,000. While some Custodes are made this way, that was not the only source of recruitment, Games Workshop explained.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Other methods might have been equally overt, others far more secretive,” the company said. “Noble daughters could also have been taken, and at some point, you run out of noble houses — even after you’ve conquered all of Terra, the inexorable war machine of the Imperium still requires a constant churn of recruits.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Games Workshop concluded: “all Custodes, male or female, embody the pinnacle of the genetic and cellular engineering the Emperor employed when creating his armies. They are all flawless creations, pushed beyond the limit of human potential. There is no difference in combat efficacy between a male Custodian and female Custodian.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s safe to say the weekend has been packed with ‘discourse’ following the Custodes reveal. YouTube comments, social media, and subreddits do indeed have many comments from people complaining about the mere existence of these female Custodes models. Some are so upset they’re threatening to leave the hobby behind over it. But it’s important to note that there is a significant pushback on this sentiment from many Warhammer 40,000 fans who have no problem whatsoever with female Custodes and dismiss any retcon concerns.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth remembering that, for all the complaints about retcons, Warhammer 40,000 “lore,” such as it is, has always been an unreliable thing. Indeed, it is built upon the idea that all we know of what was, what is, and what will be comes from <em>a certain point of view</em>. Crucial events are often delivered from a character’s perspective, and that character may have an agenda of their own. The Imperium itself — a rotting, fascist regime built upon 10,000 years of propaganda — twists the facts, if we can even call them such. There is little in the Warhammer 40,000 universe that can be relied upon. That is kind of the point.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And we’ve been here before. The Necrons — now one of the most popular xenos factions in the setting — were once mindless automatons all. Now, we have novels about individual Necrons with more personality than your average agent of the Inquisition. We don’t call the Imperial Guard the Imperial Guard anymore (well, we’re not meant to!). We are to refer to the Guard as the Astra Militarum and not to say another word on it thank you very much.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/19/tithes-1768821769620.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Tithes Episode 2 stars an Adeptus Custodes called Tyrith. Image credit: Games Workshop.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">From the same 8th Edition Custodes codex that stated all the Custodes are made from the sons of Terran noble houses:</p><blockquote>Not even the most knowledgeable of the Imperium’s scholars can say when the Emperor fashioned the Custodians. The truth is hidden in fragments of the past, accounts of figures appearing in crude hieroglyphs and cave etchings, stasis-locked scads of parchment and gene-sealed tomes that no man now can open.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">And:</p><blockquote>The method by which such remarkable individuals are created has always been known only to those of the Imperial household, and is carried out by the most accomplished chirurgeons and bio-alchemists of Terra within gilded laboratories locked away from the sight of Humanity’s masses. With the Adeptus Custodes fighting only for the Emperor himself, and beholden to the commands and scrutiny of no other, the secrets of their recruitment have never been revealed, for not even the High Lords of Terra have the right to demand them.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Games Workshop had laid the groundwork for the introduction of female Custodes by mentioning Custodes Calladayce Kesh in the latest Custodes codex back in April 2024 (some didn’t like the way this was done, or the tweet Games Workshop put out about it back then, and at the time there were no female Custodes models to go alongside the lore reveal).</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Since the first of the Ten Thousand were created, there have always been female Custodians.</p>— Warhammer Official (@warhammer) <a href="https://twitter.com/warhammer/status/1779544596172689822?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">April 14, 2024</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Then, in September 2024, fans were treated to a Warhammer animation starring a female Custodes called Tyrith Shiva Kyrus, who spent her time ripping tyranids to shreds and staring down Space Marines in the way only a Custodes can.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tyrith Shiva Kyrus was Games Workshop's first portrayal of a female Custodian since the lore revelation that Custodians could be any gender just a handful of months prior. "This fact came as a real surprise to many, since it wasn’t something previously explored," <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/TBbxxG5O/the-tithes-episode-2-custodes-dont-ask-twice/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Games Workshop said at the time</a>. "That, in and of itself, isn’t a particularly unusual thing for Warhammer 40,000 and its lore; there are simply loads of things the Warhammer Studios have never expressly stated, whether that’s ruling them in or out. Since the earliest conversations about bringing the Horus Heresy to the tabletop and Black Library fiction, the exact nature of the Custodians has been under discussion — after all, their origins and means of creation, unlike for example, the Legiones/Adeptus Astartes, are shrouded in mystery.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"A significant advantage to this portrayal is that it helps us to address a common misconception — that the Custodes are just bigger, better Space Marines. They aren’t. Space Marines were made through industrialised ritual to be mass-produced, brute-force weapons of conquest. And even 10,000 years after their creation, draped in self-assigned glory, that’s still true of them at their core. Each Custodian, on the other hand, is unique.

            <p>Former Assassin's Creed leader Marc-Alexis Côté is reportedly suing Ubisoft following a surprise and suspicious departure from the company last year.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-assassins-creed-boss-clarifies-he-did-not-walk-away-from-series-but-was-asked-to-step-aside-by-ubisoft">Côté left Ubisoft in October</a> with the company claiming he'd chosen to leave but Côté claiming he was pushed out. <a href="https://ici.radio-canada.ca/nouvelle/2221328/marc-alexis-cote-ubisoft-assassins-creed">Radio Canada</a> said Côté's lawsuit seeks CAD $1.3m (£698k) for a mixture of lost severance pay and "moral damages", and for Ubisoft to lift Côté's non-compete clause.</p>
<p>The lawsuit apparently claims (I can't independently find the filing) that problems began <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-and-tencent-announce-new-subsidiary-vantage-studios-to-lead-development-for-the-assassins-creed-far-cry-rainbow-six-franchises">when Ubisoft created new company Vantage Studios with Tencent</a> in October, to control its most valuable gaming properties. These include Assassin's Creed - the franchise Côté was leading, or so he thought. Côté quickly discovered that Vantage was hiring for a new role, Head of Franchises, that would effectively overrule him.</p>

<p>He alleges that Ubisoft boss Yves Guillemot blocked his application for the role because Côté was based in Canada and not France, and said he was offered a lower role as Head of Production instead. "Tense" discussions ensued and resulted in an offer for Côté to lead a "Creative House" looking after second-tier Ubisoft brands.</p>
<p>Côté, "disoriented, confused, and affected by the anxiety-inducing situation", according to the filing, took a break from the company to think and reflect.</p>
<p>Ubisoft management apparently told him that at the end of his two week period of reflection, he'd have to make a choice whether or not to accept the position offered, which Côté saw as an "unacceptable demotion" and therefore a form of "disguised dismissal", so he demanded severance pay in accordance with that.</p><p>Côté had been expected back at work on 13th October but the lawsuit said Ubisoft told him not to show while it formulated a response. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-franchise-lead-leaves-ubisoft-following-formation-of-tencent-subsidiary">The company then suddenly announced he had left the company of his own accord</a>, seeking new opportunities elsewhere, which the lawsuit claims Ubisoft did to avoid paying severance and to apply a non-compete clause. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-assassins-creed-boss-clarifies-he-did-not-walk-away-from-series-but-was-asked-to-step-aside-by-ubisoft">Côté wrote an emotional message at the time,</a> claiming he did not walk away but was asked to step aside.</p>
<p>Ubisoft has not yet responded to the lawsuit filing.</p>
<p>Marc-Alexis Côté worked at Ubisoft for 20 years, spending 15 of those on Assassin's Creed. He was a lead level designer on Brotherhead, director of 3, and then led Ubisoft Quebec as it made Black Flag add-on Freedom Cry, and Syndicate. He was senior producer of Odyssey, and then in 2022, Côté stepped up to take control of the entire Assassin's Creed franchise, rebooting it somewhat and kicking off the new era with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-review">Assassin's Creed Shadows, which launched in March last year</a>.</p>

<p>As Côté tells it, Ubisoft offered him a leadership position at one of its new Creative Houses, but Côté saw this as a demotion since the Creative Houses wouldn't be in charge of Ubisoft's first-tier franchises.</p><p>Following this, Côté took two weeks off work, and when he returned, Ubisoft gave him an ultimatum to accept the job or not.

According to the studio, his departure was voluntary, with the company stating that he had decided to "pursue a new path elsewhere outside of Ubisoft".</p><p>That's why Côté is demanding such a high sum of money; it effectively amounts to two years' worth of severance pay, as well as an extra $75,000 for moral damages (i.e. harm to his reputation and an abuse of power on Ubisoft's part).</p><figure role="group">

<p>Palworld devs have teased upcoming Pals through new concept art revealed from their 2nd Anniversary video. </p>



<p>Pocketpair has been hard at work growing the Palworld game and the franchise. In terms of content, we saw the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworlds-ultrakill-collab-arrives-in-december-2025-with-home-sweet-home-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ultrakill Collab and the ‘Home Sweet Home’ update</a> arrive last month. Additionally, we also saw a new Palword <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworld-facing-more-pokemon-rip-off-allegations-with-new-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TCG announced last week</a>, extending the franchise’s reach in the card game genre. Now, we have got a small tease for what’s in store for their 1.0 update, which will finally get the game out of early access. </p>







<h2 id="h-palworld-reveals-concept-art-for-upcoming-pal">Palworld Reveals Concept Art for Upcoming Pal </h2>



<p>Palworld’s 2nd <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0M82qgvIxE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Anniversary video</a> starts with Bucky, Head of Publishing &amp; Communications at Pocketpair, addressing the community. Bucky reveals that developers are working hard on the Palworld <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworld-1-0-release-window-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1.0 update</a>, which seems to be the game’s “biggest update ever”. However, they can’t show a sneak peek of this update at the moment, as it is still in development. They did have some concept art to showcase for upcoming Pals in Palworld. </p>



<p>The first concept art depicts a dragon-like creature with elements of a Lotus flower around it. The next one had a fluffy but angry-looking creature that seemed to have electric abilities. The third Pal concept art in Palworld featured a blue-and-white-coloured bird with a cloud around its face. The fourth concept art featured an eel-like Pal that could seemingly detach its lower half to turn into a blade. The last art showcased twin creatures in blue and red accents. </p>



<p>Apart from the Pal concept art, towards the end of the video, Bucky also teases another creature, asking, “That sounds like…a whale???” The statement was followed by an in-game cinematic that showed the player atop a mythical, whale-like creature, en route to a mysterious tree. Interested readers can check out the 2nd Anniversary teaser below: </p>

<p>Meet the new boss</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Nintendo of America has a new President and COO, and during the <a href="https://youtu.be/9HNNugGXKQ0?t=3522">15th Annual New York Game Awards</a>, Devon Pritchard made her first public appearance in her new role.</p>
<p>Introduced by ex-Nintendo of America President Reggie Fils-Aimé and New York Times columnist Harold Goldberg, Pritchard appeared via a pre-recorded video to celebrate the Game Awards and the nonprofit 'Playing With Purpose' writing programme, which looks to provide workshops in journalism and game narrative writing in school across New York.</p>
<p>If you're unable to watch the video right now, here's Pritchard's message in full:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Hi everyone, it is great to be here. My name is Devon, and before anything else, I want to celebrate the New York Game Awards. 15 years of supporting the games industry and in doing so lifting up the voices, stories, and dreams of so many.</p>
<p>"This show connects people who are united by a shared belief that every dream matters, and that everyone deserves a chance to do meaningful and creative work in games and storytelling. The 'Playing With Purpose' programme supports the creators, the coders, the writers, and anyone else dreaming big to join this community and bring all that makes them unique.</p>
<p>"I'm excited to meet you! To hear those stories and to learn from your journeys. And remember, like any good video game character, you're on an adventure, and every step you take matters. There's some gnarly bosses, sure, but also many good friends along the way who will support you, and powerful rewards for those who persevere.</p>
<p>"So keep believing, keep playing, and know that you truly belong in this game."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pritchard took over the role of President and COO of Nintendo of America when her predecessor, Doug Bowser, stepped down at the end of 2025.</p>
<p>Pritchard will have a big task ahead of her in spearheading the next generation of Nintendo with the Switch 2. The console has gotten off to a great start, but concerns around price uncertainty and Game-Key Cards linger in the minds of fans around the world.</p>

            <p>Former Assassin's Creed series lead Marc-Alexis Côté is suing Ubisoft for damages, alleging that his <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ex-assassins-creed-lead-says-leaving-ubisoft-wasnt-his-choice-instead-down-to-restructure-musical-chairs">abrupt October departure from the company</a> after 20 years wasn't a matter of personal choice, but a case of "constructive dismissal". That, in <a href="https://www.acas.org.uk/dismissals/constructive-dismissal">non-legalese</a>, means that the developer believes he was left with no choice but to resign, having been offered new roles he viewed as demotions amid a round of corporate musical chairs.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As reported by <a href="https://ici.radio-canada.ca/nouvelle/2221328/marc-alexis-cote-ubisoft-assassins-creed">CBC Radio-Canada</a>, Côté's lawsuit against Ubisoft has been filed in Quebec and seeks $1.3 million Canadian dollars  - around $935,000 in US currency - in damages on his behalf. That cash is designed to cover two years worth of the developer's salary, plus moral damages and an additional lifting of a non-compete clause which currently limits his games industry job options.</p>
<p>According to the lawsuit, Côté learned in a summer 2025 meeting that as part the Ubisoft rearrangement which came with the company setting up a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tencent-hand-ubisoft-a-big-wad-of-cash-to-spin-out-assassins-creed-far-cry-and-rainbow-six-as-a-separate-business">new Tencent-backed subsidiary called Vantage Studios</a> to oversee the running of Assassin's Creed, Rainbow Six, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/far-cry">Far Cry</a>, they'd be installing a "head of franchise" based in France. According to Canada-based Côté, that gig absorbed lots of his duties as Assassin's Creed series head, and he was subsequently offered roles as Assassin's Creed production head reporting to that new head of franchise or as the leader of a "creative house” overseeing another Ubisoft game series.</p>
<p>Seeing that as a demotion, Côté's lawsuit asserts that he took two weeks to think about things, then declined and asked for his severance pay. Ubisoft are cited by the suit as having responded by telling him not to show back up to work, then announcing his departure in a fashion which painted it as being your standard voluntary parting of ways.</p>
<p>I've reached out to Ubisoft for comment.</p>
<p>When RPS reached out to the publishers for comment following Côté's initial comments about his departure back in October, we received the following response:</p>
<blockquote>Following the organizational restructuring announced in March 2025, Marc-Alexis Côté has chosen to pursue a new path elsewhere outside of Ubisoft. While we are saddened to see him go, we’re confident that our talented teams will carry forward the strong foundation he helped build. We are deeply grateful for the impact Marc-Alexis has had over the years, particularly in shaping the Assassin’s Creed brand into what it is today. His leadership, creativity, and dedication have left a lasting mark on our teams and our players. We thank him sincerely for his many contributions and wish him continued success in all his future endeavors."</blockquote>
<p>We'll see how these legal wranglings shake out.</p>

            <guid>1409899</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>You really can’t have too many USB cables, can you? And now that Apple finally in the last couple years went ahead and ditched its proprietary Lightning cable to join the rest of the world in using the USB-C standard, you have even more reason to have USB-C cables readily available in every room in your house. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6770/">UGREEN is well established brand in the field of charging accessories, and right now, Amazon has a number of their cables on sale for as much as 42% off.</a></p>
<p>The UGREEN USB-C to USB-C 100W cable comes in four different sizes and your choice of buying them individually or as a pair. Breaking down the various options, we first have the smallest 1.6ft cable which only is available in a bundle of two. That normally goes for $17, but has come down to just $13. Going a size up, we have the 3.3ft cables which you can get on for $7 (down from $12) or two for $7 (down from $13). That should be a no brainer on whether to get one or two. Doubling the length to 6.6ft, you can the single for $8 ( down from $10) or $2 for $14 (down from $17). Lastly, we have the super long 10ft option which you can either get one of for $10 (down from $14) or two of for $18 (down from $23).</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6770/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>One of those long 10ft ones are great to keep in your living room. This way no matter where you or a guest is sitting on your couch, they’ll be able to charge their phone while keeping it comfortably on their person, instead of needing to return to a different corner of the room to check for messages every 15 minutes. These cables are threaded with nylon braiding too, so they’re less susceptible to fraying or splitting.</p>
<h2>Wide Compatibility</h2>
<p>As a USB-C cable, this has a broad range of compatibility for various devices. It can be used to charge laptops like the new MacBook Pros, cell phones like the iPhone 17/16/15 Series, Samsung S25/S24/S23, and Google Pixel, as well as the newly released Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>The UGREEN USB-C cable is equipped with smart chip protection. It’s built with an E-marker which can intelligently match the required current while increasing charging efficiency. It’s 100W so it’s capable of ultra-fast charging with PD3.0 and QC3.0 tech. You can expect to be able to bring an iPhone 17 Pro Max from dead to 50% in just 20 minutes time.</p>
<p>As a USB-C cable, it’s also capable of data transfer. You’ll be able to send and receive files at transfer speeds of up to 480Mbps, allowing you to quickly move massive files like movies or entire photo libraries in no time flat.</p>

			<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Owlcat Games</strong> is a video game development studio that requires no introduction nowadays, as cRPGs are as popular as ever. Following the launch of the two entries in the <em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/pathfinder-wrath-of-the-righteous-depth-beyond-all-measure/"><strong>Pathfinder</strong></a></em> series, which showed how the developer doesn't <strong>compromise in any way when adapting tabletop RPGs' rules in video game format</strong>, Owlcat launched <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/warhammer-40000-rogue-trader-charting-a-new-course/"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Warhammer 40K: Rogue Trader</em></a></strong>, their first foray into the world created by Games Workshop. </p>



<p>Although the game was, by all accounts, <strong>a very solid game</strong>, some of the studio's now trademark clunkiness (and pretty much required pre-battle buffing) seeped into it, resulting in a game that was <strong>considerably less accessible</strong> than the title which contributed a lot to the current popularity of cRPGs: Larian's <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/baldurs-gate-3-review/"><em>Baldur's Gate 3</em>.</a></strong></p>



<p>Last year, Owlcat Games confirmed it was going back to the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Imperium of Man</strong> with <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Warhammer 40K: Dark Heresy</em>, but with some twists. This time around, players would take the role of an <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Inquisitor</strong>, one of the highest-ranking members of the Imperium's secret police and intelligence, <strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">whose authority is second only to the Emperor of Mankind himself</strong>. </p>



<p>Even those with little to no knowledge of the <em>Warhammer 40K</em> world can easily understand what playing as one means: <strong>the freedom of taking on any challenge as they see fit</strong>, backed by what is recognized as one of the highest authorities in the universe.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/20251222113652_1-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Warhammer 40K: Dark Heresy does an excellent job making the player feel they are always right, no matter their choices</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">During last year's Gamescom</strong>, I was able to check out a live demo of <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Warhammer 40K: Dark Heresy</em>, which made it abundantly clear how the entire experience is centered around one fundamental concept: <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">the player is always right</strong>. Inquisitors, after all, can do no wrong, so if the player so desired, they could have concluded the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">investigation</strong> featured in the demo by just <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">putting the blame for some killings on the first possible culprit</strong>, without having to worry about the consequences. This, coupled with some improvements to combat and user interface, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">definitely caught my attention</strong>.</p>



<p>With the release of the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">alpha version</strong> last month, I was finally able to test for myself how far this concept could be pushed and whether there are indeed <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">no wrong choices</strong>. Turns out<span data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">&nbsp;<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">t</strong></span><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">here aren't. In the same investigation set on Scintilla,</strong> which sees the Inquisitor look into <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">a series of mysterious disappearances</strong>, instead of <span data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">strictly adhering to the&nbsp;<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Imperial Creed</strong> for the most part&nbsp;as I witnessed in the Gamescom demo, I took a more pragmatic approach,&nbsp;<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">not shying away from challenging the Creed when</strong></span><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"> it suited my purpose</strong>.</p>



<p>Appreciating even more the <strong>environmental storytelling and the beautiful world</strong> Owlcat Games is creating for <em>Warhammer 40K: Dark Heresy</em> as well as the new <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/inquisitors-do-more-than-fight-warhammer-40000-dark-heresy-detective-system-showcased-in-new-screenshots/">investigation mechanics</a></strong> centered on adding and connecting the clues noted in the Investigation Journal in the game's Mind Map, I couldn't help but appreciate how <strong>the developer managed to create an incredible balance between truly giving player complete freedom without punishing them. </strong></p>



<p>While it's undeniable that <em>Warhammer 40K: Dark Heresy</em> won't have the same type of <strong>world reactivity</strong> as <em>Baldur's Gate 3</em>, the <strong>differences between the Radical and Puritan "paths"</strong>, which replace the alignment system from Rogue Trader, will make sure <strong>role-playing will be an important part of the experience as much as combat is</strong>. Better yet, the game does an excellent job of <strong>making it clear</strong> in the writing that the <strong>Inquisitor is indeed always right</strong>, even if they go against the Imperial Creed.</p>



<p>Besides enjoying this sort of player freedom powering what could be the ultimate power fantasy in the <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Warhammer 40K</em> universe, short of playing as the Emperor, the <em>Warhammer 40K: Dark Heresy</em> alpha also made me <strong>appreciate the improvements to the turn-based tactical combat system introduced in Rogue Trader. </strong></p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/20251222121752_1-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Combat in Warhammer 40K: Dark Heresy has been significantly improved with new mechanics and quality-of-life features</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The streamlining of the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">cover system</strong>, the ability to destroy any objects that can be used as cover, the ability to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">aim specific body parts</strong> to disable enemies before defeating them, the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Concentration mechanics</strong> which will allow players to prevent an enemy from using powerful attacks, the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Morale system</strong> which can put the enemy in complete disarray and the ability to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">end combat as soon as it is decided the enemy will have no chance of winning</strong> are all great improvements that are set to make battles better paced and more engaging than ever.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, but understandably given the early nature of this release, the Alpha hands out <strong>characters with pre-learned abilities</strong>. While this meant I couldn’t test the limits of the progression system,<strong> the synergy between classes and skills was already evident and satisfyingly easy to leverage.</strong></p>



<p>With the entire experience having been remade from scratch over Rogue Trader, I was really curious to see how Owlcat Games would address the <strong>sometimes excessive complexity</strong> of their cRPGs, and from the Warhammer 40K: Dark Heresy Alpha, it really seems like the developer is <strong>managing to strike a happy medium between complexity and accessibility. </strong></p>



<p>With a story that will be<strong> smaller in scope</strong> than Rogue Trader but more varied, and with more meaningful combat encounters, I am really looking forward to seeing how <strong>my choices will shape the experience</strong> and whether the studio's complexity will indeed have been toned down for a more enjoyable experience. Hopefully, it won't take much longer to experience all this and finally <strong>wield the power to prove that, indeed, innocence proves nothing.</strong></p>

            <title><![CDATA[‘By That Argument, We Should Never Have Made Mass Effect’ – BioWare Vet Defends Making Anthem]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/bioware-veteran-defends-making-anthem/</link>
            <guid>1409881</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Exactly a week ago, <strong>Electronic Arts</strong> took down the official servers of <strong>Anthem</strong>, <strong>BioWare</strong>'s failed live service game, as the publisher <a href="https://wccftech.com/anthem-going-offline-2026-ea/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had announced back in July</a>.</p>



<p>A few days ago, YouTuber Destin Legarie <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Y65eoBVF0Y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hosted a 40-minute video interview with <strong>Mark Darrah</strong></a>, a BioWare veteran who worked on practically all of the studio's games since the first <strong>Baldur's Gate</strong> (1998) to <strong>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</strong> (<a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-dreadwolf-mass-effect-team-helping-mark-darrah-advisor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as a consultant</a>, after leaving the company), with the notable exception of the <strong>Mass Effect</strong> series.</p>



<p>This includes Anthem, on which Darrah worked as an Executive Producer. The developer <strong>acknowledged a number of shortcomings</strong>, such as:</p>



<ul>
<li>The game was originally inspired by <strong>Diablo</strong>, but Darrah says the team should have realized that, as a looter shooter, it should have really taken a lot more inspiration from <strong>Destiny</strong> instead. This is partly why the loot, endgame, and retention were all failures.</li>



<li>The flight mechanics were by far the most enjoyable for players, but they also <strong>caused several issues</strong>. For example, virtually every enemy unit had to have ranged attacks, since players could just fly away otherwise. Also, Darrah says that in co-op, three experienced players could drag a new player through the story at breakneck speed, disrupting the narrative flow.</li>



<li>BioWare even tested a version of Anthem <strong>without flight</strong> before E3 2017, though the goal was always to reintroduce it as they did in the final version.</li>



<li>In the interview, Darrah wonders if the developers <strong>should have proposed a 9-month public beta</strong>, keeping the entire team working on live iterations. This would have meant shipping the game, calling it "beta," and doing what happened in the first year, but before the official launch.</li>



<li>The industry veteran also believes <strong>BioWare Austin</strong>, which had much more experience with live-service games (it made <strong>Star Wars: The Old Republic</strong>), should have been handed the reins much earlier than they were. They were working on <strong>Anthem Next</strong>, which was supposed to introduce new ways to play beyond cataclysms and missions, new events, and other content. However, the team was understaffed, and Anthem Next <a href="https://wccftech.com/anthem-next-cancelled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was ultimately canceled in February 2021</a>.</li>
</ul>



<p>Toward the end of the video interview, Darrah adds that EA was <strong>partially but not entirely to blame</strong> and also addresses one of the common refrains you might have read on forums and social media: that BioWare should never have made Anthem in the first place. On that count, he doesn't really agree.</p>



<p><em>I think it's easy to blame EA, and certainly, they deserve a bunch of blame for Anthem, but it's not all their fault. But one thing that actually is worth mentioning, I think, is that there are some people that at the time loved coming out of the woodwork and saying 'see, I told you so', and it's like, 'BioWare should have never made Anthem because they are a single player RPG studio.' But <strong>my feeling is that BioWare has always been changing. By that argument, we should never have made Neverwinter Nights because we were a 2D RPG maker. We should never have made Mass Effect, because we were a tactical RPG maker, not an action RPG maker. So, I don't know that that argument holds a lot of weight for me</strong>. To me, it's like, yeah, your studios evolve, and they try new things. And was Anthem too big of a reach? Yeah, for sure. But could you tell at the time? I don't know. I don't know that you could.</em></p>



<p>Mark Darrah did provide a bit of hope for the future of BioWare, which is even more in jeopardy after Dragon Age: The Veilguard also largely <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-was-a-high-quality-game-that-failed-due-to-lack-of-shared-world-elements-says-ea-ceo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">failed to meet the company's financial projections</a>. Everything hinges on the next Mass Effect game, but the developer said there's a silver lining: now <strong>BioWare is a single-project studio that is entirely focused on this title</strong>, instead of splitting itself across multiple projects, which happened with Anthem, <strong>Mass Effect: Andromeda</strong>, and Dragon Age: The Veilguard for parts of the respective development phases. Will that be enough to create a successful game? Only time will tell.</p>

            <p>Rockstar North, the Edinburgh office of GTA 6 developers Rockstar Games, has been cordoned off by emergency services following reports of an explosion in the building.</p>
<!--more-->
<p><a href="https://www.edinburghlive.co.uk/news/edinburgh-news/edinburgh-fire-crews-rush-ongoing-33257244.amp">Edinburgh Live</a> and <a href="https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/25776012.gta6-dev-rockstar-north-building-taped-off-boiler-explosion/">The Herald</a> report that local fire crews were called out to Holyrood Road at around 5AM on January 19th.</p>
<p>"We were alerted at 5.02AM on Monday, 19 January to attend an incident on Holyrood Road, Edinburgh, reads a statement given to the latter by a spokesperson for the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service. "Operations Control mobilised three fire appliances and specialist resources to the scene, where firefighters worked to secure structural damage at a commercial building. There were no reported casualties and crews left the scene at 9.21AM."</p>
<p>Both local outlets outline that the exact nature of what happened isn't fully clear as of yet, but cite reports suggesting an "explosion in a boiler room" was the cause of the incident.</p>
<p>That's it for details as of writing, I'll update this article or link out to a separate one as or when more information arrives.</p>
<p>This incident comes amid <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fired-gta-6-devs-suffer-setback-in-legal-fight-against-rockstar-as-uk-court-denies-request-for-interim-relief">legal proceedings between Rockstar Games and the Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain union</a>, with the latter representing 31 former Rockstar employees which the company fired last year. Rockstar allege the staff were dismissed for sharing info about GTA 6 and other unannounced projects over Discord, while the union have accused them of union busting. As part of the initial response to the firings, Rockstar North's Edinburgh offices were the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ah-shit-here-we-go-again-gta-6-developers-speak-from-the-picket-line-about-rockstar-north-union-busting">site of a union protest last November</a>.</p>
<p>To be clear, as of right now there is no suggestion of a causal connection between this incident and the above events.</p>

              <p>A monitor can make or break your gaming experience. If you’re looking to enjoy consistent, high-quality visuals and snappy performance for your favorite titles, you need a solid option in your gaming setup.</p>
<p>Samsung makes some of the best out there, and we just found a way to grab one of its top-rated screens for less. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6186/">The 32-inch Samsung Odyssey G50D Series is currently going for $250 at Amazon, after the retailer generously slashed a whopping 42% off its price.</a> This is one of the lowest prices we have seen in a while, but there’s a catch. The discount ends soon, so there isn’t much time left to save. It’s best to snap it up as quickly as you can!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6186/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Brighter Whites, Deeper Blacks</h2>
<p>For just $250, you’re getting a spacious 32-inch screen. Expect lifelike visuals with QHD resolution that packs in 1.7 times the pixel density of Full HD for better detail and sharper images. The fast IPS panel offers exceptional color accuracy, while the wide 178-degree viewing angle makes it easy to enjoy consistent visuals from nearly every side; you don’t have to sit exactly at the front of the screen to see what’s going on, which also makes it great for multiplayer matches with friends.</p>
<p>VESA DisplayHDR 400 support offers more contrast, helping you see all the shades better. Think brighter whites and deeper blacks, with even the shadows being visible. Translation? You will be able to spot enemies hidden in the dark easily, plus enjoy better contrast overall. The monitor also comes with an eye saver mode that actively minimizes blue light to help keep your eyes relaxed when gaming for extended periods.</p>



<p>As for the performance, the 180Hz refresh rate does an excellent job of eliminating lag, resulting in ultrasmooth action, even during those fast-paced games. A 1ms response time, on the other hand, reduces blur, making it easy to jump on enemies as soon as you spot them. Additionally, the AMD Radeon FreeSync keeps your monitor and graphics card refresh rate in sync for an even more immersive experience, whether you’re just streaming a show or teaching bad guys a lesson.</p>
<p>Samsung G50D can also be freely moved to accommodate the way you play. You can adjust the height, swivel, and tilt it to find the right viewing angle for a competitive edge. Sitting upright for an intense battle? Position it straight. Feeling tired of sitting and want to game while standing? That’s possible too.</p>
<p>In short, if you’ve been looking to enjoy better visuals that make you feel like a part of the action, the Samsung G50D is an excellent option to consider. It offers impressive detail, vibrant colors, and a solid refresh rate – all of which come together to deliver an immersive gaming experience. The monitor is now going for $250, down from $430, which makes today a great time to pick it up for less. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6186/">If the 32-inch version is bigger than what you’re after, there’s also a 27-inch version of the same model. It’s going for $250, too, after a 29% discount</a>. However, considering how the 32-inch version offers more in the same price, it’s definitely a better pick.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>I try not to have a backlog. I’m choosier with what I spend time on at this stage of my life than I used to be, and if I care enough to play a game, I usually see it through. But there is one white whale on my shelf that, despite multiple attempts, I’ve never been able to commit to seeing through: </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-sun-and-moon-the-kotaku-review-1789134713"><i><span>Pokémon Sun </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Moon</span></i></a><span>, as well as their enhanced re-release, </span><i><span>Ultra Sun</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Ultra Moon</span></i><span>. The reason why is…a lot more stupid than you’d probably expect.</span></p> <p><span>With the exception of the Alola games, I have finished every mainline </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>game at least once. I played through the first three generations endlessly on loop as a kid, creating new challenges for myself and catching new monsters to make the most of the game for as long as I could. It wasn’t until Generation IV that I became a “one and done” </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>player before moving on to the next thing. This was both because I was old enough to buy more games for myself so I wasn’t constantly pulling water from the stone, and because I was starting to lose interest in the stories they were telling.&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>games have had cool worldbuilding but lackluster narrative, so as I was getting older and playing grander RPGs like </span><i><span>Mass Effect</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>wasn’t holding my attention the way it once had. But still, I was playing these games as if out of obligation. I finished them, put them on my shelf, and didn’t think about them much beyond that. So what could have possibly happened with </span><i><span>Sun </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Moon</span></i><span> and their “definitive” editions that finally pushed me over the edge and made me </span><i><span>not</span></i><span> finish a </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>game? Let me tell you about my pancake-eating archnemesis, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-alolan-raichu-quest-how-to-get-mega-2000637259"><span>Alolan Raichu</span></a><span>.</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Kotaku </span></i><span>readers will know that </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-raichu-alolan-pikachu-anime-1851011570"><span>Raichu</span></a><span>, the evolved form of Pikachu, is my favorite Pokémon. Because his little brother is the mascot of the whole dang franchise, Raichu is often forgotten, and sometimes, in the case of the anime, actively set up for failure to make Pikachu look good.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>For many years, I grinned and bore it. To me Pikachu, Raichu, and their pre-evolution, Pichu, were all the same Pokémon anyway. If one form got love, it was like my partner in crime was getting attention at different stages of his life. But man, Game Freak was adamant about making sure everyone and their mother knew that Raichu was the red-headed stepchild of the family. Pikachu has a held item that makes it more powerful than Raichu, so there’s even a mechanical reason not to use a Thunder Stone and evolve it. Raichu’s </span><i><span>Ultra Moon</span></i><span> Pokedex entry even says, “Because so many Trainers like the way Pikachu looks, you don’t see this Pokémon very often.” Relax, Game Freak.</span></p>

 <p><span>So when </span><i><span>Sun </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Moon </span></i><span>was coming out, I was already halfway off the wagon. Then it arrived and Game Freak revealed that every Pikachu in the game would evolve into a new regional variant. The Alolan version of Raichu is…cute, I guess. It gains the psychic typing which lets it levitate and surf around on its tail, and all of this is apparently a result of Pikachu overeating Alolan pancakes, which is why it emits a sweet scent when it rubs its electric cheeks. But I saw through its facade. I don’t smell maple syrup, I smell some bullshit. I want to fistfight him in the streets.</span></p>

  <p><span>Behind this syrup-smelling surfing psychic’s cute round face is a nasty, vile truth: Game Freak and The Pokémon Company were only willing to give Raichu attention if they changed him into something else entirely. The boy cannot get respect in his own form, and that has only become more clear in the years since </span><i><span>Sun </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Moon</span></i><span>. Pikachu gets a Gigantamax form in </span><i><span>Sword </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Shield</span></i><span>, an exclusive Z-Move in </span><i><span>Sun </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Moon</span></i><span>, and is always the playable version in games like </span><i><span>Pokken Tournament</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Pokémon Unite</span></i><span>. Raichu, meanwhile, gets scraps…unless it’s the Alolan variant, which is featured in games like </span><i><span>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</span></i><span> and is playable in </span><i><span>Pokémon Unite</span></i><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p><span>A lot of this disrespect and preferential treatment has come after </span><i><span>Sun </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Moon</span></i><span>, but I still called Alolan Raichu for what it was. </span><i><span>Sun </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Moon </span></i><span>was already primed to push me away with its less interesting tropical setting and a Pokedex with too few standouts to keep me hunting for new favorites, so to not even be able to explore this region with my favorite electric rat? To be told to settle for an imposter that smells of hotcakes and psychic power? I just couldn’t push through. And y’all, I have tried so many times over the past 10 years. However, maybe I can finally go back after </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i></a><span>.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000659337" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000659337"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000659337">© The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure> <p><span>The latest RPG in the series finally gives Raichu his due. He has not one, but two Mega Evolutions now, after having been oddly overlooked when </span><i><span>X </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Y </span></i><span>came out and first introduced those transformations. I’m obsessed with both of these forms, though I have a preference for </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-evolution-raichu-x-2000652246"><span>the flying, physical-attacking X form</span></a><span>. I admit, however, there is some part of me that still feels a little bit of that lingering resentment because both forms carry distinct visual similarities to Pikachu, almost as if Game Freak wanted to make a Mega Pikachu but couldn’t based on their own rules, and so my rat son finally got love. Yes, Alolan Raichu felt like a slight to us OG Raichu lovers at the time…but now that my favorite Pokémon finally isn’t being ignored, do I have it in me to forgive the dopey-ass surfer boy for his crimes?</span></p> <p><span>As the resident </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>guy around these parts, </span><i><span>Sun </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Moon</span></i><span> is one of the only examples I have of a backlog game that feels truly wrong to have not seen through to the end. Usually, if I don’t finish a game, there’s a less stupid and prideful reason like I just wasn’t enjoying it, so I don’t carry the baggage of games left incomplete on my shoulders as I head out to new worlds on unknown adventures. But I’m a certified champion in every other </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> region besides Alola, which I left unconquered mostly because I didn’t want to do it without my best friend by my side. I might not go back any time soon, but for the first time in over a decade, I’m starting to feel like I’m letting go of the pride that has kept me from seeing it through.</span></p>

<p>If you’ve ever used a 3D printer, you may recall the wondrous feeling when you first printed something you could have never sculpted or built yourself. Download a model file, load some plastic filament, push a button, and almost like magic, a three-dimensional object appears. But the result isn’t polished and ready for mass production, and creating a novel shape requires more skills than just pushing a button. Interestingly, today’s <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/12/how-do-ai-coding-agents-work-we-look-under-the-hood/">AI coding agents</a> feel much the same way.</p>
<p>Since November, I have used <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/10/claude-code-gets-a-web-version-but-its-the-new-sandboxing-that-really-matters/">Claude Code</a> and Claude Opus 4.5 through a personal Claude Max account to extensively experiment with AI-assisted software development (I have also used OpenAI’s <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/12/how-openai-is-using-gpt-5-codex-to-improve-the-ai-tool-itself/">Codex</a> in a similar way, though not as frequently). Fifty projects later, I’ll be frank: I have not had this much fun with a computer since I learned BASIC on my <a href="https://www.vintagecomputing.com/index.php/archives/440/shining-a-rotten-apple">Apple II Plus</a> when I was 9 years old. This opinion comes not as an endorsement but as personal experience: I voluntarily undertook this project, and I paid out of pocket for both OpenAI and Anthropic’s premium AI plans.</p>
<p>Throughout my life, I have dabbled in programming as a utilitarian coder, writing small tools or scripts when needed. In my web development career, I wrote some small tools from scratch, but I primarily modified other people’s code for my needs. Since 1990, I’ve programmed in BASIC, C, Visual Basic, PHP, ASP, Perl, Python, Ruby, MUSHcode, and some others. I am not an expert in any of these languages—I learned just enough to get the job done. I have developed my own hobby games over the years using BASIC, Torque Game Engine, and Godot, so I have some idea of what makes a good architecture for a modular program that can be expanded over time.</p>

<p>Claude Code, Codex, and Google’s <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/06/google-is-bringing-vibe-coding-to-your-terminal-with-gemini-cli/">Gemini CLI</a>, can seemingly perform software miracles on a small scale. They can spit out flashy prototypes of simple applications, user interfaces, and even games, but only as long as they borrow patterns from their training data. Much like a 3D printer, doing production-level work takes far more effort. Creating durable production code, managing a complex project, or crafting something truly novel still requires experience, patience, and skill beyond what today’s AI agents can provide on their own.</p>

<p>And yet these tools have opened a world of creative potential in software that was previously closed to me, and they feel personally empowering. Even with that impression, though, I know these are hobby projects, and the limitations of coding agents lead me to believe that veteran software developers probably shouldn’t fear losing their jobs to these tools any time soon. In fact, they may become busier than ever.</p>
<p>So far, I have created over 50 demo projects in the past two months, fueled in part by a bout of COVID that left me bedridden with a laptop and a generous 2x Claude usage cap that Anthropic put in place during the last few weeks of December. As I typed furiously all day, my wife kept asking me, “Who are you talking to?”</p>
<p>You can see a few of the more interesting results <a href="https://bxfoundry.com/">listed</a> on my personal website. Here are 10 interesting things I’ve learned from the process.</p>

<h2>1. People are still necessary</h2>
<p>Even with the best AI coding agents available today, humans remain essential to the software development process. Experienced human software developers bring judgment, creativity, and domain knowledge that AI models lack. They know how to architect systems for long-term maintainability, how to balance technical debt against feature velocity, and when to push back when requirements don’t make sense.</p>
<p>For hobby projects like mine, I can get away with a lot of sloppiness. But for production work, having someone who understands version control, incremental backups, testing one feature at a time, and debugging complex interactions between systems makes all the difference. Knowing something about how good software development works helps a lot when guiding an AI coding agent—the tool amplifies your existing knowledge rather than replacing it.</p>
<p>As independent AI researcher Simon Willison <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/7/vibe-engineering/">wrote</a> in a post distinguishing serious AI-assisted development from casual “<a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/is-vibe-coding-with-ai-gnarly-or-reckless-maybe-some-of-both/">vibe coding</a>,” “AI tools amplify existing expertise. The more skills and experience you have as a software engineer the faster and better the results you can get from working with LLMs and coding agents.”</p>

    <div>
          
          
<p>With AI assistance, you don’t have to remember <em>how</em> to do everything. You just need to know what you want to do.</p>

      </figure>

<p>So I like to remind myself that coding agents are software tools best used to enact human ideas, not autonomous coding employees. They are <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/08/the-personhood-trap-how-ai-fakes-human-personality/">not people</a> (and not people replacements) no matter how the companies behind them might market them.</p>
<p>If you think about it, everything you do on a computer was once a manual process. Programming a computer like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENIAC">ENIAC</a> involved literally making physical bits (connections) with wire on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plugboard">plugboard</a>. The history of programming has been one of increasing automation, so even though this AI-assisted leap is somewhat startling, one could think of these tools as an advancement similar to the advent of high-level languages, automated compilers and debugger tools, or GUI-based IDEs. They can automate many tasks, but managing the overarching project scope still falls to the person telling the tool what to do.</p>
<p>And they can have rapidly compounding benefits. I’ve now used AI tools to write better tools—such as changing the source of an emulator so a coding agent can use it directly—and those improved tools are already having ripple effects. But a human must be in the loop for the best execution of my vision. This approach has kept me very busy, and contrary to some prevailing fears about people <a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2025/11/is-ai-dulling-our-minds/">becoming dumber</a> due to AI, I have learned many new things along the way.</p>
<h2>2. AI models are brittle beyond their training data</h2>
<p>Like all AI models based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_(deep_learning)">Transformer architecture</a>, the large language models (LLMs) that underpin today’s coding agents have a significant limitation: They can only reliably apply knowledge gleaned from training data, and they have a limited ability to generalize that knowledge to novel domains not represented in that data.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>What is training data? In this case, when building coding-flavored LLMs, AI companies <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/7/22561180/github-copilot-legal-copyright-fair-use-public-code">download</a> millions of examples of software code from sources like GitHub and use them to make the AI models. Companies later specialize them for coding through fine-tuning processes.</p>

<p>The ability of AI agents to use trial and error—attempting something and then trying again—helps mitigate the brittleness of LLMs somewhat. But it’s not perfect, and it can be frustrating to see a coding agent spin its wheels trying and failing at a task repeatedly, either because it doesn’t know how to do it or because it previously learned how to solve a problem but then forgot because the context window got compacted (more on that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/12/how-do-ai-coding-agents-work-we-look-under-the-hood/">here</a>).</p>

      </figcaption>

<p>To get around this, it helps to have the AI model take copious notes as it goes along about how it solved certain problems so that future instances of the agent can learn from them again. You also want to set ground rules in the claude.md file that the agent reads when it begins its session.</p>
<p>This brittleness means that coding agents are almost frighteningly good at what they’ve been trained and fine-tuned on—modern programming languages, JavaScript, HTML, and similar well-represented technologies—and generally terrible at tasks on which they have not been deeply trained, such as 6502 Assembly or programming an Atari 800 game with authentic-looking character graphics.</p>
<p>It took me five minutes to make a nice HTML5 demo with Claude but a week of torturous trial and error, plus actual systematic design on my part, to make a similar demo of an Atari 800 game. To do so, I had to use Claude Code to invent several tools, like command-line emulators and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/04/mcp-the-new-usb-c-for-ai-thats-bringing-fierce-rivals-together/">MCP servers</a>, that allow it to peek into the operation of the Atari 800’s memory and chipset to even begin to make it happen.</p>

<h2>3. True novelty can be an uphill battle</h2>
<p>Due to what might poetically be called “preconceived notions” baked into a coding model’s neural network (more technically, statistical semantic associations), it can be difficult to get AI agents to create truly novel things, even if you carefully spell out what you want.</p>
<p>For example, I spent four days trying to get Claude Code to create an Atari 800 version of my HTML game <a href="https://bxfoundry.com/violentcheckers/"><em>Violent Checkers</em></a>, but it had trouble because in the game’s design, the squares on the checkerboard don’t matter beyond their starting positions. No matter how many times I told the agent (and made notes in my Claude project files), it would come back to trying to center the pieces to the squares, snap them within squares, or use the squares as a logical basis of the game’s calculations when they should really just form a background image.</p>
<p>To get around this in the Atari 800 version, I started over and told Claude that I was creating a game with a UFO (instead of a circular checker piece) flying over a field of adjacent squares—never once mentioning the words “checker,” “checkerboard,” or “checkers.” With that approach, I got the results I wanted.</p>

<p>Why does this matter? Because with LLMs, context is everything, and in language, context changes meaning. Take the word “bank” and add the words “river” or “central” in front of it, and see how the meaning changes. In a way, words act as addresses that <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2024/large-language-models-use-surprisingly-simple-mechanism-retrieve-stored-knowledge-0325">unlock</a> the semantic relationships encoded in a neural network. So if you put “checkerboard” and “game” in the context, the model’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_(machine_learning)">self-attention process</a> links up a massive web of semantic associations about how checkers games should work, and that semantic baggage throws things off.</p>

<p>A couple of tricks can help AI coders navigate around these limitations. First, avoid contaminating the context with irrelevant information. Second, when the agent gets stuck, try this prompt: “What information do you need that would let you implement this perfectly right now? What tools are available to you that you could use to discover that information systematically without guessing?” This forces the agent to identify (semantically link up) its own knowledge gaps, spelled out in the context window and subject to future action, instead of flailing around blindly.</p>

<h2>4. The 90 percent problem</h2>
<p>The first 90 percent of an AI coding project comes in fast and amazes you. The last 10 percent involves tediously filling in the details through back-and-forth trial-and-error conversation with the agent. Tasks that require deeper insight or understanding than what the agent can provide still require humans to make the connections and guide it in the right direction. The limitations we discussed above can also cause your project to hit a brick wall.</p>
<p>From what I have observed over the years, larger LLMs can potentially make deeper contextual connections than smaller ones. They have <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/07/1130795/what-even-is-a-parameter/">more parameters</a> (encoded data points), and those parameters are linked in more multidimensional ways, so they tend to have a deeper map of semantic relationships. As deep as those go, it seems that human brains still have an even deeper grasp of semantic connections and can make wild semantic jumps that LLMs tend not to.</p>
<p>Creativity, in this sense, may be when you jump from, say, basketball to how bubbles form in soap film and somehow make a useful connection that leads to a breakthrough. Instead, LLMs tend to follow conventional semantic paths that are more conservative and entirely guided by mapped-out relationships from the training data. That limits their creative potential unless the prompter unlocks it by guiding the LLM to make novel semantic connections. That takes skill and creativity on the part of the operator, which once again shows the role of LLMs as tools used by humans rather than independent thinking machines.</p>
<h2>5. Feature creep becomes irresistible</h2>
<p>While creating software with AI coding tools, the joy of experiencing novelty makes you want to keep adding interesting new features rather than fixing bugs or perfecting existing systems. And Claude (or Codex) is happy to oblige, churning away at new ideas that are easy to sketch out in a quick and pleasing demo (the 90 percent problem again) rather than polishing the code.</p>

<p>Fixing bugs can also create bugs elsewhere. This is not new to coding agents—it’s a time-honored problem in software development. But agents supercharge this phenomenon because they can barrel through your code and make sweeping changes in pursuit of narrow-minded goals that affect lots of working systems. We’ve already talked about the importance of having a good architecture guided by the human mind behind the wheel above, and that comes into play here.</p>

<h2>6. AGI is not here yet</h2>
<p>Given the limitations I’ve described above, it’s very clear that an AI model with general intelligence—what people usually call <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/07/agi-may-be-impossible-to-define-and-thats-a-multibillion-dollar-problem/">artificial general intelligence</a> (AGI)—is still not here. AGI would hypothetically be able to navigate around baked-in stereotype associations and not have to rely on explicit training or fine-tuning on many examples to get things right. AI companies will probably need a different architecture in the future.</p>
<p>I’m speculating, but AGI would likely need to learn permanently on the fly—as in modify its own neural network weights—instead of relying on what is called “<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00234">in-context learning</a>,” which only persists until the context fills up and gets compacted or wiped out.</p>

<p>In other words, you could teach a true AGI system how to do something by explanation or let it learn by doing, noting successes, and having those lessons permanently stick, no matter what is in the context window. Today’s coding agents can’t do that—they forget lessons from earlier in a long session or between sessions unless you manually document everything for them. My favorite trick is instructing them to write a long, detailed report on what happened when a bug is fixed. That way, you can point to the hard-earned solution the next time the amnestic AI model makes the same mistake.</p>
<h2>7. Even fast isn’t fast enough</h2>
<p>While using Claude Code for a while, it’s easy to take for granted that you suddenly have the power to create software without knowing certain programming languages. This is amazing at first, but you can quickly become frustrated that what is conventionally a very fast development process isn’t fast enough. Impatience at the coding machine sets in, and you start wanting more.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>But even if you do know the programming languages being used, you don’t get a free pass. You still need to make key decisions about how the project will unfold. And when the agent gets stuck or makes a mess of things, your programming knowledge becomes essential for diagnosing what went wrong and steering it back on course.</p>
<h2>8. People may become busier than ever</h2>
<p>After guiding way too many hobby projects through Claude Code over the past two months, I’m starting to think that most people won’t become unemployed due to AI—they will become busier than ever. Power tools allow more work to be done in less time, and the economy will demand more productivity to match.</p>
<p>It’s almost too easy to make new software, in fact, and that can be exhausting. One project idea would lead to another, and I was soon spending eight hours a day during my winter vacation shepherding about 15 Claude Code projects at once. That’s too much split attention for good results, but the novelty of seeing my ideas come to life was addictive. In addition to the game ideas I’ve mentioned here, I made tools that scrape and search my past articles, a graphical MUD based on ZZT, a new type of <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/661428/text-based-vr-explore-the-pioneering-world-of-mushes/">MUSH</a> (text game) that uses AI-generated rooms, a new type of <a href="https://github.com/benj-edwards/ascii-processing-unit">Telnet display proxy</a>, and a Claude Code client for the Apple II (more on that soon). I also put two AI-enabled emulators for <a href="https://github.com/benj-edwards/bobbin">Apple II</a> and <a href="https://github.com/benj-edwards/atari800-ai">Atari 800</a>&nbsp;on GitHub. Phew.</p>
<p>Consider the advent of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_shovel">steam shovel</a>, which allowed humans to dig holes faster than a team using hand shovels. It made existing projects faster and new projects possible. But think about the human operator of the steam shovel. Suddenly, we had a tireless tool that could work 24 hours a day if fueled up and maintained properly, while the human piloting it would need to eat, sleep, and rest.</p>

<p>In fact, we may end up needing new protections for human knowledge workers using these tireless information engines to implement their ideas, much as unions rose as a response to industrial production lines over 100 years ago. Humans need rest, even when machines don’t.</p>
<p>Will an AI system ever replace the human role here? Even if AI coding agents could eventually work fully autonomously, I don’t think they’ll replace humans entirely because there will still be people who want to get things done, and new AI power tools will emerge to help them do it.</p>
<h2>9. Fast is scary to people</h2>
<p>AI coding tools can turn what was once a year-long personal project into a five-minute session. I fed Claude Code a photo of a two-player Tetris game I sketched in a notebook back in 2008, and it produced a <a href="https://bxfoundry.com/tetris2p/">working prototype</a> in minutes (prompt: “create a fully-featured web game with sound effects based on this diagram”). That’s wild, and even though the results are imperfect, it’s a bit frightening to comprehend what kind of sea change in software development this might entail.</p>
<p>Since early December, I’ve been <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/benjedwards.com/post/3ma2pvxl6ws2n">posting</a> some of my more amusing experimental AI-coded projects to Bluesky for people to try out, but I discovered I needed to deliberately slow down with updates because they came too fast for people to absorb (and too fast for me to fully test). I’ve also received comments like “I’m worried you’re using AI, you’re making games too fast” and so on.</p>

<p>Regardless of my own habits, the flow of new software will not slow down. There will soon be a seemingly endless supply of AI-augmented media (games, movies, images, books), and that’s a problem we’ll have to figure out how to deal with. These products won’t all be “AI slop,” either; some will be done very well, and the acceleration in production times due to these new power tools will balloon the quantity beyond anything we’ve seen.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p>Social media tends to prime people to believe that AI is all good or all bad, but that kind of black-and-white thinking may be the easy way out. You’ll have no cognitive dissonance, but you’ll miss a far richer third option: seeing these tools as imperfect and deserving of critique but also as useful and empowering when they bring your ideas to life.</p>
<p>AI agents should be considered tools, not entities or employees, and they should be amplifiers of human ideas. My game-in-progress <a href="https://bxfoundry.com/cardminer/"><em>Card Miner</em></a> is entirely my own high-level creative design work, but the AI model handled the low-level code. I am still proud of it as an expression of my personal ideas, and it would not exist without AI coding agents.</p>
<h2>10. These tools aren’t going away</h2>
<p>For now, at least, coding agents remain very much tools in the hands of people who want to build things. The question is whether humans will learn to wield these new tools effectively to empower themselves. Based on two months of intensive experimentation, I’d say the answer is a qualified yes, with plenty of caveats.</p>
<p>We also have social issues to face: Professional developers already use these tools, and with the prevailing stigma against AI tools in some online communities, many software developers and the platforms that host their work will face difficult decisions.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I don’t think AI tools will make human software designers obsolete. Instead, they may well help those designers become more capable. This isn’t new, of course; tools of every kind have been serving this role since long before the dawn of recorded history. The best tools amplify human capability while keeping a person behind the wheel. The 3D printer analogy holds: amazing fast results are possible, but mastery still takes time, skill, and a lot of patience with the machine.</p>
