<figure><a title="Photo Mode Mario Kart World" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7a7165cabc459/photo-mode-mario-kart-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> is the biggest Mario Kart to date. The map is huge, with Easter Eggs and little secrets hiding under bridges, atop towering buildings, and in the middle of sprawling oceans. Knockout Tour is the most chaotic concoction of multiplayer I've ever seen. And I'm still knee-deep in unlocking characters (darn, Kamek...).</p>
<p>And yet, here I am to talk about photo mode. <em>Bloody</em> photo mode, you're probably thinking. A modern-day video game checkbox. Probably 60% of games have a photo mode nowadays, either at launch or patched in at a later date. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild">Breath of the Wild</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_scarlet_and_violet">Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_smash_bros_ultimate">Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</a> are just a few Nintendo first-party games that have some way of taking expressive pics of your characters.</p>
<p>But, news flash, I love it in Mario Kart World more than any of those other games.</p>
<figure><a title="Photo Mode Mario Kart World" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/bb7ab61f2bbb7/photo-mode-mario-kart-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Look, see, a <em>real</em> newsflash! — <em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Having spent a <em>lot</em> of time with Mario Kart World over the past couple weeks, and absolutely loving it, it's not the deeper mechanics, the chaotic racing, or the chillness of exploring the open world that have really stuck with me. It's how loud and expressive it lets you be, both in and out of the game. I touched on it <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">in my review</a> in terms of the animations and visuals, but I think this applies across everything, particularly photo mode.</p>
<p>Since <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_bros_wonder">Super Mario Bros. Wonder</a>, Nintendo seems to have given Mario a new lease of life. Remakes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_rpg">Super Mario RPG</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/paper_mario_the_thousand-year_door">Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</a>, and a new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_and_luigi_brothership">Mario &amp; Luigi</a> entry are indicative of that (Odyssey also just about fits the bill). These games represent Mario, Luigi, and a whole host of other characters, old and new, at their most colourful, their most jovial, and their most <em>stupid</em> in the best way possible.</p>

<p>Mario Kart World carries that torch but in an entirely new setting — not a 2D platformer or turn-based RPG, not even with any dialogue. This is a kart racer with over 100 costumes, multiple biomes, and 50 different characters ranging from classics like Peach and Wario to the stupidest of choices, like the Cow, Cataquack, and Peepa. I can drive around as <em>Peepa</em> from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/super_mario_3d_land">Super Mario 3D Land</a>.</p>
<p>Photo mode, to me, is an extension of the daft playfulness that's alive and well in the Mushroom Kingdom right now. It goes beyond just being an easy, fun way of sharing screenshots online or with friends. As with the best photo modes, it's about expressing yourself and the moment.</p>

<p>Maybe I'm way too deep into this, but a lot goes into a Mario Kart World photo. Which character would suit which location? What about the kart? Or a bike? Which costume? Do I want other racers in the shot? Enemies? Which pose looks best? What mood do I want to convey? Do I use a frame?</p>
<p>I'm not a professional photographer — please don't ask me to take good photos of any animal that isn't my cat — but when it comes to these kinds of shots, with this variety of characters? I'm all in.</p>
<p>Let's take Yoshi in his Biker outfit, for example. He <em>has</em> to be in the W-Twin Chopper (nothing else goes with those shades), and we need somewhere either suitably muddy <em>or</em> very cool to look effortless. So, off to Choco Mountain I went, driving around, looking for the best spots to frame my photo.</p>
<p>The muddy chocolate makes things a little tougher around here; you'll drown if you stay in it too long, and item boxes weren't giving me Mushrooms so I could zip over the little pools. But then a Feather and a curved wall gave me the chance to do something that looks easy as hell, but really isn't. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/mario-kart-world-how-to-wall-ride">Wall riding</a>...</p>
<figure><a title="Photo Mode Mario Kart World" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/43375c8436a0d/photo-mode-mario-kart-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Et voilà! Something that conveys a very cute character, looking very cool in the moment, with shades, a leather jacket, and a very suitable vehicle.</p>
<p>Or, you know, sometimes I just get really stupid ideas and decide to put Bowser, in a similar biker outfit, in Lil' Dumpy. As soon as I unlocked the costume for the king of Koopas, I knew immediately I was going to do something ridiculous with it. And, there you have it:</p>
<figure><a title="Photo Mode Mario Kart World" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a911293fce4e8/photo-mode-mario-kart-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>I don't always use frames, but when I do... — <em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>In a franchise with over 40 years of history behind it, Mario has done a <em>lot</em> of things, and that also gives me a chance to relive, and re-experiment, with those moments. One of my favourite shots was a complete coincidence as I was driving around collecting P Switches in the snowy regions of Free Roam.</p>
<p>I went off-road after driving down from Starview Peak, hoping to find a big, blue button to bash my head against multiple times. But what I got instead was a goldmine: A group of penguins gathered around an oil drum.</p>
<p>Nintendo references Mario's hatred of penguins <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/mq4uCJDwO9U?si=ZRWLAc_HKVcnb8Y4&amp;t=726">in the Mario Kart World Direct</a> (we've all thrown the penguin off of Cool, Cool Mountain in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/super_mario_64">Super Mario 64</a>, right?), but what if the penguin wanted to take revenge? Luckily, penguin just happens to be a character in Mario Kart World, and in my eyes, he craves <em>violence</em>.</p>
<figure><a title="Photo Mode Mario Kart World" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/51fd5573ded2f/photo-mode-mario-kart-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Beyond the sheer expressiveness of the game and the vastness of the world, the moment-to-moment action is just so easy to snapshot, and because every single moment can cause complete chaos, there are so many chances to put characters in danger for the sheer sake of art.</p>
<p>This makes me sound bad, doesn't it? I'm sure if Mario and friends were real, they'd hate me for putting them in perilous situations. But they're not all life-threatening; firing Daisy out of barrel cannons on the bridge between Faraway Oasis and Crown City is just kind of delightful, and getting into a heated contest with your brother brings out the drama.</p>

<p>The possibilities are endless, and all of that hooting and hollering while you're racing — groaning from being hit by a Blue Shell or cheering as you knock your best friend off the course and push them down 10 places in an instant — can be <em>captured</em> in an instant.</p>
<p>Plus, we can finally find out what happens when a Cataquack encounters another Cataquack:</p>
<figure><a title="Photo Mode Mario Kart World" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/597826d37dddb/photo-mode-mario-kart-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Of course, Knockout Tour is still my favourite thing about this game, and in those moments where I'm scrambling to make it into the top 16, or top 8, or simply just aim to win, I forget all about taking snapshots because I'm on the edge of my seat.</p>
<p>But when I do want to channel my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iain_Macmillan">Iain Macmillan</a> or <a href="https://www.kymillman.com/photography/formula-1/?srsltid=AfmBOoojdRYkIwFQ2bUpN7gdY_TmHRD08qkIuwYam7MZ0JfTlNyISzbx">Kym Illman</a>, Mario Kart World lets me capture the action, the calm, the fun, and the drama, with aplomb. May Mario and friends <em>always</em> feel this alive and expressive. I can't wait to mess around with it in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, too.</p>
<p>Or, you know, I could just admire the food. I <em>need</em> those Boo Buns in my life.</p>

<h3>The Nintendo Life Mario Kart World Photo Gallery</h3>
<p>As a little bonus, I thought it would be fun to round up a few shots from the NL Crew of their Mario Kart World escapades.</p>
<p>First up is reviewer extraordinaire PJ, who's making sure Mario gets some exercise in while riding along the high roads. Good for him! Love the little Baby Blooper, too — one of my favourite four-wheel vehicles in the game</p>

<p>Okay, next is a DK pic from our esteemed editor Gavin. Oh, uh, erm...no! Stop. Oh god... it's a photo of the popular Nintendo character Donkey Kong, as supplied by Gavin, you dirty people. There's some Waluigi here too, so you can keep your minds out of the gutter.</p>
<p>Anyway, <em>buns</em>. We like buns, right?</p>

<p>Following on from <em>that</em> fiasco, we have my trusty P Switch comrade Jim; he's taken a shine to the lovely little Monty Mole. Simple, effective, adorable — and look, there's even <em>another</em> Monty! Thanks, Moo Moo Meadows!</p>

<p>Last, but absolutely not least, Ollie has caught Baby Mario in the act — how on earth did he manage to get the biggest ice cream?? Also, thanks Ollie for reminding me that bees can be dangerous. Good for nature, not good for... crabs?</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/techland-would-love-to-bring-dying-light-the-beast-to-the-nintendo-switch-2.1223304/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/techland-would-love-to-bring-dying-light-the-beast-to-the-nintendo-switch-2/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During our <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-impressions-and-qa-from-sgf-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Summer Game Fest 2025 interview with Tymon Smektała</a>, we asked the Techland Dying Light Franchise Director whether there were any plans to bring Dying Light: The Beast to the Nintendo Switch 2 console. Without promising anything, Smektała was very open about his desire to do it at some stage:</p>
<p><em>I would love this to happen at some point, but nothing to announce at this time.</em></p>
<p>On one hand, Techland's Director has detailed several technical improvements made to the C-Engine for Dying Light: The Beast:</p>
<p><em>We have also improved the visuals a lot. Our in-house C-Engine engine went through a number of iterations. Now, all the weather effects, the rendering of materials, lighting, shadows, and how the sun moves in the sky. All of those things are on a completely different level compared to Dying Light 2: Stay Human.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>On the other hand, the game is one of the very few to be still targeting a launch on old-generation consoles (PlayStation 4 and Xbox One) in 2025. As such, there's little doubt that the Nintendo Switch 2 could run the game in terms of raw power. It's rather a matter of opportunity, then. With the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-debuts-with-3-5-million-units-sold-in-4-days/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launch sales</a> it's had so far, it would seem like a no-brainer to bring a game to Nintendo's console, but that doesn't mean it would be easy for the Polish developer.</p>
<p>The first Dying Light only launched on the Switch six and a half years after the game's original debut in 2015. It took the opportunity to gather all DLCs into a <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-platinum-edition-leaked-due-on-thursday-may-27th/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Platinum Edition</a> that launched everywhere and added the Switch version. Whether Techland plans to do the same for this 'unofficial third game' remains to be seen.</p>
<p>As a reminder, Dying Light 2: Stay Human was announced to be coming to the original Nintendo Switch through a cloud version that, however, never materialized.</p>

            <p>
Space <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stellaris">Stellaris</a> has received another update jam-packed with the kind of systemic adjustments that, were you to shout them through your bedroom door at your mum, would cause her to smile shakily, then go downstairs and sob into a tea towel at the knowledge that her treasured child, her brightest and best, will never amount to anything useful, for they are too busy obsessing over ringworlds and genesis arks and xeno-compatibility. 
</p>
<p>
Mum! MUM. I've just heard that "Storm Aftermath events will no longer happen in systems where you are constructing megastructures"! Even better, "Evolutionary Predator Empires can now once more gain and keep the Psionic Ephase trait"! Christmas has come early, mum! The eagle has landed! MOTHER, LOOK AT ME. I will not be denied.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
The Storm Aftermath-fixing update in question, Stellaris patch 4.0.21, accompanies <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/281990/view/502828352450592822?l=english">a cautionary note from game director Stephen "Eladrin" Muray</a>, who says that developers Paradox Interactive are planning to slow down the rate of Stellaris patching in the wake of the game's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-date-stellaris-40-a-phoenix-update-to-attract-new-players-and-improve-performance">4.0 update</a>, because they keep accidentally lighting whole planets on fire. It turns out the old Zuck mantra "move fast and break things" only gets you so far when you're troubleshooting galaxies.
</p>
<p>
"We've released a tremendous number of patches since then at a rapid rate - but our patch cadence has become problematic (and even counterproductive) in some ways," Muray writes. "Too often in game development, fixing one bug introduces another - and I haven't been giving our internal QA testers enough time to fully vet and test the changes we've been making. 
</p>
<p>
"Examples from recent patches include a few weeks ago when an unrelated fix to a pop issue caused Wilderness empires to seemingly randomly destroy themselves by killing all of their biomass, or when another fix just after that caused save games to corrupt and become unloadable," he goes on.
</p>
<p>
Paradox remain "committed" to patching Stellaris, which has sunk to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/281990/Stellaris/">a Mixed Steam user review consensus</a> following the release of the apparently cataclysmic 4.0 update, but they'll be "taking a more measured and deliberate approach to allow internal testing to catch up while giving you a more stable environment to play the game in". 
</p>
<p>
Specifically, they're shifting the emphasis to open betas that bring together QA work and player feedback more organically - the first of these will be updated "on a weekly to fortnightly basis depending on internal progress throughout the summer", with "the next 4.0.x live release" due sometime in August. Muray suggests that modders who "have been waiting for a moment of stability" take advantage of the shortage of major changes during that period.
</p>
<p>
As for what exactly they'll be patching next, please summon your mother back upstairs, for it is once again time to defeat and confuse her with the kind of preposterous sci-fantasy jargon she never ever imagined her darling baby would ever learn, back when you were just a wee tyke nuzzling at the nipple.
</p>
<p>
"I'm personally currently looking at ways to improve the AI's behavior," Muray continues. "Other things currently in active development are OOS investigations, a number of strata issues that affect slavery, purging, and other oddities among pop employment, and more of a design change rather than a bugfix - based on your feedback we're looking at having newly grown pops go straight into the Civilian stratum or its appropriate equivalent instead of being unemployed members of their parent pop group. 
</p>
<p>
"While we liked the verisimilitude of top-heavy planets having more stability issues than ones that were more evenly developed, we acknowledge that having a persistent trickle of unemployed pops feels wrong," Muray continues.</p>
<p>Did you hear that, mum? He took the words right out of my mouth. Mother, will you stop weeping and fetch me my abacus so I can calculate the performance losses from the bug "where every empire was calculating their Biomass total far too often". No, I do not want to speak to the careers advisor again. Yes, I will be eating dinner in my room this evening.

			<p>Bandai Namco has announced it will host a Little Nightmares Showcase for next week on <strong>June 24, 2025, at 12pm PST / 5pm EST / 8pm BST</strong>.</p>
<p>The news was announced with a short post to the <a href="https://x.com/LittleNights/status/1935729464823976221">Little Nightmares III official X account</a>, with a short video clip showing the date and time of the showcase and the caption "<em>Something unsettling is coming. It's closer than you think. Are you ready to face it, little ones?</em>"</p>
<p>That's all Bandai shared about the showcase, though we can infer that it'll include good deal of information on the next entry in the Little Nightmares series, Little Nightmares III, which is still without an official release date after it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/little-nightmares-iii-gets-delayed-to-2025/">delayed last year</a> and pushed into 2025.</p>
<p>Though a release date hasn't been officially confirmed, a product listing for Little Nightmares III on Target (spotted by <a href="https://gameranx.com/updates/id/539541/article/little-nightmares-iii-release-date-potentially-leaked/">Gameranx</a>) has the release date set for September 15, 2025. We'll find out next week if that leak was correct.</p>
<p>It'll also be interesting to see more of Little Nightmares III, as this is the first game in the series that isn't being developed by the series creators at Tarsier Studios. Supermassive Games has taken over the series, and while the initial clips and previews suggest that it'll stay very close to the kind of game Tarsier already established, Supermassive will undoubtedly bring their own flair to the games in some way.</p>
<p>When <a href="https://wccftech.com/little-nightmares-iii-gamescom-hand-on-preview-surviving-together/">Wccftech's Francesco De Meo previewed the game at Gamescom 2024,</a> he wrote that from the top of the demo, "<em>there was no doubt that I was playing a Little Nightmares game. Everything was in the right place: the characters, the atmosphere, the tone, and the gameplay</em>."</p>
<p>So far, some of the key differences seem to be that the characters in Little Nightmares III can use a series of weapons, but no doubt, there are more changes yet to be revealed, even if it's all staying close to what we all know to be a Little Nightmares game.</p>

Videos of the fights show the empowered Adel zipping aruond the field, creating massive storms, and generally wiping the floor with entire trios of players in short order.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While you can tackle the Everdark Sovereign solo, or with friends and/or strangers, it seems like the new fight is truly adding some challenge, even for those who have been putting a lot of hours into Elden Ring Nightreign. To me, it's reminiscent of Monster Hunter's upgraded fights that get added post-launch, like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-wilds/How_to_Beat_Arch-Tempered_Rey_Dau">Tempered versions of monsters</a>, that seem meant to add extra challenge as players' knowledge and power rises exponentially over time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What's the reward for felling an Everdark Sovereign? Well, a brand-new shop located in the hub area will let you spend all the Sovereign Sigils you'll earn from a clear, and even this shop is a pretty exciting update. Alongside offering special Relics and other items, the Sigils allow playes to change the Roundtable Hold's lighting, acquire the currently available skins, and set shifting earth statuses. The latter has been a major request from the community, and it's great to see it addressed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So while the patch notes for 1.01.3 were fairly unassuming at first, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1lf09p1/this_update_fixed_the_game/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">players now seem to feel like this is a huge update</a>. The roll-out of enhanced bosses has already brought some new life and challenge back to Nightreign, and the promise of more to come is enticing, as are the new short-term pursuits to chase after.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bandai Namco is also teasing this as the start of something: "This is only the beginning of the Everdark Sovereign cycle. As the power of the Night ebbs and wanes, the Sovereigns will soon return to the abyss they came from." We already know Elden Ring Nightreign is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-will-get-dlc-bosses-and-characters-according-to-steam-page-slip-up">due to get full updates</a> down the road, so if this is an early indication of what we can expect, the long-term prospects for FromSoft's new co-op survival action game seem good.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve got plenty of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Essential_Tips_and_Tricks"><u>Nightreign tips and tricks</u></a> to help you take down <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Nightlord_Boss_Guides"><u>all the eight Nightlord Bosses</u></a>, and if you’re wondering how to unlock the two locked <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Nightfarers_-_List_of_Character_Classes"><u>Nightfarer Classes</u></a>, check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Unlock_the_Revenant"><u>How to Unlock the Revenant</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Unlock_the_Duchess"><u>How to Unlock the Duchess</u></a>, plus <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Change_Characters"><u>How to Change Characters</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a> community is torn right now. In the Deep Desert, roaming hordes of orniphopters (the Dune equivilent of a plane or helicopter) are dominating the end game and making an already dangerous area even more perilous. The thing is, I don't think this is a bad thing. In fact, I think it's good for the game in the long run.</p>
<p>For those who aren't familiar, the Deep Desert is a no-holds-barred open world PvP area that makes up the majority of Dune: Awakening's end game. It's a vast, mostly barren, landscape where the best materials can be found. It's also a place where any player can kill you and snatch any money or materials you have on you.</p>
<p>So the stakes are high. At the moment, the Deep Desert is being patrolled by Assault Orniphopters. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-pvp-is-being-dominated-by-one-busted-technique-crushing-people-with-helicopters">They may not be able to crush you to death anymore</a>, but they're still armed with missiles, allowing pilots to shoot down other orniphopters with relative ease. One can be evaded easily enough, but when eight of them fly towards you, you're done for.</p>

<p>As you can imagine, there are numerous complaints about these flocks of orniphopters dotted around social media and Dune: Awakening community hubs. Take <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1lcojf7/to_the_surprise_of_nobody/">this Reddit post</a> conveying the sadness tied to the Deep Desert compared to Hagga Basin. Or this one, in which user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1ld7yi5/what_we_really_need_for_the_deep_desert/">nowheels64</a> makes a plea for the lock-on missile launchers that appear in the recent Dune movies. The frustration <em>is</em> real. It's palpable.</p>
<p>Those annoyed by the Deep Desert all have valid opinions. It is undoubtedly frustrating when you're on your own, mining materials, and get blown to pieces from some unseen threat on high. Losing all your things is a bummer, there's no two ways about it.</p>
<p>But I'm going to make an argument that the scurge of orniphopters isn't <em>inherently</em> a bad thing for the Dune: Awakening end game. The Deep Desert, the Landsraad - it's all about collaboration with your fellows within the faction you have chosen. Player guilds are attached by the hip to the Landsraad, and objectives assigned each week are so lofty as to practically require group effort. Could one person theoretically farm up 1,000 Adept swords and hand them in on their own? Sure. Is that the intention? Obviously not.</p>
<p>So where does this leave the player, fresh from Hagga Basin? Well, they're outnumbered and unable to make a real dent in the Landsraad. The only option is to join a guild, to dive headfirst into the social pool of a very community-focused end game.</p>
<p>Dune: Awakening doesn't force you to do this, to be a social animal, but it's so obviously the point that the only other thing Funcom could do to emphasise it further is to build a big neon sign that says "join a guild" in the small PvE slice of the Deep Desert.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>Flying out alone, like this, is perilous. That's kind of the point! | <span>Image credit: <cite>Eurogamer</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I appreciate that this isn't everyone's bag. In fact, history has taught us it's not the majority of people's preferred way to play. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/throne-and-liberty">Throne and Liberty</a> lost a lot of players who didn't want to touch the guild zone control mechanics, no matter how cool sieges looked. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/darkfall-online">Dark Fall Online</a> was incredibly PvP focused, and incredibly niche as a result. In <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/world-of-warcraft">World of Warcraft</a>, if you do a War Mode world quest and see another player PvP tagged, a lot of folks will just /wave and go on with their business.</p>
<p>But with a game like Dune: Awakening, the conflict between the factions is so integral to the mechanics, and even the narrative. You're on Arrakis during the war of assassins, Landsraad bonuses are faction-wide. It's Atreides vs Harkonnen baby, all the way down into the mud. To shy away from that would be to separate from the source material in a way I'm not convinced Funcom wants to do.</p>
<p>I'm not going to sit here and tell people they're playing the game wrong: you play the game you pay for however you want. There's nothing wrong with popping back to Dune: Awakening when a new faction or major story update happens. But in terms of the Deep Desert, I hope this spirit of danger remains. It can be aggravating, yet it's also a necessary force to push players into the wider faction conflict. And isn't that what Dune is really all about?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWRt-PiOzlI">Digital Foundry</a> has presented its tech review for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_scarlet_and_violet">Pokémon Scarlet and Violet</a> on the Switch 2, with the latest generation receiving a pretty substantial performance update for Nintendo's newest console.</p>
<p>All things considered, it seems that this has proven to be a pretty positive outcome for the games (though one that, in this writer's opinion, arrived far too late), with visual quality and frame rates receiving significant boosts.</p>
<p>To start off, the games' visuals are much cleaner than before and, according to DF, "hold up well on a 4K television set". Shimmering has more or less been eliminated, with a solid 1080p internal resolution at play. Though not definitively confirmed, it's speculated that the game is likely making use of Nvidia's DLSS technology to boost the visuals slightly.</p><p><figure data-videoid="-mwkAYKvypQ" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-mwkAYKvypQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mwkAYKvypQ"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>823k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mwkAYKvypQ">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>Frame rate is also a huge improvement, running at a decent 60fps for the most part. There are some dips here and there – particularly during busy scenes – but it's a night and day difference when compared to the sub-30fps you would expect to see on the Switch 1.</p>
<p>Similarly, distant characters and objects now move in full animation sequences, rather than the weird, jittering animation seen on Switch 1. This can be applied to trainers walking in the open world and even the infamous windmill, which now runs smoothly at far distances. Loading times are also much better, with fast travel now taking on average between 3 and 4 seconds each time, whereas you could be looking at anything up to 15 seconds on the Switch 1.</p>
<p>A few areas haven't been touched, though. Draw distances are largely the same across both consoles, while pop in is also still a bit of an issue on the Switch 2. The Pokémon still aren't persistent either, so if you happen to leave a specific area, the same Pokémon you saw previously won't remain there upon return. Keep an eye out for those shinies.</p>
<p>Overall though, it's a much-needed improvement, and actually makes playing Scarlet and Violet quite a pleasurable experience when compared to the Switch 1. It still looks kinda rough, of course, with blocky textures and bland environments, but performance-wise, this is very welcome, indeed.</p>

			<p>There's now two Death Stranding film adaptations in the works. The first is the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-death-stranding-movie-has-found-a-writer-and-director-in-a-quiet-place-day-ones-michael-sarnoski/">A24 movie with Michael Sarnoski directing</a>, and the second is a newly announced animated film being made by animation studio Line Mileage in collaboration with Kojima Productions, with Raised by Wolves creator Aaron Guzikowski signed on to write the script.</p>
<p><a href="https://deadline.com/2025/06/death-stranding-animated-adaptation-aaron-guzikowski-writer-1236436519/">Deadline</a> reports that the film will be a more mature-focused animated feature, and will center a new story in the Death Stranding universe that has not been explored in the games.</p>
<p>"<em>I love the world of Death Stranding,</em>" Guzikowski said in a statement to Deadline. "<em>It's so creatively freeing, so beautifully dark and yet hopeful; I'm so excited and honored that Hideo Kojima, whose work I've long admired, has invited me to dwell within his creation, to birth new stories into this fertile, mind-bending universe. Drawing and animation have always been near and dear to my heart, so to finally get to play in this space is a dream come true</em>."</p>
<p>Line Mileage's chief creative officer, Daniel Dominguez added "<em>As an avid gamer I can say, unequivocally, Death Stranding is the most cinematic, thought-provoking video game I have ever played. Playing it gave me the same emotional rush, visceral punch, and intellectual pleasure I had the first time I watched Blade Runner, or Ghost in the Shell. Adapting it into a form it so naturally evokes is an honor. And for Aaron Guzikowski to lend his talents, whose authorial mind and creative energy humble me...needless to say, this project is a dream come true</em>."</p>
<p>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach is due a week from this current time of writing, and now with two movie adaptations in the works, it's clear we'll be hearing about this series for a long time to come. Whether that's in a good or bad way remains to be seen with how the next game and these subsequent adaptations do.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://wccftech.com/hideo-kojima-changed-death-stranding-2-wasn-t-polarizing-enough/">recent interview with Rolling Stone,</a> co-composer for Death Stranding 2, Woodkid, revealed that Hideo Kojima's reactions to players being extremely positive about how the game was shaping up in early playtests were to change it and make it more polarizing. Kojima wasn't satisfied with positive responses across the board, he wanted to see more people react differently than just delivering full praise.</p>
<p>It's still unclear how deeply involved Kojima will be in both the A24 live-action adaptation and Line Mileage's animated adaptation, but the litmus test for both, as to how well they work as adaptations of a Hideo Kojima game, will undoubtedly be how differently people react to the narrative in each film.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a> developers Funcom have revealed in a post-launch Reddit AMA that they're currently aiming to release a fresh update full of quality of life-related tweaks in early July, as well as adding "new contracts across the board" down the line.</p>
<p>However, if you're after big new stuff to do, you'll have to wait for the major updates that'll be releasing alongside the game's DLCs.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"We have an update in testing that contains a lot of quality of life updates, which we are aiming to release in early July," DA executive producer Scott Junior wrote <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1lehj35/official_dune_awakening_launch_ama_with_funcom/">in response</a> to a question about Funcom's immediate future plans, "When we get closer to it being publicly testable we will release the full patch notes. It contains too many changes for me to list here, but you'll be seeing it soon!"</p>
<p>If I had to guess, I'd say there's a chance that update includes simple base building tweaks folks have been begging for, such as storage containers and vehicles you can name, as well as the option to deposit all of their water with one button press. All of those were confirmed as being in the works at different points in the thread.  </p>
<p>Meanwhile, in terms of bigger additions to the game, Junior explained: "each of our major updates will always continue new story content and new PvE content, which will release at the same time as our DLCs come out. Our goal is to have these release every 3/4 months."</p>
<p>In terms of what the developer's plans are to tweak PvP, which has <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/survival/dune-awakening-devs-promise-a-bunch-of-changes-as-the-survival-mmos-pvp-and-endgame-content-come-under-fire-over-loot-balance-concerns-and-more-total-mess/">come under fire</a> from players early doors, DA senior game director Viljar Sommerbakk wrote that the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dune-awakening-players-kept-getting-squashed-by-ornithopters-so-an-update-has-made-everyone-invulnerable-to-vehicle-bashing">scout ornithopter</a> won't be losing its rockets, with the devs instead instead aiming to make its performance vary depending on what gear you equip it with.</p>
<p>In line with that, specifically in terms of deep desert PvP, Sommerbakk said the devs are currently "formulating a plan" for changes based around three considerations. They want players to have to make "meaningful decisions" about their loadouts, the mode to feel "reliable, responsive, and clearly understood" moment to moment, and are fixing "issues with movement desyncs and rubber banding, as well as ability activation reliability".</p>
<p>One of the major things players asked about in the thread was the possibility of the game getting more contracts for PvE folks to work through on a weekly basis, rather than running out of stuff to do. "There are plans to add new contracts across the board," wrote DA creative director Joel Bylos, "In addition, the Landsraad itself is supposed to involve more contracts in order to reveal tasks for the Houses. As well as contracts that lead into the Deep Desert."</p>
<p>In terms of the Landsraad, the devs were also clear they've read feedback about issues like tasks locking early or being too tough for solo players, and plan to rectify those as well as making sure folks feel like its rewards are worth the work.</p>
<p>As for folks missing out on Landsraad tasks that are claimed not long after they're released, Bylos replied that Funcom's "current plan is to allow your contributions to stack week after week, so that small groups and solos can work towards larger rewards over time. And then adding more tiers of rewards as well as new activity drivers".</p>
<p>It's a lot of spicy stuff to be sure. Funcom definitely aren't shying away from the raging sandworms of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dune-awakening-review">player opinion</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Mike Klubnika's previous <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/buckshot-roulette">Buckshot Roulette</a> was a simple, harrowing game about aiming a shotgun at your very own face and praying for a click, not a bang, then challenging a manky git across the table to do likewise. The developer's forthcoming s.p.l.i.t, by contrast, looks like a squirming snakepit of moving parts that calls to mind both <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/duskers">Duskers</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/space-warlord-organ-trading-simulator">Space Warlord Organ Trading Simulator</a>.

In this "short psychological horror game", you are part of a team of hackers attempting to break into "an unethical superstructure". The whole thing appears to unfold in a small, grubby room full of crackling monitors, with despairing trees visible through a curtained window. Your job is to poke at a command prompt interface while bandying words with shadowy strangers over IRC. The below trailer is already giving me a migraine. I can feel my guts uncoiling in protest. How very glorious.

"The facility you and your crew infiltrate is a superstructure of unethical electronics," the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3684610/split/">Steam page</a> adds. "The daunting task is only made possible by careful planning, and vulnerabilities hidden deep below legacy code and engineering." Be warned that the game will contain depictions of self-harm and suicide. That noose in the picture seemingly isn't just for show.

<p>
Alice O, greatest of news editors, is a fan of Klubnika's work. "I really like how his games are small visits to unexplained terrible places," she <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/inscryption-meets-russian-roulette-in-this-weird-short-horror-game">wrote back in 2024</a>, shortly before she quit this stinking james gournalism business and, as legend tells, escaped to the mountains in a hamster-powered balloon.</p>
<p>I'm pretty sure s.p.l.i.t. will be similarly dense and anomalous, and as such, I'm prepared to forgive the Tom Clancy-ass title punctuation here. Perhaps the abbreviation stands for "Send Pizza Lest I Tunnel (Past Your Network Security)"? We'll find out when the game hits e-shelves on 24th July. If you'd rather play more Buckshot Roulette, know that it now has a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/buckshot-roulette-now-has-a-4-person-multiplayer-mode-which-im-sure-you-will-survive">four-person multiplayer mode</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Valve released a new Steam Client Beta today, and it's focused on adding accessibility options to Big Picture Mode on PCs and SteamOS on handheld PCs like the Lenovo Legion Go S and Steam Deck.</p><p>Specifically, it is adding a UI scaling option, toggles for high contrast mode and reduced motion, and additional screen reader and color filter settings. These options can now all be found in an Accessibility sub-menu that's now part of SteamOS and Big Picture Mode's settings menus. The image below shows off exactly what this new menu looks like. With these additions, Valve now recommends that Steam users who require features such as screen readers use Big Picture Mode instead of the standard Steam client.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1849/18498836/4517851-a042795ddde3e336612076287008ff9520af6575.png" data-ref-id="1300-4517851" data-ratio="0.70100143061516" data-width="1398" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1849/18498836/4517851-a042795ddde3e336612076287008ff9520af6575.png" data-ref-id="1300-4517851"></a><figcaption>The new SteamOS accessibility menu with options for UI scaling, high contrast mode, reduced motion, color filters, and scren reader settings.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1849/18498836/4517851-a042795ddde3e336612076287008ff9520af6575.png"></figure><p>SteamOS specifically will see particular benefits from the Screen Reader and Color Filter updates. For the Screen Reader, players will now be able to adjust its pitch, speed, and volume and consistently hear it read out each item being highlighted.

It is committing to improving accessbility options on Steam, teasing that "these new settings are only the first available of the accessibility features we're working on," <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements?snr=1_2108_9__2107" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in a blog post</a>.

              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>Blizzard recently blew the lid off <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft</a>'s upcoming 11.2 update, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-the-war-withins-ghosts-of-karesh-update-is-the-tbc-sequel-we-didnt-know-we-needed/1100-6532500/" data-ref-id="1100-6532500">Ghosts of K'aresh</a>, and players are now convinced a new specialization for Demon Hunters could be in the cards.</p><p dir="ltr">In the official Ghosts of K'aresh preview video, a moment around the two minutes and 38 second mark with three Demon Hunters sticks out. The Demon Hunter on the left looks to be Havoc (DPS) spec, while the one on the right, wearing bulkier armor, certainly looks like a stand-in for a Vengeance (tank) Demon Hunter. The third Demon Hunter, placed prominently in the middle of the screen, is decked out in Void-themed armor and wielding warglaives of distinct purple Void energy.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CE8zcDHcMA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2CE8zcDHcMA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The inclusion of a Void-powered Demon Hunter is certainly raising eyebrows, especially when combined with a datamined ability (via <a href="https://www.icy-veins.com/wow/news/did-blizzard-just-tease-a-new-demon-hunter-spec-nearly-a-decade-after-their-introduction/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Icy Veins</a>) from the upcoming 11.2 patch client literally labeled as "Demon Hunter Metamorphosis Void." That has led players to believe Blizzard is teasing a third Void-focused spec that could be coming soon.</p><p dir="ltr">It certainly seems possible that Demon Hunters will receive a new way to play either as part of Ghosts of K'aresh, in a subsequent patch, or with the arrival of the game's next Midnight expansion. It's worth noting the 11.2 update will introduce a new raid, Manaforge: Omega, which includes an encounter against a mysterious council of Void-powered Demon Hunters. With that in mind, it's easy to see how the game's existing Demon Hunters could find new power in the wake of defeating this council.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard isn't announcing anything at the moment, but it wouldn't be the first time a class has received a third specialization out of the blue. During Dragonflight, Blizzard added a third, unannounced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-dragonflight-new-augmentation-spec-is-a-first-for-blizzard-mmo-in-more-ways-than-one/1100-6515232/" data-ref-id="1100-6515232">specialization for Evokers called Augmentation</a> that had ties to the game's ongoing story, with a raid boss even using Augmentation spells like Ebon Might prior to the specialization being officially added. Demon Hunters are currently the only class in the game with just two specializations, so receiving a third one with ties to the game's current story would make complete sense.</p><p dir="ltr">For now, players will have to wait and see what Blizzard is cooking up, but there are still plenty of other features coming in Ghosts of K'aresh for players to be excited about. The update will serve as a surprising The Burning Crusade sequel, as players travel to the destroyed Ethereal homeworld to stop Dimensius, the largest boss in WoW history. In addition to a new zone, dungeon, and raid, players will earn an upgradeable artifact cloak that can be used to transform into an energy form in order to interact with the world in new ways. Ghosts of K'aresh will additionally add new asynchronous multiplayer features reminiscent of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-next-major-update-will-add-one-of-dark-souls-most-innovative-features/1100-6532496/" data-ref-id="1100-6532496">Dark Souls to WoW's Delves</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">As for when WoW's most anticipated new feature, player housing, will arrive, Blizzard still hasn't said. However, in a recent hands-on preview, we said even the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/we-tried-wow-player-housing-and-the-possibilities-already-feel-endless/1100-6531566/" data-ref-id="1100-6531566">early version of WoW's player housing system</a> already offers near-endless possibilities.</p>

A press release provides a more ominous overview of what s.p.l.i.t. entails:</p><p>“A daunting task lies ahead. Unconscionable secrets and vulnerabilities lie buried deep below legacy code and engineering.

<p>Unsurprisingly, for the second week in a row, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> takes pole position by shifting another 134,900 copies in the week of 9th to 16th June.

Absolutely nothing to sneeze at. We wouldn't be surprised if it hit a million next week.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/rune_factory_guardians_of_azuma">Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</a>'s Switch 1 version continues to do well, selling over 50k units since launch (almost another 10k this week), with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_kart_8_deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/minecraft">Minecraft</a> rounding out the top five.</p>

And aside from <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/elden_ring_nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>, it's an entire Nintendo sweep.</p>

<p>The big headline with the hardware here is that the Switch 2 has sold over a million units <em>already</em>. With a further 153,205 consoles selling this week, that's a total of 1.1 million Switch 2s sold in Japan alone. That's extremely impressive.</p>
<p>In terms of the Switch 1, it's still selling pretty well, shifting over 13k units this week alone. However, the PS5 (combined OG model, Pro, and Digital units) has surpassed it, selling over 15k consoles between its three SKUs.</p>

                <p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is proving to be a worthy successor to the original Switch, offering more processing power, a better display, and plenty of new functionality. Online multiplayer is also better on Switch 2 thanks to new features like Game Chat, Game Sharing, and faster download speeds. With all that new online functionality, you might be wondering if you should use a VPN with your Switch 2 when jumping online. Unlike Xbox Series X or PlayStation 5, which aren’t portable and typically connect to the same router every day, you can travel the world with your Switch 2, connecting to public Wi-Fi. As such, it might seem worthwhile to use a VPN with your Switch 2, though there are reasons to remain skeptical about their performance.</p><h2>Using a VPN on Switch 2</h2><p dir="ltr">First things first--yes, you can use a VPN on Switch 2. However, it’s not as straightforward as using a VPN on your PC. There’s no built-in VPN app for Switch 2, meaning you’ll need to either create a hotspot from another supported device or set up a VPN on your router. The latter can be tricky for beginners, and the process varies slightly depending on your specific VPN service.</p><p dir="ltr">If you’re thinking of setting up a VPN on your router, consider using ExpressVPN. The company offers its own line of Aircove routers that come preconfigured to route all traffic on your network through an ExpressVPN server. There are two models available: the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09VBXLGJR?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">$190 Aircove</a> and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CM6VL4PS?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">$170 Aircove Go</a>. Both feature WiFi 6 support and come bundled with a 30-day ExpressVPN free trial. Any device with WiFi or Ethernet connectivity can connect to the Aircoves, including the Switch 2, your PCs, other gaming consoles, smartphones, and more.</p><p dir="ltr">If you’re traveling, you can make use of a personal Wi-Fi hotspot. While smartphones are the most commonly used hotspot devices, most cannot natively share their VPN connection via a mobile connection. Instead, you’ll need to create a hotspot on your laptop or MacBook and connect your Switch 2 to it that way. Just enable network sharing on your device, connect to your VPN, then connect your Switch 2 to your laptop’s hotspot. The process varies slightly based on your VPN provider, but most offer detailed walkthroughs. For an example of what this might entail, check out <a href="https://www.expressvpn.com/support/vpn-setup/share-vpn-connection-windows/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">this tutorial from ExpressVPN</a>.</p><h2>Is Using VPN On Switch 2 Against Terms of Service?</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4517193-mariokartworld.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4517193" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4517193-mariokartworld.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4517193"></a><figcaption>Mario Kart World</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4517193-mariokartworld.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Just because you <em>can</em> use a VPN with Switch 2, that doesn't mean you <em>should. </em>A VPN can, theoretically, make your Switch 2's internet connection more private and secure. But there are some serious considerations to make before running your data through a remote server. For one, your speeds might be slower since VPNs encrypt your data and funnel it to another server, which takes time. More importantly, using a VPN can violate Nintendo's Terms of Service (TOS).</p><p dir="ltr">For example, using a VPN to circumvent regional pricing restrictions is against Nintendo's TOS, and various online games also restrict VPN usage. Using one can result in a ban if you're caught--or worse. Nintendo can remotely--and permanently--brick consoles for users who break certain rules outlined in the Switch 2 End User License Agreement. Because these regulations vary widely by game and region, there’s no one-size-fits-all answer.</p><p dir="ltr">In general, it's not necessary to use a VPN on Switch 2 if you’re sticking to single-player games or diving into casual online matches at home. The only possible edge case is if you’re worried about sketchy public Wi-Fi networks at cafes, airports, and hotels--but even then, it might be best to not connect to public networks if you're worried, or even play in Airplane mode. Still, if you're intent on using a VPN with your Switch, just make sure you deactivate it before using the eShop and confirm that using a VPN is not against an online game's terms of service.</p><h2>Other benefits of a VPN</h2><p>While it's hard to recommend a VPN for Switch 2 in most instances, the privacy and security benefits of a VPN can be helpful for other devices. Many VPN services also offer a wealth of other features like password managers, ad blockers, cloud storage space, identity theft alerts, and more. These won't be usable with your Switch 2, but they can be helpful for logging into your Nintendo Account on your PC or smartphone and monitoring your account for any security breaches. Luckily, most VPNs are affordable, costing just a few bucks a month. You can check out a few of the most popular VPNs at the links below.</p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-four-discontinued-donkey-kong-lego-sets-restocked-at-amazon/1100-6532560/">All Four Discontinued Donkey Kong Lego Sets Restocked At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-preorder-nintendo-switch-2/1100-6530595/">Donkey Kong Bananza Amiibo Costs $30, Available To Preorder Now</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-carries-nintendo-games-again-including-new-switch-2-exclusives/1100-6532451/">Amazon Carries Nintendo Games Again, Including New Switch 2 Exclusives</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-spider-man-magic-the-gathering-trading-card-restock-amazon-preorder/1100-6529819/">Marvel's Spider-Man Magic: The Gathering Preorders Restocked At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-bogo-50-off-movie-sale-includes-brand-new-4k-blu-ray-steelbooks-box-sets/1100-6529351/">Amazon BOGO 50% Off Movie Sale Includes Brand-New 4K Steelbooks &amp; Box Sets</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-book-sale-buy-one-get-one-50-percent-off-fantasy-sci-fi-horror-novel-box-sets/1100-6527091/">Amazon B1G1 50% Off Book Sale - Popular New Novels, Box Sets, And All-Time Greats</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/8bitdo-nintendo-switch-2-controller-compatibility-how-to-guide-best-switch-2-controller-deals/1100-6532267/">8BitDo's Best Controllers Get Switch 2 Support - How To Set Them Up And Why It's A Big Deal</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-5440-page-complete-history-of-middle-earth-box-set-is-only-106-at-amazon/1100-6526926/">The 5,440-Page Complete History Of Middle Earth Box Set Is Only $106 At Amazon</a></li>   </ul> </div>

			<p>Xbox is reportedly working on its Classics programs together with the team behind a popular emulator to bring original Xbox and 360 games to PC and Game Pass, complete with enhancements.</p>
<p>In a new video shared today, known Xbox Game Pass leaker <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@extas1s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eXstas1s</a> revealed that Xbox is working with the Xenia Canary development team on a sort of Classics program to create an emulation platform that will bring old games to Series X and S, PC, Game Pass, and xCloud, complete with visual and performance enhancements. The launch of this program will coincide with the brand's 25th anniversary, and games will reportedly launch in multiple waves that will be announced throughout 2026. Among the games that will launch via this new emulation platform will be Fable 2, Skate 3, Gears of War 3, and Batman: Arkham Asylum. Many other titles, however, are also under consideration, with the team evaluating potential technical and licensing issues.</p>
<p><iframe title="EXCLUSIVA 🔥 XBOX + XENIA se UNEN para revivir juegos de XBOX 360 en PC, nube y GAME PASS" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uub8TghbVSg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Considering how much importance Microsoft placed on backward compatibility in the past few years, what Exstas1s revealed today sounds reasonable enough, and pretty exciting as well, as this program would bring to PC games that are not available to play natively, like the aforementioned Fable 2, and the original versions of Ninja Gaiden and Ninja Gaiden 2, to name a few. Still, we must take everything with a grain of salt until an official announcement is made.</p>
<p>Though we don't know if Microsoft is indeed working on this Classics program, we do know the company is hard at work on its next-generation hardware. Together with <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-announces-multi-year-deal-with-amd-to-power-next-gen-devices/">AMD</a>, Microsoft is building gaming silicon that will deliver the next generation of graphics innovation with better visual quality, immersive gameplay, and improvements offered by AI while maintaining compatibility with the existing library of Xbox Games.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/funcom-will-add-more-hagga-basin-like-maps-in-future-dune-awakening-updates-new-pve-content-aimed-to-be-out-every-3-4-months/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-out-now-after-a-strong-head-start-weekend/">Dune: Awakening</a> has only been out for a little more than a week (even longer if you've been playing since its premium early access release), and players are already looking towards what's coming next for the game.</p>
<p>It'll still be a while before Funcom releases any major content updates, but one element we can expect, according to the studio's community manager, Ignasis Miró Sastre, is that the team will add more "<em>Hagga-Basin-like</em><em> maps</em>" in future updates.</p>
<p>Writing on the Dune: Awakening Discord server (spotted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-new-maps-hagga-basin">Eurogamer</a>), Sastre wrote, "<em>I think Joel kinda leaked in the past that we plan to add more Hagga-Basin-like maps in the future as part of new content.</em>"</p>
<p>Hagga Basin is the starting area in Dune: Awakening, where players can start finding their <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/dune-awakening-tips-for-surviving-arrakis/">sand legs</a> before traveling further into the desert, and eventually to the deep desert and the game's more PvP-focused areas.</p>
<p>It's an area of the game that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1lcojf7/to_the_surprise_of_nobody/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">players have a strong fondness for</a>, if only because it doesn't have the same potential for the kinds of horror stories players have experienced with a trip into the deep desert. A new area like Hagga Basin would be more than welcomed by Dune: Awakening players, to have that same well-curated exploration on Arrakis that Hagga Basin delivers in a fresh way.</p>
<p>And it'll feel even better since it'll likely be free, as Sastre later comments that "<em>Content will come as part of free updates, as far as I am aware. If it ever comes as part of a paid package, I imagine it would be because it's something big. But for now I think we have said we plan to release content for free, and then optional stuff via optional DLCs so we can actually afford rent, lights, and pineapple on pizza</em>."</p>
<p>Hopefully we'll be able to hear about whatever the next Hagga-Basin-like map is soon, and it wouldn't be the biggest surprise if we did, since the studio also just confirmed in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1lehj35/comment/mymv65a/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">Reddit AMA</a> that it plans to release PvE-focused content "<em>every 3/4 months</em>."</p>
<p>"<em>Each of our major updates will always continue new story content and new PvE content, which will release at the same time as our DLCs come out,</em>" Funcom wrote in response to a question about PvE plans. "<em>Our goal is to have these release every 3/4 months</em>."</p>
<p>So for now, we can look to sometime in September/October for when the next major batch of content is out for Dune: Awakening. Though, the studio also stipulates <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1lehj35/comment/myn27y3/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">elsewhere in the AMA</a> that while it will always communicate its plans for what's next in the game with the community, it might not necessarily publish a static roadmap.</p>
<p>So far, Dune: Awakening is having an incredibly strong launch, with a new concurrent player count of <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1172710/charts/">189,333</a> players that was reached this past weekend. It'll be interesting to see how the game continues to grow with the coming updates.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[New Report Claims Switch 2 Third-Party Game Launch Numbers Are Pretty Bad]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-third-party-game-launch-sales-report</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-report-claims-switch-2-third-party-game-launch-numbers-are-pretty-bad.1223160/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-third-party-game-launch-sales-report<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new report claims that launch numbers for third-party games available on the newly-released Nintendo Switch 2 aren't great, and that customers seem to be favoring Nintendo's own games rather than those by publishers like Capcom, CD Projekt, and Sega.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/it-was-the-biggest-console-launch" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">The Game Business</a>, around 62% of physical Switch 2 game sales in the US during the console's launch week were for first-party games, and that doesn't include the&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World&nbsp;</em>console bundle, which comes complete with a digital copy of the racer.</p>

<p>The Game Business notes that "one third-party publisher" (who the publication doesn't name) referred to Switch 2 launch sales as "below our lowest estimates", so it sounds like non-Nintendo publishers releasing games on the Switch 2 aren't happy with sales so far.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-third-party-launch-numbers-cyberpunk-2077.jpg?itok=us_KQx7O 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-third-party-launch-numbers-cyberpunk-2077.jpg?itok=MWkIhCl- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Cyberpunk 2077&nbsp;</em>is one of the Nintendo Switch 2's third-party launch titles.</figcaption></figure><p>As The Game Business points out, while Switch 2 third-party numbers might look better than the original Switch's figures (81% physical first-party during the launch month), those figures should come with some caveats.</p>

<p>More third-party games launched alongside the Switch 2 - thirteen versus the original console's five - and the Switch 2 has also <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/switch-2-fastest-selling-nintendo-console" rel="nofollow">sold more consoles than the original machine did</a> during the same time period, so the higher percentage doesn't tell the whole story.</p>

<p>It's difficult to know what, if anything, these figures portend. Many of the Switch 2's third-party titles are several years old, meaning a lot of people will probably already have had their fill of them.</p>

<p>Additionally, the Switch 2's strange Game Key Card system, which means that many publishers don't actually include full game files on their Switch 2 carts, may have put off buyers from picking up games on Nintendo's platform. It's difficult to say without more in-depth qualitative data, of course.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mario-kart-world-nintendo-switch-2-third-party-launch-sales.jpg?itok=TXSQb1zp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mario-kart-world-nintendo-switch-2-third-party-launch-sales.jpg?itok=c5GTUjW7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Mario Kart World&nbsp;</em>has done predictably well for Nintendo, even if third-party sales are floundering.</figcaption></figure><p>As newer Switch 2 games and third-party exclusives (assuming such releases are planned by publishers) begin to arrive, we'll probably get a more complete picture of how people feel about Switch 2 third-party titles.</p>

<p>Still, Nintendo probably isn't too worried; it's always the company's first-party releases that do the best on Nintendo hardware, and as long as games like<i>&nbsp;Mario Kart World</i>, the two&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>Switch 2 Editions, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/donkey-kong-bananza-switch-2" rel="nofollow">the upcoming&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/donkey-kong-bananza-switch-2" rel="nofollow">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>&nbsp;</em>enjoy strong sales, Nintendo probably won't sweat too much.</p>
