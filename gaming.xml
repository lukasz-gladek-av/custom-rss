            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/-it-s-okay-to-make-a-small-game-astro-bot-director-nicolas-doucet-says-tiny-ideas-contain-huge-potential<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Team Asobi studio director Nicolas Doucet has some advice for GDC 2025 attendees lucky enough to find a spot in his packed out 'The making of Astro Bot' session: "It's okay to make a small game."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">They're pertinent words in era of burgeoning production cycles and budgets—and ones that should hold weight given the critical and commercial performance of Team Asobi's effervescent platformer, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Astro Bot</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Introducing his point, Doucet surfaces a photograph of Team Asobi's onboarding handbook that states "we aim for quality, not quantity." Better to create a michelin star morsel than a greasy platter of overcooked sliders.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For Doucet, thinking small means gaining more control over your work and processes. It also means your players are far more likely to actually roll credits—letting you more effectively compete for their limited time in an increasingly saturated market.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The prospect of a game you can actually complete is a really, really positive argument [for small games]," he explains. "That meant being okay with the game being 12 hours, but if it had been eight hours—and the eight hours were fantastic—we would have settled for that to reach consistent quality."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Doucet acknowledges concerns over game size can be a "difficult bias" to overcome and admits the prospect of developing a smaller title initially sparked discussions in Team Asobi HQ. Eventually, however, the team realized they could use the benefits of thinking small and compact to maintain a clear scope and rapidly execute on unique concepts.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/consume-me-wins-grand-prize-nuovo-award-at-the-2025-igf-awards" target="_self" data-discover="true">'Consume Me' Wins Grand Prize, Nuovo Award at the 2025 IGF Awards</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's a decision that was justified by the fact that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Astro Bot</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was built in just three and a half years—only six months more than the team initially envisioned. Budget was maintained by choosing to adjust the pitch of the studio's ramp-up curve to accommodate fewer developers over a longer period of time.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With that mantra of 'simplicity' in mind, Team Asobi became adept at distilling ideas down to their core throughout production. For instance, although the DualSense controller has 18 buttons, the team forced themselves to utilize as few inputs as possible—relying on short and long presses and contextual controls to bridge the complexity gap.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The studio also simplified some of Astro's abilities. For example, they removed a third medium-sized Astro Bot from the (utterly fantastic) level that sees the titular hero turn into a sponge to absorb water and grow in size.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"[Initially we let players] select three sizes of sponge: small, medium, and large," says Doucet. "At first it was fine but then you forget and think 'am I small? Am I medium? Am I large?' It became too complicated so we went for a system that fluctuates between big and small. Once again, this is bias, as game designers we always think that more is better, but it's not the case."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/how-civilization-vii-s-powerful-narrative-system-helps-players-experience-unique-parts-of-history" target="_self" data-discover="true">How Civilization VII's powerful narrative system helps players experience unique parts of history</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Team Asobi sought to remove similar complications from its hero characters, such as the bot versions of Aloy and Kratos.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With Aloy, the studio ensured slow-motion triggered automatically whenever players target an enemy with her bow and arrow. In Horizon, that effect had to be triggered manually. For Kratos, players need only press one button to hurl and recall his thudding axe. Again, that's different from God of War, which requires different button inputs to achieve the same outcome.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Doucet says those tweaks were made in service of simplicity and with an implicit understanding that Astro Bot was targeting a different audience.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That pursuit of 'less is more' extended to other, perhaps more surprising, areas of production. Doucet explains it pushed the studio to tell a story "with a minimum amount of text and no voice over." He reveals Astro Bot features less than 5000 words—or 4.292 words to be exact.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There are also only 12 minutes and 30 seconds of cutscenes in the entire experience, meaning players are 'active' roughly 98.3 percent of the time.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/-balatro-plays-winning-hand-at-gdca-2025-receiving-game-of-the-year" target="_self" data-discover="true">'Balatro' Plays Winning Hand at GDCA 2025, Receiving Game of the Year</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's a metric that speaks to the team's belief in creating an buoyant toybox&nbsp;by reducing distractions to champion perpetual participation. There were other benefits, too.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It kind of struck me in development, but all of these efforts towards simplicity, they've actually made the game easier to share," muses Doucet. "For example, the fact there is no skill tree—while individual powers are one-shot—means that we introduce a new mechanic all the time. That means you could have friends coming to your house, picking up the game halfway through your campaign, playing for the first time, and still having a normal experience. That becomes really powerful when we think about spreading to new audiences."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ultimately, Doucet feels actively pursuing simplicity is often viewed as criminally uncool in the world of sprawling blockbusters—but perhaps that just means those developers capable of squashing that particular insecurity will reap the biggest rewards.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"In order to exist in this very busy world, I think it's sometimes better to settle for a good spot in second league, rather than a bad spot in the top league," he explains. "Instead of joining the cool trendy party on a crowded beach with bars and celebrities, how about you just look for a little quiet beach and have a cool picnic over there?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"A lot of the choices we made with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Astro Bot</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> could be labelled double-A or maybe lacking in ambition—like the size of the team, the size of the game, the fact there's no text, no voice, and its not an open world. But that doesn't really matter. We still made a game that made people really happy, and in fact it was probably the simplicity that a lot of players made time for."</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">News Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-solar-powered-controller-detailed-in-new-%E2%80%9Coperation-device%E2%80%9D-patent.1141509/</guid>

			<p>Sony recently filed a patent for a new type of PlayStation controller that could solve some of the biggest issues of current wireless controllers, such as losing power right at the worst possible time.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://tech4gamers.com/sony-patents-solar-power-controllers/?fbclid=IwY2xjawJIDShleHRuA2FlbQIxMQABHVwVHGQueVMZZupV-8DT_-KIESWvFQMimNqN7_WL90EACfvjRBhqzmNO1g_aem_pn2iGOc8pztrFDDWfs47hQ">Tech4gamer</a>, Sony recently filed a patent called <a href="https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2025046814&amp;_cid=P21-M80ZRL-19120-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Operation Device</a> which outlines a PlayStation controller sporting a plurality of photovoltaic elements located on its housing and a storage area that accumulates power that will essentially charge the controller with solar energy. The drawing accompanying the patent shows a DualSense controller and where the photovoltaic elements will be placed.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/PlayStation-controller-solar-power.png"></a></figure>

<p>While a solar-powered PlayStation controller sounds nothing more like an interesting idea without any sort of revolutionary application, Sony is aiming to address one of the biggest issues of current wireless controllers: preventing the controller from losing power at the wrong time. With solar power, a wireless controller's battery would never get drained, which would definitely make it enticing over a traditional controller with a limited battery life.</p>
<p>Even though it is hardly a revolutionary controller, Sony has already attempted to evolve the classic PlayStation DualShock controller with the DualSense controller, later bringing further innovation with the premium DualSense Edge controller. Sporting the same adaptive triggers and haptic feedback support of the base version alongside new features, such as swappable sticks, three levels of trigger pulls for the L2 and R2 triggers, and more, the DualSense Edge is the ultimate form of the PlayStation 5 controller.

<p>As revealed in a Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2246340/view/534345486851637348" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a> earlier today, Capcom will unveil Title Update 1, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-1-april-announced" rel="nofollow">due to arrive sometime in April</a>, on March 25th. You can catch it at around 7am Pacific (that's about 10am Eastern and around 2pm GMT).</p>

<p>The showcase will see&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>producer Ryozo Tsujimoto revealing more about what's coming as part of Title Update 1, including returning monster Mizutsune, as well as "a host of other new additions", according to Capcom.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-showcase-roaring.jpg?itok=H_JmSTVt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-showcase-roaring.jpg?itok=WhBFyHxk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>' first Title Update showcase is airing next week.</figcaption></figure><p>If <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-rise-sunbreak-title-update-5-release-date-and-more-revealed" rel="nofollow">previous</a>&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>Title Update showcases are <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-world-iceborne-title-update-4-receives-early-july-release-window" rel="nofollow">anything to go by</a>, we'll probably get some more endgame activities for&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>as part of its first update, plus more cosmetics and perhaps a little more paid DLC to tempt you.</p>

<p>Just in case you're not familiar with it,&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>is the latest game in Capcom's&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>series of action RPGs. The game features a more direct narrative focus than its predecessors, but at its core, it's still built around slaying monsters and using their parts to upgrade your gear.</p>

<p>The game has proven phenomenally popular since launch, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-8m" rel="nofollow">racking up eight million sales</a> in its first three days and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-steam-player-record" rel="nofollow">breaking records</a> for both the series and Capcom as a whole on Steam.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that it was released on the very last day of February,&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>instantly topped the month's chart for best-selling games <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/circana-us-sales-data-february-2025-monster-hunter-wilds" rel="nofollow">according to analyst firm Circana</a>, so it's safe to say Capcom has a hit on its hands (talons?) with this one.</p>




<p><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>' first Title Update showcase airs on March 25th at 7am Pacific (10am Eastern, 2pm GMT). You can buy the game right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246340/Monster_Hunter_Wilds/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/monster-hunter-wilds/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/monster-hunter-wilds/9NMT6XFN0LVD" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and you can read <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/monster-hunter-wilds-review-new-frontier" rel="nofollow">our Tyler's review right here</a>.</p>

But it doesn’t come free. You’ll have to invest cash to improve your abilities. But since you have amnesia after crash-landing on a foreign island, naturally your wallet is a little light. Thanks to the locals and an abundance of treasure hidden across each island in the game, you’ll soon find yourself stacking pirate gold like a wealth-hoarding dragon in no time. But some ways are faster than others, so let’s go over the quickest ways to get that bag.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196578" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Total Recall: Why Yakuza Is So Much More Than A Japanese GTA" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="387" data-playlist="196578,195719,196394" data-current="196578"><div><p>Total Recall: Why Yakuza Is So Much More Than A Japanese GTA</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196578/196578_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196578/196578_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196578/196578_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196578/196578_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22135.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h403"><a id=""></a>Bounties: the most lucrative way to make money</h2><figure id="" data-id="8cd4552ca41f2c3e8d220a19a423e36b" data-recommend-id="image://8cd4552ca41f2c3e8d220a19a423e36b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Goro Mijima opens a treasure chest in Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Goro Mijima opens a treasure chest in Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8cd4552ca41f2c3e8d220a19a423e36b" data-recommend-id="image://8cd4552ca41f2c3e8d220a19a423e36b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Goro Mijima opens a treasure chest in Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>While the tactics and techniques discussed below will net you some pocket change for buying items and, after some time, upgrades, you’ll need to pull in big money for ship customization and late-game upgrades to your health, damage, and abilities.

You’ll acquire junk by exploring Rich Island, as well as all subsequent islands in the archipelago, and by defeating enemies you encounter in the world.</p><p>After unlocking access to the Goromaru, you’ll also receive a treasure map shortly once you hit the high seas and can travel to various islands. These islands, represented by a treasure chest on the map, offer on-the-ground combat against various criminals and unknown pirates, usually a boss and mini-boss along the way, and then a treasure chest at the very end. If you make it that far, opening up said chest will often grant you a ring or other lore item, the former of which you can wear to boost your abilities, along with resources to sell and money.</p><figure id="" data-id="2271ae2d24db7f5d30dffe7ffff60087" data-recommend-id="image://2271ae2d24db7f5d30dffe7ffff60087" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The treasure chest description in Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The treasure chest description in Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2271ae2d24db7f5d30dffe7ffff60087" data-recommend-id="image://2271ae2d24db7f5d30dffe7ffff60087" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The treasure chest description in Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Lastly, if you need a few dollars, roam landmasses to encounter random groups of enemies, most of which drop a handful of cash upon defeat.

It’s not much, but every little bit adds up to a new skill or buff.</p></div><hr><p><em>Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</em> is available now on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows PCs.

They’re headed to <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em> on March 27, alongside new creature and trainer cards hailing from <em>Pokémon Violet</em> and <em>Scarlet</em>’s Paldea region. Tatsugiri, Sprigatito, and Iono are just a few of the new faces arriving before the end of the month.</p><p>Exactly how rare will Shiny <em>TCG Pocket</em> cards be? The Pokémon Company and developer DeNA haven’t yet revealed the actual odds of finding one in a pack. They may be similar to current crown cards like the gold Charizard ex which has a 0.04 percent chance of appearing in packs. The Shiny Charizard ex shown in the trailer for Shining Revelry has two new rainbow symbols in the rarity section of the card, however, leading me to believe it will be even harder to find. </p><p>The good news is that players will have other things to occupy themselves with besides the pain of not finding shinies when the new set drops. <em>TCG Pocket</em>’s first Ranked matches are also going live in the game on March 27.

                <p dir="ltr">Disco Elysium is coming to mobile devices for the first time later this year, and we got exclusive hands (and thumbs) on with the new version of the RPG. This isn't a simple port whatsoever. In fact, GameSpot's Lucy James admits that "it is very different to what I thought it was going to be."</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DHcM71FPjPH/?igsh=MW1ib3hlNnE1Znd0bw%3D%3D" rel="nofollow ">On Instagram</a>, James shows off Disco Elysium running on Android and how the RPG is making the transition to smartphones. The game originally launched on PC in 2019 before coming to other consoles in the years that followed, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disco-elysium-releases-on-nintendo-switch-october-12/1100-6496489/">such as Nintendo Switch in 2021</a>. But with this new port, how you engage with Disco Elysium is different. "It's meant to be played in these shorter bursts, rather than sitting down and really committing to a very dense RPG," said James.</p><p dir="ltr">As for the controls, Disco Elysium is embracing how people use their smartphones. "The way you interact with it is how you interact with your phone," James said. Basically, you're swiping and tapping with your thumb while your smartphone stays in portrait mode. So it looks possible to play through the experience with one hand.</p><p dir="ltr">Earlier this month, developer ZA/UM Studio announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disco-elysium-getting-a-total-re-imagination-for-mobile-this-summer/1100-6530112/">the mobile edition of Disco Elysium for launch this summer</a>.

<p>Epic Games continues to give people what they want. More OG Fortnite content is on the way thanks to OG Season 3, and there’s plenty of love for this early season, meaning the anticipation is already building.</p>



<p>OG Fortnite Season 3—AKA Meteor Strike—is next up for the battle-royale title in 2025. Fortnite has a plethora of game modes at this point with regular battle royale, LEGO Fortnite, a Rocket League crossover, and so much more. But Fortnite OG is another shrewd move from Epic: Giving us all a chance to enjoy the earlier years.</p>



<p>Fortnite OG Season 3 was first released in February 2018, and yet we’re celebrating it again in 2025—possibly with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-mortal-kombat-mythics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mortal Kombat Mythics</a> and maybe some <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-is-receiving-yakuza-skins-soon-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yakuza skins</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-fortnite-og-season-3-releases-in-march">Fortnite OG Season 3 Releases in March</h2>



<figure><figcaption>How did we get so Lucky? Credit to Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>A message on the <a href="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/1903099532868505615" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Fortnite X social media channel</a> has confirmed <strong>Fortnite OG Season 3 gets underway on March 25</strong>. One of its standout additions was a new POI—Lucky Landing (shown in the screenshot above).</p>



<p>Lucky Landing is characterized by its Asian-themed buildings and lush, eye-popping Cherry Blossom tree in the center. The majority of the season’s storyline focused on a meteor heading for the map. </p>



<div><article><p><span>Why crash out when you could crash in?

Back to where it all started…OG Season 3 launches March 25 🚀 </span></p></article></div>



<p>The map slowly started altering as the season progressed, and we were beginning to see the creativity of the Fortnite map and how your experience would dynamically change as the weeks went on. I also fondly remember the Battle Pass having the “Take the L” emote which I unashamedly dropped on fallen enemies after I two-tapped them with Pump Shotguns.</p>



<p>It was a simple time. Long may the OG Fortnite map trend continue.</p>

<p>Dave the Diver’s Like a Dragon DLC, Ichiban’s Holiday, will release on April 10, 2025.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-new-in-dave-the-diver-s-ichiban-s-holiday-dlc">What’s New in Dave the Diver’s Ichiban’s Holiday DLC?</h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/03/dave-the-diver-x-like-a-dragon-collaboration-dlc-ichibans-holiday-launches-april-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gematsu</a>, Dave the Diver’s Ichiban’s Holiday DLC will see the beloved character, Ichiban Kasuga, and his favourite bartender from Survive Bar arrive at Blue Hole for a vacation. However, things never go smoothly for Ichiban, and during his vacation time, he gets into a conflict with Sea Blue when he realises that they are capturing dolphins.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-classic-arcade-brawler-experience">Classic Arcade Brawler Experience</h3>



<p>To remedy the situation, Ichiban decides to infiltrate Sea Blue’s base. However, things will not be easy for him, and he needs a partner. Cobra joins on the journey, and as soon as you reach the base, the game turns into a classic arcade beat ’em up title, with players having to switch between both characters during the fights. Players should keep an eye out for a special reward at the end of this stage.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-karaoke-minigame-and-more">Karaoke Minigame and More</h3>



<p>Moreover, Ichiban’s Holiday DLC will add more content to Dave the Diver. In the spirit of Like a Dragon, players now have a new Karaoke minigame where they can sing along with their favourite characters. Also, some unique characters from the Like a Dragon series will be introduced as Bancho Sushi staff.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Players should know that Ichiban’s Holiday will be the first paid DLC for Dave the Diver. Also, the DLC will be only available for a limited time of six months on all platforms once it arrives, as this is “a special collaboration with a big game”, revealed game director Jaeho Hwang.</p>

It’s full of cool little touches, whether it’s throwing something at an enemy with the grappling rope or dropping from your glider onto your horse. Unfortunately, it’s also a game full of map clutter, bloated systems, and a truly absurd amount of junk loot, and the time I spent clearing out everything that didn’t spark joy and dealing with all these non-essential systems made me pine for a leaner, meaner, more focused game. Rise of the Ronin is excellent when it has the courage to be itself and lean into its challenging, rewarding fighting; too often, however, it feels stuck in indecision, torn between what it wants to be and what it feels it’s expected to be, and not even the best samurai can overcome that."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Jesse is a mild-mannered staff writer for IGN.

                <p>Baldur's Gate 3 actor Samantha Beart, who played Karlach, has spoken out against artificial intelligence technologies being used for short-term gain. Speaking to <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/edge/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Edge</a>, Beart said CEOs want to use AI to "save money," but long-term reputational damage may be coming for those who take this approach.</p><p>"In the long term, it'll destroy their reputation, their company, everything," Beart said, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/baldur-s-gate/baldurs-gate-3-karlach-actor-says-ceos-just-want-to-save-money-with-ai-itll-destroy-their-reputation-their-company-everything/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">as reported by GamesRadar</a>.</p><p>Beart went on to say that actors are unlikely to back down in the fight against AI because doing so would mean, "You've just signed your way out of any sort of job or career."</p><p>"We have an industry of highly artistic people who've had a calling to do this stuff, and then you've got these people with money, who don't play games, who see it as an easy way to make a return on investment," Beart said.</p><p>Video game voice actors in the SAG-AFTRA union are currently on strike against video game companies, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mass-effect-actor-on-why-ai-is-existential-issue-in-ongoing-strike-negotiations/1100-6528710/" data-ref-id="1100-6528710">issues around AI said to be the final sticking point in the talks</a>.</p><p>"The dream of the tech industry is to sell off your company at an overinflated price and retire," Beart said. "And I feel that's being done with game studios right now."</p><p>Video game voice actors have been on strike since July 2024, meaning the strike has now stretched beyond seven months. SAG-AFTRA video game performers also went on strike in 2016, with a work stoppage spanning 18 months.</p><p>A recent study found that the majority of game developers worldwide use AI technologies to make games, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/study-finds-majority-of-game-dev-companies-use-generative-ai-already-despite-worker-concerns/1100-6528919/" data-ref-id="1100-6528919">despite workers raising major concerns</a>. AI has been a controversial topic in video games and beyond, in part over fears about job losses with fears about generative AI being used to potentially take jobs. Electronic Arts CEO Andrew Wilson has said the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-ceo-on-how-ai-will-impact-video-games-and-the-people-who-make-them/1100-6513969/" data-ref-id="1100-6513969">rise in AI will lead to job losses in the short term</a> but will ultimately create more jobs total, just like what happened with previous labor revolutions.</p><p>In other news, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-uses-horizons-aloy-to-demonstrate-new-ai-tech-and-its-about-as-impressive-as-youd-expect/1100-6530023/" data-ref-id="1100-6530023">a recent video showed Horizon's Aloy in a tech demo for an AI assistant</a>--and people quickly voiced their concerns about this. Even Aloy's actor, Ashly Burch, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/horizon-actor-ashly-burch-worried-in-wake-of-ai-aloy-video/1100-6530163/" data-ref-id="1100-6530163">spoke out to criticize it</a>. </p>

The event also included first-time reveals for previously unannounced games, of which many looked really neat. My personal favorite was a cozily bleak isometric survival crafting game called <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2604490/I_Hate_This_Place/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2604490/I_Hate_This_Place/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>I Hate This Place</em></a></span>. <br></p><p>We are now practically inundated with quarterly showcases and festivals from all the major events and platform holders, and they can’t always be revealing brand new games. So a lot of the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsFTvIsRYbw&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsFTvIsRYbw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2.5 hour-long Future Games Spring Showcase</a></span> consisted of reminders of titles that was already announced, but so many continue to look cool, well worth a place on your radar. </p><p>That includes Brazilian roguelike ARPG <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1782460/Hell_Clock/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1782460/Hell_Clock/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Hell Clock</em></a></span>, grimdark sci-fi adventure <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2154070/INDUSTRIA_2/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2154070/INDUSTRIA_2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Industria 2</em></a></span>, atmospheric puzzle platformer <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1928690/Bionic_Bay/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1928690/Bionic_Bay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Bionic Bay</em></a></span>, and cyberpunk shooter <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/990380/METAL_EDEN/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/990380/METAL_EDEN/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Metal Eden</em></a></span>. Also <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2447980/Crown_Gambit/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2447980/Crown_Gambit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Crown Gambit</em></a></span>, because I love me a good card-based tactical-RPG. A bunch of games also have recent demos out, including the evocative retro pixel-art JRPG <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1864000/Artis_Impact/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1864000/Artis_Impact/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Artis Impact</em></a></span>. </p><p>In the meantime, here are nine games we didn’t know about until they were revealed during yesterday’s showcase. </p></div></div><div><p><em>Outriders</em> developer People Can Fly is taking a stab at a mix of the hottest live-service genres around. <em>Lost Rift </em>is a base-building survival shooter that combines PvE coop with PvPvE extraction gameplay. The crudest way I can describe it is mashing together <em>Far Cry</em>, <em>Fortnite</em>, and <em>Rust</em>. </p></div><div><p>Based on the Kyle Starks’ comic by the same name,<em> I Hate This Place </em>is about surviving in the woods by collecting resources in the day, and navigating occult horrors at night. What helps set it apart form similar survival crafting loops is the inky art-style and ‘80s analogue horror vibes. </p></div><div><p>Don’t be fooled, <em>Elsewhere Electric</em> is not a van life adventure game. It is instead a co-op first-person exploration game where you solve puzzles in a strange facility. It supports virtual reality headsets and will show each player different things, forcing them to communicate to overcome obstacles. </p></div><div><p>This one is a bonkers mashup. <em>Shelf Heroes</em> is an FPS with roguelike elements, and card-based perk powerups, and multiplayer co-op. You have to assemble your perfect action figure to take back your home from rogue toys. <em>Risk of Rain</em> <em>2</em> meets <em>Toy Story</em>?<br></p></div><div><p>What if you could ponder the Roman Empire from the cozy comfort of a <em>Stardew Valley</em>-like? <em>Romestead</em> looks the part, but will offer less chill with up to eight players battling for dominance across limited resource maps. So maybe less slice-of-life farming sim than <em>Age of Empires </em>clash of civilizations?<br></p></div><div><p>A robot with a gun awakens on an abandoned oil tanker and searches for meaning. <em>The Last Caretaker</em> calls on players to “craft, explore, and battle rogue machines” as they try to bring humanity back from apparent extinction. There’s a choose-your-own-adventure tag on Steam though, so maybe you can decide to leave humans behind in the end. </p></div><div><p>Kickstarted over four years ago, the table-top dark fantasy tactical RPG <em>Frosthaven</em> is getting a video game adaptation. It’ll feature single-player, co-op, and online multiplayer, with a closed beta happening soon, ahead of its Early Access release. </p></div><div><p><em>Raev</em> is a kingdom builder that blends RPG elements with 4X strategy. You guide a civilization of furries on their way to environmental harmony, architectural beauty, and societal greatness. It’s coming to PC in 2026. </p></div><div><p>Old-school first-person shooter <em>Painkiller</em> is being revived by Saber Interactive. The <em>Doom</em>-inspired fast-paced gothic gorefest will offer co-op as players battle the fallen angel Azazel and his army of demons using steampunk-looking weapons. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
