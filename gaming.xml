Was it the dark days where every single big blockbuster movie got a shitty tie-in video game crunched out by some poor dev team in six months to launch alongside the film? Or is it the present, where new movies rarely get tie-in games at all outside of the occasional throwaway mobile game? Yes, of course there are exceptions, but for every <em>Goldeneye 007</em>, <em>Scott Pilgrim</em>, or <em>Spider-Man 2</em>, there are a dozen <em>E.T.</em>s, <em>Rambo</em>s, or <em>Fight Club</em>s. Meanwhile, we’ve finally got kind of a good thing going in the other direction, with enough quality movie/TV adaptations of games that an outright shitburger like <em>Borderlands</em> feels like a rare exception and not the rule. </p><div><p>I get it, games take longer and more effort to make, especially the kind of quadruple-A thing most film studios would prefer their cash-ins to look like. But here’s the secret sauce, kids: Most of the best movie-to-video-game adaptations aren’t even direct adaptations of a specific movie, but are instead parallel stories, spinoffs, off-brand prequels and sequels, and weird anthology tales existing in the same universe. <em>Star Wars </em>has been proving that theory right for decades now, but even ambitious-yet-average one-offs like <em>Mad Max</em> and <em>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</em> have the right idea. </p><p>And that’s the sweet spot we’d like to look at, especially in the wake of the rather excellent <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em>: The games that took a film’s ball and ran with it. There’s quite a few of them, but here’s 10 that are especially worth your time. </p></div></div></div><div><p>Probably the indisputable winner of this entire list, if we’re honest. Creative Assembly took a good hard look at everything<em> Aliens: Colonial Marines</em> did and made the exact opposite of that. The extent to which <em>Isolation</em> applies pressure to the player and <em>dares</em> them to make a wrong move or make the wrong noise is breathtaking. Quite literally, too, if you turned on that option on select platforms where the alien can hear you through your controller, laptop, or camera microphone. And how gloriously sadistic is the fact that they even included that option?</p></div><div><p>There are elements of <em>The Thing</em> that show its age, especially the gunplay that becomes a drag once you start getting fewer alien monstrosities and more generic humans in your way. But wrapped around a fairly bog-standard survival horror game is a suite of brilliant mechanics that truly makes it feel harmonious with the Carpenter film of the same name. Once you start rescuing survivors, any one of them could be infected at any time, and deciding just how much to trust them–or not–with resources and tasks still feels tense and unique. Nightdive Studios just shadow-dropped a very pretty remaster of the game. It’s still very much worth a look today as it was back in 2002 when it first arrived. </p></div><div><p>Here we have the rarest of rare scenarios: <em>Escape From Butcher Bay </em>is a game that is an outright triumph in every way the film it was meant to tie-in with is not. Yes, there’s still a goofy charm to <em>Chronicles of Riddick</em>: The Film, the kind of bro-ey nerd charm you can only get from one Vincent Diesel, Esq. It actually feels more like a one-shot <em>D&amp;D/Warhammer</em> campaign than anything else, and nobody was even attempting that in 2004. </p><p><br><em>Escape from Butcher Bay</em>, however, is every inch the sequel to <em>Pitch Black</em> the world needed and wanted. The game is a down and dirty, stealthy prison escape scenario with an excellent “see-in-the-dark” mechanic, awash in character actors, and <em>a lot </em>of Riddick shanking people in the spine. And the game pulled all this off while still serving some satisfying Furyan lore expansion. For some reason, we haven’t gotten 10 sequels to this yet.   </p></div><div><p>Oh sure, there’s an argument to be made that <em>Shadow of Mordor/Shadow of War</em> are the better games to include here, considering how much of their presentation is lifted from the Peter Jackson films. However, I’d argue for a more unique experience, look no further than <em>The Third Age.</em> As literally anyone who plays it for five minutes can tell you, the game is basically just <em>Final Fantasy X</em> in Middle Earth. Thing is, what seemed like a derivative choice in 2004 feels far more novel in 2024. The story, with a kind of parallel Fellowship ensuring the A-team gets to Mount Doom, runs roughshod over the established canon, but the group’s backstories are all solid enough to maintain interest for the entire play time, and hey, least they don’t do anything too stupid like, say, oh, idk, for instance, make Shelob a goth baddie, or make the last thicc female Ent fight a Balrog. </p></div><div><p>Every once in a while, somebody threatens to try and do a new <em>Back to the Future</em>, or maybe turn that Broadway musical into a film. Meanwhile, Telltale got there first, with the help of series screenwriter Bob Gale, and a smattering of the original cast in tow, all putting in work. The first two episodes are a little on the sillier side, with a jaunt to Prohibition-era Hill Valley. But once the busybody ancestor of Principal Strickland gets involved with Doc Brown, resulting in Hill Valley being turned into a techno-dystopia, things are drastically more interesting. It’s a damn shame the ending–which managed to rope in Michael J. Fox while introducing some multiverse shenanigans back when that was still cool–never went anywhere. What we’ve got instead is still the one and only time this series has ever been expanded upon in a meaningful way. </p></div><div><p>Look, I love <em>GTA V</em> and <em>Red Dead Redemption II</em>, but every damn day, I mourn that the Rockstar Games that had time to pump out games that weren’t <em>GTA</em> appears to be in a coma. Don’t even get me started on how much I miss <em>Midnight Club</em>, we’ll be here all day. But above all, we don’t talk enough about the one time Rockstar decided to play in someone else’s cinematic sandbox to give us not just one of the best takes on a 3D beat-’em-up we’d get (until the <em>Yakuza</em> games finally started to gain traction in the West), but also one of the best movie adaptations all around. <em>The Warriors</em> takes a cult classic film literally nobody was even paying attention to in 2005, and breathes new life into it. The game isn’t just an adaptation, but is an expansive prequel starring most of the same cast. This thing has been long overdue for a remaster, but alas, Rockstar would have to pull people off of lovingly modeling every strand of a meth head’s chest hair in <em>GTA Online</em> to do it. </p></div><div><p>It’s always a mistake whenever someone says <em>Bond </em>films are all just dumb action flicks, especially the Daniel Craig era. But to be fair, the Pierce Brosnan flicks weren’t shy about being exactly what they were, until they parasurfed way too close to the sun with <em>Die Another Day</em>. Quality of the films notwithstanding, it made total sense that Brosnan would end up getting the best Bond game ever made (<em>Goldeneye 007</em>’s aged, and you know it. Why are you booing me? I’m right). <em>Everything or Nothing</em> is just a wild-ass ride from beginning to end, with enormous action set pieces no film would be able to budget for without bankrupting England. It’s frankly shocking it didn’t, considering the staggering amount of star power EA managed to rope into this. The game features Brosnan himself, as well as Judi Dench, John Cleese, and even Willem Dafoe as the baddie.Shannon Elizabeth and Heidi Klum star as Bond girls, and Mya does the theme song (which is still a bop). This is just straight up, spared-no-expense AAA shit right here, a game that actually feels like a later <em>Uncharted</em> sequel long before anyone even heard the name Nathan Drake. </p></div><div><p>Ask virtually anyone about what they think a <em>John Wick</em> video game should be, chances are good the answer is something that resembles <em>Max Payne</em> or <em>Hotline Miami</em>. Nobody’s first answer would’ve been <em>John Wick Hex</em>, and yet after playing it, one will find themselves wondering “Why wasn’t it?” <em>John Wick Hex</em> is a strategy game that puts you in the head of the Baba Yaga, where every little consideration of the killzones he finds himself in must be accounted for to escape without taking a bullet, and it’s only after you’ve done the legwork that you actually get to see the dope, bone-crushing, headshotting glory. It’s also working with a really cool cel-shaded art style, and really, though, it’s just cool to see John <em>as</em> the Baba Yaga, the guy still building his legend instead of the legend. </p></div><div><p>Out of everything else in this list, <em>Terminator: Resistance</em> is shocking in the fact that nothing about its pedigree gives the indication that it might be playable let alone often good. Look at developer Teyon’s resume prior to this, and it is a long, depressing list of straight up shovelware for the Wii and 3DS. Hell, their last licensed game is the dreadful PS3 <em>Rambo</em> rail shooter I mentioned at the start. Somehow, those guys managed to pull off <em>Fallout</em>-but-with-<em>Terminators</em>, and did it in a way that doesn’t outstay its welcome the way too many of the <em>Fallout </em>games do. We used to get stuff like this all the time in the PS2 era. Now, a AA game taking a road-less-traveled with a big property is one of those swings nobody makes. But when they do, it often winds up being a delightfully wonky treat. </p></div><div><p>It’s not exactly a surprise when WayForward manages to make a pretty passable game out of a tie-in property nobody cares about, let alone a legitimately fun, cool Metroidvania, but in <em>The Mummy Demastered</em>’s case, the team found themselves in the wild position of crafting the only shining positive about an absolute shitshow of a project. <em>The Dark Universe</em> is still a punchline in the annals of recent film history (though we did get that great Elisabeth Moss <em>Invisible Man</em> out of it), but the game is surprisingly pretty forward thinking in a few ways. Specifically, it’s got more of a <em>Souls</em>-like approach to the way it handles death, in that, as a nameless grunt, completing the mission means heading into darkened tombs, having to take down your predecessor if you want any of your inventory back. All it really needed was a trailer with a pixel-art Tom Cruise <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.indiewire.com/features/general/imax-the-mummy-trailer-sound-effects-missing-youtube-1201761023/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.indiewire.com/features/general/imax-the-mummy-trailer-sound-effects-missing-youtube-1201761023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">screaming in the center sound channel of your TV</a></span>. </p><hr></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

That doesn't look like a Sandisk logo. That looks like the logo of a company that sells machine gun arms in the <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> universe.

            <p>NetEase's PvPvE sandbox action horror, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/feedback-on-once-humans-season-2-has-been-quite-demoralising">Once Human, started testing its mobile port back in September</a>, and now we <em>finally</em> have a mobile release window: April 2025.</p>
<p>In an end-of-year <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uc00VaAEgfM">livestream</a>, NetEase also revealed what new features Meta-Humans can expect when the mobile version drops, including three new scenarios: Code: Purification, Code: Deviation, and Code: Broken. The latter is a 10-day PvP scenario, whilst the first two are PvE.</p>

<p>We'll also get to experience the all-new Visional Wheel from 16th January, which introduces new wrinkles to gameplay courtesy of new weapons, powers, and rules, as well as making enemies stronger and adversely impacting player sanity. Oh, and there'll be a holiday event running across Christmas and the new year, too.</p>
<p>Once Human is also expected to come to console - complete with cross-platform support - as well. There's still no date on that, though. Sorry.</p>
<p>Interested? Head on over to the <a href="https://www.oncehuman.game/">official website</a> to pre-register your interest now. Right now, over 26 million Meta-Humans have signed up, unlocking a slew of free gifts including cosmetics, skins, decorative items, and crafting resources.</p>
<p>I gave <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/once-human-review">Once Human a modest three out of five stars when I reviewed it for Eurogamer</a>, saying it offers a deeply moreish open world scavenge-em-up, but weak action and generic clutter hold it back. Since launch, however, NetEase has ramped up its premium in-game offerings, including cosmetic loot crates.</p><p>"Not for one moment did I expect a F2P live service offering to be anything other than an unmitigated slog stuffed with the pitfalls and unforced errors of every other game I started and stopped playing, so wildly over-saturated is this genre. But here I am, late at night again, fashioning myself a Slippery When Wet sign to put beside my water tank."</p>
<p>The developer behind NetEase's survival free-to-play horror, Once Human, recently said the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/feedback-on-once-humans-season-2-has-been-quite-demoralising">feedback it's received about the game's second season has been "quite demoralising"</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-game-of-2024<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">In 2024, we saw games where soldiers dove headfirst into alien planets to defend Earth, Princess Zelda led her very own legend, a little robot overcame impossible odds to rescue PlayStation’s greatest characters, and a game of poker played out unlike anything else.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There can be arguments for why any number of our Best Game of 2024 nominees could take home the crown, a stark contrast from last year where Baldur’s Gate 3 and The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom were locked-in favorites. The breadth of games on display, from Black Myth: Wukong to Final Fantasy 7: Rebirth, means picking this year’s winner was harder than usual, but ultimately there was one clear winner. Here’s IGN’s Best Game of 2024.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Game of 2024</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Honorable Mentions</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Before we get to the overall winner, let’s look back at some of the other games from this year that deserve your recognition, starting with our Honorable Mentions. These nominees were much-loved by IGN’s editorial team but didn’t get as many votes as our winner and runners-up.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>The Rise of the Golden Idol</strong></h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/12/theriseofthegoldenidollaunchtrailer-ign-blogroll-1731437713897.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The mystery is afoot in the sequel to 2022’s delightful point-and-click game The Case of the Golden Idol. Set 200 years after the events of the first game, Rise of the Golden Idol returns with more devilishly clever puzzles where you solve various crimes that begin to combine into one grand mystery.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Infinity Nikki</strong></h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/20/infinitynikki-gameplay-blogroll-1732139672495.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The Fashion Nikki series has always had its share of devotees. The dress-up simulator was a pleasant, cozy way to pass the time, collecting different outfits and making your character as cute as they can be. But Infinity Nikki is a bold reinvention, combining all the elements fans loved, along with the amazing outfits they could create, and adding a vibrant, Zelda-like open-world to explore.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Silent Hill 2</strong></h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/19/ign-silent-hill-2-never-played-ep2-thumbnail-oo-1726776383592.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">There were doubts as to whether Bloober Team could faithfully remake one of the most beloved horror games of all time. Even Bloober admitted as much, citing the mixed reception some of their previous horror games have received. But the determination to do right by the source material paid off as Silent Hill 2 delivers one of the scariest – and best – gaming experiences of the year. Faithful to everything that made the original great, while updating the rusty, aging bits beautifully, Silent Hill 2 embodies everything that’s great about the original and then some.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</strong></h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/01/11/princethumb-1704993410690.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The Prince of Persia, one of gaming's forgotten greats, finally got a new entry worthy of the Prince’s title. This 2.5D Metroidvania delivers one of the most exhilarating revivals of any franchise in recent memory, and with its tight controls, excellent action, and swashbuckling storytelling, this is the best Prince of Persia game since Sands of Time.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Black Myth: Wukong</strong></h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/16/blackmythwukong-1726515688801.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Black Myth: Wukong captivated audiences ever since its first trailer was revealed, but that was only a part of the story. Yes, the boss fights are epic, and the combat is sublime, but this loving recreation of one of China’s oldest, most beloved stories means millions of players can finally appreciate the legend of the Monkey Prince in a whole new way.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Animal Well</strong></h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/02/09/animalwellgameplaytrailer-ign-blogroll1-1675960235640.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the earliest surprises of the year was Animal Well. On the surface, it’s another well-made homage to past 2D Metroidvania games. But the deeper you go, the more you realize Animal Well isn’t all that it appears. While the core gameplay and platforming are excellent, you quickly discover there’s a massive puzzle at the heart of it all. So take out your notebook and get ready to put your brain to work to uncover the truth behind Animal Well.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Runner-Up: Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/13/indianajones-thumb-1734054378637.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Next up are games that were oh-so-close to being crowned Game of the Year, but narrowly missed out to the overall winner. MachineGames is back with another Nazi-punching blockbuster. And no, this isn’t a new Wolfenstein game. Instead, the Swedish studio has endeavored to bring one of cinema’s greatest heroes into the modern gaming age. Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is essentially a truly great Indiana Jones movie brought to life. And by truly great, we mean up there with the original trilogy. Buoyed by Troy Baker’s frankly insane portrayal of Harrison Ford’s iconic archeologist, The Great Circle feels like a dream come true for anyone who grew up enraptured by movies like The Last Crusade and Raiders of the Lost Ark.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Indy was never a shoot ‘em up hero; instead he used his brains as well as his brawn to solve ancient riddles and punch out bad guys, and that’s something MachineGames has wonderfully adapted here. Whether it’s exploring the ancient catacombs of The Vatican or sneaking up on fascists and bonking them over the head, The Great Circle literally puts you into the dirt-caked shoes of Indiana Jones, and it turns out it’s every bit as fun and exciting as we imagined.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Runner-Up: The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/27/blogroll-thumbnail-1727407554384.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">“Why is it called The Legend of Zelda if it stars Link?” is a question most have asked at one point in their life. Well, ask no more as Echoes of Wisdom puts Zelda in charge of her own legend in this new top-down adventure game. Visually similar to the 2019 remake of The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening, Echoes of Wisdom is very much a true Zelda game, complete with the classic puzzles and dungeons the series is known for.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Its creators have clearly learned from more recent games in the series too, and even though Echoes of Wisdom is more of a “classic” Zelda experience, the freeform creativity of Breath of the Wild is present thanks to the Echoes mechanic that lets Zelda conjure whatever item and enemy she encounters, leading to all kinds of madcap solutions. Stuck on the other side of a ledge? Just stack a bunch of beds together to cross. Duh.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Runner-Up: Helldivers 2</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/12/hd2-blog-1709811363355-1715480666596.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Are you doing your part in the war to save our galaxy? If not, jump into Helldivers 2 and start blasting away at alien and robot scum. Arrowhead Game Studios delivered one of the new live-service games of the year with the sequel to its isometric alien shooter. Reimagined as a squad-based third-person shooter, Helldivers 2 is both a satirical take on the military-industrial complex while also being an addictive blast thanks to its potent mix of high-powered weaponry, devastating orbital drop missiles, and a spirit of Earthian patriotism.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Runner-Up: Final Fantasy 7: Rebirth</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/02/21/finalfantasyviirebirth-review-blogroll-1708556006533.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">After the prelude that was Final Fantasy 7: Remake, we finally get to the heart of the adventure in the second in Square Enix’s planned trilogy. Final Fantasy 7: Rebirth encompasses some of the most important moments from the original, but more than that stands on its own as a brilliant open world RPG.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What stands out almost immediately is how much love Square Enix has for these characters. It’s clear Square Enix wants players to spend as much time as they can with Cloud, Aerith, Tifa, Barrett, and Red XIII, providing plenty of side quests and minigames, and expanding entire moments so that we can all spend just hang with the gang some more before they resume their mission in the fight against Sephiroth. It makes these moments all the more valuable too, given the ending to Rebirth and the approaching finale.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Runner-Up: Astro Bot</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/30/astrosbot-1717108957666.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Astro Bot’s life began as a humble mascot for the Playroom tech demo. Anytime Sony had some new hardware to show off — whether it was the PS VR headset, or the PlayStation 5 — Astro Bot was there to guide players through the ins-and-outs of whatever new system Sony wanted to show off. But with Astro Bot, the adorable little mascot finally takes center stage.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This colorful, vibrant 3D platformer isn’t just a showcase for the PS5’s powerful GPU and fast SSD, because between the unbridled level of creativity in each level and the controller-stressing difficulty of some of the harder challenge runs, Astro Bot is pure delight and wonderment. Every ability Astro Bot plays around with — from inflating into a balloon or punching enemies with bungee fists — never fails to amuse even the most hardened gamer. I don’t say this lightly, but PlayStation might have just found its answer to Nintendo’s Mario. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Runner-Up: Dragon Age: The Veilguard</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/08/dragonage-storysofar-blogroll-1731090586531.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">After a brief interlude into the live-service genre with games like Anthem, and a perhaps ill-advised attempt to rush out another Mass Effect game with Mass Effect: Andromeda, BioWare has gone back to what it knows best – a good old-fashioned, dungeon-crawling RPG full of delightful characters, witty dialogue, and the chance to create a character who looks and talks exactly the way you want them to. But while BioWare may have opted for a back-to-basics approach to storytelling, there is one area of major improvement: the combat.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s not unfair to say this is the best a BioWare game has ever played, from its sword-and-sorcery combat to even the way you traverse the myriad of dungeons and mystical locales. While we’re only one game into the BioWare renaissance, all eyes are back on the storied studio.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Runner-Up: Balatro</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/01/24/balatroreleasedatetrailer-ign-blogroll-1706114330757.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">“It’s just a poker game with some roguelike mechanics,” I remember saying to friends, incredulously, when they first told me they spent all night playing a little game called Balatro. “How good could it be?” Turns out after tens of thousands of poker hands and hundreds of hours spent playing, Balatro still has me wrapped around its fingers. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">A lot can be said about Balatro’s addictive qualities and how it has this magnetic ability to get you to play just one more round. The reason for Balatro’s rapid ascendency is how it took one of America’s oldest games and refashioned it for one of gaming’s most popular genres, the roguelike. The combination of classic poker rules and randomized Joker and Tarot cards that augment your combos and bump up your high score so you can get to the next round is pure gaming bliss. Balatro is built on creating seemingly endless moments of elation and devastation in equal measures. All you have to do is play your cards right… literally.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Winner:<strong> Metaphor: ReFantazio</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/24/metaphorign-1724474565097.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">For years, Atlus’ cult-RPG Persona went from being a cool underground RPG series from Japan to one of the biggest franchises in modern gaming. But with Metaphor: ReFantazio, it’s clear the developers behind Persona were seeking to push themselves to new heights. Trading in the modern-day Japanese high school setting for a pure fantasy world full of long-eared knights and bat-like ninjas, Atlus’ Studio Zero has created an incredible and timely meditation on political strife and demagoguery. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">After the death of the King, the United Kingdom of Euchronia, divided by racial prejudice among its citizens, begins the process of holding its very first popular election that kickstarts a grand, cross-continental adventure. For anyone familiar with the Persona series, you’ll find familiar hallmarks here. Players split their time crawling through difficult dungeons full of horrifying monsters, while spending free moments building up relationships with various party members and inhabitants around the country.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But while the Persona games took these quiet moments to reaffirm the virtues of youthful friendships, Metaphor uses these times to tackle headier questions. What defines a knight’s duty, or the responsibilities of those born into wealth? Can one ever heal from the pains of racism, and is religious tolerance a foolhardy endeavor? These aren’t easy questions to address but are asked plainly throughout Metaphor’s 70-hour playtime.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Studio Zero refrains from giving clear-cut answers to these questions, it instead acknowledges the virtues of empathy, kindness, and strength in the face of overwhelming fear and hatred that can take root in an uncertain world where leaders promise salvation in exchange for unwavering loyalty. Wrap these philosophical musings in a stylish, turn-based RPG that looks and feels stupendous — complete with beautiful character designs from artist Shigenori Soejima and music from Shoji Meguro – and you’ll quickly understand why Metaphor: ReFantazio is IGN’s pick for Best Game of 2024.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So congratulations to Metaphor: ReFantazio and Studio Zero, and also to all of our other winners and runner-ups in 2024’s IGN Awards. Be sure to check out our full list of Award Winners for Best Movie, TV Show, and more, and we’ll see you again in 2025 for even more gaming goodness.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Larian has said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-patch-8-due-out-in-2025-adds-12-new-subclasses-and-loads-more">Patch 8 is Baldur’s Gate 3’s last major update</a>, with the developer moving on to brand new games away from the Dungeons &amp; Dragons universe.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Patch 8 stress test build is set to go live in January, Larian said in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1086940/view/538840670729666668" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a post on Steam</a>. It will be available to players on PC via Steam, and on console via Xbox and PlayStation. GOG and Mac players do not have access. The <a href="https://larian.com/stress-test-register" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">form for registering interest</a> is live now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Larian said it wants to "rigorously" test Patch 8 for instability or gameplay issues before it comes out. “With your help, we’ll be able to keep an eye on any funny business,” the developer said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Part of this is testing crossplay. "Bringing crossplay to a game the size of Baldur’s Gate 3 has been no easy task," Larian explained, "and we want your help to test-drive this new functionality.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Share the stress test registration link to summon your friends and settle in for a crossplay campaign, or head to the Larian Studios Discord Server to look for a group to play with."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Supported mods “should” remain free of issues, but the stress test will hopefully turn up any issues mods might have interacting with Patch 8 features.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Patch 8 is Baldur's Gate 3's last major update, Larian has promised to continue to support the game's modders, with “big updates still to come,” including more functionality “to let you tell your own stories.” Official mod tools were released in September, and since then players have uploaded more than 3,000 mods and downloaded over 70 million.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Larian said it’s winding down mod curation for consoles during the holiday season. It’ll pick back up again in the new year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

                <p>Ubisoft has released a new game called <a href="https://edenonline.ubisoft.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Captain Laserhawk: The Game</a>, which is a top-down multiplayer shooter that utilizes NFTs and blockchain technology. It's currently in early access on PC and somehow features Rayman.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/500114/ubisoft-nft-game-captain-laserhawk-game-file" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game File's Stephen Totilo</a>, the game is based on the Netflix show Captain Laserhawk: A Blood Dragon Remix, which itself is based on the Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon spin-off. In Captain Laserhawk: The Game, Rayman is simply the announcer for deathmatches, so he's not actually playable.</p><p>The game requires players to have a Niji Warrior NFT to play. A Rayman profile picture can also be purchased for 750 virtual coins and attached to your Niji Warrior NFT. That's pretty much the extent of Rayman's involvement in this game. Ubisoft has quietly released this game to little fanfare, as there aren't many social media posts even acknowledging its existence outside of a few <a href="https://medium.com/@UBISOFT-CAPTAIN-LASERHAWK" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Medium posts</a>.</p><p>NFTs were a hot topic a few years ago, as companies like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-and-ea-executives-are-big-believers-in-nfts/1100-6497712/" data-ref-id="1100-6497712">Electronic Arts, Take-Two</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/square-enix-says-there-will-be-10000-characters-in-its-nft-game/1100-6512348/" data-ref-id="1100-6512348">Square Enix</a> vouched for them.

            <p>A video game charting the true story of the Nakba, the ethnic cleansing of Palestinian Arabs in 1948, has secured three-quarters of its <a href="https://www.launchgood.com/v4/campaign/dreams_on_a_pillow">crowdfunding goal</a> with over three weeks still to go.</p>
<p>Dreams on a Pillow - a "pseudo-3D stealth adventure game about a land full of people being made into a people without land" - tracks Omm, a young mother from an olive farmers' family in al-Tantura. With Omm, you'll traverse historical events and stories of the Nakba as she attempts an escape towards Lebanon in the North.</p>

<p>The crowdfunding page explains that Palestinian game developer Rasheed Abueideh is "asking for your support and blessing as he sets out on his largest game project so far, which has been a dream of his for almost a decade". To date, it has realised £104.5K of the £155,823 Abueideh seeks to raise and is set to close on 13th January.</p>
<p>"Almost exactly a decade ago, as an Israeli invasion tore through Gaza, Rasheed Abueideh recognised the power of games: they let players step into someone else’s reality," the description explains.</p>
<p>"Not long after Rasheed began development of Liyla &amp; The Shadows of War, a game that brought to life the harsh realities of living under invasion, apartheid, &amp; occupation. The development was fraught with obstacles and rejections: Apple declared the game 'too political', and temporarily banned the game - and while publishing funding in the games industry were aggressively funding games, a Palestinian game was deemed 'too controversial'. Rasheed persevered, and Liyla became a global phenomenon."</p>
<p>Abueideh said Dreams on a Pillow is "proof that games can tell the stories of anyone, anywhere". For more, <a href="https://www.launchgood.com/v4/campaign/dreams_on_a_pillow">head on over to the crowdfunding page</a>, where pledges range from £24 to £8000.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Black Desert continues to get updates, with new classes and new content added to the game all the time. Most recently, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-desert-onlines-new-expansion-is-out-now/">Land of the Morning Light: Seoul expansion</a> was released, where players were taken to Ancient Korea, where they could explore architecture, meet new characters, and fight off new enemies in the expansion. Today, it's been announced that the new gunslinging class, Deadeye, is available in early access. Those who want the opportunity to try out Deadeye will be able to go through the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.naeu.playblackdesert.com/en-US/News/Detail?groupContentNo=7956&amp;countryType=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Black Desert Global Lab</a>, where you'll get to experiment with the class' revolvers, shotgun, and Lil' Devil.</p>
<p>This announcement comes after Pearl Abyss marked a decade of Black Desert at Calpheon Ball, which is a global community event that took place at the Suwon Messe in South Korea. For those unable to attend, the event was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlI-kQ6MCew" target="_blank" rel="noopener">live-streamed</a>, and players got to see a ton of announcements unveiled as a celebration of the game's longevity.</p>
<p>The 29th class for Black Desert will be launching worldwide on Black Desert Online and Black Desert Mobile on December 24. Additionally, those who have been wanting to try out this MMORPG but don't want to spend any money on it will be able to get it completely free on Steam right now as a limited-time gift for the holiday season. This comes during the Steam Winter Sale, which runs through January 2.</p>
<p><iframe title="FESTA: A Decade of Adventures 2024 | Black Desert" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jlI-kQ6MCew?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Additionally, as there will be an influx of new players thanks to the game being given away for free, they have boosted progression for those who are just joining. This comes with a 1000% combat EXP boost, which will fast-track progression for those who are on Season Servers. Players will also be able to get Graduation Rewards. These are special materials that players can obtain, which will allow them to craft Ornette's and Odore's Spirit Essence, as well as PEN Boss gear as a reward for completing the latest season.</p>
<p>There are plenty of updates that have been made to Black Desert, including a new mount that has been added to the game, and will be released on January 16, 2025. Black Desert Mobile specifically will also be receiving some major updates, with new content being added to the game in 2025. This includes Awakened Dawnveil Gear, a PvPvE battleground, and Atoraxxion: Vahmalkea, the first zone of Atoraxxion.</p>

			<p>The Monster Hunter Wilds PC performance will be improved over the open beta, as the game will deliver a better experience than the test version with the same hardware configuration.</p>
<p>In a new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWqiYSA-t8E" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pre-Launch Community Update stream</a>, director Yuya Tokuda confirmed that, while the team cannot provide specifics yet regarding PC performance, PC performance will definitely be improved over the <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-struggles-1080p-rtx-4070/">open beta test</a>, so players should expect a better experience on the same hardware as in the test version.</p>
<p>During the stream, it was also confirmed that Monster Hunter Wilds will receive a PlayStation 5 Pro day-one patch that will offer some yet-to-be-detailed improvements over the base model. In addition, it was also confirmed that on base PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X, the Prioritize Graphics mode will target 2160p output resolution upscaled from 3072x1728 resolution and 30 FPS. The Prioritize Framerate mode, on the other hand, will target 2160p output resolution upscaled from 1080p and 60 FPS. On Xbox Series X, Monster Hunter Wilds will feature a single display mode that will target 1080p resolution and 30 FPS gameplay. In all cases, AMD FSR will be used to upscale the rendering resolution to the output resolution and not checkerboard rendering as in the open beta version.</p>
<p>The Monster Hunter Wilds Pre-Launch Community Update also goes over plenty of other changes coming to the final version of the game over the test version, such as weapon-specific changes, the return of hitstop, and more. You can check out the entire stream below.</p>

<p>In its <a href="https://x.com/stalker_thegame/status/1870106910751703303" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">end-of-year message</a> on social media platform X, GSC Game World pledges to continue updating&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>throughout next year. As a reminder, the company recently released a major patch for the game that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-update-1-1-a-life" rel="nofollow">features over 1800 fixes</a>.</p>

<p>Additionally, the studio promises to share the&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>roadmap at the start of 2025, although it doesn't commit to a specific date. It's likely we'll get to see what GSC Game World has planned for its latest game sometime in January or February at the very latest.</p>

Though the update was promised for Xbox Series X|S, it seems to be coming to PS5 as well, if GSC Game World's message is anything to go by.</p>

<p>In the post, GSC Game World says the next-gen patch for "the console versions" of&nbsp;<em>Legends of the Zone Trilogy&nbsp;</em>will arrive next year, and the PC versions of the games will also bring the enhancements introduced by said patch.</p>

<p>They'll include "additional graphical enhancements and other features", as well as mod support, although the latter may be a while away yet.</p>

The first two movies’ post-credits scenes felt like natural extensions of the movies they came from, but <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</em>’s is a bit more disorienting and might have left new fans a bit confused.

It starts with Sonic running around, seemingly racing against Tails and Knuckles as seen earlier in the movie. However, in his haste, the hedgehog takes a wrong turn or two and ends up in a New York state park. A bit far from your home in Green HIlls, Montana, my guy. Once there, he’s greeted by none other than Metal Sonic, an evil synthetic recreation of our hero who Doctor Eggman creates in the games to try and match Sonic’s speed and power. At first, Sonic outmaneuvers Metal as his attacker attempts to obliterate him with an energy blast from a cannon in his arm, but is then suddenly surrounded by a squad of his robotic doppelgangers. Just as they all jump in to take him out, they’re struck by a flying hammer covered in pink chaos energy similar to Sonic’s blue and Shadow’s red. It returns to its wielder: a hooded figure who reveals herself to be a pink hedgehog before the movie cuts to black.</p><figure id="" data-id="50fa5ec864ab98406316a28bf7e88f7a" data-recommend-id="image://50fa5ec864ab98406316a28bf7e88f7a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1366" data-height="768" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Amy stands in front of machinery in the White Space in Sonic Generations." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Amy stands in front of machinery in the White Space in Sonic Generations." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="50fa5ec864ab98406316a28bf7e88f7a" data-recommend-id="image://50fa5ec864ab98406316a28bf7e88f7a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1366" data-height="768" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Amy stands in front of machinery in the White Space in Sonic Generations." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If you’re not one of the long-time fans who likely was popping off at this point in the theater, this hammer-using vigilante is Amy Rose. She originally debuted alongside Metal Sonic in <em>Sonic the Hedgehog CD </em>back in 1993. For most of her early appearances, Amy was defined as Sonic’s one-sided love interest—she was infatuated with the hero, but he was too busy being the fastest hedgehog alive to consider something as trivial as romance. However, as the years have gone on, Amy has become a much more well-rounded character and a team leader in her own right. Historically, she’s added some girlypop spunk to the <em>Sonic </em>cast, and after being a boys club for three movies, the live-action universe is in dire need of that.</p><p>But what are she and Metal Sonic doing in the live-action movies? Again, this scene feels pretty disconnected from the rest of the film, so there’s only so much we can pull from in this short exchange. Given that Sonic has traveled to a different part of the country than we’ve seen in the movies thus far, it’s entirely possible Amy has already been on Earth by herself for some time and decided to be a vigilante in New York. How she got here, where she comes from, and just how she’ll feel about more alien animals in her space remains to be seen, but seeing as <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3 </em>doubles down on the idea of Sonic and his kind being aliens from different places, it stands to reason that Amy is not from Earth, either.</p><figure id="" data-id="ff775c929a58fd96df881621f62ba5c9" data-recommend-id="image://ff775c929a58fd96df881621f62ba5c9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Metal Sonic looks down at something off-screen in Sonic Forces." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Metal Sonic looks down at something off-screen in Sonic Forces." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ff775c929a58fd96df881621f62ba5c9" data-recommend-id="image://ff775c929a58fd96df881621f62ba5c9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Metal Sonic looks down at something off-screen in Sonic Forces." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The bigger question mark in this scene is Metal Sonic. Eggman builds the robot hedgehog in the games, but as we saw not 10 minutes prior, Jim Carrey’s version of the mad scientist has seemingly kicked the bucket in a final moment of heroism. Granted, they also pretended to kill him off at the end of <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 2</em>, but there were more explicit teases to his survival than anything in <em>Sonic 3</em>. Agent Stone, Eggman’s loyal henchman, has seemingly turned a new leaf at the end of the movie as well, so he’s probably off the table. In theory, anyone could have seen all the events of the first three movies and decided to create a robot version of Sonic, but there’s still the question of why. That’s the major difference between this post-credits scene and previous ones; this one feels almost abstract, introducing new ideas and characters who have no clear, direct connection to what happened in the movie it bookends. I wouldn’t be surprised if this scene is featured in <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 4</em>, maybe 10 to 15 minutes into the film with more context to fill in these gaps. But for now, the only thing we really know as a result of this scene is who the new players will be in the next film.</p><p>The second post-credits scene is much shorter and more straightforward. We see that one of Shadow’s inhibitor rings has made a small crater on Earth after it fell to the planet during the final battle in space. The shot lingers briefly before we see Shadow walk into the frame and pick it up. It’s not much, but it confirms that Shadow survived the destruction of the Eclipse Cannon and will be around for the next movie. That’s not too surprising. <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3 </em>is heavily based on <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em>, in which Shadow is presumed dead after the final battle, only to return in <em>Sonic Heroes</em> after being rescued by Eggman. There are reports of plans for a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.patreon.com/posts/115749707?utm_campaign=postshare_creator&amp;utm_content=android_share&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/115749707?utm_campaign=postshare_creator&amp;utm_content=android_share" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shadow-centric spin-off</a></span>, too, so of course they didn’t kill him off for good.</p><p>Overall, I’m starting to wonder if <em>Sonic 4</em> could be a loose adaptation of <em>Sonic Heroes</em>. Metal Sonic is the primary antagonist of that game, and if Shadow’s reported spin-off introduces the rest of his team, treasure-hunting spy Rouge the Bat and decommissioned Eggman robot E-123 Omega, they’re already halfway to having most of <em>Heroes</em>’ cast accounted for. Whatever the fourth movie ends up being, <em>Sonic </em>fans have a lot to chew on after the end of <em>Sonic 3</em>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/exclusive-%E2%80%93-cloud-imperium-games-undergoes-major-shake-up-to-hit-deadlines.1066341/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/cloud-imperium-games-major-shake-up/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Star Citizen and Squadron 42 developer Cloud Imperium Games has undergone a significant shake-up to its upper management team to hit its deadlines.</p>



<p>Speaking to sources who wish to stay anonymous as they cannot publically talk about the company’s plans, several top-level executives have been laid off, and other top people at the company have been shifted to different roles.</p>



<p>It’s understood that the changes were starting to be implemented earlier this month, with head honcho Christ Roberts announcing the news to staff in an internal memo following the company’s annual “<a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/comm-link/transmission/20371-Letter-From-The-Chairman" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Letter from the Chairman</a>.” In late November 2024, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cloud-imperium-games-layoffs-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cloud Imperium Games also let go of some of its staff</a>, prominently those in the QA department, as a part of its restructuring efforts.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, Insider Gaming has heard of at least three executives with a combined experience of around 25 years at Cloud Imperium Games who have had their positions terminated. It’s said that announcements of their departures will be announced in due time.</p>



<p>In an internal announcement to employees, Chris Roberts said, To achieve this laser focus [of meeting the release of SQ42 and Star Citizen 1.0], it is more important than ever to ensure we have high-performing and efficient teams working throughout the company. In order to achieve this, I have had to make changes to the structure of our teams from the very top of the company and downwards to ensure we have the right people in the right roles, working in person as much as possible from our most critical year yet.”</p>



<p>Speaking with staff, some believe that the change is to save costs rather than to meet deadlines, with rumors around the office even suggesting that Sandi Gardiner, the wife of Chris Roberts, is to return to the company in a more prominent role. Sandi Gardiner left Cloud Imperium Games in May 2019 but remained on the board of directors.</p>



<p>Several months ago, Insider Gaming released an exclusive report on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-citizens-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">what exactly is happening with Star Citizen’s 12 years of development</a>.</p>

<p>Fortnite has just announced the return of Renegade Raider and Aerial Assault Trooper skins, now available in the OG Season Shop.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-renegade-raider-returns-to-fortnite">Renegade Raider Returns to Fortnite</h2>



<p>After appearing in the original season, the Renegade Raider, the rarest skin, has made its way back to the Fortnite Item Shop. The skin costs 1,200 V-Bucks, but you must unlock it before purchasing it. The OG Season Shop now consists of 4 new cosmetics: the Aerial Assault One Glider, the Aerial Assault Trooper Skin, Renegade Raider Skin and Raider’s Revenge Pickaxe; each of them has to be unlocked by collecting a specific amount of XP before being able to purchase them.&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>Aerial Assault One Glider – 500 V-Bucks (unlocked by collecting 500,000 XP)</li>



<li>Aerial Assault Trooper Skin – 1,200 V-Bucks (unlocked by collecting 1,000,000 XP)</li>



<li>Renegade Raider Skin – 1,200 V-Bucks (unlocked by collecting 1,500,000 XP)</li>



<li>Raider’s Revenge Pickaxe – 1,500 V-Bucks (unlocked by collecting 1,500,000 XP)</li>
</ul>



<p>Additionally, the original owners of Renegade Raider and/or Aerial Assault Trooper from 2017 are receiving a token of appreciation from Fortnite. They will receive an exclusive style for both skins in the spring of 2025. All new cosmetics will be removed from the item store on January 31, 2025, so players have till then to gain the XP.&nbsp;</p>

			<p>Today, the 2025 roadmap for Once Human was revealed, and with it came some very exciting details for those who play the game. The team behind this horror survival game shared details today on the release date for the mobile version of Once Human, new scenarios coming soon, custom servers, and more. If you want to watch the broadcast for yourself, make sure to check out the video below, where you can watch all of the announcements.</p>

<p>Since its initial release in 2024, Once Human has been highly successful; it has ranked among the top sellers on Steam, and the game has seen <a href="https://wccftech.com/once-human-august-update-out-includes-animal-ranching/">consistent updates</a> that add new content, luring players back into the game and providing them with new ways to enjoy the post-apocalyptic world of Once Human. Below is the official roadmap for 2025, where you can see all of the major updates they have planned for the year.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Admittedly, the three new scenarios for Once Human won't be released until much later in the year, with a set release date during Q3 2025. However, the scenarios now have names, which are the following: Code: Purification, Code: Deviation, and Code: Broken. The details of the scenarios have also been announced so players can know what to expect from them when they are released.</p>
<p>Code: Purification is a scenario where the players must prevent pollution from taking over the environment by participating in dynamic events. Players will be tasked with teaming up to clear up the pollution and see the world clearly and unpolluted once more. This scenario has several endings that players can see, depending on the actions that they take during the scenario.</p>
<p>Code: Deviation revolves around the ally Deviations, who are the most popular characters in Once Human. In this scenario, players are tasked with hunting and capturing them, to then fuse them together to create new Deviations to battle against each other in a tournament.</p>
<p>Code: Broken is a PvP free-for-all, where players will get to battle over ten days with randomized events, resources, and apocalyptic superweapons that will cause absolute havoc on the battlefield. Much like Code: Purification, there are multiple endings for this event.</p>
<p>One of the other major announcements is that the mobile version of Once Human will be launching in April 2025. Currently, those who register their interest in the Once Human Mobile version <a href="https://tracking.us.nylas.com/l/6ce931d3de6e45e0ae0c615902ae457b/3/deaf88540e237b9a0062cc0ed5c4ad92a48dca5fd94a93e6393c76c69ba45504?cache_buster=1734626229" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via a link</a> will have the chance to win rewards, such as money, in-game rewards, or even an iPhone.</p>

			<p>Cyberpunk 2077 is not getting a PlayStation 5 Pro patch likely due to the lack of a real path to improve image quality on the system.</p>
<p>Replying to a supporter's question during their weekly podcast, the tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DFClipsChannel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> highlighted how developer CD Projekt Red may have decided not to release a PlayStation 5 Pro patch for their latest game because there was no clear way to offer better image quality, beyond using the console's bigger GPU to enhance the game's Dynamic Resolution Scaling, which is already done via the system's Game Boost feature.</p>
<p>Improving Cyberpunk 2077 ray tracing features could have been among the possibilities on PlayStation 5 Pro, but having been developed with an older SDK, CD Projekt Red didn't have access to certain ray tracing and hardware optimization, and would have had to upgrade SDK first before being able to introduce features like ray-traced reflections or global illumination, something that would have opened more issues and require an engineering effort. Introducing PSSR support, additionally, may not have been worth it, as it may not have offered any substantial improvement over AMD FSR.</p>
<p><iframe title="Cyberpunk 2077: Why Isn't There A PS5 Pro Patch - And What Enhancements Are Possible?" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lz5bowN_SLk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While Cyberpunk 2077 will not get a PlayStation 5 Pro update, CDPR still hasn't abandoned the game entirely. A new update was released <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-update-2-2-adds-several-new-customization-features-and-improved-photo-mode/">last week</a>, introducing new features and improvements, such as new customization options for V, new Photo Mode options and more.</p>
<p>Cyberpunk 2077 is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S and Xbox One. The <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-shiny-firmware-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Phantom Liberty expansion</a> is also available, but only on PC and current generation systems.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pathologic-3-quarantine-2025-prelude-demo</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pathologic-3-quarantine-coming-in-2025-not-quite-a-demo.1066311/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pathologic-3-quarantine-2025-prelude-demo<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Ice-Pick Lodge and publisher HypeTrain Digital have announced&nbsp;<em>Pathologic 3: Quarantine</em>, a sort of prologue episode for the main game that you'll be able to play for free next year.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3199650/view/515196772511908425" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">an announcement post</a>, Ice-Pick Lodge describes&nbsp;<em>Quarantine&nbsp;</em>as a "free prelude" that's "not quite" a demo, although it has similarities to a demo. The studio compares&nbsp;<em>Quarantine&nbsp;</em>to&nbsp;<em>The Marble Nest</em>, a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/505230/view/5156014950378312752" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">teaser</a> released prior to&nbsp;<em>Pathologic 2&nbsp;</em>that Ice-Pick described as a "mood piece".</p>

<p>Despite the similarities,&nbsp;<em>Quarantine&nbsp;</em>won't function in quite the same way as&nbsp;<em>The Marble Nest</em>; rather than being a self-contained story, it'll "showcase fragments of gameplay mechanics, set the stage for the story, and pull back the curtain a bit" with regards to&nbsp;<em>Pathologic 3</em>'s world.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pathologic-3-quarantine-announced-street.jpg?itok=swgWRvEi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pathologic-3-quarantine-announced-street.jpg?itok=XCjK9Yqw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Pathologic 3: Quarantine&nbsp;</em>is designed to set up the main&nbsp;<em>Pathologic 3&nbsp;</em>experience.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Quarantine&nbsp;</em>will, according to Ice-Pick, tie into the events of the main game, and it'll "partially overlap" with&nbsp;<em>Pathologic 3</em>'s intro, but it'll also give you the chance to see unique scenes you won't see in the main game.</p>

<p>You'll also get the chance to get your first glimpse of the Capital, where the Bachelor's lab is located, and you'll get to discover what drove the Bachelor to leave his lab. Along the way, you'll be diagnosing patients and trying to figure out their secrets as you go.</p>

<p>We don't have a release date or even a more specific release window for&nbsp;<em>Pathologic 3: Quarantine&nbsp;</em>yet, but it goes without saying that you can almost certainly expect this free teaser to arrive sometime before the game itself does.</p>




<p><em>Pathologic 3&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pathologic-3-announced-2025" rel="nofollow">announced back in October</a>, although technically speaking, it was actually <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pathologic-2-bachelors-scenario-announced" rel="nofollow">revealed in July 2020</a> as an expansion to&nbsp;<em>Pathologic 2&nbsp;</em>(which is itself both a remake of and sequel of sorts to the original&nbsp;<em>Pathologic</em>).</p>

<p>As such, in&nbsp;<em>Pathologic 3</em>, you'll play as&nbsp;Daniil Dankovsky, also known as the Bachelor. You arrive in a small town beset by the plague, and it's up to you to discover said plague's mysterious origins and see if you can put a stop to it.</p>

<p><em>Pathologic 3&nbsp;</em>is due to land on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3199650/Pathologic_3/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a> sometime next year. You can also wishlist the standalone prelude&nbsp;<em>Quarantine&nbsp;</em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3199650/Pathologic_3/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">via Steam</a> if you want to.</p>

It still isn’t a perfect device, but it’s one with potential that continues to grow, and that means you’re likely to be spending more and more time with yours. As such, you may be draining your battery a bit faster, eh?</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196181" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Best Reveals From The Game Awards 2023" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="180" data-playlist="196181,196230,197298" data-current="196181"><div><p>The Best Reveals From The Game Awards 2023</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21718.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>It’s true—the PlayStation Portal’s battery life is actually pretty decent out of the box, promising between 7-9 hours on average. But if you’re on an extended trip somewhere with no ability to charge it, you may want to try extending that life even further. Here are some tips for extending the battery life on your PlayStation Portal.</p><h2 id="h64226"><a id="brightness"></a>Reduce screen brightness</h2><p>This one is a no-brainer. The brighter you keep your screen, the faster your battery will drain. If you’re in a dark room, you should be able to keep the brightness close to its lowest setting, but you may need to increase it again to see the screen in well-lit locations.</p><p>The brightness setting can be accessed on your quick settings tabs, or you can go into Settings &gt; Display and Brightness. You’ll want to do that anyway for the next trick.</p><h2 id="h64227"><a id="light"></a>Turn off the light bar</h2><p>The light bar around the rim of the PlayStation Portal controller looks cool, but it can drain your battery a bit. Since the light doesn’t serve any purpose beyond proof that your device is on, it may be worth disabling altogether.</p><p>Go to Settings &gt; Display and Brightness to turn this feature off. While you’re there, you can also disable the mute button light, though I doubt that tiny light affects the battery much, if at all.</p><h2 id="h64228"><a id="haptics"></a>Turn off the haptics and trigger effects</h2><p>It goes without saying that the PlayStation Portal’s haptic feedback and trigger effects are awesome, but they can also contribute to battery drain in games that frequently use it (this is also true of the PS5’s DualSense controllers). </p><p>If you head to Settings &gt; Controller, you adjust the intensity of these features. I’d recommend turning them all the way off if your goal is to save as much battery as possible, but even just reducing their intensity will help a little.</p><h2 id="h64229"><a id="restmode"></a>Set a reasonable time for entering Rest Mode</h2><p>Lastly, make sure you set a reasonable time for the PlayStation Portal to enter Rest Mode, which will turn the screen off and reduce the amount of power it’s using when you’re not actively using it.</p><p>To adjust this feature, head into Settings &gt; System &gt; Battery. The best time setting would be 30 seconds, but even somewhere around 1-2 minutes should help you reduce battery drain when you’re away from the handheld. </p><p>With all of these settings changed, you should save some battery life on your PlayStation Portal. That means more time to play <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-winter-wonderland-christmas-holiday-level-1851721615&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-winter-wonderland-christmas-holiday-level-1851721615"><em>Astro Bot</em>’s new Christmas level</a></span>!</p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Vessel of Hatred was released in October, adding the Spiritborn class and a new jungle region.</p>
<p>"A polished, bewitching upgrade that sinks its claws into you - featuring perhaps the best character class in Diablo's history," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-review">Diablo 4: Vessel of Hatred review</a>.</p> <div>

<p>However, Diablo now has strong competition from Path of Exile 2, another ARPG that released into early access this month.</p>
<p>Ahead of its launch it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/path-of-exile-2-director-warns-of-queues-this-weekend-due-to-over-a-million-early-access-players">reached one million early access redemptions</a>, and on Steam it quickly reached a peak <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2694490/charts/">concurrent player count</a> of 578,569.</p>
<p>"Soulslike thrills combine with sky-high production values to make Path of Exile 2 a hugely impressive package, even in early access," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/path-of-exile-2-early-access-review">Path of Exile 2 early access review</a>.</p>
<p>Still, its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/path-of-exile-2-not-rewarding-enough-its-developer-admits-amid-incoming-changes">developer admitted the game was "not rewarding enough"</a> as it addressed early feedback and laid out plans to alter its rewards.</p>
<p>Diablo 4 is also available on Xbox Game Pass.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/20/what-we-played-space-marine-2-behemoth-indiana-jones/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>It will probably feel like you’ve got all the time in the world to play games over the next week or two, and my gaming the past seven days has been rather sparse. I’ve dabbled with a little bit of Space Marine 2 and more Darktide – a great one-two punch of big hordes and Warhammer 40K co-op – and dipped a toe back into Helldivers 2 to battle the Illuminate enemies. The definitely make for a good change of pace to the bugs and bots of old, and the new city maps are pretty neat as well.</p>

<p><strong>Gamoc</strong> has played a handful of different games, with The Thaumaturge and Behemoth in for review, and there’s “the ever-present spectre” of Phasmophobia in his life these days. He also briefly gave TemTem a go –&nbsp;“The fact that Palworld is being sued by Nintendo whilst TemTem is out here untouched whilst being the clearest rip off of Pokémon is kinda silly.”</p>
<p>The Edge of Allegoria is on <strong>Aran’s</strong> plate for a review, which he describes as “a classic Game Boy RPG but with the adult themes turned way up.” He’s also played a bit more of Marvel Rivals with Punisher and Star Lord as his go-to characters, continued on with The Witcher 3 and is just leaving White Orchard, and some more Football Manager 2024, “where I’ve had my contract at Valencia renewed for another 3 years. Probably because I’ve consistently got them into European competitions over the last few seasons and won a couple of trophies. The league eludes me though because of Real Madrid and Barcelona.”</p>


<p><strong>Steve’s</strong> week has mostly featured a combination of Indiana Jones and Nine Sols – “both fantastic games with very different styles and level of challenge. It’s been nice to wander around the world of Indy in between bouts of swearing at difficult boss fights – although I do seem to be faring better in Nine Sols now that I’ve unlocked a few more abilities.”</p>
<p><strong>Jim</strong> watched Secret Levels, which had him wanting to go back to finish off the campaign of Space Marine 2… so he did exactly that, and found it an enjoyable romp on the whole. However, most of his play time has been spent with Kingdom Come: Deliverance – “It’s a drastic change of pace compared to Space Marine 2 and one that immerses you in the life of a peasant looking to climb the ranks in medieval society. It’s a game best savoured slowly, and really isn’t for everyone. I’m hoping to roll credits ahead of the sequel’s release.”</p>
<p><strong>Tuffcub</strong> got to check out if Alien: Rogue Incursion was the Alien: Isolation VR game that everyone’s been dreaming about since 2016, but <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/18/alien-rogue-incursion-review/">sadly found out that it isn’t</a>. I guess we hope that Alien: Isolation 2 has VR built in, now?</p>

<p>And we’ll round things out with <strong>Ade</strong>. He’s been playing Lego Horizon Adventures with his son, as a nice change of pace from Minecraft, and Sea of Stars in co-op with his partner. He “me” time has been completely consumed by Unicorn Overlord, though. He recommends that you play the demo and also get hopelessly addicted to it.</p>
<p>Now then, what have you played this week?</p>

While it’s a fact that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24086957/dune-part-two-movie-review"><em>Dune: Part Two</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24079544/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review-ps5"><em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24054862/apple-vision-pro-review-vr-ar-headset-features-price">the Apple Vision Pro</a> all came out in 2024, it’s also hard to believe — they all feel like they happened forever ago.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23998898/2023-best-worst-streaming-gaming-tech-roundup">As with past years</a>, we’re using this as a chance to reminisce. That means stories from our reporters covering the most important or weird trends in tech and culture as well as roundups to help you navigate 2024’s many, many releases across game consoles and streaming services.</p><p>So, before we all head into 2025, take a moment to look back on the things you’ve forgotten about — or catch up on those that you missed altogether.</p></div><section id="updates-section"><ul><li role="article" id="stream-entry-2aea0b74-e2ce-4689-b686-03d57304cf52"></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-2d875479-e31f-457a-a05e-c8653be0edcb"><div><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24305493/apple-arcade-best-games-2024-ios-iphone-ipad">8 great Apple Arcade games for your iPhone or iPad</a></h2><div><figure><span><span></span></span><p><cite>Image: Cath Virginia / The Verge, Getty Images</cite></p></figure></div><p>It was a bit of a weird year for Apple’s subscription gaming service. 2024 saw very few notable exclusives launch on Apple Arcade; instead, the service was fleshed out with a number of big games that you can already play on other platforms. It hasn’t been great for showcasing what makes Apple Arcade unique, but on the other hand, it’s hard to complain too much when it means your subscription now includes <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24082252/balatro-review-poker-roguelike-videogame"><em>Balatro</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/23827123/vampire-survivors-news-announcements-updates-dlc-spinoffs"><em>Vampire Survivors</em></a>. Here’s the best of what came out this year.</p><p>This poker game has been an unexpected hit ever since <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24082252/balatro-review-poker-roguelike-videogame">it launched on PC and consoles at the beginning of the year</a>. It’s sort of like a solo version of poker, only with the gameplay loop of a roguelike, which means that you’ll be collecting rare joker cards to augment your hands as you create a deck capable of turning out absolutely absurd scores. It takes a moment for it to click, but <em>Balatro</em> is particularly well suited to mobile, where you can squeeze in a few quick rounds wherever you are… or accidentally let a few hours go by while you try to complete a run.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24305493/apple-arcade-best-games-2024-ios-iphone-ipad">Read Article &gt;</a></span></p></div></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-4f306230-c99f-45b7-93bf-108a650a43c7"><div><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24305485/smart-rings-2024-smart-rings-oura-samsung-galaxy">2024 in wearables: the year of the smart ring</a></h2><div><figure><span><span></span></span><p><cite>Image: Cath Virginia / The Verge, Getty Images</cite></p></figure></div><p>When you say “wearables,” people generally think of smartwatches. But 2024 was a relatively quiet year for smartwatches, during which iterative updates reigned supreme. That happens in a maturing category. In exchange for polished products, you lose out on the weird frenetic energy — and sometimes ludicrously bad ideas — found when people are trying to figure out how to make a nascent gadget category work. Thankfully, it seems that energy is starting to bubble up with smart rings.</p><p>Smart rings are not new, but in 2024, there was a sort of renaissance for the category. I had an inkling that might be the case back in January, when several smart rings <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/12/24034978/smart-ring-oura-ring-evie-ring-zepp-helio-ces-2024">littered the CES show floor</a>. And then Samsung kicked the door wide open in February by announcing the long-rumored <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24205156/samsung-galaxy-ring-review-smart-ring-wearables">Galaxy Ring</a>. Samsung is a major player in the smartwatch space. For them to branch out into an entirely new wearable category? That’s <em>big</em>. It propels what’s thus far been a niche form factor into the mainstream.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24305485/smart-rings-2024-smart-rings-oura-samsung-galaxy">Read Article &gt;</a></span></p></div></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-e6a573b8-736c-439b-b5c6-a0fe754d8c6b"><div><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24305570/steam-deck-best-games-2024-verified-playable-valve">8 great games for your Steam Deck</a></h2><div><figure><span><span></span></span><p><cite>Image: Cath Virginia / The Verge, Getty Images</cite></p></figure></div><p>The Steam Deck gets better every year, and 2024 was no exception. It’s been my primary gaming device ever since I became a parent, and I love being able to access the humongous library of games available on Steam from wherever I want, whether it’s at home or while the baby is taking a nap at grandma’s house. Valve keeps adding great features via software updates, too, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/5/24289138/steam-game-recording-now-available-all-users">like game recording</a>.</p><p>If you’re just setting up a Steam Deck for the first time — perhaps you’re lucky enough to get one of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/11/24294106/valve-white-steam-deck">limited-edition white models</a> — or you’re dusting off your Deck after a little break, I’ve put together some recommendations of great games from this year, along with one update to a classic.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24305570/steam-deck-best-games-2024-verified-playable-valve">Read Article &gt;</a></span></p></div></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-45020bc3-a00f-4500-9488-d09e9dd3ed0f"><div><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24314116/bluesky-threads-2024-social-media-networks-fediverse-twitter-x">Social networks in 2024: bless this mess</a></h2><div><figure><span><span></span></span><p><cite>Image: Cath Virginia / The Verge, Getty Images</cite></p></figure></div><p>If you had to pick <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23686584/twitter-alternative-social-media-platforms-mastodon-bluesky-activitypub-protocol">a social network winner</a>, it’s probably Threads. Two years ago, after Elon Musk acquired Twitter and announced his intention to ruin it forever, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg saw an opportunity to build a text-first social network. Now, barely 18 months after its launch, Threads has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/16/24322947/mark-zuckerberg-meta-threads-100-million-daily-active-users">more than 300 million users</a> and has been adding <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/26/24306591/threads-35-million-signups-november-growth">a million more every day</a>.</p><p>But Threads isn’t Twitter, and it’s never going to be. Twitter was never the biggest or most successful social network — far from it —&nbsp;but Twitter was at the absolute epicenter of culture for years. It was where politicians went to talk to their constituents and emergency services went to tell people what was happening. It was where newsmakers dropped their scoops first. It was, by a mile, the place you were most likely to have your message actually read — or even replied to! — by an A-list celebrity or your favorite brand. It was a bad business and a frequently badly run company, but Twitter was the most <em>right now </em>place on the internet.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24314116/bluesky-threads-2024-social-media-networks-fediverse-twitter-x">Read Article &gt;</a></span></p></div></li></ul></section></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
