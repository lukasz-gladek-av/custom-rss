            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/04/test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown-preview-the-first-truly-social-racer/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>With a freshly announced <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/30/test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown-release-date-confirmed-for-september/">release date in September</a>, the long wait for a new Test Drive Unlimited is coming to an end. Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown will invite players to visit Hong Kong Island for a unique driving and racing experience.</p>
<p><iframe title="Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown - Release Date Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8GUCrMPJgkE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>You see, Solar Crown is as much about the racing as it is the social aspects. Most racing games only give a cursory nod to your avatar’s customisation with a bundle of race suits to wear, but Solar Crown doesn’t just let you change how you look when in the cockpit and on the podium, it invites you to step out of the car at various times. There’s the lobby of the Solar Hotel – a fictional spire built into the real-world setting – and there’s both open and private areas to the hubs for the Streets and the Sharps, the two rival car racing gangs of the city. You’ll even walk around car dealerships, the workshop where you can upgrade your car, and more.</p>


<p>Starting by picking a Nissan 370Z as my starter car, the handling is fun and accessible by default. Of course, racing game experts will want to switch to having fewer assists, letting more of a car’s natural tendencies come through as you push it to the ragged edge in a race. KT Racing promise individualised handling and characteristics for all of the more than 100 cars that will be in the game at launch, and I look forward to more time with the game to see how they’ve pulled this off.</p>
<p>After picking that first car, though, players will have to be willing to embrace a tangibly slower pace to the progression. Where modern Forza Horizon games will fling so many cars at you to the point that they become almost meaningless, Solar Crown wants to make everything feel earned and desirable. Getting a new car should be exciting, it should be something that you want to drive and master, to upgrade to the max over time as you look to rise up the rankings and the leaderboards.</p>


<p>Through upgrades, parts changes, and driving presets, cars will be adaptable. Of course, you can soup things up to become a street racing demon with slicker tyres, engine upgrades and more, but there’s plenty of off-road areas to explore on Hong Kong Island, and you could make that street car happier on gravel and dirt paths. Alternatively, save up and buy a truck or SUV, which can handle the bumpy uneven terrain much more easily.</p>
<p>Of course, modern gaming sensibilities have shifted over the last 15 years, and so KT Racing has a tightrope to walk to make Solar Crown still feel rewarding to those used to more instantaneous gratification. While they want you to play for many, many hours to earn enough cash to buy a Pagani Zonda, for example, they won’t gate-keep the applicable hypercar races quite so hard, with a lower-priced option available to take part while you save up. And there will also be car-specific events, such as the race we encountered that demanded we first go and grab a cheap and cheerful 500 Abarth to take part.</p>
<p>While you might have to wait to take a car into competition or to show off to your friends that you’ve managed to buy it, that doesn’t mean you can’t try it out. At any time you can visit one of the various opulent car dealerships, each dedicated to a particular country or region, and test drive one of the cars they have there – it’s in the title, after all. This gives you a tight two-minute window to see what a car is all about, and see if it’s actually the car you want to save up for and buy.</p>

<p>One gaming trend that Solar Crown <em>is</em> following is the shift to always online shared spaces and seasons of live content. For one thing, each race you look to take part in is preceded by some matchmaking to try and combine AI with real racers, and there will be other players doing their own thing on the island as you roam, or in the social areas that you wander around with your avatar. Each season will have a competition for players to take part in, looking to rise up the ranks from bronze, silver and up through to the Solar Court, which grants access to a special featured car – an ultimate flex to demonstrate their racing prowess. The very best player will be crowned as the Solar King or Solar Queen – one per region and per platform.</p>
<p>KT Racing has been inviting a select few fans and community members to check out the game and give feedback over the past year, and that’s led to some tweaks and changes that will be ready for the game’s launch. A much-requested feature, you will now have a personal garage space that lets you view up to six of your cars, inspect them in private and get in physically before choosing to join the open world – the slightest disappointment is that you can’t drive out of the garage at this point. For this demo, it also felt like the game was just a little bit too restrained early on, forcing me to repeat races and hunt down speed traps to earn the experience needed to level up and unlock both car upgrades and a new set of races. Our demo wasn’t that of the full game, but getting the early game flow right is the high-wire act that KT Racing will have to get just right for the final release.</p>

<p>On the whole, I feel that Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown is coming together rather well. There’s so many more individual touches that show the different attitude and tone that it has to other open-world racing games, which will make it a breath of fresh air compared to the competition. I can’t wait to revisit Hong Kong Island in just a few months time.</p>

The Dungeons of Hinterberg team has announced a demo for its upcoming Austrian-based Zelda-like adventure.
</p>
<p>
This demo will allow players to explore dungeons - including one described as "gravity-defying" - visit the Glacier Overworld and meet new characters during a full in-game day cycle.
</p>
<p>
The game's first playable demo will go live later this week, on 8th June, over on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1983260/Dungeons_of_Hinterberg/">Steam</a>, where you can also add it to your wishlist.

<p>
Dungeons of Hinterberg has caught the attention of many members of the Eurogamer team. After taking part in a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dungeons-of-hinterberg-has-stolen-my-heart">hands-off demo at Summer Games Fest</a> last year, our Chris Tapsell already felt the game looked "brilliant". He then managed to actually go <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-weve-been-playing-indie-preview-special-edition">hands-on with it earlier this year at GDC</a>, and his praise remained. "This game plays like a dream vacation - it's a delight," he wrote. 
</p>
<p>
These feelings were echoed by our Donlan, who has also been hands on with Dungeons of Hinterberg already. In his feature <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dungeons-of-hinterberg-is-about-a-holiday-which-is-why-everything-feels-so-important">Dungeons of Hinterberg is about a holiday - which is why everything feels so important</a>, he expressed his delight at the game's art style, puzzles and world.
</p>
<p>
"There are hubs and areas to explore dotted with fast travel, but while I love uncovering treasure chests and new dungeons, there's a pleasure found purely in the fiction of where you are," he wrote. "Yesterday I climbed a hill and found a little restaurant at the top. It meant far more to me than any RPG trinket would. I took lots of screenshots and felt like I was on holiday, like I was exploring a place that I wouldn't get to stay in long term, and so I had to make the most of it. Wonderful stuff."
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/austrian-zelda-like-dungeons-of-hinterberg-gets-release-date">Dungeons of Hinterberg is set for full release next month</a>, on 18th July. It will be available across Xbox Series X/S and Steam, including a day one release on Game Pass.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-yakuza-tv-show-is-coming-out-on-amazon-prime-in-october.888921/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-yakuza-tv-show-is-coming-out-on-amazon-prime-in-october<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>Amazon will air a live-action TV series based on Sega's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-franchises/yakuza">Yakuza</a> games in October this year, says the streaming service. Like A Dragon: Yakuza will be a six-part series following characters in the criminal underbelly of Kamurocho, set to straddle between two time periods: 1995 and 2005. The series "showcases modern Japan and the dramatic stories of these intense characters, such as the legendary Kazuma Kiryu, that games in the past have not been able to explore,” said Amazon, who are releasing it through Prime Video, just like their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/well-whaddya-know-therell-officially-be-a-season-two-of-amazons-very-popular-fallout-tv-show">Fallout series</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Exactly what the plot of the show will be remains to be seen. But it will follow "the life, childhood friends and the repercussions of the decisions of a fearsome and peerless Yakuza warrior with a strong sense of justice, duty, and humanity," according to <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/like-a-dragon-yakuza-live-action-series-sega-game-prime-video-1236024275/">Variety</a>. That sounds like our boy Kiryu for sure. </p>
<p>Work on the TV show was first announced <a href="https://variety.com/2020/film/news/yakuza-movie-sega-video-game-1234781210/">back in 2020</a>. And word later came out about the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/yakuzagames/comments/14lfd0z/ryoma_takeuchi_and_kento_kaku_to_play_kiryu_and/">actors and directors</a> involved. Hard-punching bastion of justice Kiryu Kazama will be played by Ryoma Takeuchi, for example, who played the protagonist in Kamen Rider Drive. I've not seen any Kamen Rider, so I'm not qualified to tell you if this actor is good at channelling the indignant stiffness of a deeply annoyed statue. But that is what is required of him.</p>
<p>The series is being directed by Take Masaharu and Takimoto Kengo, and the original writer of the first game's script, Masayoshi Yokoyama, is on board as an executive producer. He suggests he was reluctant at first but decided to get involved. “Since the day I first put pen to paper on the original Yakuza‘s script," he said, "I’ve never once thought about revisiting any of my work on the series. It’s because I understand all too well the challenges and hardships that come with remaking a finished title. However, if I were ever sent to the past through some kind of cosmic joke, this is the experience I’d want to create.”</p>
<p>We are quite fond of the Yakuza series here in the treehouse. Ed was into <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth">Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth</a> when it came out earlier this year. "It's a wonderful, happy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/spawn-point-the-best-jrpgs-for-total-beginners">JRPG</a> and it will never fail to brighten my day," he said in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-review">his review</a>. "Thank goodness for Yakuza."</p>
<p>One of my favourite scenes in Yakuza is when Kiryu sees some chumps <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl25uwGLATc">throwing rocks at a puppy</a>. The father figure of Tokyo catches a rock in mid-air, inches from the dog's face. Then proceeds to destroy the goons in the only way he knows how. If the TV show adapts this one scene, I will be satisfied.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/crash-team-racing-modded-version-now-supports-online-multiplayer-mode-and-pc-compatibility/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/crash-team-racing-%E2%80%9Cmodded%E2%80%9D-version-now-supports-online-multiplayer-mode-and-pc-compatibility.888918/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/crash-team-racing-modded-version-now-supports-online-multiplayer-mode-and-pc-compatibility/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Well, a modding team has done something intriguing to witness as they integrate multiplayer and PC compatibility into the original Crash Team Racing.</p>
<p>It's surprising what the modding community can do for titles, especially when it comes to reviving them and adding new features. The latest project by a modding team focuses on bringing an online mode into the game. In a demo of the title, the players in the actual game were connected through a worldwide network, with each player in a completely different country. Surprisingly, there weren't any sort of latency issues, and the game ran perfectly.</p>
<p><iframe title="OnlineCTR - The PS1 Crash Team Racing Online Experience (Launch Trailer)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fxhz0EMHlCE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Apart from the online play mode, the modded Crash Team Racing also supports "unofficial" compatibility with the PC platform, and the modding team utilizes DuckStation, the PS1 emulator, to do so. Moreover, the title runs at a stable 60 FPS, ensuring smooth gameplay despite being a "tuned" version of a game that was released almost two decades ago. In terms of the experience itself, the modded title allows you to pair up with up to 8 players with multiple tracks and characters similar to the original game.</p>
<p>Well, if you are interested in checking out "Online Crash Team Racing," you can visit the dedicated website <a href="https://www.online-ctr.com/">here</a>. In&nbsp;order to play it on PC, you'll need to have the DuckStation emulator installed as well. Playing the title is a nostalgic experience, and with the multiplayer feature, it's definitely worth trying out.</p>
<p>PC players might be especially interested since they were unfortunately left out of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/crash-team-racing-nitro-fueled/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Crash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled</a>, the remastered version launched in 2019 for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch.</p>

		<p>Amazon’s Prime Video is following up their smash hit Fallout series with another video game adaption based on Sega’s Yakuza series. Because reasons the title has been reversed and the series is call Like a Dragon: Yakuza, rather than Yakuza: Like a Dragon which is the title of the 2020 video game.</p>
<p>There series will span six episodes and is a crime drama directed by Take Masaharu (“100 Yen Love”) and Takimoto Kengo (“Kamen Teacher”) and Takeuchi Ryoma will star as Kiryu Kazuma.</p>


<p>“The series’ story is set in two time periods, 1995 and 2005, and follows the life, childhood friends and the repercussions of the decisions of a fearsome and peerless Yakuza warrior with a strong sense of justice, duty, and humanity,” say Amazon.</p>

<p>“I have poured out my heart, soul, and the experience that I have garnered over 35 years into ‘Like a Dragon: Yakuza’,” said director Take.</p>

<p>“The unfettered appeal for Japanese content from within Japan and other parts of the world has been growing exponentially. While Prime Video Japan continues to offer a variety of content across genres, adapting an internationally popular game franchise that has such deep resonance and layered characters presents a unique charm and makes for an extremely compelling watch,” said James Farrell, head of international originals, Amazon MGM Studios.</p>
<p>There series will be released in two batches of three episodes with the first landing on October 25th 2024 and the remaining episodes following a week later on November 1st.&nbsp; It’s not explicitly stated but it seems this will be a Japanese langauge series but will come with subtitles and dubs for over thirty languages.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-9-remake-development-is-very-far-along-leaker-claims-said-to-be-a-multi-platform-title/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Development on the rumored Final Fantasy 9 Remake is progressing well, and Square Enix might very well release the game before April 2025.</p>
<p>At least, that's what known SEGA/Atlus leaker 'Midori' said on X some hours ago. Last month, after <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-ix-remake-faithful-modest-budget/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">various claims</a> from other leakers, 'Midori' <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-ix-remake-is-happening-confirms-leaker-unlike-ffx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> that the remake is indeed happening. No additional details were shared last month, but the leaker (known for his SEGA/Atlus leaks), has now provided more information about the remake. According to 'Midori', the remake was initially outsourced to a different development, but development has shifted as publisher Square Enix wasn't satisfied. Although the leaker can't confirm a release date for the remake, development on the title is now "very far along", and could be released before the end of Square Enix's current fiscal year (which runs through March 31, 2025).</p>
<p>"According to conversations, the title was originally outsourced to another developer, but SQEX was not satisfied and development shifted", the leaker wrote on X.</p>
<p>'Midori' <a href="https://x.com/MbKKssTBhz5/status/1797838848011227419" target="_blank" rel="noopener">added</a>, "Development of this title is now very far along, but I do not have any firm information on the scope of this title or a firm release period right now. This title could release before the end of this fiscal year, but I am not certain right now."</p>
<p>While it's possible that Final Fantasy 9 Remake, which is said to be released as a multi-platform title, will be present at the Xbox Showcase this Sunday, the leaker advises to keep expectations in check as he isn't sure that this is the case.</p>
<div data-md="221" data-hveid="CBEQAA" data-ved="2ahUKEwiOsYbV1sGGAxUA_rsIHWaCDK8QnKEBKAB6BAgWEAA">
<p>"There are plans for new information on some SQEX titles at the Xbox Showcase. I don’t know if this title will be at the showcase. So it is good to keep expectations low right now. And this is a title that is currently planned for release on multiple platforms", the leaker also said on X.</p>
</div>

<p>Personally, we would love to see a remake of 2000's Final Fantasy 9, which was released for the original PlayStation, and is considered one of the best entries in the franchise.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/like-a-dragon-yakuza-tv-series-on-amazon-prime-later-this-year<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
Amazon will release a new live-action TV series based on Sega's Yakuza games later this year.
</p>
<p>
Like a Dragon: Yakuza will be exclusive to Prime Video and release globally on 25th October.
</p>
<p>
Japanese actor and model Ryoma Takeuchi (who cameoed in Detective Pikachu, among other roles) will take on the lead role of Kazuma Kiryu, while Masaharu Take (The Naked Director) will direct.
</p>

</figure>
<p>
The series will span two time periods - 1995 and 2005 - and will follow "the life, childhood friends, and repercussions of the decisions of Kazuma Kiryu, a fearsome and peerless Yakuza warrior with a strong sense of justice, duty, and humanity". 
</p>
<p>
This hints it'll be, perhaps, based on the first game in the series, which takes place in 2005 following events 10 years before.
</p>
<p>
"I am truly honoured to be given the opportunity to play the role of Kazuma Kiryu, a beloved character and the game series," said Takeuchi. "I strongly felt that I was willing to put my life on the line. Audience will enjoy the show's human drama and conflict that unfolds around Kazuma Kiryu. Moreover, please take a look Kiryu's intense fighting scenes with the Dragon tattoo on his back."
</p>
<p>
Take said he has "poured out [his] heart, soul, and the experience that [he has] garnered over 35 years into Like a Dragon: Yakuza", noting 2024 is fittingly the year of the dragon.
</p>
<p>
"Since the day I first put pen to paper on the original Yakuza's script, I've never once thought about revisiting any of my work on the series," said Masayoshi Yokoyama, head of Ryugagotoku studio and executive producer on the TV series. "It's because I understand all too well the challenges and hardships that come with remaking a finished title. However, if I were ever sent to the past through some kind of cosmic joke, this is the experience I'd want to create."
</p>
<p>
He added: "While the games let you experience their world through the subjective lens, this adaptation will be the ultimately objective way to enjoy the show. I have no doubt that fans of the series will be drawn to how it brings the games to life and adds new surprises."
</p>
<p>
The TV series is yet another indication of the success of the series, which has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-sammy-reports-best-financial-performance-for-a-decade-despite-european-studio-disappointment">sold 21.3m units in total</a>. The most recent game, this year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-hits-1m-sales-in-first-week">Infinite Wealth, sold 1m units in its first week</a> and was the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-is-series-biggest-steam-launch-to-date">series' biggest Steam launch ever</a>.



</p>
<p>
Ironically enough, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/yakuza-was-flat-out-rejected-by-sega-in-its-first-proposal-says-series-creator">Sega "flat out rejected" the first proposal for the game</a>, presuming it wouldn't attract mass audiences.

</p>
<p>
Yet the TV series is likely to do just that, especially following the success of Amazon's Fallout series. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-fallout-tv-show-was-watched-by-65m-people-in-its-first-two-weeks">Fallout was watched by 65 million people</a> in its first 16 days of release and has already been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-fallout-show-officially-renewed-for-second-season">renewed for a second season</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/just-cause-developer-announces-layoffs-and-studio-closures-including-one-office-open-less-than-a-year<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>Just Cause developer Avalanche is shutting two of its five offices, one of which had been open for less than 12 months.</p>
<p>Last night, the company announced it will close down its New York and Montreal studios. As a result of these closures, 50 employees will be laid off, equating to roughly nine percent of Avalanche's overall workforce.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://avalanchestudios.com/stories/statement-nymr">statement</a> shared on Avalanche's website, the studio called these closures an "exceptionally difficult decision", but one it believed "necessary to ensure a stable and sustainable future for the company".</p>

</figure>
<p>"Our focus is now on supporting all Avalanchers through this challenging time," it continued. "We're grateful for the invaluable contributions of those leaving and remain committed to creating incredible gaming experiences for our players."</p>
<p>Avalanche opened its New York office in <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/avalanche-opens-new-york-studio">2011</a>, while the <a href="https://avalanchestudios.com/stories/avalanche-studios-group-expands-to-montreal">Montreal office only opened in October last year</a>, following the acquisition of Monster Closet Games. At this time, the company called this acquisition "a fantastic way to start our new chapter".</p>
<p>Avalanche is sadly one of many studios to suffer layoffs and closures this year. According to an archive tallying layoffs across the industry, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games-industry-layoffs-surpass-10000-for-2024-so-far">more than 10,000 people have been laid off from their jobs</a> across the video game industry in 2024 alone. Others impacted include <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-to-lay-off-1900-people-across-xbox-and-activision-blizzard">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-laying-off-900-playstation-employees-london-studio-to-close-in-its-entirety">Sony</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-impacted-by-unknown-number-of-layoffs-across-us-and-european-offices">Square Enix</a>, and this is merely scratching the surface.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/xbox-games-showcase-might-feature-a-shadow-dropped-1st-party-game-xbox-portable-likely-to-be-teased/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>With Sony's State of Play over and a Nintendo Direct possibly coming later this month, all eyes are focused on Microsoft's Xbox Games Showcase, which is slated to go live on Sunday, June 9, at 10 AM Pacific Time.</p>
<p>Speculation is already running rampant among Xbox fans, and today, Spanish leaker eXtas <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCFmKwQIo0Q" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has added extra fuel with some rumors from his own sources.</a> To start with, he said that a first-party Xbox game will be shadow-dropped during the showcase.</p>
<p>This means it will be released in some capacity right away. It could be a beta, a demo, or a full release. The most likely game to be shadow-dropped is Towerborne, the side-scrolling fantasy action game once known as <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-exclusive-project-belfry-2d-action-ghibli-vanillaware/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Project Belfry</a>. Developed by Stoic (the makers of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-banner-saga-3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Banner Saga</a>), Towerborne is set in a post-apocalyptic (but colorful) world where the so-called Aces are all that stands between the monsters and the safety of the titular tower.</p>
<p>Players will be able to fight solo with NPC companions or with other players in a group of four. That's also the number of fighting styles available in the game, with unique moves available for War Clubs, Gauntlets, Dual Daggers, and Swords &amp; Shields. The world map will continue to evolve over time with seasonal content to keep players engaged.</p>
<p>eXtas also said that Microsoft might share a teaser about the long-rumored Xbox Portable console. Rumors on Xbox handhelds <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-release-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">intensified</a> in the last few months, and even Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-discussed-once-again-by-microsofts-phil-spencer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seemed</a> to tease something of the sort in an interview at GDC 2024.</p>
<p>As for the rest of the Xbox Games Showcase, it's worth reminding earlier rumors, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-announcement-rumor-xbox-games-showcase-medieval-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DOOM: The Dark Ages</a> from id Software and <a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-6-might-appear-at-xbox-showcase-people-arent-ready-for-how-good-it-looks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gears 6</a> from The Coalition. The Perfect Dark reboot, in development at The Initiative and Crystal Dynamics, was also <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-will-be-shown-next-month-recent-rumors-might-have-been-outdated-says-insider/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumored</a> to be featured at the upcoming show.</p>
<p>Other likely candidates for an appearance include Avowed, Ara: History Untold, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, and Microsoft Flight Simulator, all of which should get release dates since they are 2024 games. Looking at the 2025 lineup, we might also see Clockwork Revolution, State of Decay 3, South of Midnight, and Fable.</p>

<p>We’ll never know exactly what sort of fiction Tom Clancy would have written if he was less interested in the calibre of specific bullets and their effiency at dismantling burgeoning socialist governments, and more so in the specific sigils required to blast a riot cop through a third story window. While charity shops across the land mourn this devasting loss to their paperback shelves to this very day, we do at least have a glimpse into what such a literary venture may have looked like. Oh, did you like that door? Was it your <em>favourite</em> door? Soz, pal. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">Strategy</a> game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tactical-breach-wizards">Tactical Breach Wizards</a> just hexed right through it with a new demo as part of Steam Next Fest. I’ve played it, and it’s very exciting stuff, not least for how differently it plays than what I’d expected.</p>

<p>Tactical Breach Wizards comes from Suspicious Developments, founded by former game journo and RPS contributor <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/authors/tom-francis">Tom Francis</a>. All these disclaimers are enough to make me hopeful that someone will someday pay me, Nic Reuben, to write the legally distinct Little Shop Of Horrors management sim of my dreams, but I digress (call me). The studio’s previous work includes <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gunpoint">Gunpoint</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/heat-signature">Heat Signature</a>. Both are well-loved, but thankfully, neither look to infringe on my concept for the legally distinct Little Shop Of Horrors management sim of my dreams (call me.)</p>

<p>The first thing I’d like to make absolutely clear about Tee-Bee-Dubs, if only for my past self who tends to form unwieldy assumptions based on singular screenshots, is that it has nothing to do with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/xcom-enemy-unknown">XCOM</a> 2012 or its progeny. Ok, so ‘nothing to do’ might be a bit of a stretch. It still offers turn-based, grid-aligned tactics. Your team still boasts contrasting and complimentary skills. Also, there’s still cover, although you have to actively duck behind it. In terms of how it actually feels to play, though, it’s miles away from XCOM’s lengthy, ultra-deadly skirmishes of attrition. I’m using XCOM as an example here, but Wizard’s sleekly designed, eminently solvable, room-by-room discrete puzzles mean it stands proudly and refreshingly apart from the glut of XCOM’s grandkids we’ve had in the intervening…12 years! If anyone needs me I’ll be reconstituting myself from the salt sachet of dust I currently reside in.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>Here, you’re less concerned about a stray Muton headbutting your beloved sniper to death (I have played other tactics games I swear), and more about cleanly and efficiently solving whatever configuration of bastards and windows the current room throws at you, in as few moves as possible. Any actions taken are effectively just plans, as you can both redo turns and scry possible enemy responses. You don’t commit to things until you thwack that end turn button like you’re furiously wishlisting the legally distinct Little Shop Of Horrors management sim of my dreams (call me.) All this is just a taster to the main event, though. An amuse-bouche to the amusement of boofing bods rudely out of windows.</p>
<p>You know you’re in for a cracking time when, alongside scores for speed and efficiency, the results screen bookending each room tallies up your total, and I quote, defenestrations. In TBW’s implied quest to throw absolutely everything that breathes through glass, some abilities are more efficient than others, but even basic attacks all feature some sort of knockback. And, wouldn’t you know it, these compact room-levels are effectively just window delivery systems. When a room has no windows, you know Mr. Francis is incredibly serious. I’m not yet sure from the chunk of demo I played if there’s any evolution on these currently windows-only environmental hazards, but that’d be neat, wouldn’t it? Not that I don’t like windows. I would have had to quickly abandon the game in disgust if I didn’t.</p>
<p>There will be some evolutions though, no doubt. Each level gives you a chance to flesh out the skills of your wizards with perk points. There’s a host of other lovely details I’d like to quickly cram in, right down to the incredibly minor. The graphics settings have cute names like ‘practical peach blizzards’ and such. The bit on the menu screen for patch notes currently says ‘fixed: demo didn’t exist’. I love this sort of thing. It’s the kind of minor attention to detail that promises similar love elsewhere, nice little pre-gags to warm you up, like arriving at the pub to find there’s a shot already waiting for you on the bar. It’s also just a very funny game in general, although there’s plenty of hints towards a more involved story as your progress. At this point, it’d take a serious hex to stop me diving into the full game when it releases, as if by magic, at some unspecified point in the future. Hopefully, sooner than the legally distinct Little Shop Of Horrors management sim of my dreams (call me.)</p>

        <p>"Nobody is shutting us down. We are going into hibernation because we are done with this project," clarified co-owner Nate Austin</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Wildermyth developer Worldwalker Games will be on a hiatus for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>In a post shared on <a href="https://x.com/wildermyth/status/1795872859232813087">social media</a>, the studio's co-owner Nate Austin shared that active development on the 2021 RPG is now complete and players shouldn't expect new content. The team will continue supporting Wildermyth with bug fixes, and the console port is still on the cards.</p>
<p>He clarified that the studio's hibernation is not a reflection of poor performances or other troubles, but simply what was planned all along now that the project is over.</p>
<p>Austin however added that Worldwalker will be "saying farewell to many of [its] team members."</p>
<p>"Wildermyth has been wonderful, but nothing goes on forever," Austin said. "We wanted to ship [DLC] Omenroad, and having done that we're ready to move on. This was the plan, and it doesn't have anything to do with how well Omenroad is going."</p>
<p>He added: "We're an independent studio, which means we're not answerable to investors. Nobody is shutting us down. We are going into hibernation because we are done with this project."</p>
<p>He concluded by saying that he's "pretty sure" that the team will "eventually find something else to pour [their] passion into, and that it'll be communicated to players "when the time comes"</p>

<p data-characters="201" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Following the massive success of <em>Fallout</em> on Prime Video, Amazon is heading back into the world of video games for another blockbuster series, with <em>Like a Dragon: Yakuza</em> set to release later this year. </p> <p data-characters="303" data-current-count="303" data-injectable="false">Made up of six episodes, the Amazon original series is directed by Masaharu Take and stars Ryoma Takeuchi, known for his role as Shinnosuke Tomari in <em>Kamen Rider Drive</em>. The series will feature six episodes, split into two parts, with the first released on October 25 and the second on November 1, 2024. </p> <p data-characters="261" data-current-count="564" data-injectable="true">The big announcement took place in Tokyo, Japan on June 4, with both Take and Takeuchi in attendance. Amazon stated that <em>Like a Dragon: Yakuza</em> will be “a live-action adaptation with an original story based on SEGA’s global hit game franchise.”</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Masaharu Take directs while Ryoma Takeuchi stars. Image via Amazon</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="434" data-current-count="734" data-injectable="true">In a press release, lead Ryoma Takeuchi said he was “truly honored to be given the opportunity to play the role of Kazuma Kiryu,” and told fans to look forward to “intense fighting scenes with the Dragon tattoo on his back.” Director Masaharu Take echoed these thoughts, explaining that he has “poured [his] heart, soul, and the experience that [he] has garnered over 35 years into <em>Like a Dragon: Yakuza.</em></p>
 <p data-characters="565" data-current-count="565" data-injectable="true">Masayoshi Yokoyama, who wrote the script for the first <em>Yakuza</em> game is also onboard, serving as an executive producer on the series. “Since the day I first put pen to paper on the original <em>Yakuza</em>‘s script, I’ve never once thought about revisiting any of my work on the series,” he stated. “It’s because I understand all too well the challenges and hardships that come with remaking a finished title. However, if I were ever sent to the past through some kind of cosmic joke, this is the experience I’d want to create.”</p>
 <p data-characters="430" data-current-count="430" data-injectable="true">The release of <em>Like a Dragon: Yakuza</em> will see Amazon dip back into the world of gaming following the monumental success of <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/fallout-tv-show-sparks-a-surge-in-popularity-for-the-games-on-steam/">Fallout</a></em>. The series based on Bethesda’s iconic franchise was a massive success, setting a new record for the most watched title ever among adults 18-34 in the first 16 days of release, and sits just behind <em>The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power</em> for the company’s most successful launch ever. </p>
 <p data-characters="171" data-current-count="171" data-injectable="false">While we don’t know too much about the story of <em>Like a Dragon: Yakuza</em> just yet, we expect to hear more and see our first glimpses of the show throughout the summer. </p>

        <p>50 employees have been let go across both studios</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Avalanche Studios Group has announced the closure of its Montreal and New York studios, resulting in layoffs for 50 employees.</p>
<p>In a statement shared on its <a href="https://avalanchestudios.com/stories/statement-nymr">website</a>, the developer said the shuttering of these offices was "necessary to ensure a stable and sustainable future for the company."</p>
<p>"Our focus is now on supporting [those affected] through this challenging time," it continued. "We're grateful for the invaluable contributions of those leaving and remain committed to creating incredible gaming experiences for our players."</p>
<p>The Montreal office hadn't been open for long, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/avalanche-studios-to-open-montreal-office">having launched last October</a> following the acquisition of Montreal-based developer Monster Closet Games.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/avalanche-opens-new-york-studio">Avalanche's New York studio opened in 2011</a>, and was <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/avalanche-cut-stuff-in-new-york-and-stockholm-offices">affected by staff cuts in 2015</a> alongside the Stockholm office following the release of Just Cause 3 and Mad Max.</p>

			<p><span data-contrast="auto">Originally a 3DS title released back in 2015, Legend of Legacy is the latest of a series of JRPGs to be given the HD Remaster treatment for modern consoles. I didn’t get a chance to play this back in the day, but I was aware of the game and later fell in love with The Alliance Alive from the same studio, so where better to jump in than a remaster?</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><iframe title="The Legend of Legacy HD Remastered - Announcement Trailer (Nintendo Switch, PS4, PS5, PC)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZPWk721vZq0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Picking your hero from a small selection and then naming them, you’re thrown onto the Isle of Avalon with a small party of adventurers and, after a short interlude with the Lord of the island in Initium, begin exploring the island to search out its secrets. Within this world, you will engage in all the standard JRPG trimmings including fights, dungeons, chatting with NPCs and recruiting new party members to join your increasingly motley crew.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>


<p><span data-contrast="auto">The main objective is to explore the various regions of the world. As you wander around, you will slowly fill in the maps, with a satisfying little pencil scratching noise when you complete one. Each area is split into smaller ones, with each one having its own map to complete. Then once you have completed all the maps in an area, you can sell them back to the Shop in Initium. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Be aware you can only sell a map set once, regardless of how completed it might be at the time, so if you still have some corners of a map to fill in make sure you do so before you trade it in.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">The combat takes place in a standard turn-based format with standard roles in place, and your archetypal medieval weapons to use. You’ll take turns with the enemy hitting each other, and the ones that survive the hitting win. However, this would be a dull experience if that’s all there was to it, and Legend of Legacy has got you covered with a host of neat little twists on the formula.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">The first and biggest is a twist found in the combat system – Formations. This allows you to change around the placements of your party members each turn depending on where and how you might need them. For instance, you might need to move your lower defense characters to the back row to reduce the damage they take while you heal the party or bring your tankier character forward to defend the others.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">With the Formations you can assign each party member a position based on their role for this next turn, whether that be guarding other party members, attacking enemies or supporting the other members. There are presets for this, but you can create your own Formations to best suit how you play the game, and they can be further customised as you unlock new stances during your journey.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">You’ll also be at the whim of the Elementals in the world. These mysterious entities will have a particular effect over the areas you walk through, with the compass in the top right indicating if a particular element is strong there. You can engage with Spirit-Perches to increase an element’s power in the nearby area. This can alter aspects of the world around it or create a contract with that element for battles.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">These contracts are how the magic system works in Legend of Legacy. When you have a contract with an element and the correct Charm equipped, you can cast powerful spells in battle. Also, an element’s strength in an area will also have a passive effect on the battle such as a prevalence of air increasing defence against physical skills for both your party and all enemies too. So, this needs to be balanced very carefully.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Oh, and if you try to cast a spell without a contract active, it will just fail, so that’s fun too.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">As another quirk of the gameplay, your characters don’t level up in the standard way in JRPGs, instead falling into a system much like Final Fantasy II. You gain stat increases from battles occasionally, but these are randomised stat increases based on the usage of the characters. This also extends to your abilities, with new abilities (called ‘Arts’) for weapons being learned as you use that specific weapon.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">This is where my biggest bugbear with this game rears its head. As your stat increases are randomised and weapon skills linked to that weapon’s use, it quite literally crushes any reason to experiment. There’s no point changing your weapons based on new types you find – no matter if they might be better against a new enemy – as you’re back at square one with no abilities for this new weapon, lowering your character’s efficacy dramatically.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Worse still, this also applies to the new potential party members you meet. As these new characters haven’t been “used” they start at the beginning with few Arts and none of the stat increases you have gained on your party. So, you only really benefit from sticking with the same party the whole time, which was a huge mood killer for me personally when I acquired the cute little frog guy and had to grind to make him at all&nbsp;useful.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Once you get into the groove with it, the gameplay is&nbsp;smooth, with most battles taking a matter of moments to play out. The only exceptions to this being the stark and sudden spikes in difficulty that happen throughout the game. I have to say though that these spikes do bring excitement to the game, especially considering that the narrative is&nbsp;incredibly intermittent in how it’s told, and the exploration is repetitive.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">With the difficulty spikes though, the worst thing to happen if your entire party drops to 0HP is being returned to the beginning of the current area you are exploring. It still feels a touch unfair to be blindsided by an enemy far stronger than anything else around it without warning, but the overall penalty isn’t terrible even if it’s inconvenient.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">All this said, one area this game doesn’t scrimp on is the presentation. The chibi character design and colourful storybook effect on the design of the world perfectly mesh to create clear and beautiful visual style. This style was gorgeous already on the 3DS, but the HD remaster really enhances the visuals. Then&nbsp;when paired with the simple but effective score, you have a game that just FEELS handcrafted with care.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/like-dragon-yakuza-series-prime-video<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Amazon has announced a&nbsp;<em>Like a Dragon</em>&nbsp;TV series, and it's airing on Prime Video later this year.&nbsp;<em>Like a Dragon: Yakuza&nbsp;</em>will span six episodes, three of which will arrive in late October, with the remaining three set to debut the following week.</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://press.amazonmgmstudios.com/us/en/press-release/prime-video-to-premiere-like-a-dragon-yakuza-an-am" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement post</a>, Amazon says the series will feature an "original story" based on the franchise, so it doesn't sound as if&nbsp;<em>Like a Dragon: Yakuza&nbsp;</em>will adapt any particular game in the&nbsp;<em>Like a Dragon&nbsp;</em>(<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/three-new-like-dragon-games-announced-at-rgg-summit">nee&nbsp;<em>Yakuza</em></a>) series.</p>

<p>With that being said, it sounds like the series will hew pretty closely to the first game; it'll take place in 1995 and 2005 and will feature Kazuma Kiryu as its protagonist.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/like-a-dragon-yakuza-series-prime-video-yakuza-kiwami.jpg?itok=7ZDUZ2vj 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/like-a-dragon-yakuza-series-prime-video-yakuza-kiwami.jpg?itok=v8rzbfqP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Like a Dragon: Yakuza&nbsp;</em>seems like it'll be at least partially based on the original&nbsp;<em>Yakuza&nbsp;</em>(although the remake&nbsp;<em>Yakuza Kiwami&nbsp;</em>is pictured here).</figcaption></figure><p>Stepping into the rather intimidatingly large shoes of Kiryu is actor Ryoma Takeuchi, who played the main role in&nbsp;<em>Kamen Rider Drive</em>&nbsp;and also provided the Japanese dub for Tim Goodman in&nbsp;the movie&nbsp;<em>Detective Pikachu</em>.</p>

<p><em>Like a Dragon: Yakuza&nbsp;</em>will be directed by Masaharu Take, a movie and TV director whose works include&nbsp;<em>100 Yen Love</em>, which was submitted (but not nominated) as the Japanese entry for Best Foreign Language Film at the 2015 Oscars.</p>

<p>Take says that he's "poured out my heart, soul, and the experience that I have garnered over 35 years" into the series, and that it's fitting that&nbsp;<em>Like a Dragon: Yakuza&nbsp;</em>should be released in "the year of the dragon".</p>

<p>For his part, Takeuchi says he's "truly honored" to be playing Kazuma Kiryu. He playfully directs viewers to "take a look at Kiryu's intense fighting scenes with the Dragon tattoo on his back". Sounds like those iconic shirtless rooftop battles will make an appearance in the show.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/like-a-dragon-yakuza-series-prime-video-kiwami-2-majima.jpg?itok=a59BLU3o 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/like-a-dragon-yakuza-series-prime-video-kiwami-2-majima.jpg?itok=fGCogHeI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Hopefully, we'll get to find out who's playing Goro Majima in&nbsp;<em>Like a Dragon: Yakuza&nbsp;</em>soon.</figcaption></figure><p>We don't yet know which other iconic characters from the&nbsp;<em>Like a Dragon</em>-slash-<em>Yakuza&nbsp;</em>series will be making an appearance in Prime Video's series. Hopefully, we'll get to see regulars like Goro Majima and Haruka Sawamura develop their relationships with Kiryu.</p>

<p><em>Like a Dragon: Yakuza&nbsp;</em>seems to be part of a push Prime Video is making to create more shows based on video games.</p>

<p>It joins the likes of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/fallout-tv-show-proves-last-of-us-wasnt-fluke">critically-acclaimed&nbsp;<em>Fallout</em></a>, which launched earlier this year, and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tomb-raider-live-action-series">upcoming&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>series</a>, which boasts the involvement of writer Phoebe Waller-Bridge.</p>

<p>We'll get to see how&nbsp;<em>Like a Dragon: Yakuza&nbsp;</em>handles the story of Kazuma Kiryu when its first three episodes arrive on Prime Video on October 25th. The concluding three episodes will subsequently arrive on November 1st.</p>

			<p>Today, SEGA <a href="https://press.amazonmgmstudios.com/us/en/press-release/prime-video-to-premiere-like-a-dragon-yakuza-an-am" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> it has partnered with Amazon Prime Video to release Like a Dragon: Yakuza, a live-action TV adaptation of the acclaimed roleplaying game series.</p>
<p>The show will be available globally starting on October 25. Comprised of six episodes, it will be released in two tranches: three episodes on October 25 and another three on November 1. According to the press release, this will be an original story set across two time periods: 1995 and 2005. Like a Dragon: Yakuza is directed by Masaharu Take and Kengo Takimoto, with Erik Barmack, Roberto Grande, and Joshua Long listed as executive producers.</p>
<p>Protagonista Kazuma Kiryu will be played by popular Japanese actor Ryoma Takeuchi, who explained:</p>
<p><em>I am truly honored to be given the opportunity to play the role of Kazuma Kiryu, a beloved character in the game series. I strongly felt that I was willing to put my life on the line. The audience will enjoy the show's human drama and conflict that unfolds around Kazuma Kiryu. Moreover, please take a look at Kiryu's intense fighting scenes with the Dragon tattoo on his back.</em></p>
<p>Masayoshi Yokoyama, Head of RYUGAGOTOKU Studio and Executive Producer, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>Since the day I first put pen to paper on the original “Yakuza“'s script, I've never once thought about revisiting any of my work on the series. It's because I understand all too well the challenges and hardships that come with remaking a finished title. However, if I were ever sent to the past through some kind of cosmic joke, this is the experience I'd want to create. If I had to go through the wringer anyhow, I'd want to make the most engaging versions of Kamurochō and Kazuma Kiryu I could —and this show has it all. There is no question that Prime Video’s Like a Dragon: Yakuza will become another landmark release for the Like a Dragon series. While the games let you experience their world through the subjective lens, this adaptation will be the ultimately objective way to enjoy the show. I have no doubt that fans of the series will be drawn to how it brings the games to life and adds new surprises. Newcomers, I'm sure, will find themselves invested simply in the gritty realism of the show. If anything, I'd love to watch this version alongside audiences all around the world—experiencing all of its intensity and soaking in every single second.</em></p>
<p>As a reminder, the latest entry in the game series, Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth, launched earlier this year to <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-end-of-yakuza/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">critical</a> and commercial acclaim.</p>
<p>This is just the latest game franchise translated into a live action TV series.

<p>Prime Video is shaping up to receive another banger of a live-action adaptation later this year, with the sudden announcement that a Like a Dragon: Yakuza series is heading to the platform in October. This reveal came out of nowhere, shocking fans worldwide and drawing an immediate sentiment of anticipation, given the recent success of the series and Prime’s adaptations thus far (I’m looking at you, Fallout).</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-sudden-strike">Sudden Strike</h2>



<p>RGG Studio took to social media to share an image promoting the Like a Dragon: Yakuza series for the first time with almost nothing in the way of a preface. It was a simple drop that stunned audiences, with RGG offering a date and a platform – October 24 on Prime Video.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Make the choice to take the next step. Like a Dragon: Yakuza comes to Prime Video October 24. <a href="https://t.co/Pn2gKQzqlK">pic.twitter.com/Pn2gKQzqlK</a></p>— RGG Studio | Like a Dragon &amp; Yakuza Series (@RGGStudio) <a href="https://twitter.com/RGGStudio/status/1797826081166184839?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 4, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>







<p>It’s a live-action adaptation starring Ryoma Takeuchi as Kazuma Kiryu, the iconic lead of the series and one of gaming’s suavest and most capable fighters. Takeuchi is best known for his voice work and live-action roles in productions hailing almost exclusively from Japan, and his career thus far has been contained almost solely to a string of television shows.</p>



<p>Fans have had a mixed reception to the casting, but many agree that they’ll wait and see Takeuchi in the role of Kiryu before they pass judgment.</p>

Made in Japan, the series stars the hugely popular Japanese drama and stage actor Ryoma Takeuchi in the role of Kazuma Kiryu. </p><p>Like a Dragon: Yakuza will be available on Amazon Prime in over 240 countries and territories worldwide, released in two batches on October 25 and November 1, 2024.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>The Yakuza Games In (Chronological) Order</h3></div></output><h2>A new story loosely based on the original Yakuza</h2><p>The live-action crime-suspense series is based on an original screenplay loosely inspired by the first game in the series, 2005’s Yakuza. It will be set mainly in the Kamurocho entertainment district, straight from the games, and follows Kiryu and three of his childhood friends in two time periods, 1995 and 2005. </p><p>Similar to the games, protagonist Kiryu is described in the show’s press release as a “fearsome and peerless Yakuza warrior with a strong sense of justice, duty, and humanity”, and the story will deal with the repercussions of his actions in the two time periods. Takeuchi commented that the show will include “​​intense fighting scenes”, alluding to the wild action the series is famed for.</p><p>The series was announced today at a press conference at the picturesque Hotel Gajoen Tokyo. At the event, Takeuchi and Take discussed the process of adapting the acclaimed game series for a live-action drama. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/04/yakuza-show-1717470220217.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Director Masaharu Take and actor Ryoma Takeuchi at today's announcement.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Speaking of the tattoo on his back and sculpting his body for the role, as seen in the key visual image released today, Takeuchi said, “You can’t play Kiryu Kazuma without getting into shape, so I knew I had to throw myself into it. This was a job not only for me but also for the costume and makeup teams. It took two and a half hours just to prepare for this shot.”</p><p>He added, “It’s partly Kiryu Kazuma and it’s partly me. I got so close to the part that it was hard to distinguish where he ended and I began. That included getting into shape for the part, the costume and so on. Rather than acting the part of Kiryu, I feel like he became part of the family.”</p><p>Director Take said, “Having someone with such a large physical presence as Takeuchi makes all the difference. I understood that he knows his body better than anyone, so I left it to him to get into shape. Takeuchi did all the action himself as well. It was impressive.”</p><p>Of Kiryu’s place in the story, Take said, “In 1995, the protagonist is still young and he makes a lot of mistakes, and these lead to him spending a decade in prison and the consequences he faces when he gets out in 2005. I tried to show those differences in the two time periods, and the cast helped to achieve this as well.”</p><p>Taking their positions in front of a golden folding screen emblazoned with a dragon reminiscent of the tattoo on Kiryu’s back, the actor and director made a symbolic prayer for the show’s success.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/04/img-8734-1717470697624.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Ryoma Takeuchi will star as iconic Yakuza character Kiryu Kazuma in the upcoming series.</figcaption></figure></output><h2>Meet the new Kazuka Kiryu</h2><p>Takeuchi broke through with his role as Shinnosuke Tomari in multiple Kamen Rider projects.

<p id="7e50o5">Many moons ago, Hariyama was pretty relevant to the meta as a fighting-type Pokémon, but it has since been overtaken by Pokémon like Lucario, Conkeldurr, Terrakion, and others. However, Hariyama is still pretty good if you have a shadow Hariyama, so if you have a shadow Makuhita, you should consider holding on to it and powering it up.</p>
<h2 id="wepEXU"><strong>What is the shiny rate for Makuhita in Pokémon Go?</strong></h2>
<p id="NElmhN">As per old research by the now-defunct website The Silph Road (via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230423103325/https://thesilphroad.com/shiny-pokemon">Wayback Machine</a>), the shiny rate for Pokémon on a regular day is approximately one in 500. Makuhita is not a confirmed Pokémon that gets a “permaboost” (meaning that it’s a rare spawn and thus gets a boosted shiny rate).</p>
<h3 id="TZ4GJv"><strong>What can I do to attract more shiny Pokémon?</strong></h3>
<p id="r3MqkW">Not much, unfortunately. It appears to be random chance. Shiny Pokémon catch rates are set by developer Niantic, and they are typically only boosted during special events like Community Days or Safari Zones, or in Legendary Raids. There are no consumable items that boost shiny Pokémon rates.</p>
<h3 id="thj8sX"><strong>Where can I find a list of available shiny Pokémon?</strong></h3>
<p id="WRj9xa">LeekDuck keeps <a href="https://leekduck.com/shiny/">a list of currently available shiny Pokémon</a>. It’s a helpful visual guide that illustrates what all of the existing shiny Pokémon look like.</p>

                <p>NZXT revealed some new components at Computex 2024 this week. These include a fresh incarnation of its highly popular H7 Flow mid-tower case, single-frame fans designed with ease-of-use in mind, and a new generation of ATX 3.1 power supplies.</p><p dir="ltr">The NZXT single-frame fans are designed as an alternative to multiple fan cables, serving as two or three fan arrays in one eight-pin cable that has both PWM and RGB. However, you may need a splitter for it to work on a traditional motherboard fan port, as it also comes with 5V ARGB. NZXT plans to roll out a "control hub" that will directly manage these fans with ease in Q3 of 2024.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1596/15969599/4312127-h52.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4312127" data-ratio="1" data-width="2000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1596/15969599/4312127-h52.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4312127"></a><figcaption>The revamped H7 Flow layout prioritizes airflow to the GPU, and it's also easier to get into without using a screwdriver.  </figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1596/15969599/4312127-h52.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Finally, NZXT is introducing the C-Series Gold and Platinum PSUs, which are available in 850W, 1000W, and 1200W variations. They have been redesigned to maximize airflow and reduce noise, and they're also available in white for those of you who like to match up.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/3/24170904/msi-claw-8-ai-plus-lunar-lake-battery-computex<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Just three months after releasing its first gaming handheld PC to damning reviews — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24105991/msi-claw-review">here’s mine</a> — MSI is already announcing a likely replacement. The “MSI Claw 8 AI Plus” swaps its lackluster Intel Meteor Lake chip for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/23933156">the brand-new Lunar Lake ones</a>, while replacing its 7-inch, 1080p 120Hz variable resolution rate screen for a larger 8-inch one.</p><p>Perhaps even more importantly, it will boast up to an 80 watt-hour battery, MSI tells<em> The Verge</em> — tying it with the recently announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/2/24169709/asus-rog-ally-x-price-release-date-inside-gaming-handheld">Asus ROG Ally X</a> for biggest battery in a PC gaming handheld. Despite the larger screen, it’ll still offer a smooth 120Hz refresh rate with VRR, writes MSI marketing specialist Anne Lee. </p><p>The Claw will also offer a second USB-C port with Thunderbolt 4 capabilities, just like the Asus, will come with a wall-mounted charger instead of the two-cord brick of the original, and will have enhanced “tactile feel of the LB/RB buttons.”</p><p>MSI didn’t provide any other details or a single image of the new handheld, only telling us that the company would release more info <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/2/24168856/computex-2024-convention-news-announcements">at Computex</a> — the PC show that’s currently underway in Taipei, Taiwan. But we know as of today that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/23933156">Intel’s Lunar Lake has up to 50 percent more GPU performance</a> than Meteor Lake and its Xe2 GPU needs less power for the same performance — though Intel doesn’t label its chart axes, so we have no clue how much.</p><div><figcaption><em>“Meteor Lake H” is the chip that was in the original MSI Claw.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Intel</cite></p></div><p>MSI did announce <em>another</em> version of the Claw today: a limited-edition <em>Fallout</em> version that looks a tad like the game’s Pip-Boy wrist computers, but is unfortunately based on the original 7-inch MSI Claw with Meteor Lake, not Lunar Lake. So unless there’s a lot of utterly diehard<em> Fallout</em> + Claw fans, I expect that one will be similarly dead on arrival. Still, MSI’s press release says it will have “the largest battery in the industry,” so maybe it’ll have a surprise or two inside?</p><p>In case you’re wondering, yes, I have been retesting the original MSI Claw with the newest BIOS and sets of drivers, and I’m not yet finding enough of a performance boost to change my recommendation at all.</p><p><em><strong>Update, June 4th: </strong>Jacob Roach of Digital Trends </em><a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/msi-claw-8-ai-plus-first-look/"><em>has pics of the Lunar Lake version</em></a><em> — and it’s a complete redesign with an M.2 2280 slot for longer SSDs that’s coming in September. </em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/wonder-woman-game-from-monolith-reportedly-%E2%80%9Ctroubled-%E2%80%9D-unlikely-to-be-shown-soon.888744/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/wonder-woman-monolith-troubled-rumor/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Amongst the list of major upcoming AAA titles, few are more mysterious than the <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/wonder-woman/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wonder Woman title</a> in the works at Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor/War developer <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/monolith-productions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Monolith Productions</a>. The game was first announced back in 2021, and since then, we’ve heard very little about it. With “E3” season ramping up, some might be hoping we’ll finally get a real look at the game, but according to a new rumor, that’s unlikely.</p>
<p>This rumor comes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/2kJQjUgT_QY?si=YyVMNSSzLBCp75a0&amp;t=2539" target="_blank" rel="noopener">courtesy of Kinda Funny’s Greg Miller</a>, who doesn’t usually do the insider thing, but is unquestionably a well-connected figure in the industry. Per Miller, he’s heard from an insider that the Wonder Woman game is “troubled,” and probably isn’t going to be seen anytime too soon, as he doesn’t believe it’s “ready for prime time.”</p>
<p><em>“In the past year, because I'll leave it ambiguous, I've talked to an insider, who was, like, "this game's troubled." That's all I'll say. So, I don't hold out hope that it's in a place to show something. [...] I think it's not where they want it to be, I don't think it's ready for prime time.”</em></p>
<p>The premise of a Wonder Woman game built by Monolith using their trademark Nemesis System has always felt a bit odd, so it’s not too hard to believe development may be troubled. That said, as always with rumors, take them with a grain of salt.</p>
<p>Last year, following rumors the Wonder Woman game would be a live service title, Warner Bros. <a href="https://wccftech.com/wonder-woman-is-a-single-player-game-not-designed-for-live-service-says-warner-bros/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">clarified it would be a single-player adventure</a>, providing the following brief description…</p>
<p><em>“Wonder Woman is a single-player action-adventure game set in a dynamic open world. This third-person experience will allow players to become Diana of Themyscira and introduce an original story set in the DC Universe while also featuring the Nemesis System. Wonder Woman is not being designed as a live service.”</em></p>
<p>Platforms and a release window for Wonder Woman have yet to be announced. What do you think? Can Monolith pull a worthy Wonder Woman game together?</p>

Recently, both Nishino and Hulst shared why they believe having two CEOs is the best move for PlayStation.</p><p dir="ltr">Their statement came from an <a href="https://sonyinteractive.com/en/news/blog/an-exciting-future-at-sony-interactive-entertainment/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SIE blog post</a>. In it, they explain that the "PlayStation community is at the heart of everything" the company does. The two go on to explain how they plan on operating going forward.</p><p dir="ltr">"We believe it's never been more important for the leadership at SIE to step back, review our business holistically, and move forward with a new structure designed to bring out the best in the organization and deliver increasingly incredible experiences."</p><p dir="ltr">As the post continued, Nishino and Hulst shared an email to Sony employees. Near the end of it, the two give their opinion on why having both on board is the best move going forward.</p><p dir="ltr">"While having two CEOs is a new structure for SIE, we know this will foster greater creativity and innovation as we look for new ways to grow the business, always keeping our community at the forefront. Two distinct Business Groups will enable us to have more rigor and clarity across our lines of business as SIE continues to grow and evolve. As we step into our new roles, we will take time to deepen our understanding about various aspects of the business."</p><p dir="ltr">Going forward, Nishino will be in charge of Sony Interactive Entertainment's Platform Business Group, which is responsible for technology, products, the platform experience, and third-party developer relations. Hulst will lead the Studio Business group and will be responsible for all PlayStation game content and film/TV adaptations.</p><p>For more PlayStation-related news, check out<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/state-of-play-may-2024-all-the-biggest-ps5-announcements-and-games/2900-5435/"> our gallery highlighting everything that was announced at PlayStation State Of Play last month</a>.</p>

		<p>Geoff Keighley’s Summer Games fest kicks on on June 7th and ahead of the show he took to Twitch for a Q &amp; A session, during which he tempered expectations for the show. “There will be, definitely, new announcements,” he said, “but the show is largely focused on, I think, existing games that have new updates for fans.”</p>
<p>“There definitely are things that are being announced but this is not a show that has a lot of like ‘coming in 2026’ or ‘2027’, or teasers for games that are years and years out… That’s generally what I would say in terms of expectation setting.”</p>


<p>So lets start with some of what will be shown. Metaphor: Refantazio and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/monster-hunter-wild/">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> are confirmed, along with indie games made “single devs”. Also in the show will be Kingdom Come 2: Deliverance and a trailer for some “cool DLC.”.&nbsp; Batman: Arkham VR from Camoflaj is also confirmed along with Dragon Ball Sparking ZERO and a trailer for the Among Us animated show.</p>
<p>He confirmed the following titles will not be present: Beyond Good and Evil 2 , Five Nights At Freddy’s, Grand Theft Auto 6, Hollow Knight: Silksong, Kingdom Hearts 4, Wolf Among Us 2, Judas, or Metal Gear Solid Delta. There will also be no Muppets (boo!) and no music acts (yay!).</p>

<p>The show will begin at 10pm BST on June 7th and run for two hours, it will be followed by the day of Devs indie show for an hour, then the always wacky Devolver show at 1am,</p>

<p>It doesn't seem like PlayStation VR2 is having quite the same success as its predecessor, which was a runaway hit at a moment when public curiosity and investment in VR were at an all-time high. Nonetheless, it's one of the most advanced VR headsets available—tied to a tiny library on the PS5.</p>
<p>That's about to change, as Sony has confirmed its plans to launch a PC adapter for the headset on August 7. It will cost $60, and it will, at a minimum, let PSVR2 owners play a large library of SteamVR titles, provided their PCs meet the minimum specifications.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/06/03/playstation-vr2-players-can-access-games-on-pc-with-adapter-starting-on-august-7/">Sony's blog post</a> about the adapter says players will need a Steam account, so it's unclear how or whether you can use the headset to dive into PC VR experiences through various channels besides Steam.</p>
<p>In addition to the PSVR2 headset, its controllers, and the new adapter, you'll need a DisplayPort 1.4-compatible cable and the following PC specs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows 10 or 11 64-bit</li>
<li>Intel Core i5-7600 / AMD Ryzen 3 3100 or later</li>
<li>Nvidia GeForce GTX 1650 or later, or Nvidia RTX series, or AMD Radeon RX 5500XT or later, or AMD Radeon RX 6500XT or later</li>
<li>RTX 3060 or later or RX 6000XT or later are recommended "for the best performance"</li>
<li>Bluetooth 4.0 or later.</li>
</ul>                                            
                                                        
<p>Users will have to install SteamVR, and there will be a PlayStation VR2 app as well.</p>
<p>All that sounds exciting if you bought a PSVR2 but are really feeling the dearth of content on the PlayStation platform. (PSVR2 isn't compatible with the large library of PSVR1 games, and several flagship VR titles still haven't been updated for it.)</p>
<p>But a lot of the cool features that make PSVR2 so great won't actually work on PC, Sony says. That includes "HDR, headset feedback, eye tracking, adaptive triggers, and haptic feedback (other than rumble)."</p>
<p>That's rather frustrating, because some of those features have shown up in the highest-end PC VR headsets that have been announced.
</p><p>Sony notes that "the high-fidelity and sensory immersion features of PS VR2 are supported, including 4K visuals (2000×2040 per eye), 110-degree field of view, finger touch detection, and see-through view, as well as foveated rendering (without eye tracking) and 3D Audio in supported games."</p>
<p>All told, it's still a relatively strong offering, superior to the numerous Oculus Rift S headsets that are still circulating out there. We'll have to wait and see what barriers exist to running non-Steam content when it arrives later this summer.</p>

		<p>Supermassive Games and Bandai Namco have announced that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/little-nightmares-iii/">Little Nightmares III</a> will no longer be released this year and has been delayed until an unspecified date in 2025.</p>
<p>“As much as we can’t wait for you to return to the Nowhere, we also want to make sure we give the game the care and love it deserves. Quality is a top priority for us, and we know you feel the same way,” reads a statement posted on Twitter.</p>


<p>“We’ll be sharing more about Little Nightmares III later this summer, so please bear with us and look forward to further updates.”</p>

<p>Supermassive Games have taken over development duties from Tarsier Studios for this third instalment. Trapped within the Spiral, a cluster of “disturbing places”, Low and Alone will have to work together to survive in a dangerous world full of delusions and nasty things lurking around in the shadows. Whilst the game continues the themes of “eww”, “yuk”, and “bork” found in the first to games it is set in a completely different location, Nightmares 1 and 2 were set in The Maw.</p>

<p>The game will be playable from end to end in online co-op mode, or if you prefer you can play solo and have an AI companion help you out.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/02/09/little-nightmares-2-review/">Little Nightmares II Review</a></h2>
<p>In our Little Nightmares II review, I said,<em> “It’s rather obvious, but if enjoyed the first Little Nightmares then you will enjoy the Little Nightmares II. While some new elements have been added it is more of a next chapter to the story than a full blown sequel. The attention detail is incredible, bringing the story to life without a single spoken word. It’s unsettling, creepy, darkly amusing, and at times a little frustrating, but immensely enjoyable. Another little, slime covered gem from Tarsier Studios.”</em></p>
<p>Little Nightmares III is coming to PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and PC.</p>

This has added to concerns over the kind of access Google employees have to videos before they go live, an issue highlighted in recent reports from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-youtube-leaks-work/"><em>Insider Gaming</em>’s Tom Henderson</a> and <a href="https://x.com/_Tom_Henderson_/status/1796298547647635940"><em>404 Media</em></a><em>.</em></p><p>One incident, as noted by Henderson, occurred in 2022 when KSI attempted to give away over $10,000 in Amazon gift cards. However, <a href="https://x.com/KSI/status/1596643151980134405">KSI later realized</a> that all of the gift card codes had been redeemed before the video was posted, sparking an internal investigation at YouTube. The company reportedly started a similar investigation after the trailer for <em>GTA VI</em> leaked, but it’s not clear whether it’s related.</p><p>All of this ties into what seems like an ongoing problem at Google. On Monday, <a href="https://www.404media.co/google-leak-reveals-thousands-of-privacy-incidents/"><em>404 Media</em> published reports</a> based on Google’s internal database records, and it found that a <a href="https://www.404media.co/google-contractor-used-admin-access-to-leak-private-nintendo-youtube-video/">Google contractor was behind</a> the 2017 Nintendo leak that offered an early look at <em>Yoshi’s Crafted World</em>.</p><p>At the time, a user on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nintendo/comments/6gyd01/a_new_yoshi_game_probably_woolly_world_2_is_going/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_content=post_title&amp;embed_host_url=https://cdn.iframe.ly/api/iframe">Reddit shared an image</a> of the trailer just before its reveal at E3. The image contained an “admin.youtube.com” URL in the address bar, suggesting that an employee accessed the private version of the video.</p><p>Google confirmed that an employee accessed the information in a database entry viewed by <em>404 Media</em>. “Google employee deliberately leaked private Nintendo information,” the entry said. “Former TVC [temporary vendor contractor] download video with admin account, and shared unreleased Nintendo feature with friend.” The entry also reportedly said the incident was “non-intentional.”</p><p>In a statement to <em>The Verge</em>, Google spokesperson Matt Bryant says every flag reported by <em>404 Media</em> “was reviewed and resolved at that time.” However, the company didn’t elaborate on what it does to prevent employees from accessing and leaking content early.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It is a perfect recreation of that silly open-world <em>GTA</em>-like collecton-a-thon experience, just without Homer and Springfield.

That’s the basic premise of <em>Turbo Trip.</em> You are Tiny Terry and after lying to get a job with a taxi company, you get a car. It’s now your job to go around collecting junk and cash to help you upgrade your taxi cab and make it go faster and faster. If you upgrade it all the way, you can drive it up a giant building and into space. Probably. That’s the plan, at least. And that’s your goal in <em>Tiny Terry’s Turbo Trip.</em>&nbsp;<br></p><p>However, to get all the junk and cash needed to max out your taxi and reach outer space, you’ll need to explore a delightfully colorful and zany open-world filled with characters to help and collectibles to find. Right away, <em>Turbo Trip</em>’s cartoon visuals impressed me. Even on a Steam Deck, the game looks marvelous, like a trippy, vivid Saturday morning cartoon directed by Weird Al.<br></p><p>Each character I met in this odd world was a misshapen lump of bright color and limbs. Even better, they all made me laugh, often because they didn’t know how to react to Tiny Terry. His bizarre antics and dedication to being the weirdest one in the room lead to some of the best awkward pauses I’ve ever experienced in a video game.<br></p><p>I also appreciated that, for as weird and wild as <em>Turbo Trip </em>gets, it never feels like it’s doing things just to be random. It still feels like a (somewhat) real world with genuine people living in it. Even Terry has his moments of genuine growth and care. This all helps the game avoid the trap of being a collection of internet memes and bad jokes haphazardly stitched together, something other comedy games can often feel like. There’s depth here.<br></p><p>But great writing, colorful visuals, silly antics, and a nice lead character aren’t enough to make a great game. You also need to have fun playing it, and <em>Tiny Terry’s Turbo Trip</em> excels at that, too.</p><p>It feels lazy, but the best way to describe this game is: <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/the-simpsons-hit-run&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/the-simpsons-hit-run"><em>Simpsons: Hit And Run</em></a></span>, but without the copyrighted characters. Like <em>Hit and Run</em>, in <em>Turbo Trip</em> you explore a large but not massive open world filled with random junk (in this case, literal junk) to collect. Sometimes the junk is just sitting around. Other times it’s hidden in out-of-the-way locations. Like <em>Hit And Run</em>, you do light platforming to reach these places while also completing silly quests for townsfolk which often involve driving and jumping around the city. Also like <em>Hit And Run</em>, you can hop into any NPC’s car and ride about town as a passenger.<br></p><p><em>Turbo Trip</em> actually expands on <em>Hit And Run</em> by adding more upgrades you can unlock as you play, like a glider and different weapons. (Oh, don’t worry, there’s no combat in this game. You just use weapons to break open boxes or annoy random NPCs.) I also greatly prefer running and driving in <em>Turbo Trip</em> as platforming genuinely feels nice and is super responsive compared to the stiffer controls in<em> Hit And Run</em> and even some other big open-world games out there. (Looking at you <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>…)<br></p><p><em>Tiny Terry’s Turbo Trip</em> will likely take you less than four hours to complete, though if you try to do and collect everything it might take closer to six. Either way, you’re in for an awesome and funny open-world comedy game that <em>actually </em>made me laugh a lot and which is a dream to play. It might not be<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/simpsons-hit-and-run-2-sequel-remake-remaster-planes-1851038958&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/simpsons-hit-and-run-2-sequel-remake-remaster-planes-1851038958"><em>Hit And Run 2</em></a></span><em>,</em> but it’s a damn fine game on its own. <br></p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/wuthering-waves-tactical-hologram-boss-difficulty-ranked/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=wuthering-waves-tactical-hologram-boss-difficulty-ranked<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="216" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The Tactical Hologram bosses are the most difficult content you can tackle in <em>Wuthering Waves</em>. There are four bosses total, so if you’re looking to tackle them from easiest to hardest, here they all are ranked.</p> <h2 id="h-all-tactical-hologram-bosses-ranked-in-wuthering-waves" data-injectable="false">All Tactical Hologram Bosses Ranked in <em>Wuthering Waves</em></h2> <p data-characters="575" data-current-count="575" data-injectable="true">Right before I jump into the ranking process, understand that the difficulty of boss encounters in <em>Wuthering Waves</em> depends on several factors, with one of the largest being personal skill. As such, this ranking is based entirely on my own skill level, which may be lesser or greater than yours. For a little context, I am currently on Difficulty 6 on every one of the Tactical Hologram bosses so far, so the rankings will be based on Level 5. I believe this still pretty much paints the same picture, however. Disclaimer over. The following ranks are from <strong>easiest to hardest</strong>.</p>
 <h3 id="h-impermanence-heron" data-injectable="false">Impermanence Heron</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wuthering-Waves-Tactical-Hologram-Ranked-Heron.jpg"></a><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="370" data-current-count="670" data-injectable="true">This deranged death bird is the easiest of the Tactical Hologram bosses because its patterns are simple to understand. There is little complication to any of the Impermanence Heron’s attacks, and if you die to it, you very clearly get why. Its attacks have massively obvious tells (minus a certain sidestep wing sweep move) making it easy to read for counterplay. </p>
 <p data-characters="395" data-current-count="395" data-injectable="false">Additionally, this overgrown bird is quite slow, allowing you plenty of time to react to it. It has very few parry windows that matter, and each one is easy to land once you’ve got the timing down for them. Overall, an easy boss. Most people shouldn’t struggle too much up to about Difficulty 4, but that’s only because all of the Tactical Hologram bosses get much harder then.</p> <h3 id="h-feilian-beringal" data-injectable="false"><strong>Feilian Beringal</strong></h3> <figure data-current-count="695" data-injectable="true"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wuthering-Waves-Tactical-Hologram-Ranked-Feilian.jpg"></a><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="422" data-current-count="422" data-injectable="true">This giant ape is a bit harder than the Impermance Heron, due to being faster and more relentless with its continuous attacks. However, for most people, Feilian Berginal’s speed won’t be much of an issue due to how telegraphed its attacks are. All of them have large wind-ups, so you have plenty of time to react, and they’re often so large that they straight-up miss you if you don’t do anything. </p>
 <p data-characters="369" data-current-count="369" data-injectable="false">What puts this ape over the Heron in difficulty is its seemingly large health pool and log-spin attack. First, Feilian Beringal has a lot of health to burn through to beat the timer, meaning you need to be fishing for counterattacks every chance you get, especially at lower gear levels. Early on, I found this aspect of the monkey to be the hardest part to deal with. </p> <p data-characters="666" data-current-count="1035" data-injectable="true">However, Feilian Beringal also has a special attack he performs on occasion when he gets access to his log. He will begin to spin around rapidly for about ten seconds, in which, during this time <strong>he can one-shot you if any portion of it hits you.</strong> What makes this move particularly dangerous is that the animation of the spin does not match the actual hurt-box that can, well, hurt you, meaning you can die to an attack you cannot see. The best counter for this is to literally spam dodge during the spin attack, and counterattack after each one. The extended i-frames from the counter will allow you to survive the entire animation, and you get more damage out of it.</p>
 <h3 id="h-mourning-aix" data-injectable="false">Mourning Aix</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="488" data-current-count="788" data-injectable="true">Oof. I have a lot to say about this boss. Rough around the edges doesn’t even begin to describe it, because this monstrosity has so many glitches, camera bugs, and one-shot mechanics that, when all combined together, make this one of the hardest bosses in the entire game. Mourning Aix is no joke even without all the bugs, as everything it does is just generally annoying. This monster constantly mixes slow, easy-to-spot attacks with lightning-fast ones that catch you off guard. </p>
 <p data-characters="584" data-current-count="584" data-injectable="true">Worse, this beast spams a cyclonic blade swarm attack that requires you to <strong>memorize which</strong> <strong>attack it used before it</strong>, to understand how many times you need to press your dodge button, otherwise you die. Not joking. It literally uses different variants of this move depending on that. Generally speaking, you want to parry <strong>every single one of its parry-able attacks</strong>, as it reduces the frequency of cyclonic blade swarms you’ll have to deal with. Trust me when I say, it’s worth the trouble. The harder the difficulty you choose, the more important those parry windows become.</p>
 <h3 id="h-thundering-mephis" data-injectable="false">Thundering Mephis</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="469" data-current-count="769" data-injectable="true">Thundering Mephis is easily the most difficult boss in <em>Wuthering Waves </em>as a hologram. This boss is extremely fast, and constantly barrages you with kill moves that require very fast reaction times to avoid. On top of this, the boss disappears constantly, reducing your overall DPS on him unless you parry his attacks on an equally consistent basis. I’d say that this boss is nearly impossible to kill in time if you don’t parry most of his moves, currently.</p>
 <p data-characters="727" data-current-count="727" data-injectable="true">What truly makes this boss a nightmare is its infuriating clone that it spawns at random while attacking you. The clone can appear at a moment’s notice, and attack with lightning speed. It can appear off the edge of your screen and blast you while you focus on the main body. It can unleash Thunder Mephis’s mass AoE instant kill move, while the main body blasts you from off-screen. There are just so many combination attacks that clutter the scene that it’s often hard to tell what even happening. You’re dealing with this <strong>while dealing with relentless attacks of Thunder Mephis, constantly.</strong> Everything both the main body and clone do can one-shot you. All it takes is one tap, and you’re done. </p>
 <p data-characters="480" data-current-count="480" data-injectable="true">If this wasn’t enough for you, then know that you can parry the clone’s attacks. Normally, you’re rewarded for doing this, but if you manage to pull off this feat, even by accident <strong>you’re frozen in place, camera and all, and are unable to dodge, swap characters,</strong> or<strong> generally defend yourself</strong> for about one second. This is enough time for Thundering Mephis to outright kill you. Part of me thinks this is another bug, but, honestly, I’m not even sure.</p>
 <p data-characters="104" data-current-count="104" data-injectable="false">What I am sure of, though, is that there is no more difficult boss than this monster in <em>Wuthering Waves.</em></p>
