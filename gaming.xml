            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/song-of-ice-and-fire-tmg-spring-2024-new-releases<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Swords slice through frozen air as hot blood hisses red on fresh snow, so you know what that means! We're heading up to the frozen North as we take a close look at two brand new units for <em>A Song of Ice and Fire TMG</em>. With new releases for both the Free Folk army and the Winterfell army, we’re traveling up to the wall (and beyond)!</p>
<p>I’ve been consistently impressed with previous releases, which you can check out in <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/song-of-ice-and-fire-tmg-bolton-starter-set-review">my review of the Bolton Starter Set</a>, and my review of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/song-of-ice-and-fire-tmg-late-2023-new-release-review">some late 2023 <em>Song of Ice and Fire TMG&nbsp;</em>releases</a>, but let's see how these two new units stack up!</p>
<h2><em>A Song of Ice and Fire TMG:&nbsp;</em>Harma's Vanguard</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/harmas-vanguard-a-song-of-ice-and-fire-tmg.jpg?itok=Z_c0fgDS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/harmas-vanguard-a-song-of-ice-and-fire-tmg.jpg?itok=hjPgYJAw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>These miniatures are so dynamically sculpted, making a huge impression on the table!</figcaption></figure><p>First up, let's take a look at <a href="https://store.asmodee.com/products/sif-harmas-vanguard-ml" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Harma's Vanguard</a>, a new unit for the Free Folk army! The head of Mance Rayder's vanguard, Harma Dogshead led the approach South down the Milkwater - for non-<i>ASOIAF</i>&nbsp;readers all this is to say, she was a Freefolk raider who, notably, hated dogs!</p>
<p>And though she's not included in this set (she was already released as part of <a href="https://www.cmon.com/products/free-folk-heroes-1/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Free Folk Heroes I</a>&nbsp;years ago), her Vanguard represents a new, highly mobile bright spot in the army. With the only other Cavalry in the entire Free Folk range being the Frozen Shore Bear Riders (extremely cool, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/song-of-ice-and-fire-tmg-spring-2022-previews">check them out in our Spring 2022 roundup</a>), Harma's Vanguard can give some much needed ground cover to this army.</p>
<p>As with all Calvary, they get to make a free Maneuver action at the start of their turn. And while their weapons are a bit lacking (their "Crude Weapons" hit on a 4+, and they're rolling 6/4 based on damage), and they don't have great defense (6+), their ability to close the gap on the battlefield is crucial.</p>
<p>Add to that their special Order ability "Planned Approach," which at the Start of Any Turn reads: Target 1 friendly unit in Long Range. Until the end of the Turn, that unit may not be targeted by enemy effects or abilities. When selecting their Action for the Turn, that unit may only declare Charge Actions.</p>
<p>I really like this ability, as it feels very thematic to a Vanguard. Their job is to scope out the battlefield, discovering weaknesses and then alerting the army as to the when and where of the attack! That's just what they're doing with this ability. With a cost of 5 points (and no upgrades available), they open up new potentials for a... gasp! <i>faster</i>&nbsp;Free Folk army list!</p>
<h2><em>A Song of Ice and Fire TMG:&nbsp;</em>Winterfell Guards</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/winterfell-guards-a-song-of-ice-and-fire-tmg.jpg?itok=YEWbyhLg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/winterfell-guards-a-song-of-ice-and-fire-tmg.jpg?itok=lBAq17ts 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Will you hold the line for Winterfell? These guys would!</figcaption></figure><p>Next, let's take a look at the <a href="https://store.asmodee.com/products/sif-winterfell-guards-ml?_pos=1&amp;_psq=Winterfell+Guard&amp;_ss=e&amp;_v=1.0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Winterfell Guards</a>. These Guards are described on their play card as "Veterans in their prime," who have staunchly defended the castle walls of Winterfell but now find themselves called to the battlefield in this time of war. One of the ways that I really like this flavor coming to life is in their "Adaptive" special ability, which just says to "Reduce the cost of 1 Attachment in this unit by 1."</p>
<p>What this means is that if I wanted to attach a neutral or Winterfell hero, a special captain, or some other cool "upgrade" to this unit I could do so for 1 less cost. That's a fun little ability, but from a storytelling perspective? Perfection. I think it makes&nbsp;<em>so much sense</em>&nbsp;that a unit comprised of veterans would be able to seamlessly welcome in a leader or specialist within their ranks.</p>
<p>With Longswords hitting on a 3+ (with 7/6/4 dice rolled as their ranks determine), and a decent 4+ defense, these are indeed sturdy warriors. Their two special abilities also seem fairly potent to me. For one, there's the Winterfell Supplies ability, which grants them Precision ("For each Attack Die roll of 6, the Defender does not roll a Defense Die, but instead suffers 1 Wound.") and says that while you control the Combat Zone, your melee attacks will always roll the highest value (7).</p>
<p>There's also the "Improved Defenses" Ability, which says that while you control the Maneuver zone, this unit gains a +1 to Defense Dice Rolls.</p>
<p>So here's the question, are these abilities -- which rely on you controlling specific zones -- actually all that helpful? In my opinion, you never want to be caught in a situation where you're controlling zones&nbsp;<em>just</em>&nbsp;for these benefits - they're not quite big enough I don't think - but if you have other ways to make use of these zones, then you've suddenly created a very threatening force here!</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/winterfell-guards-closeup-detail-a-song-of-ice-and-fire-tmg-.jpg?itok=11L6cLjH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/winterfell-guards-closeup-detail-a-song-of-ice-and-fire-tmg-.jpg?itok=AJhnZUzf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Behold a mighty Champion!</figcaption></figure><p>Also included in this unit release is an Upgrade, the Winterfell Champion. He costs 1 (therefore is free for this unit, thanks to the above-mentioned Adaptive trait) and adds Critical Blow ("For each Attack Die roll of 6, the Defender suffers +1 Hit.") and "Enemies Successfully Charged become Weakened." I don't hate this Champ as a free upgrade to this unit, since you're already enjoying free damage from their Precision! So a roll of a 6 will deal 2 automatic damage that your opponent can't even roll to defend against - Nasty!</p>
<h2>How Do They Look?</h2>
<p>As you can see from the above photographs, these <em>A Song of Ice and Fire Tabletop Miniatures Game </em>miniatures - like just about everything else in this line - look absolutely stunning. And though there's no hobby element to&nbsp;<em>ASOIAF:TMG&nbsp;</em>(all models come pre-built and based, much to this busy reviewer's delight) the tradeoff in detail is really impressive. From tufted fur cloaks to a diversity of stances, these units both look incredible.</p>
<h2><em>A Song of Ice and Fire TMG Review: </em>Harma's Vanguard and&nbsp;Winterfell Guards - Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Both of these units represent solid additions to their respective armies, but I think that Harma's Vanguard is much more transformative to the Free Folk than the Winterfell Guards are to Winterfell. Sure, it's great to see new Winterfell units, but there's nothing going on with that set that's really breaking the mold. But adding another Calvary unit to the Free Folk? Now that's interesting.</p>
<h2>Should I Buy Harma's Vanguard and/or Winterfell Guards?</h2>
<p>For Harma's Vanguard, if you're looking to add mobility to your Free Folk army, this is an absolute must-buy. For Winterfell Guards, if you like the thought of auto-dealing out multiple hits on good dice rolls, consider it! But know that these Veterans won't completely change your game.</p>

  <p id="avciNX">An important thing to know going into <em>The Watchers</em>, the feature directorial debut of Ishana Night Shyamalan, is that it isn’t a horror movie — it’s folkloric fantasy. That distinction will only matter to people who <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYo91Fq9tKY">watched an initial trailer</a> and walk in expecting a focus on scares and violence, instead of on unpacking the mystery and history around the movie’s titular Watchers. Anyone who goes in with the wrong expectations will probably just find <em>The Watchers</em> baffling. It has its share of creepy moments, rising tension, and sudden-blast-of-music jump scares, but as a suspense story, it fizzles out surprisingly early.</p>
<p id="pqwSMf">That may be because the story beats are lined up in a bewildering order, guaranteed to drop the movie’s tension from one act to the next instead of escalating it. While it’d be difficult for any movie to live up to <em>The Watchers</em>’ opening premise, Shyamalan’s version of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Watchers-gripping-debut-horror-novel-ebook/dp/B08TP9ZQY5?tag=polygon05-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank" has-subtag="true" data-cdata="{&quot;rewritten_url&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Watchers-gripping-debut-horror-novel-ebook/dp/B08TP9ZQY5?ascsubtag=___pl__p_23937331__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder\u0026tag=polygon05-20&quot;,&quot;subtag_max_length&quot;:99,&quot;subtag_delim_length&quot;:3,&quot;subtag_key&quot;:&quot;ascsubtag&quot;,&quot;subtag_data&quot;:{&quot;ascsubtag&quot;:&quot;___pl__p_23937331__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder&quot;,&quot;tag&quot;:&quot;polygon05-20&quot;},&quot;encode_subtag&quot;:false}">A.M. Shine’s 2022 novel</a> does a particularly poor job of paying off the early promise of the story’s setup.</p>

</p>
<p id="E2X8Wk">The premise is unusual enough to be intriguing: Mina (Dakota Fanning), a Galwegian pet store worker still harboring deep emotions about her mother’s death 15 years earlier, gets lost in a forest, where she’s clearly being manipulated by beings with supernatural powers. She eventually reaches a glass-fronted shelter roughly the size of a shipping trailer, where three other people: Ciara (Georgina Campbell), Daniel (Oliver Finnegan), and Madeline (Olwen Fouéré) have been living. At night, they lock themselves into the shelter (which they call “the Coop”) and unseen creatures come to stare at them. During the day, the creatures hide in burrows, and the captives are free to roam the forest — but they believe that if they go too far and get caught outside at night, their captors will kill them.</p>
<p id="kd07i3">Most of <em>The Watchers</em>’ appeal comes from all the mysteries in this setup: wondering what the Watchers are and what they want, what secrets the other three captives are hiding, who will inevitably crack first under the pressure the eerie situation puts the group under, and how Mina’s arrival will upset the status quo. The sharp, high-contrast cinematography (from <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22724430/lamb-movie-sheep-birth-scenes"><em>Lamb</em></a>’s Eli Arenson) gives these opening chapters a winningly oppressive look, with the golden glow of the Coop extending out into the deep blues and blacks of the nighttime woods. The constant effect of the Coop’s mirrored wall gives the characters an eerie set of duplicates hovering nearby at all times, which Shyamalan and Arenson use to create a hyper-real but still fable-like atmosphere that’s often haunting and unsettling. </p>

<p id="K7Up3A">One visual conceit in particular — foregrounding the mirror images, while diminishing the actual characters and turning them into afterthoughts — is a clever, eerie trick that hints at the film’s larger theme, around duplication. Mina’s parrot, a golden conure, periodically repeats things she says. Mina has a twin (also played by Fanning), who she’s pushed out of her life. Early on, Mina starts seeing an image of herself as a little girl off in the woods, an initial hint of the Watchers’ powers and intentions. But that theme never fully coheres in a satisfying or surprising element: It’s all scattered foreshadowing for a reveal that’s given away early, then repeated over and over in a way that keeps diminishing its impact.</p>
<p id="hYB4l4">Everything about <em>The Watchers</em>’ story and structure seems designed for exactly that sense of diminishing returns. The most compelling mysteries are quickly resolved, mostly through exposition. The tensest part of the movie is similarly resolved long before most cinephiles would expect it to, giving way to more exposition. The film’s third act largely consists of research, reading, and characters telling each other things the audience already knows, but in portentous tones, as if that might add significance. It’s honestly confusing, waiting for the other shoe to drop, then realizing there is no other shoe, just a protracted unraveling of the movie’s initial tension.</p>

<p id="xCkx2A">In theory, the structure could be viewed as a shift from general stakes to personal ones, and from a broad threat to a specific one. In practice, the movie lets its scariest elements go long before the finale, and replaces them with a tediously slow procedural building up to a poorly paced, badly mismanaged conversation. There’s real potential in the story elements here, but they all seem to come in the wrong order, and in some cases, in the wrong locale. It’s as if Shyamalan is trying to tell a story that’s distinctive, different, and unpredictable, but winds up with something mostly distinctive in how badly it misses the basic elements of a thriller. </p>
<p id="fhxD76">It’s easy to imagine a version of this film structured in the opposite order, where a character learns enough about the Watchers’ history and intent to make them more frightening when they appear, and the “trapped in the Coop” scenario lasts longer, feels more central, and is allowed to build the suspense up to the breaking point. It’s much harder to understand how anyone thought a movie could hold on to an audience once all the peril gives way to characters giving speeches and watching videos. </p>
<p id="JDk3Pj">Maybe going in with those expectations in mind will help: When a story is <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22740450/horror-movie-tropes-real-fears">built entirely out of fear of the unknown</a>, it’s preposterously difficult to stick the landing without <a href="https://www.avclub.com/a-well-orchestrated-cabal-could-easily-manage-all-of-t-1798224683">eventually disappointing the audience</a>. But even forewarned and forearmed, <em>The Watchers</em> is a strange experience, like watching a fairly solid supernatural suspense movie, then spending half an hour reading the footnotes. </p>

<p>If you've <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/compression-attached-memory-modules-may-make-upgradable-laptops-a-thing-again/">read</a> our <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/12/camm-standard-published-opening-door-for-thin-speedy-ram-to-overtake-so-dimm/">previous coverage</a> of the emerging CAMM standard, you know how excited we are about the ultra-thin modules that can simply be screwed into place on a laptop or portable motherboard. That offers a viable replacement for the now-standard soldered LPDDR RAM, which saves space but is incredibly difficult to repair or replace.</p>
<p>The CAMM standard brings the same easy-to-swap design as the older SO-DIMM RAM stick standard but with a smaller footprint, thermal design, and power usage specially made for portable devices. Reports suggest the XPG Nia will use the low-power LPCAMM2 version of these RAM modules, which will be easily accessible by lifting up the kickstand on the back of the XPG Nia. Alongside a standard M.2 2230 slot for adding more storage, that should make the new handheld much easier to upgrade than the likes of the Steam Deck, which <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/modder-boosts-steam-deck-to-a-bountiful-32gb-ram">requires some serious hacking</a> to push above the standard spec.</p>                                            
                                                        
<figure><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/numberpad-1.jpeg" data-height="1886" data-width="3998" alt="A Dell rendering depicting the size differences between SODIMM and CAMM."></a><figcaption><p><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/numberpad-1.jpeg" data-height="1886" data-width="3998">Enlarge</a> <span>/</span> A Dell rendering depicting the size differences between SODIMM and CAMM.</p><p>Dell</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>The only real downside to CAMM2 memory modules, at the moment, is the price; <a href="https://www.techradar.com/pro/lpcamm2-memory-module-debuts-with-shockingly-high-price-tag-but-fear-not-things-can-only-get-better-as-smaller-memory-players-jump-on-the-bandwagon">a recent CAMM2 offering from Crucial</a> runs $175 for 32GB or $330 for 64GB. That's significantly more than similar, bulkier SO-DIMM modules, but those prices should come down as more device makers and RAM manufacturers start supporting the standard.</p>
<h2>A “circular computing device”?</h2>
<p>Thus far, the XRG Nia's modular design doesn't seem to extend to the planned AMD Phoenix APU or Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor. That said, users will reportedly be able to remove the entire motherboard from the portable case, which can then be inserted into a smaller, screen-free enclosure for a potential second life as an Arudino/Raspberry Pi-like mini-PC.</p>
<p>Adata says it also plans to release the system's 3D design files and pinout details publicly, letting modders and third-party manufacturers design their own cases and accessories. It's all part of what Adata is calling a "circular computing design" that's part of its "sustainable future" initiative.</p>

<p>There are a few other features that set the XRG Nia apart from the waves of me-too Steam Deck clones. In addition to the rear kickstand, the entire screen enclosure slides up on a sort of pivot, providing a shallower viewing angle that requires less neck tilting when holding the device in front of your chest. Adata is also promising a front-facing camera that can be used for streaming as well as eye-tracking, which could theoretically power some fancy foveated rendering tricks for extra graphics horsepower.</p>
<p>It's way too early to know how all of these features will shake out in the move from prototype to final device; <a href="https://x.com/RetroHandhelds/status/1797885352994292036/video/4">reports suggest</a> the company is aiming for a release sometime in 2025. Still, it's nice to see a company trying some new things in the increasingly crowded space of handheld PC gaming devices that Valve has unleashed. If Adata can deliver the portable as an actual consumer product at its target of 1.5 pounds and $600, it could be one to keep an eye on.</p>

<p>I fully understand why people don't want multiple game launchers on their PC. Steam is the default and good enough for (seemingly) most people. It's not your job to compel competition in the market. You want to launch and play games you enjoy, as do most of us.</p>
<p>So when I tell you that <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/marvels-midnight-suns"><em>Marvel's Midnight Suns</em></a> is a game worth the hassle of registering, installing, and using the Epic Games Launcher, I am carefully picking my shot. For the price of giving Epic your email (or a proxy/relay version, <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/duckduckgo-help-pages/email-protection/what-is-duckduckgo-email-protection/">like Duck</a>), or just logging in again, you can play a fun, novel, engaging turn-based strategy game, with deckbuilding and positioning tactics, for zero dollars. Even if you feel entirely sapped by Marvel at this point, like most of us, I assure you that this slice of Marvel feels more like the comic books and less like the overexposed current films. Just ask the guy who made it.</p>
<h2>Tactical deckbuilding is fun</h2>
<p>The game was <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/13373/marvels-midnight-suns">very well-regarded by most critics</a>&nbsp;but <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/firaxis-hit-by-layoffs-after-midnight-suns-disappointment-and-departure-of-iconic-creative-lead/">was not a financial success</a> upon release in December 2022, or was at least "underwhelming." Why any game hits or doesn't is a combination of many factors, but one of them was likely that the game was trying something new. It wasn't just <em>X-COM </em>with Doctor Strange. It had some <em>Fire Emblem</em> relationship-building and base exploration, but it also had cards. The cards blend into the turn-based, positional, chain-building strategy, but some people apparently saw cards and turned away.</p>
<p>"Before, I never had an experience where people had expressed disappointment before playing, you know," Jake Solomon, the now-departed director of <em>Midnight Suns</em> and <em>XCOM,</em> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/jake-solomon-uncut-heres-our-post-firaxis-gdc-interview-in-full">told Rock Paper Shotgun in an interview.</a> "As we told people from the beginning, it's not an accident, we don't share a single mechanic with <em>XCOM</em>. … And so I think when people play it, they get it, it's really fun, and you can get as addicted to this as you can to <em>XCOM</em>. But I also totally get it when people look at images coming out and go 'What the f*** is that? Are those… are those cards? Cards!?' So yeah, I can sympathise with people for that reason, I guess."</p>

<p>Folks, the cards are fun. The resources you gather go into upgrading your cards, which are all your moves in combat. There are strategies inherent to each character, like chaining attacks, moving enemies through portals, area-of-effect attacks, and the like. But then you can min-max heroes' abilities, focus on your favorite heroes, and laugh when things go horribly awry or ridiculously in your favor.</p>
<p>You don't build one deck in <em>Midnight Suns</em>, you build a whole team of little decks. As a designer for deckbuilder <em>Cobalt Core</em> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/04/why-there-are-861-roguelike-deckbuilders-on-steam-all-of-a-sudden/">told Ars</a>, deckbuilding puts you "in this space where no two turns are ever exactly the same, so players get to keep figuring out new optimal solutions. But even though the options are always huge, they're made up of pretty simple building blocks, so it's not overwhelming."
</p><p>The other big change from <em>XCOM </em> and similar games is a rich use of both a destructible environment and rag-doll enemies. Having Magik set up a portal, then Iron Man blasts a goon through it, then seeing that enemy fly through the exit portal into an overloaded battery that explodes, knocking out two more baddies—it's a great feeling.</p>
<figure><figcaption><p>Even devout Marvel fans will find some characters they'd never delved into previously, like Nico Minoru of the Midnight Suns crew.</p><p>2K/Firaxis</p></figcaption></figure>
<h2>Comicbook Marvel, not movie-stars Marvel</h2>
<p>The thing that most often happens in between missions is talking. You seek out and talk to your teammates, respond to things they say, go on excursions with them. It gets to the point where you can join a book club with Captain America, Blade, Captain Marvel, and, reluctantly, Wolverine.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>It can be a bit much, but the dialogue and voice acting is well-done, in my estimation. In some comic-book-but-also-movie games, the lack of rights to an actor's face can be hard to get past, if you're used to seeing them in that superhero getup. <em>Midnight Suns</em> has both pretty close approximations of various heroes, or alternate faces that didn't bug me after the first few sightings. And if none of the world-building/friend-making stuff is for you, you can hold a button and skip through toward more goon-bashing.</p>
<p>Solomon noted in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/jake-solomon-uncut-heres-our-post-firaxis-gdc-interview-in-full">that same RPS interview</a> that he is a "really, really, like, super Marvel Comics nerd." That comes through in how each character is framed, how they interact, and their motivations. There's still a good bit of the modern Marvel quip quotient, but it's palatable. Going on friend dates with the Scarlet Witch may not be something you seek out in your turn-based tactics, but give it a try. It gives you some motivation to see your heroes succeed and work together.</p>
<p>Epic has <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/marvels-midnight-suns">the base <em>Midnight Suns</em> game free</a> through June 13 at 11 am. You could add on some DLC if you like, with new characters like Storm, Venom, Morbius, and Deadpool (if you're _really_ okay with quipping). You'll see various costumes and in-game currencies available for sale, too, but none of them are at all necessary to play and succeed at the game. If you're enjoying the game, and wish it ran a bit faster, consider <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/midnightsuns/comments/zlm1ka/method_to_bypass_2k_launcher_for_epic_games/">disabling the 2K launcher in the Epic Games version</a>.
</p><p>A lot of games release every day, and some of them end up being games I wish I could have written about and recommended. <em>Midnight Suns</em> has long resided in that mental space for me. For the price of zero dollars, plus whatever level of commitment is required for an Epic Store download, it's an easy game to recommend.</p>

Even though the showcase is essentially a hype trailer for the video game industry, filling in the marketing hole <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23998271/e3-gaming-convention-canceled-death">E3 left behind</a>, Summer Game Fest got its own hype trailer reminding us of what games to expect.</p><p>But even though the SGF hype train has left the station, MC Geoff Keighley has <a href="https://kotaku.com/summer-game-fest-2024-geoff-keighley-sets-expectations-1851516386">cautioned viewers not to get too excited for surprise reveals</a>. During <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2162199165">a Q&amp;A livestream</a>, Keighley said that it’s a quieter year for big releases and announcements compared to last year.

Organized by accessibility consultant and critic Laura Kate Dale, it’s a reaction to events designed to build hype and how disabled gamers too often have to temper excitement with caution over whether revealed games will be accessible. A frustration, Dale told <em>The Verge</em>, driven by “the industry’s unwillingness to be open and transparent about gaming accessibility.”&nbsp;</p><p>Now in its second year, the showcase continues to push back against a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/8/23754562/summer-game-fest-women-diversity-geoff-keighley">lack of inclusive gaming events</a> as it grows — it includes <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fcurator%2F45010171%2Fsale%2FAccess-AbilitySummerShowcase2024">a dedicated Steam page</a> this year. Already, developers are not only viewing it as an opportunity to show off their games, Dale said, but also as encouragement to implement accessibility earlier in development to be ready for the event. “The idea that a place to proudly promote their accessibility would help push developers to have more features ready at earlier milestones makes me feel like the show is having a tangible impact,” Dale added.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24172897/access-ability-showcase-best-games-trailers-2024">Read Article &gt;</a></span></p></div></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-b879fcce-21cc-4279-8e98-0e89c767d1a9"><div><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/7/24171636/summer-game-fest-2024-how-to-watch">How to watch the Summer Game Fest 2024</a></h2><p>It’s that time of year again.

  <p id="H5NYBs">Monday afternoon’s Ubisoft Forward 2024 is this year’s exclusive look at everything the major publisher-developer is working on — or, at least, everything it’s ready to share with players. </p>
<p id="vUpeqm">This year’s event likely <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24173629/12-new-indie-games-play-right-now">isn’t going to be an all-out barrage of release dates</a> and new game announcements (much like the previous <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/24167070/summer-game-fest-2024-schedule-sgf-e3">Summer Game Fest events</a> from this weekend), but Ubisoft has promised plenty of updates and reveals — here’s how to tune in and what to expect.</p>
<h2 id="MjqkLT"><strong>What time is Ubisoft Forward?</strong></h2>

<h2 id="igijuN"><strong>What games to expect at the Ubisoft Forward</strong></h2>
<p id="EYV2Oc">and intel on <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24124341/star-wars-outlaws-story-trailer-release-date"><em>Star Wars Outlaws</em></a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24156633/ubisoft-assassins-creed-shadows-trailer-release-date-codename-red"><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24161951/ubisoft-xdefiant-unable-to-find-match-launch-day-troubles"><em>XDefiant</em></a>. Based on the Ubisoft Forward trailer above, it seems likely that we’ll get gameplay trailers for all of these titles and more. </p>
<p id="aek2Gz"><em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> already has a release date of Aug. 30, 2024, and <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> should be released on Nov. 12, 2024. <em>XDefiant</em> was released on May 21, so expect the showcase to include an overview of upcoming updates and patches.</p>
<p id="jSRRBM">Other than those three huge titles, we aren’t exactly sure what to expect from Ubisoft’s showcase. We’d love to see any update at all on <em>Prince of Persia: Sands of Time</em>, but <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24171532/summer-game-fest-2024-e3-xbox-showcase-ubisoft-forward">we’re not holding our breath</a>. We’re also hoping to see new trailers for the <em>Splinter Cell</em> remake, but no promises.</p>
<p id="oxJ1hN">Players can also tune into the Ubisoft Forward to get <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/1wiMDtoAYWGz6xzD1Vvu5K/ubisoft-forward-2024-how-and-where-to-watch">Twitch drops and other rewards</a> — just make sure to link your Ubisoft account with your Twitch account if you care about scoring extra trinkets and skins in games, new and old.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/24172035/leyndell-ashen-capital-walkthrough<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="RiOKiO"><strong>Leyndell, the Ashen Capital </strong>is the completely altered version of the sumptuous <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/22982996/leyndell-royal-capital-site-of-grace-tips-tricks-hidden-path-strategy-boss-morgott">Leyndell, Royal Capital</a> from earlier in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/e/23921448"><em>Elden Ring</em></a>.</p>
<p id="oK0MCy">Exploring it is the last scratch before getting inside the Erdtree and facing the final encounter. </p>
<p id="39wV2d">In this <em>Elden Ring</em> walkthrough, we point out the location of the last items for you to grab in the wasteland that is now Leyndell, the Ashen Capital. We’ll also tell you how to reach the fights against <a href="https://www.polygon.com/e/23936375">Sir Gideon Ofnir</a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/e/23936409">Hoarah Loux</a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/e/23937716">Radagon</a>, and the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/e/23937836">Elden Beast</a>.</p>

<hr id="Mdx7r9">

<p id="cQHlOi">You can only access the Ashen Capital after you have defeated <a href="https://www.polygon.com/e/23936324">Maliketh</a> in Crumbling Farum Azula. Following a cutscene, you’re teleported to Leyndell. The city is now a fairly short area and there isn’t much to be done here, besides unlocking some lost graces that disappeared from your world map, get to the Subterranean Shunning-Ground if you haven’t done it yet, or heading toward the endgame.</p>
<p id="MQWyKU">Below, you find the rundown of the east section of the map and all the new areas you can access by going south.</p>
<hr id="T28UpR">
<h2 id="BAiu1Y"><strong>Leyndell, Ashen Capital east walkthrough</strong></h2>
<p id="6wZFrb">You’ll want to start your journey in the modified Leyndell by going east from the lost grace where you wake up after the events in Crumbling Farum Azula. As mentioned, you won’t find enemies around this initial part of the city, so don’t worry about dying. On the other hand, at the east side, all you find is a lost grace — nothing else.</p>

<p id="Xufulc">The walkway splits into two paths; on the left path, you find a root that you should use to reach the upper level of the building.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/destiny-2-the-final-shape-review-in-progress.893007/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/destiny-2-the-final-shape-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Regularly playing Destiny for the past decade, through all its unforgettable highs and painful lows, has been a tremendous leap of faith for me and my fellow Guardians. This uneven saga hasn’t always felt like it was leading somewhere worth following, but with Destiny 2: The Final Shape, it seems our faith has been rewarded at last. After some extremely rocky launch day server troubles, followed by two days of nonstop playing, what I’ve seen so far has been overwhelmingly awesome. The campaign (absent a proper finale right now) is one of the best in series history, the new Prismatic subclasses are exactly the badass shock to the system its sandbox needed, the fresh set of weapons have been a literal blast to mess around with, and the fearsome Dread enemy faction add welcome variety and difficulty to the battlefield. There’s still a lot left for me to play, including the endgame raid I’ll be battling against this weekend and the story conclusion that’s locked behind it – but as the ending to this 10-year saga takes its final shape, Destiny is more fun than it’s ever been, and I’m eager to see if it can stick the landing.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Destiny 2: The Final Shape Launch Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>If you’re arriving extremely late to the space opera party, The Final Shape is the latest (and quite possibly greatest) expansion in developer Bungie’s ongoing, magically-infused multiplayer FPS. As an immortal and homicidally inclined Guardian, I’ve had the privilege of defending humanity against all manner of alien threats over the years, from evil sorcerer insects to an extremely boring robot army, all while looting cool weapons and armor, unlocking sweet space magic abilities, leveling up, and juggling so many currencies, menus, and ill-explained RPG systems that your head is liable to explode Arc of the Covenant-style if you don’t have a friend to walk you through it. After seven years of expansions, patches, and seasonal updates, Destiny 2 has grown into one of the best and twelve of the worst games you’ll ever play, all wrapped into a live-service package unlike anything else out there. It’s great; I hate it.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>This campaign finally sold me on the existential horror of The Witness.</p></div><p>The Final Shape has the unenviable task of concluding the main story of good vs. evil that’s haphazardly played out since the first Destiny. Although that story has mostly been a veritable jambalaya of overused tropes, sci-fi gobbledygook, and lore <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzBmOeYmN_M" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>so convoluted one player had to make a ten hour YouTube video to explain it</u></a>, it occasionally brings the heat with some genuinely compelling characters and meaningful stories, like those found in 2022’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/destiny-2-the-witch-queen-review">The Witch Queen</a>. So far, The Final Shape appears to count itself among those rare instances of solid storytelling, finally focusing on the big bad that’s been alluded to from the very beginning for a showdown with the fate of the universe on the line. </p><p>That archenemy comes in the form of The Witness, and although I wasn’t impressed with the character’s initial reveal or the setup that’s taken place over the past two years leading up to this finale, The Final Shape’s campaign, packed with hard-hitting cutscenes that explain a whole lot, finally sold me on this existential horror. I won’t go into details to spare you any spoilers, but The Witness ended up being a much more interesting villain than I’d anticipated, the threat humanity is facing finally feels real instead of like some distant shadow we have an appointment with, and I’m thrilled we’re finally getting some actual answers to the questions we’ve had all these years.</p><p>That said, there are still plenty of points in The Final Shape where Destiny’s usually sloppier storytelling continues in that tradition, like with the middle act of the story where it pivots to some drama with the stoic and stalwart Commander Zavala, who suddenly (and with only the scarcest whiff of justification) becomes an emotional loose cannon to add a bit of unearned tension into the mix. There’s also some side stories with obscure characters returning from seasons you might not have played or lore entries you probably didn’t read, which mostly pulls focus away from the conflict at hand without adding a whole lot – the kind of par-for-the-course wonky Destiny storytelling that’s irked me since 2014.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>What's really going to matter is if it can deliver a satisfying conclusion.</p></div><p>But, ultimately, the thing that’s really going to matter is whether or not The Final Shape can deliver a satisfying conclusion, and that remains to be seen. While I enjoyed the seven-mission main story, which can be completed in as many hours, it doesn’t have a real ending quite yet – instead, it sets up the raid that unlocks today, which will serve as one last big battle before an eighth and final campaign mission that will likely wrap everything up. Here’s hoping Bungie can give us something at least as good as the rest of the campaign with that, because it’s largely delivered a satisfying finale so far.</p><p>Regardless of how that story ends, the levels you’ll play and new areas you’ll explore are some of my favorites yet. Delving into the body of a God, you’ll explore The Pale Heart of the Traveler, a bizarre reality where one’s memories, desires, and fears manifest themselves in the physical world. What starts as an idyllic but peculiar world begins to shift into a horrific landscape, as the twisted wishes of The Witness corrupt it, with a bunch of gross hands and faces filling up the environment. That gives it an uncomfortable and surreal quality that’s a massive departure from the mostly grounded areas our Guardians have visited so far. It’s also fantastic that we finally got a map that isn’t just a loop with a few small areas to explore, instead favoring a fairly linear layout that feels like traveling from the Shire to Mount Doom on an epic quest to put the world right. I’m still exploring its nooks and crannies, shooting and looting everything I can find, but it’s already easily my favorite destination to date.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Similarly, its missions follow in the fantastic footsteps of The Witch Queen by adding light raid mechanics and challenging combat encounters, which provide more than the mindless shooting hallways that Destiny sometimes finds itself reduced to. In one level, you’ll hop between two realities to solve a puzzle in order to kill a massive boss, and in another you’ll battle to the top of some icy peaks, taking advantage of gale winds to propel you across massive gaps. Each level does a great job of teaching you a new mechanic here and there, slowly adding to the complexity of gunplay and puzzle solving, until somehow you’re juggling half a dozen things at once by the final battle, taking out an army of foes in one of the most badass showdowns so far. I had a ton of fun playing the entire campaign solo on Legendary, and am already looking forward to going through it again with friends on my other characters.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The Dread are awesome, injecting much needed variety into the sandbox.</p></div><p>One of the things that makes these missions so enjoyable is the first new enemy faction Destiny has gotten in six years, called the Dread. Even the two other enemy factions added in previous Destiny expansions were mostly remixes of existing enemies, so one could argue that the Dread are the first fully original faction so far, and what a difference that makes. The Grim, batlike creatures that fly around pelting you with blaster fire and screeching at you to slow your movement are overwhelming in large groups, while the Husk are melee bruisers who rush you with deadly blades and send explosive creatures flying at you if you don’t kill them in a specific way. Most of these additions are completely awesome, injecting some desperately needed variety into a sandbox that has stagnated over time. That said, there are a few that are less inspired: Attendants and Weavers, for example, appear almost as reskinned enemies from an existing race and pelt you with irritating abilities, including one that makes you move extremely slowly for way too long, and which resulted in more than a few deaths that felt a bit cheap. Still, these are minor qualms I have with a faction that’s been a ton of fun to fight so far.</p><p>As always, the latest Destiny expansion comes with a whole arsenal of unique toys to loot and bring to bear upon your foes, and The Final Shape has some really nice additions. The Call, a small sidearm that shoots mini rockets, is absolutely phenomenal to goof around with, while Lost Signal is a grenade launcher that shoots a smattering of explosives that do damage over time. My personal favorite new item is an exotic called Hazardous Propulsion that launches a flurry of missiles from your back whenever you use your class ability, which has gotten me out of so many tight spots lately – I’m completely obsessed. Destiny has always been renowned for its gunplay, even when other aspects of the shooter have come up short, so none of this is particularly surprising. But even for a game that’s known for its great weapons and armor, The Final Shape is a standout so far in what it offers. They really cooked on this one, folks!</p><div data-cy="carousel"><h3>TieGuyTravis' Destiny Rankings</h3><p>TieGuyTravis ranks each Destiny expansion since the series's conception.</p></div><p>The Final Shape also adds to Destiny’s space magic repertoire with a new subclass called Prismatic, which allows you to mix and match certain Light and Darkness abilities found in other subclasses to create interesting combinations. It then adds some new abilities of its own on top of that, from grenades that combine different damage types and status effects to do things like suspend enemies in the air and electrocute everything in the vicinity, to new super abilities that might let you throw giant exploding axes onto the battlefield, then pick them up to wreak havoc on the enemy. Being able to wield a mix of elements and abilities that were previously locked behind their own specific classes is a major game changer, and takes buildcrafting to the next level in terms of customization and playing around with different possibilities. I have yet to unlock all the options and have only played on one character class (the Titan) at the moment, and I’m already equally overwhelmed and excited by the possibilities.</p><p>I’ve played about 30 hours of The Final Shape so far, and will easily play another 40 over the weekend as I dive into the raid, finish the story, explore more of the side content, and try out the other character classes, but I’m already having a blast with what I’ve seen. I'll be back with a scored review sometime next week, but The Final Shape has already delivered in more ways than I thought possible – here’s hoping that momentum continues as Bungie rolls out the last act.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">Way back in the day, Xur, the Exotics vendor who only shows up in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/" data-ref-id="5000-463450">Destiny 2</a> on the weekends, required you to pay for his spiffy wares in a currency called Strange Coins. In Destiny 2, Strange Coins went away, only popping up later as part of the Dares of Eternity activity. With the currency changes that came with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-the-final-shape-guides-hub/1100-6523936/" data-ref-id="1100-6523936">The Final Shape</a>, you'll start finding Strange Coins in your pocket again, and you'll need them to buy stuff from Xur again.</p><p dir="ltr">The thing is, it's not immediately clear where you can get Strange Coins from in the game. You'll need a lot of them to buy stuff from Xur, as everything he sells, from Exotic weapons and armor to Legendary gear, requires Strange Coins. Here's what we know about Strange Coins and how to earn them. You might also want to check out our guide to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/where-is-xur-today-june-7-11-destiny-2-exotic-items-and-xur-location-guide/1100-6524013/" data-ref-id="1100-6524013">where Xur is and what he's selling</a>, as well.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How To Get Strange Coins in Destiny 2</h2><p dir="ltr">The main process for earning Strange Coins is taking part in Ritual activities. Those are the main Destiny 2 activities, like Strikes, Crucible matches, and Gambit matches. Notably, you don't need to mess with the new Pathfinder system to earn Strange Coins--they just drop when you complete activities.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4314990-20240607122727_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4314990" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4314990-20240607122727_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4314990"></a><figcaption>Ritual activities like Strikes, Crucible matches, and Gambit matches will earn you Strange Coins.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4314990-20240607122727_1.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">You'll always get Strange Coins from completing Ritual activities, but the number you earn is random. The minimum is two Strange Coins per activity, and the max is four. For context, much of what Xur sells is at least going to run you a handful of Strange Coins. Legendary armor and weapons come in at 17 Strange Coins, Exotics are 23, and Exotic Catalysts are 74. That probably means you want to regularly knock down Ritual activities to keep the flow of Strange Coins coming.</p><p dir="ltr">Ritual activities appear to be the most reliable source of Strange Coins, but they're not the only source. We've also seen them pop up among rewards from activities such as campaign missions in The Final Shape and Overthrow in the Pale Heart, but those aren't reliable sources--they seem to pop up randomly as you're doing activities in the world.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4314992-20240607122443_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4314992" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4314992-20240607122443_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4314992"></a><figcaption>Using Strange Coins to buy things from Xur will earn you a Favor of the Nine buff, which you can use to get more Strange Coins.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4314992-20240607122443_1.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">There is one counterintuitive way to get more Strange Coins, though: Spend them. When you spend 47 Strange Coins with Xur, you're rewarded for your brand loyalty with a timed buff called Favor of the Nine, which gives you a chance to get an additional Strange Coin for every Strange Coin you earn. What's more, the buff can stack, so you can burn several of them at once to increase your chances and maximize your Ritual activity earnings.</p><p dir="ltr">Check out the rest of our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-the-final-shape-guides-hub/1100-6523936/" data-ref-id="1100-6523936">guides for The Final Shape</a>, and read our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/destiny-2-the-final-shape-review/1900-6418239/" data-ref-id="1900-6418239">review of The Final Shape</a> while you're at it.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/yet-another-cult-classic-is-being-remastered-by-nightdive-this-time-its-the-thing/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=yet-another-cult-classic-is-being-remastered-by-nightdive-this-time-its-the-thing<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="245" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Following the announcement of <em>Killing Time: Remastered </em>yesterday, Nightdive Studios has announced as part of the IGN Live Stream that they are also remastering 2002’s <em>The Thing</em>. It’s planned to be launched on PC and consoles later this year.</p> <p data-characters="469" data-current-count="469" data-injectable="true">This announcement is somewhat surprising. Not only is this a relatively newer title that Nightdive is taking on compared to their previous remasters, but it’s a <em>licensed</em> one on top of that. They’re going all out with this one. The Thing: Remastered will not only port the game to the studio’s proprietary modern KEX Engine but also features “upgraded models, textures, and animations hand-crafted by Nightdive, plus enhanced lighting and atmospheric effects.”</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Nightdive Studios</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="544" data-current-count="844" data-injectable="true">Set after John Carpenter’s 1982 film of the same name, <em>The Thing </em>is a unique third-person shooter that leans into the trust angle of the film and not knowing whether the person next to you is even human. There was a trust system implemented to replicate this, which was one of the game’s most novel features, but also one of the points that were pointed out by players and critics at the time <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/r-thething" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as being undercooked</a>. Both the trust and infection angle had to be scaled back for purposes of scripted events. It was, essentially, too ambitious.</p>
 <p data-characters="325" data-current-count="325" data-injectable="false">Yet despite its inability to quite reach its goals, the reviews it received at the time weren’t abysmal, and enough people look back at it fondly enough that it could be considered a cult classic. Not quite the vindication the film (which was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160628091204/http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/thing_the" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">poorly received</a> at release) achieved, but it’s better than complete obscurity.</p> <p data-characters="247" data-current-count="572" data-injectable="true">I haven’t played it, so I can’t really give you my own opinion on it. I haven’t even watched the movie it’s based on, which I’ll probably have to do before the remaster is released. However, I can tell you I’m excited to give it a try.</p>
 <p data-characters="110" data-current-count="110" data-injectable="false"><em>The Thing: Remastered</em> is coming to PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, Switch, and PC sometime later this year.</p>

  <p id="TQzm7M"><strong>Tribal quests</strong> are one of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/ffxiv-guides-ff14-final-fantasy-14-online/22381941/beginners-job-subscription-teleport-mount-shadowbringers-endwalker"><em>Final Fantasy 14</em></a>’s more rewarding <a href="https://www.polygon.com/ffxiv-guides-ff14-final-fantasy-14-online/24118981/reset-daily-weekly-times-server-time">dailies</a>. Formerly known as “beast tribe quests,” these quests involving helping out the other races of Eorzea by beating down baddies that might be giving them grief, or helping them rebuild an area using crafting and gathering.</p>
<p id="VT3eWy">Below, we detail how tribal quests in <em>FFXIV </em>work, along with their rewards and how to unlock all of them.</p>

<hr id="e4Ke81">
<h2 id="8Lgdsm"><strong>Tribal quests in FFXIV, explained</strong></h2>
<p id="525F1Z">Tribal quests are daily quests you can complete to earn reputation and specialized currency. There are more than a dozen different tribes in <em>FFXIV</em> and they all offer different quests and rewards. These are great dailies to do to earn chunks of EXP, as some tribes focus on combat, whereas others focus on crafting or gathering.</p>
<p id="1NxgEW">You can accept a total of <strong>12 tribal quests per day</strong> and each tribe will give you up to <strong>three quests per day</strong>. If you rank up with that tribe, they’ll give you an additional three more to complete.</p>
<p id="eaL4L6">For each quest you accept and turn in, you’ll get some <strong>reputation points</strong> with that tribe. After amassing a certain amount of points, you’ll rank up with that tribe, allowing you to complete another quest and access more rewards. You can check your reputation from your character screen. You’ll need to use the currency you get from completing the quests to buy the rewards (like the aforementioned mounts and minions).</p>

<p id="Q2xL5f">Most of the quests are as simple as accepting the assignments, talking to an NPC, and then either taking out enemies, riding a mount to certain locations, crafting items out of given materials, or gathering certain things from nodes.</p>
<p id="g0TTwG">Note that the tribes from <em>A Realm Reborn</em> have some gimmicks that later tribes do not. The combat tribes may require you to complete specific FATEs in the area to finish them. For Ixali crafting quests specifically, you need to have the given set of Ehcatl Wristgloves equipped while you’re making their crafts.</p>
<p id="Tk5Ivz">Once you hit bloodsworn rank with all the tribes per expansion, you’ll unlocked the <strong>allied tribal quests</strong> for that expansion. (This is with the exception of <em>Shadowbringers</em> tribes, which have no allied quests.) These are just regular story side quests (not dailies) and there are exclusive rewards like emotes locked them.</p>
<hr id="qnOmah">
<h2 id="yBbbdR"><strong>Notable tribal quest rewards in FFXIV</strong></h2>
<p id="e2YSyK">Each tribe has some keystone rewards behind it. For nearly maxing out your reputation with the tribe, you’ll unlock the ability to buy <strong>orchestrions</strong>, <strong>minions</strong>, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/ffxiv-guides-ff14-final-fantasy-14/22382215/mount-unlock-chocobo-flying-level-requirement"><strong>mounts</strong></a>. Later tribes even have <strong>emotes </strong>and <strong>framer’s kits</strong> as part of the rewards. That said, if you’re a completionist who wants all of these types of collectables in the game, tribe quests are a must-do.</p>
<p id="CH0hhd">All the notable collectable-type rewards for each tribe are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li id="DDycsn">
<strong>Ixali: </strong>Wind-up Ixal minion, Direwolf mount, Wind-up Dezul Qualan minion</li>

<p id="Ss4xGG">Some tribes also have exclusive dye colors, furnishings, and glamour locked behind them, making all tribes pretty worthwhile to do. You can use some of the currencies to buy items you need to complete your <a href="https://www.polygon.com/ffxiv-guides-ff14-final-fantasy-14-online/24146448/heavensward-anima-relic-weapon-quest-steps-aetheric-density"><em>Heavensward</em> Anima relic weapon</a>, too.</p>
<p id="ZwxwBW">Sometimes some of the tribe-exclusive rewards are used as rewards in Mogtome events between patches. If you ran some of these enough times and cannot stand to do them, don’t fret, as you can wait for one of these events to let you grab a mount.</p>
<hr id="86e5Sd">

<p id="h7lqHf">Before unlocking any tribal quests, you’ll need to complete the <strong>level 41 main scenario quest “In Pursuit of the Past.”</strong> You’ll also need a combat, crafting, or gathering job of appropriate level, depending on which tribe you’re trying to unlock.</p>
<p id="if7N3r">As usual, the quests to unlock this content will be marked with a blue quest marker with a plus sign on it, so you should keep your eyes out for those.</p>

                <p>A sequel to Aerial Knight's Never Yield has been announced during IGN Live, appropriately titled We Never Yield. We Never Yield builds upon and continues the story of the game's previous entry alongside adding new features that were not present in the game's previous entry such as voice-acting and local multiplayer.</p><p>We Never Yield continues the story of Wally and Lone, twin brothers who were destined to receive their family treasure. This time around, Wally and Lone will be attempting to work together to resolve their issues from the previous entry. "You do not see a lot of Black characters resolving trauma with each other," developer Neil Jones said. With dual protagonists, players can still play solo, but the game becomes easier by playing with another person, where players can use two separate controllers or have half of a portion of the controller or buttons assigned to that individual.</p><p>Even though We Never Yield is a sequel, players do not need to play the previous entry to catch up on the story, since the initial 10 minutes will cover the plot of Never Yield alongside that game's ending. One of the most game-changing features this time around is the addition of The Power of Kings, which is a meter built up after bypassing a few obstacles that can be used to create a dash, but by waiting until the meter is completely filled--invulnerability is gained (with the summoning of a crown) to smash obstacles in your way for more challenging sections in the game.</p><p>Hub areas allow the twin brothers to take a breath, speak with one another, change outfits, and lore tablets allow deeper knowledge into the game's kingdom of its founding, creation, and worldbuilding.</p><p>We Never Yield releases on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ps4/" data-ref-id="5005-120">PS4</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ps5/" data-ref-id="5005-128">PS5</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/xbox-series-x/" data-ref-id="5005-129">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pc/" data-ref-id="5005-19">PC</a> this July.</p>

<p data-characters="287" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">It’s been roughly three weeks since <em>Helldivers 2</em> got its last major update, but the streak is getting ready to end. Arrowhead hopped on Discord to tease what’s coming with next week’s <em>Helldivers 2</em> update, which will include visible supply lines and more than 100 fixes.</p> <p data-characters="257" data-current-count="257" data-injectable="false">The info was delivered in typical Arrowhead fashion: As a meme. Community Manager Thomas “Twinbeard” Petersson was the one to drop the hint, saying “So about that patch, here’s a little something. It’s Friday after all.” </p> <figure data-wp-context="{ &quot;core&quot;: 				{ &quot;image&quot;: 					{   &quot;imageLoaded&quot;: false, 						&quot;initialized&quot;: false, 						&quot;lightboxEnabled&quot;: false, 						&quot;hideAnimationEnabled&quot;: false, 						&quot;preloadInitialized&quot;: false, 						&quot;lightboxAnimation&quot;: &quot;zoom&quot;, 						&quot;imageUploadedSrc&quot;: &quot;https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/helldivers-2-patch.jpg&quot;, 						&quot;imageCurrentSrc&quot;: &quot;&quot;, 						&quot;targetWidth&quot;: &quot;552&quot;, 						&quot;targetHeight&quot;: &quot;431&quot;, 						&quot;scaleAttr&quot;: &quot;&quot;, 						&quot;dialogLabel&quot;: &quot;Enlarged image&quot; 					} 				} 			}" data-wp-interactive="" data-current-count="557" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Arrowhead/<em>Helldivers 2</em> Discord</figcaption> <div data-wp-body="" data-wp-bind--role="selectors.core.image.roleAttribute" data-wp-bind--aria-label="selectors.core.image.dialogLabel" data-wp-class--initialized="context.core.image.initialized" data-wp-class--active="context.core.image.lightboxEnabled" data-wp-class--hideanimationenabled="context.core.image.hideAnimationEnabled" data-wp-bind--aria-modal="selectors.core.image.ariaModal" data-wp-effect="effects.core.image.initLightbox" data-wp-on--keydown="actions.core.image.handleKeydown" data-wp-on--touchstart="actions.core.image.handleTouchStart" data-wp-on--touchmove="actions.core.image.handleTouchMove" data-wp-on--touchend="actions.core.image.handleTouchEnd" data-wp-on--click="actions.core.image.hideLightbox" tabindex="-1"> <p> <figure><figcaption>Image via Arrowhead/<em>Helldivers 2</em> Discord</figcaption></figure> </p> <p> <figure><figcaption>Image via Arrowhead/<em>Helldivers 2</em> Discord</figcaption></figure> </p>  </div></figure>
 <p data-characters="192" data-current-count="192" data-injectable="false">Among the most requested features from the community is the ability to see supply lines on the galactic map. According to the post, those are finally coming with a way to view attack origins. </p> <h2 id="h-helldivers-2-s-next-patch-changes-up-patrol-spawns-and-more" data-injectable="false"><em>Helldivers 2</em>‘s next patch changes up patrol spawns and more</h2> <p data-characters="252" data-current-count="444" data-injectable="true">Arrowhead ended its weekly update streak last month, stating it wanted to <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-patches-may-slow-down-as-arrowhead-plans-to-take-its-time-with-the-next-one/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">slow things down</a> and take its time to get patches right. It’ll be the first since May 14. No, the June 1 hotfix that addressed the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2s-dark-matter-mission-is-getting-a-hotfix-to-address-all-the-bugs-and-the-bugs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dark Matter mission</a> doesn’t count. </p>
 <p data-characters="295" data-current-count="295" data-injectable="false">Based on the above meme, it looks like the update is pretty meaty. The developer has been addressing the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-theorists-dig-into-how-patrol-spawns-work/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">patrol spawn system</a> since April, but the tweaks implemented appeared to make things worse. Petersson later responded, saying the developer <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-devs-are-finally-reverting-frustrating-patrols-and-spawn-rates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">planned to dig into the issue </a>and fix spawn rates. </p> <p data-characters="242" data-current-count="537" data-injectable="true">The upcoming patch will include such a fix and much more. There will also be the inclusion of invite-only lobbies and Super Samples appearing in level 6 difficulty matches. Overall, Arrowhead is bringing more than 100 changes with the update.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Arrowhead</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="405" data-current-count="705" data-injectable="true">The patch will hopefully start to address the myriad issues that have followed the game for some months now. Players in the community have lobbied concerns regarding <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/arrowhead-ceo-admits-helldivers-2s-balancing-isnt-what-it-should-be/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game balance</a>, patrol spawns, and weapon nerfs. The creator of Arrowhead, Johan Pilestedt, also <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-ceo-steps-down-so-he-can-focus-more-on-actually-making-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stepped away from his role as CEO</a> to work more closely on the game’s development as the company’s new chief creative officer (CCO). </p>
 <p data-characters="222" data-current-count="222" data-injectable="false">It’s hard to say when the patch will arrive, but chances are good it’ll be early next week. Arrowhead was dropping updates every Tuesday or Wednesday, so it’s safe to say that it could be either of those.</p> <p data-characters="284" data-current-count="506" data-injectable="false">The patch sounds like it’ll be a good one. Players have been asking for visible supply lines since the day they learned <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-community-figures-out-the-invisible-supply-line-mechanics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the feature existed</a>. Personally, I’m excited for weapon balance changes. More to the point, I’m hoping they finally fix my Eruptor. I miss my boy.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/talisman-fifth-edition-announced-by-games-workshop.892944/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/talisman-fifth-edition-announced-by-games-workshop<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Games Workshop has announced a new edition of one of their games. However, it isn't one of their more popular war games like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-40000"><em>Warhammer 40,000</em></a> or <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-age-of-sigmar"><em>Warhammer Age of Sigmar</em></a>. It is <em>Talisman Fifth Edition</em>, a new refined version of the beloved fantasy board game.</p>
<h2>The Talisman Fifth Edition Announcement</h2>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/2024/06/07/talisman-returns-with-a-glorious-new-5th-edition-and-the-same-classic-gameplay/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Warhammer-Community post</a>, Games Workshop explains what <em>Talisman Fifth Edition</em> will contain. Originally titled <em>Talisman: The Magical Quest Board Game, </em>the board game was designed by Robert Harris and released in 1983. Over those 40+ years, it has received expansions and updates, its prior edition was released in 2007.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/talisman-fifth-edition-board-set-up.jpg?itok=FgdcRHZE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/talisman-fifth-edition-board-set-up.jpg?itok=RSLJrbNN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Time to go back and stake your claim.</figcaption></figure><p>Overall, the main game remains unchanged. Two to six players choose a character and embark on a quest to claim the Crown of Command and rule the land. You roll dice to traverse a large board, level up, get powerful loot, followers, and spells, and confront an encounter deck packed with enemies and allies. A single game can be finished in 60-90 minutes.</p>
<p><em>Talisman Fifth Edition</em> will feature new quality-of-life improvements to the game as well as brand-new artwork. As for what those improvements entail, the post is light on detail. However, it confirms that the Elder Dragon and Crown of Command work smoother. In addition, levelling up is a lot quicker.</p>
<p>The base game will be produced by Avalon Hill. It will contain 12 classic characters, 100 adventure cards, 24 spells, and special colored cones to demonstrate stat improvements</p>
<p>Games Workshop also highlighted the first major expansion for <em>Talisman Fifth Edition</em>. The expansion, <em>Talisman Alliances: Fate Beckons</em>, mixes up the core experience with co-op. Players will work together to overcome five Trials. These Trials will be introduced in Legacy format as five linked games.</p>
<p><em>Talisman Fifth Edition</em> is available for pre-order. It is currently being sold at an MSRP of $59.99 and will be available July 1. <em>Talisman Alliances: Fate Beckons</em> will be available later in the year.</p>
