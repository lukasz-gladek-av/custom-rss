                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dune-awakening/" data-ref-id="5000-570883">Dune: Awakening</a> has finally launched, and even after a lengthy development cycle and a variety of alphas and betas, the PC performance isn't where many players would like it to be. Even if you have a top-of-the-line machine with modern hardware that costs an arm and a leg, you're likely seeing FPS dips, stuttering, and crashes while playing on PC.</p><p>While there's not much you can do about the crashes aside from updating your drivers, you can mitigate the stutters and improve your overall FPS by adjusting specific graphics settings. To see what those settings are in Dune: Awakening, check out the guide below.</p><h2>Best PC settings for Dune: Awakening</h2><p>First and foremost, before you attempt to play Dune: Awakening on PC, you want to ensure that you at least meet the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1172710/Dune_Awakening/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">minimum requirements</a> outlined by the developers. If one or more of your PC parts don't meet those requirements, you're going to have an incredibly difficult time on Arrakis, if you can even get the game to boot at all.</p><p>If you've ensured your PC meets the requirements to play, launch the game and navigate to the settings menu. Here, choose the "Graphics" tab and then start going through all of the settings from top to bottom. You'll notice that the game has auto-detected the settings for you already based on the hardware configuration of your PC.</p><p>However, if you run those settings, you're going to wind up with a solid amount of stuttering and FPS dips as soon as you enter the world. To make sure that doesn't happen, take a look at our recommended settings below:</p><p><strong>Display Settings</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Field of View</strong>: 110</li><li><strong>Motion Blur</strong>: Off</li><li><strong>Vsync</strong>: Off</li><li><strong>Frame Rate Cap</strong>: Capped to your monitor's highest refresh rate</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4507680-duneawakeningscreenshot2025.06.05-18.41.40.27.png" data-ref-id="1300-4507680" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4507680-duneawakeningscreenshot2025.06.05-18.41.40.27.png" data-ref-id="1300-4507680"></a><figcaption>Dune: Awakening display settings</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4507680-duneawakeningscreenshot2025.06.05-18.41.40.27.png"></figure><p><strong>Graphics Settings</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Resolution</strong>: The desired resolution for your monitor (1920 x 1080 ensures the best performance)</li><li><strong>Window Mode</strong>: Fullscreen</li><li><strong>Upscaling Quality</strong>: Medium</li><li><strong>Upscaling Method</strong>: DLSS, if using an Nvidia GPU</li><li><strong>Frame Generation Method</strong>: Nvidia DLSS FG 2X, if using an Nvidia GPU (FSR if using AMD)</li><li><strong>Override Upscaling Preset</strong>: On</li><li><strong>Resolution Scale</strong>: 58</li><li><strong>Nvidia Reflex</strong>: Enabled + Boost</li><li><strong>DLSS Upscaling Quality</strong>: Performance</li><li><strong>Shadows</strong>: Low</li><li><strong>Virtual Shadow Maps</strong>: Off</li><li><strong>GI Quality</strong>: Medium</li><li><strong>Enable Lumen</strong>: Off</li><li><strong>Reflections</strong> <strong>Quality</strong>: Low</li><li><strong>Low End Laptop Mode</strong>: Off</li><li><strong>Limit Process CPU Usage</strong>: Off</li><li><strong>View Distance</strong>: High</li><li><strong>Post Processing</strong>: Low</li><li><strong>Effects Quality</strong>: Medium</li><li><strong>Texture Quality</strong>: Medium or High, depending on your hardware</li><li><strong>Foliage Quality</strong>: Medium or High, depending on your hardware</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4507681-duneawakeningscreenshot2025.06.05-18.41.30.51.png" data-ref-id="1300-4507681" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4507681-duneawakeningscreenshot2025.06.05-18.41.30.51.png" data-ref-id="1300-4507681"></a><figcaption>Dune: Awakening graphics settings</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4507681-duneawakeningscreenshot2025.06.05-18.41.30.51.png"></figure><p>Out of all of these settings, you'll want to make sure that you have enabled some sort of upscaling, as Dune: Awakening runs much better when you have DLSS or FSR turned on. Additionally, if you have a compatible GPU, you should also enable Frame Generation. While this does add a slight input delay, it's hardly noticeable in an MMORPG and more than makes up for that with dozens of extra frames.</p><p>You also want to make sure you're capping your FPS to your monitor's highest refresh rate. Capping your FPS allows your PC to run rampant with frames and can be a major factor in the stuttering you can experience. To go along with that, ensure Vysnc is turned off, as that will make your game run much smoother overall.</p><p>The rest of the settings are fairly basic. You want shadows to be as low as possible, any type of reflection doesn't need to be turned up too high, and textures can remain slightly higher than other settings if you want your game to look decent. Of course, if you don't care about graphics or you want to squeeze every bit of FPS out of your PC, then turn every setting to its lowest value and see how far that gets you.</p><h2>Other ways to improve FPS and remove stutters</h2><p>If you want to take things a step further when it comes to PC performance, there are additional settings you can change in Dune: Awakening. However, these settings are out of the game and are instead done through the Nvidia Control Panel. If you're an AMD user, you don't have access to most of these tools, but you can still check your GPU software for ways to improve performance.</p><p>As for all Nvidia users, open or download the Nvidia Control Panel program. From here, follow the steps below to make Dune: Awakening run as smoothly and efficiently as possible:</p><ul><li>In Nvidia Control Panel, go to "Manage 3D Settings"</li><li>Then, click "Program Settings" and hit "Add" at the top of the menu</li><li>A box will pop up, and from here, click "Browse." This brings up the File Explorer and you need to find the location of the .exe file for Dune: Awakening (look in the Steam folder on the drive folder you downloaded the game on)</li><li>Once you've found the .exe file, select it and add it to Nvidia Control Panel</li><li>You can now scroll down the program settings for the game and make a few changes:  <ul><li>Power Management Mode: Prefer maximum performance</li><li>Texture Filtering - Anisotropic sample optimization: Off</li><li>Texture Filtering - Quality: High performance</li></ul></li><li>Exit Nvidia Control Panel once those changes have been applied and relaunch Dune: Awakening</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4507626-dune.png" data-ref-id="1300-4507626" data-ratio="0.74132492113565" data-width="951" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4507626-dune.png" data-ref-id="1300-4507626"></a><figcaption>The Nvidia Control Panel settings for Dune: Awakening</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4507626-dune.png"></figure><p>Using the optimal settings and the Nvidia Control Panel adjustments, your game should be much smoother and feature far fewer stutters. However, the developers at Funcom will ultimately need to release some patches in Dune: Awakening that further fix the PC performance so you can go back to using higher settings without such a big performance hit.</p>

What if we could dream it together?</p><p><em>Reverie in the Moonlight</em> is an action game where, with the help of your stuffed animals, you try to defend yourself from the monsters attacking you night after night.</p><p><strong>Nightly Visits</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Little Tete’s nights are restless. His dreams are full of horrible monsters attacking him. But then, one night, he meets <a title="Platforms > Luna [61 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/cloud/luna">Luna</a>, and she teaches him how to use his plushies to defend himself.</p><p><strong>Cute But Strong</strong></p><p>When faced with a monster, Tete can only do one thing: run away. His plushies, however, can actually fight and defeat monsters. Different animals play different roles, with some focusing on short-range attacks, some on long-range shots, and some on supporting their allies. There are 40 types to choose from, so find your favorites and help them protect Tete from the monsters.</p><ul><li><strong>Ham Jr.</strong> – Runs left and right, hitting monsters that get too close with a stick.</li><li><strong>Snoozy-G</strong> – Enjoys sleeping, napping, and resting. Monsters that hit it are slowed down for a while.</li><li><strong>Striped Angel</strong> – When it sees someone in trouble, it always wants to help. It heals Tete up from a distance.</li></ul><p><strong>Collect and Strategize</strong></p><p>After the monsters’ attack is over, you can shop with the gold you found. You can get new plushies and even buy special items that can make you stronger. Some of them will also give you new weaknesses, so it’s up to you to strategize and prepare for the next attack in the best way possible. There are more than 100 items in the game… Will you be able to collect them all?</p><p><strong>Change Clothes to Change Strategies</strong></p><p>So, you’ve played the game’s story to the end. Well done. But this is just the start!</p><p>You can change Tete’s clothes, choosing from more than 20 costumes. Each one makes him stronger in some ways and weaker in others. If you want to help Tete defeat his nightmares, you’ll have to find the right plushies and items to go with each costume!</p><ul><li><strong>Moonlight Wizard</strong> – Plushies with long-range attacks become stronger, but Tete can only use those. Defending yourself becomes harder, so you’ll have to defeat monsters before they can get close.</li><li><strong>Nap Cloud</strong> – Increasing attack power becomes difficult, but plushies that don’t move around attack twice as fast. Try to find as many stationary friends as you can.</li><li><strong>Doggy Friend</strong> – Tete can only use dog plushies. If you want to win, you’ll need to make good use of their fast respawn speed.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.</p><h2><span>Official Trailer</span></h2><p><strong>English</strong></p><p><iframe title="Reverie in the Moonlight - Official Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QIxwEK7qZPQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><strong>Japanese</strong></p><p><iframe title="トロイメライの月あかり 公式トレイラー" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/P5xtptt7exo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><strong>Traditional Chinese</strong></p><p><iframe title="月下夢景（トロイメライの月あかり）官方預告片" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vFyKPrlpL-A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><strong>Simplified Chinese</strong></p><p><iframe loading="lazy" title="月下梦景（トロイメライの月あかり）官方预告片" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QJiVRSrpGDg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It’s a freebie that grants access to the 2012 title at no extra cost, but as many share their excitement online, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/49520/Borderlands_2/#app_reviews_hash" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Borderlands 2 Steam reviews</u></a> are telling a different story.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the All Reviews section boasts a “Very Positive” rating on Steam with more than 287,000 user reviews, the more than 3,300 Recent Reviews have the second Borderlands game’s reactions labeled “Mostly Negative.” The downward trend began around May 20, 2025, with a particularly large movement of negative responses filling its reviews section today.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/05/screenshot-2025-06-05-161818-1749167697352.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Borderlands 2 Steam User Reviews. Screenshot captured by IGN.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This spike in negative Borderlands 2 reviews comes not from a gameplay update or troubled servers but instead key changes Gearbox parent company Take-Two Interactive made to <a href="https://www.take2games.com/legal/en-US/#11-responsibility" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>its Terms of Service</u></a> in February of this year. Players are using their reviews to point to a few topics, including concerns the end-user license agreement (EULA) condemns the use of mods, cheats, and VPNs. However, the primary concern being echoed across social media channels relates to fears Take-Two, 2K Games, and Gearbox are harvesting data and private information.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“One of the best games ever made. I cannot recommend it to anyone right now due to the publisher adding spyware into an updated EULA that you have to accept to launch it,” one <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198083384906/recommended/49520/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>popular review from Steam user RyeTheTactician</u></a> says. “It's called forced arbitration and it's one of the scummiest things shady people want to normalize. I will not change it to a positive review until this is fixed, too bad, I had fun will all the Borderlands games in multiple devices, but will probably not play this or [Borderlands 4] for a long time.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198142247081/recommended/49520/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Another complaint</u></a> working its way to the top of the conversation involves the wider idea of a publisher altering the terms of service for a game that launched nearly 13 years ago. Some have gone as far as to ask for refund options if they wish to decline the updated document's conditions. Others are also highlighting Borderlands 2’s status as a relatively casual video game with a focus on single-player and co-op experience. The idea is that, without a substantial, competitive multiplayer component, there should be no reason for Take-Two to fear how cheaters may impact the experience of the average Borderlands player.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>People are review-bombing the Borderlands games because Gearbox/2K made EULA changes</p><p>Looks like people are review bombing the entire **Borderlands** series because Gearbox/2K made EULA changes that can apparently gain root-level access to your machine under the guise of… <a href="https://t.co/fZwAoSr9wo" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/fZwAoSr9wo</a></p></div>— Pirat_Nation 🔴 (@Pirat_Nation) <a href="https://twitter.com/Pirat_Nation/status/1924670214987206782?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 20, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Take-Two’s terms of service update can be found when booting up other 2K titles, including the original <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/729040/Borderlands_Game_of_the_Year_Enhanced/#app_reviews_hash" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Borderlands</u></a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/397540/Borderlands_3/#app_reviews_hash" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Borderlands 3</u></a>, which are currently on sale for $9.89 and $3.99, respectively, on Steam. Each title has received a different level of review bombing, with nearly all users pointing to the EULA as the cause behind their freshly added thumbs-down rating. There’s even <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/vcxzvxzcvxczadsadsqw/recommended/49520/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a specific list of grievances being copy-pasted</u></a> across the Steam reviews section for each game, which includes concerns that Take-Two is taking advantage of sensitive information such as names, email addresses, IP addresses, billing details, phone numbers, and more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Changing the ToS and turning games into spyware and then offering the game for free in order to then steal data from unknowing people is pretty bold,” <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/Critikal14/recommended/49520/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Steam user =SilvioHammer=</u></a> alleges.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Many have used their reviews to specifically call out Gearbox boss Randy Pitchford, who attempted to address privacy fears with a post on X/Twitter last week. When <a href="https://x.com/Gods_Full_Armor/status/1928344562403074220" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>one fan said</u></a> the EULA update had “essentially turned every Borderlands game into spyware with access to all of our information,” Pitchford <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1928521510618042521" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>assured</u></a> PC fans that there are no software-level changes to the Borderlands games that should have players worried about spyware.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Nothing has or will change about the software,” Pitchford said at the time. “I think the publisher legal team is covering their bases, but that has nothing to do with what we’re doing. I cannot change the EULA - that’s decided at the publisher level. But I can assure that there is no spyware in the software.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Yeah - humans are involved. It sucks to get brigaded when we’re over here making good games. Everyone should make their own decisions, though, so if running a protest because of fear over some lawyers covering their butts, I guess that’s the world we have to live in.</p>— Randy Pitchford (@DuvalMagic) <a href="https://twitter.com/DuvalMagic/status/1928608796206653672?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 31, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Pitchford's comments have been backed by other players who feel the reaction to the Take-Two's changes is a bit overblown. This includes clarification from some who say the EULA has gone largely unchanged for years, going as far as to say previous versions of the document already included several of the conditions players are voicing concern about now. It's unclear how the significant the February changes to the terms of service were, but overreaction or not, it's clear a vocal portion of the Borderlands community is no longer happy with what the agreement entails.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"People are overreacting for sure," one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/borderlands3/comments/1kpj0oj/comment/msy261f/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit comment says</a>. "The EULA is hardly any different than the one before it all the way back in 2018. People are just freaking out now because some clickbaiting content creator told them to."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s currently unclear if Take-Two will update its terms of service in any way that could alleviate privacy concerns or the criticism related to mod support. For those who pick up Borderlands 2, which is available to own for free until June 8 at 10 a.m. PT / 1 p.m. ET, the terms of service agreement in question pops up when you boot up the game for the first time. Those who decline it can continue to enjoy the experience but only while playing offline.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The updated terms of service will likely need to be accepted in order to play Gearbox’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/borderlands-4"><u>Borderlands 4</u></a> online as well. It’s set to launch September 12, 2025, for PC via the Epic Games Store, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X | S. A Nintendo Switch 2 version will launch at a later date.

The Nintendo Switch Lite Carry Case + Screen protector should have you covered. It adds minimal bulk by sticking close to the dimensions of the Switch Lite itself while providing 360-degree protection. There are also some fun designs to match different Switch games, like the Animal Crossing design we’ve linked, but unfortunately, Bells aren’t an accepted currency. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is one of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-nintendo-switch-case">best Nintendo Switch cases</a> you can buy, adding simple convenience and peace of mind. It zips and unzips easily to slide your Switch Lite in nice and snug or out when you’re ready to get your game on. Though compact, the case still offers additional storage for you to carry a collection of game cartridges. Finally, with this combo, you get a screen protector, so even when you throw it in your backpack without the case, you don’t need to worry about scratching the screen. Coming in around $25, this is an excellent investment in protection. </p></div><p id="best-rugged-case"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best rugged case">2.

It offers a sturdy shell with a nifty handle to protect your Switch Lite from drops and scratches and room to house all your favorite accessories. You even get a bunch of different color options to choose from. And best of all, this case is incredibly affordable, so you can snag it for under $20 and have money left over to score some <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-game-deals">great game deals</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unlike the Nintendo Switch Lite Carry Case, ButterFox provides plenty of space for storage and uses it cleverly. Two organizer layers offer slots for 19 game cartridges and two microSD cards, so you should rarely be without your favorite games. These layers double as a protective microfiber lining over the screen and a buffer to keep other accessories from pressing the Switch Lite's controls. A mesh pocket provides room to hold charging cables, earbuds, and even a modest <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-portable-power-banks"><u>portable charger</u></a>, while quality zippers ensure everything remains safely tucked away in the case.  </p></div><p id="best-cover"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best cover">3.

That makes it much more susceptible to damage out in the wild. The power of just a bit of plastic wrapped around the device could be the difference between making it or breaking it, literally. The Hori DuraFlexi Protector should hopefully prevent the latter from happening. It covers the Switch Lite around the sides and back in a flexible TPU that can absorb shock and protect the portable console, similar to a phone case. So, if you have butter fingers or just want to slide your Switch into a bag without hassling with a carrying case, this cover is for you. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Hori DuraFlexi Protector is classy, simple with Pokemon and Animal Crossing designs available. The cover also features perfectly placed cutouts to ensure you can easily access all of the Switch Lite's ports while the sleeve is on, so when you’re juicing up, you won’t have to remove the cover. The material used even gives you a bit of extra grip. And while the impressively low price tag may raise some red flags, it's worth noting that the DuraFlexi protector is officially licensed by Nintendo.</p></div><p id="best-rugged-cover"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best rugged cover">4.

You’ll be covered, literally, with the Orzly Grip Case. This cover is rubberized and ready to put your Nintendo Switch Lite in a protective embrace, covering all around to shield it from your flimsy grip. It’ll prevent bumps and scrapes while also giving your hands more grip. And though this is an excellent rugged case, it adds just 25 grams of weight to your Switch Lite, so you won't have to stop calling it Lite just because you've tucked it into this case. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">What you get from the Orzly Grip Case is far more than just protection for the console. Orzly added thicker handles to the sides, making up for the lack of ergonomics around the Switch Lite's controls. This kit also provides covers for the thumbsticks for more tactile control and less wear. There’s even some storage, so you won’t have to leave your favorite games behind, while a kickstand on the case allows you to enjoy content hands-free.

You're going to want a screen protector to prevent any damage. There are a ton of Switch Lite screen protectors popping up on the market, but amFilm's Tempered Glass Screen Protector is the tried and true most trusted. It’s also a super affordable way to keep your Switch safe, costing just under $10. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This particular Switch Lite screen protector is made of tempered glass, which won't scratch nearly as easily as the plastic screen, giving your handheld the glossy, premium glass screen it should have had from the get-go. You get more than just the screen protector, as the kit offers wet wipes, a microfiber cleaning cloth, and a squeeze card to ensure the smoothest installation possible without any dust bubbles or smudges. amFilm’s Tempered Glass Screen Protector also happens to be a three-pack, so you'll have enough screen protectors to use as replacements for years to come—or if you screw up installation on the first attempt. </p></div><p id="best-grip"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best grip">6.

You can upgrade your hold with the grip from Satisfye. This attachment slides right onto your Switch Lite, adding two palm fins to give your hands something to really grab onto, while the included thumb pads add extra protection and a tactile feel. The grip also helps give your thumbs a bit more room to move, especially when reaching for the D-Pad or right thumbstick, making your entire gaming experience much more enjoyable.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We loved the version of the grip from Satisfye for the full-size <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/03/13/satisfye-gaming-grip-for-nintendo-switch-review"><u>Nintendo Switch</u></a>, so it's nice to see a model for the smaller Switch Lite. The technology loaded into this grip ensures your device is held tightly in place without any damage to the chassis, and the Switch won’t overheat, as there’s ample airflow.

Plus, your hands can get in the way of what you’re playing, especially where precision is concerned.

Its triangular shape ensures the stylus doesn’t roll away from you, while the durable aluminum body means you’ll be good to toss it in your bag or wherever.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/ubisoft-sexual-harassment-lawsuit-france<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Three former Ubisoft executives are on trial in France this week, accused of creating a company culture at the video game studio that allowed systemic sexual harassment and sexism to thrive. The three men — Thomas François, former Ubisoft editorial vice president; Serge Hascoët, former creative director; and Guillaume Patrux, former game director — have been accused of sexual and moral harassment. François is also accused of attempted sexual assault. The trial began Monday and is expected to proceed into Friday before deliberations begin.</p><p>Neither Ubisoft itself, nor any current employees, are being prosecuted in this case, something several employees <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/en/pixels/article/2025/06/03/trial-of-ubisoft-executives-first-defendant-denies-responsibility-and-blames-company-culture_6741965_13.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">told Le Monde</a> was “disappoint[ing].”&nbsp;</p><p>Deliberations can last hours or days; there’s no real timeline for how long that could take. Though Ubisoft as a company is not directly involved, it’s certainly paying attention: Though it won’t have its usual Forward presentation as part of <a href="https://aftermath.site/summer-game-fest-2025-switch-2-launch-geoff-keighley" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Summer Game Fest</a>, the company is set to appear in IGN Live and the PC Gaming Show, a Ubisoft representative <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/stephentotilo.bsky.social/post/3lqqfmg47ok2z" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed to Game File</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>It certainly wouldn’t have been a good look for Ubisoft to have a presentation while the trial is going on. And beyond the allegations related to Ubisoft’s culture, the company is facing financial challenges; it announced an operating loss for the previous year <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/15/assassins-creed-maker-ubisoft-ubi-stock-plunges-on-dismal-outlook.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">at 15.1 million euros in May</a>. The company <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/637775/ubisoft-tencent-carveout-assassins-creed-far-cry-tom-clancy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced in March</a> that it’s spinning up a new subsidiary heavily backed by Tencent’s 1.16 billion euros investment; that subsidiary is responsible for three key Ubisoft franchises, Assassin’s Creed, Far Cry, and Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six.</p><p>As of Thursday, the trial is on its fourth day. All three men, whom <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/02/ubisoft-trial-france-accused-sexual-harassment-video-games-me-too" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Guardian</a> reports have denied all the charges, have been questioned throughout the week, the first of whom was François, according to Le Monde. <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/en/pixels/article/2025/06/03/trial-of-ubisoft-executives-first-defendant-denies-responsibility-and-blames-company-culture_6741965_13.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Le Monde reported that François</a> did not "acknowledge" “dozens of testimonies of sexist or sexual violence” except one, where it’s claimed he showed up to breakfast on a business trip with pornography displayed on his phone and told his colleagues that he “masturbated this morning.” Of that, François reportedly said, "I shouldn't have done that in front of a woman.” The rest of the allegations were addressed, according to Le Monde, with denials or explanations; for instance, in response to questions about "racist and homophobic remarks," he said he "has gay friends."</p><p>From <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/en/pixels/article/2025/06/03/trial-of-ubisoft-executives-first-defendant-denies-responsibility-and-blames-company-culture_6741965_13.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Le Monde</a>:</p><blockquote><div><p>"I just thought I was working at the best company in the world and doing the best job in the world. I didn't think about it," François, who's in his 50s, repeated to the judges trying to question him about his behavior. "Even after #MeToo?" the presiding judge asked. "Yes. I didn't make the connection between what was happening in my daily work life and what was being reported in the media," the defendant replied. He then added, "I regret it." He described having become part of a corporate culture that existed "everywhere, in every department," and "not having thought that it was abnormal."</p><p>"At my first evaluation, I was told 'It's cool, you bring a good atmosphere, thank you,'" he said. Later, he added: "I wish someone had stopped me, called me into HR, told me that what I was doing wasn't okay."</p></div><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>On Thursday, Clara Lainé, a French reporter live posting from the courthouse, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/clara-laine.bsky.social/post/3lqttbvady22i" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">described a busy day in the Bobigny courthouse</a> as the parties continued pleadings and prepared their final words. “I've been a lawyer for 25 years, I've seen some sordid files, but on this scale, never,” Maude Beckers, who is representing four victims and the Solidaires Informatique union, said in court Thursday, per a translation for Aftermath of <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/clara-laine.bsky.social/post/3lqtxd4z2as2i" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lainé’s</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/clara-laine.bsky.social/post/3lqtxdjwjp22i" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reporting</a>. “Even if their victims are broken, used, if certain [victims] can no longer set foot in the company without the threat of being subjected to the same treatment, I want to underline the strength that they have.”</p><p>Lainé reported that French prosecutor Antoine Haushlater asked the court for a three-year suspended prison sentence for François, in addition to a fine of €30,000. He requested an 18-month suspended prison sentence for Hascoët, and a maximum fine of €45,000. For Patrux, he asked for a 15-month suspended prison sentence and a €10,000 fine. Suspended prison sentences are typically deferred to probation, and a prison sentence is served only if probation is violated.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/sony-fight-stick-project-defiant-announced"><h3>I Need To Know If Sony’s Fight Stick Is Good Or Not</h3></a><p>Along with a new game from Arc System Works, Sony's announced their first fight stick code-named Project Defiant.

With the weekend finally in sight (we just need to make it through <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/summer-game-fest-2025-conference-schedule-all-dates-times-streams">this year's Summer Geoff Fest</a> first), it's all change on the Epic Games Store. A fresh set of freebies is now available to download and keep, and one of them is Arkane Studios' ultra stylish <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/deathloop">Deathloop</a>.
</p>
<p>
Epic's latest free games - which replace <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/herere-this-weeks-free-epic-games-store-games">last week's offerings of Tiny Tina's Wonderlands and Limbo</a> - can be claimed right now, and come in both PC and mobile flavours. You will, of course, need to be in the EU to access Epic's mobile store on iOS, but it's available worldwide via Android devices. But regardless of how you get there, here's what's free right now:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Deathloop (PC)</li>
<li>Ogu and the Secret Forest (mobile)</li>
</ul>
<figure>
<p>
<a aria-label="DEATHLOOP - Official Launch Trailer: Countdown to Freedom" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8phmhAoxeIs?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">

<p>
Deathloop, if you're unfamiliar, traps players on the 1960s-styled island of Blackreef, where they'll need to assassinate eight key targets before they can finally escape. The trouble is, the entire place is caught in a time loop, meaning everything needs to be done before the day resets. And worse, another assassin is on your trail. It's part exploratory immersive sim, part chaotic shooter and was good enough to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/deathloop-review">earn itself a Eurogamer Essential</a> back in the day.
</p>
<p>
As for Epic's other freebie this week, Ogu and the Secret Forest is a hand-drawn exploration adventure promising puzzles, mysteries, and more. "Befriend bouncy characters," explains the official blurb, "and defeat strange creatures to unravel the mystery of the charming world."
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/deathloop">Deathloop</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/ogu-and-the-secret-forest-ffc421">Ogu and the Secret Forest</a> are available to download and keep via the Epic Games Store now and will remain so until next Thursday, 12th June. After that, Two Point Studios' fantastic Theme Hospital spiritual successor <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/two-point-hospital">Two Point Hospital</a> will take their place.

He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Some people reported an unwelcome surprise after picking up their Nintendo Switch 2 preorders at GameStop: staples used to attach receipts to Switch 2 boxes ended up damaging the screens on the console, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-screen-punctures-ruin-launch-day-for-fans-due-to-store-receipts-stapled-into-consoles-box">as reported by <em>IGN</em></a>. However, GameStop says this was an issue that was “isolated” to a single store and that it has already offered replacements.</p><p>When you open the box for the Switch 2, the tablet / screen part of the device is just under the top flap of the packaging. The tablet’s proximity to the top of the box possibly explains how staples could get through and poke holes in the screen — especially if the person using the stapler gave it a solid push.</p><p>Reports started trickling in overnight as people got their preorders. In <a href="https://x.com/Oadhan/status/1930496875532018128">this post on X</a>, for example, you can see photos of two dots on the box, a bag, and the screen.</p><p>To <em>IGN</em>, a GameStop spokesperson said that it was “investigating the matter” and promised to “make customers whole.” And on Thursday, one Reddit user affected by the problem <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/1l43c3z/update_on_the_staple_issue/?share_id=Pqlu60ioQUZJOFKDEvyfD">said that</a> they spoke with a GameStop manager who said they would be able to exchange their damaged unit.</p><p>“We’ve addressed a unique case of staples damaging Switch 2 screens – isolated to one store,” GameStop says <a href="https://x.com/gamestop/status/1930688438342176780">in a post on X</a>. “Replacements have been offered.

He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Ahead of the Nintendo Switch 2’s launch, Nintendo said that the eShop would be improved and run more smoothly on the new console. Based on our initial testing at <em>The Verge</em>, it’s immediately apparent that the Switch 2’s eShop is much better.</p><p>On the original Switch, the eShop can be extremely sluggish. Even just moving from one section to another can have a lag, and clicking into a game sometimes takes a bit to load before you can even go through the process of buying it. The delays and slow navigation make using the shop a huge pain; I personally often defaulted to buying digital games on Nintendo’s website because it was a better experience.</p><p>On the Switch 2, the eShop is way faster. It’s all much more snappy, with <em>much</em> less lag browsing through sections and loading up game pages. Just take a look at this video comparing jumping into the eShop on both consoles, captured by my colleague Tristan Cooper – it’s dramatically faster on the Switch 2:</p><p>And how about if you want to search <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/664621/deltarune-nintendo-switch-2-launch-time">for <em>Deltarune</em></a>? Again, way quicker on the Switch 2.</p><p>“Thanks to the system’s performance capabilities, Nintendo eShop on Switch 2 has been improved and runs smoothly even when displaying a large number of games,” Switch 2 director Takuhiro Dohta said in an interview <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fwhatsnew%2Fask-the-developer-vol-16-nintendo-switch-2-part-4%2F%3Fsrsltid%3DAfmBOop9Dwm1pWdSyk-2keK5d7TMj9CiX6O81ImmGVhH2dA6V1F2MHhE" rel="sponsored">published in April</a>. “We believe the act of finding the game you want to play is itself part of the game system experience.”</p><p>Right now, the eShop feels like one part of the Switch 2 experience that’s a huge upgrade. Hopefully, that will end up making it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/671658/nintendo-switch-indie-games-eshop-legacy">a better place to find great games</a>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Back in 2023, Nintendo held one of those Direct thingies it likes to do, and as it often does the Japanese version of the stream had some games the western one didn't. In particular, there was one game that drew my attention: <a href="https://rockpapershotgun.com/games/stray-children">Stray Children</a>. It caught my eye in part because it has a really unique pixel art look to it, but also because Yoshiro Kimura was its director, one of the original designers of cult-classic <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/moon-remix-rpg-adventure">Moon: Remix RPG Adventure</a>. And now, after a bit of a wait, developer Onion Games have confirmed it's getting its English release later this year, and it'll even be doing so on PC.
</p>

<p>
If you haven't heard of Stray Children before, here's the lowdown of the oddball game: you play as a young, dog-like boy who gets whisked away to another world through a strange old console. In this new land, its inhabitants are all children, a wall set up around them keeping out The Olders, "monstrous adults, carrying the heavy load of their own inadequacies, self-doubt, and all of the grievances that grown-ups gather."

<p>
Much like Moon before it, it's not a typical <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> adventure. Battles take place in small arenas with enemies sending out occasionally bullet-hell like attacks for you to dodge. You can either fight these messed up adults literally, or figuratively with your words, all of this adding up to something definitely reminiscent of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/undertale">Undertale</a>, which is a bit ironic given how much of an influence Moon was on that game.
</p>
<p>
Stray Children actually released in Japan last year, but only on Nintendo Switch, and an English localisation was promised right from its announcement. The bad news is that there's still no exact date in place just yet. It'll arrive sometime in 2025, at least, and we're basically halfway through the year already. No, you're having a crisis about the passage of time, bog off, go and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3649490/Stray_Children/">wishlist Stray Children on Steam</a> or something.

            <p>
June is here, which means Amazon has refreshed its Prime Gaming offerings for another month, and - following a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/prime-gaming-members-get-22-more-games-in-may">bumper-packed May</a> - it's a comparatively quiet one this time around.

</p>
<p>
Then, as June trundles onwards and summer vaguely threatens to emerge, members can look forward to the likes of Thief: Deadly Shadows, the third game in the classic stealth series, and minimalist railway puzzler Station to Station. That's alongside the acclaimed Jupiter Hell, a grimy top-down turn-based sci-fi shooter, plus guns-and-sorcery cRPG Dark Envoy.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-switch-2%E2%80%99s-best-feature-might-be-that-the-eshop-doesn%E2%80%99t-suck.1208844/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/05/the-switch-2s-best-feature-might-be-that-the-eshop-doesnt-suck/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Yes, that’s a slightly silly title, but in amongst all of the updates, improvements and all-new features for the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a>, one of the key things I’m happy to see being put out to pasture is the original Switch’s eShop.</p>
<p>The fact is, the Switch eShop sucked. Certainly not because it gave us a window into Nintendo’s incredible library of games, or even because it found itself chock full of dollar-store tat, but because it barely worked, creaking and groaning and whinging and stopping and starting all the way from the moment you loaded it up to the moment you tried to give Nintendo your money. It didn’t even play you a little ditty to shop by! As far as user experiences go, it has to rank amongst the worst in modern gaming. And that includes installing things on the PlayStation 3 and the existence of Amazon Luna.</p>
<div id="attachment_460341"><p id="caption-attachment-460341">The new Nintendo Switch 2 eShop homepage</p>

</div>
<p>The Switch 2’s portal into the eShop starts well by doing the very bare minimum of loading itself up in a timely fashion and displaying all of its wares at the same time. My expectations shouldn’t have been quite so low, but we’re starting from a position below the floor, somewhere down in the substrate. With the dinosaur bones.</p>
<p>The first thing you’ll see is the curated Highlights. These are currently pretty much the entirety of the Switch 2’s launch line-up, with Mario Kart World beckoning us with glee next to the neon-soaked and thoroughly different Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition. As an aside, I love that these seem to be the top choices so far for Switch 2 – alongside Fast Fusion – because, well, it shows that we’re a weird bunch, doesn’t it?</p>

<div id="attachment_460342"><p id="caption-attachment-460342">Nintendo Switch 2 eShop “For You” game suggestions</p></div>
<p>Anyway, moving down with the D-pad results in the cursor going down. Yes! I know! It’s moving in time with my button presses and everything! And you can search, check out your Wish List, and see a series of suggested games that takes you to a very cool discovery tool branded as ‘For You’.</p>
<p>For You gives you a series of weekly recommendations – refreshed every Saturday – showing you a trailer, the price of the game, your friends that have played it, and what games that you own that are similar to it. It also matches the genre and publisher to other things in your library. It’s user friendly, clear, and it works perfectly smoothly.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I’ve just logged back into the Switch 1 eShop to double check they’ve not added it there, and I’m still stuck trying to scroll down through the menu. It turns out that, yes, it is exclusive to the Switch 2 store, which is probably a good thing, since the original eShop struggles to show one game, never-mind ten.</p>
<div id="attachment_460340"><p id="caption-attachment-460340">Trust us when we say this is scrolling really, really fast, and hasn’t had a hitch for a good 15-20 seconds before I got bored.</p></div>
<p>The most wonderful – or you could say, normal – part of the whole experience, is that I can scroll through page after page of Recent Releases, Coming Soon and Charts, and it just scrolls. It doesn’t reach the bottom and force you to wait while it works out where it put the games, reaches behind the sofa or under a rug, and pulls out the next page or so to pacify you while it thinks about it. It just works.</p>
<p>And once you’re done shopping? Well, you’ll find that the Switch 2 is capable of some positively modern-feeling download speeds. Where the original Switch could refuse to go above 40 or 50Mbps, it felt like, the Switch 2’s improved Wi-Fi chipset and faster storage means it can whizz along at up to 400Mbps, though it’s more commonly between 250-300Mbps. Nothing to turn your nose up at.</p>
<p>Thanks Nintendo.</p>

He says he fell in love with the voice that Suno would generate when he uploaded unfinished demos of his songs onto the platform. “It came to a point where I’m like, ‘Yo, this voice, it’s amazing.’”</p><p>There’s no word on when TaTa’s first single will be released, but the Stage Zero team plans to make her seem as real as possible. The AI artist will have a social media presence, and the company has already has released a photo of a young, pink-haired female artist meant to be TaTa. </p><p>AI is a divisive subject, especially in a music industry still figuring out how to regulate a technology that challenges copyright laws.

So you can imagine that the general reception to Timbaland siding with the machines has been less than favorable:</p><p>Mudaliar believes the public opposition to AI-generated music will subside eventually because “[AI is] not going anywhere,” comparing what he sees as the inevitability of its eventual acceptance to the way that influencers went from laughable to standard. Even though human creators will be involved in the process of creating music for TaTa and other AI artists, it’s hard not to look at this new endeavor as a way to minimize human involvement in music. Timbaland has a track record of making generation-defining music, but this move just sounds off. <br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Probably one of the most appealing parts of an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> is bonding with other characters, right? Building up your player character's relationships with various companions, like in games like the Persona series for example. What I wouldn't say is particularly common is you, the player, having a direct relationship with the character you're playing as. This is where <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockpapershotgun.com/games/downhill">Downhill</a> comes in, a fourth wall breaking action RPG whose main character knows you exist and controls them, all the while having to figure out a way to save the world.
</p>

<p>
"The idea of power and its abuse is what lies at the core of Downhill," Sisterhood Games, the developer of Downhill, explain in the game's <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sisterhoodgames/downhill-a-unique-4th-wall-breaking-arpg">Kickstarter page</a>. "Each time we start a new RPG game, we take full control of a character, but what if that character had a will of their own? Moreover, what if it oftentimes clashed with your vision for your playthrough?"

<p>
A fourth wall break in an indie RPG is nothing new, that's kind of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/undertale">Undertale</a>'s whole deal to a degree (a game cited as an inspiration, alongside how <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/oneshot">OneShot</a> communicates to the player directly). But what sells me on Downhill is the way in which you develop a relationship with its protagonist Fade. Do you want to help her in any way you can, or do you want to fight against her? You can talk to her at any point throughout the game, various dialogue options affecting how she thinks of you.
</p>
<p>
That might mean doing something simple as asking how she is, or forcing her to fight an enemy. I wouldn't say subtlety is the name of the game here, it's clearly going to be a game where you question your role in the way games play out. I just really like the presentation of it all. There's a really unique dark fantasy aesthetic to it with some good, creepy-looking creatures to fight, and the twist on RPG dialogue options being that you're conversing with your own character is a fun one.
</p>
<p>
You can revive Fade as many times as you want too without having to load your save data, but that comes with the cost of it causing her mental distress. Obviously you can't tell everything from a game without playing it, but it certainly sounds like there's a thoughtfulness as to how commonplace mechanics can affect the characters you play as. Good stuff!
</p>
<p>
As mentioned, the game is currently looking for funds on Kickstarter, so you can chuck a few quid your way if it takes your fancy. It's also available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3433000/DOWNHILL/">wishlist on Steam</a>, and there's a short demo for you to check out too if you're not convinced enough to support the fundraiser just yet.

I played about two hours of the game, and it’s got a lot of the staples of the RPG social sim fans know and love. It even adds a few new bells and whistles to the series’ turn-based combat, lending new dimensions to a typically straightforward system. However, mapping everything this series has to offer onto live-service structures and gacha rolls doesn’t inspire a lot of confidence in what may be one of the last <em>Persona 5 </em>spin-offs before we finally reach <em>Persona 6</em>.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196055" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="227" data-playlist="196055,196411,196013" data-current="196055"><div><p>6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21584.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>It’s a shame I’m so hesitant, because the premise of <em>The Phantom X </em>is really compelling to me. This game takes place in a separate timeline in which a different group of high schoolers took up the Phantom Thieves mantle. Instead of playing as Joker, you play as Wonder, a completely different guy who goes to another school and has different friends, but still has Joker’s ability to summon multiple entities called Persona to fight off Shadows in a paranormal world called the Metaverse. Like most <em>Persona </em>heroes, his life is split between fighting monsters in one world and living a normal teenage existence in the other, but the difference this time around is that <em>The Phantom X </em>breaks the traditional RPG grind for a much more elaborate gacha one.</p><p>You build out your party by unlocking characters with gacha rolls. The game’s calendar system is regimented by an energy mechanic, so you can’t just have a breezy marathon running through several in-game days at a time like you could in other <em>Persona </em>games. Stats and abilities are now gated by RNG rather than acquired by simply getting more powerful. You know, the normal free-to-play dressings that keep you booting the game up every day or so.</p><p>I can’t speak to the probabilities for different pulls based on my two hours with the game, but folks who’ve been playing it in the East have said that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/PERSoNA/comments/1fkeeue/after_200_hours_of_playing_persona_5_x_the/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PERSoNA/comments/1fkeeue/after_200_hours_of_playing_persona_5_x_the/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">it’s pretty generous</a></span> compared to other gacha games and lets you unlock characters and summonable Personas with relative ease. But even if <em>The Phantom X </em>is less predatory than your average slot machine, I think I’m just kinda bummed that an interesting premise is being overcomplicated by all these chance-based systems. I’ve played every <em>Persona </em>game and can navigate all their complexities pretty easily, but opening a menu in <em>The Phantom X </em>and seeing how all the systems, from the social elements that have long been the draw to the simple act of customizing your party, have been made more complicated so the game can get its hooks into your daily routine and wallet takes the wind out of my sails.</p><p>I love <em>Persona 5</em>. Yeah, we have probably <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/persona-5-the-phantom-x-is-a-solid-rpg-but-even-adding-gacha-cant-hide-the-fact-that-persona-5s-been-stretched-awfully-thin-over-the-last-9-years/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/persona-5-the-phantom-x-is-a-solid-rpg-but-even-adding-gacha-cant-hide-the-fact-that-persona-5s-been-stretched-awfully-thin-over-the-last-9-years/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reached the subseries’ oversaturation point</a></span>, but I still am waiting for whatever the final spin-off will be that will gloriously send the Phantom Thieves off into the sunset. Every game Atlus put out after the 2016 original has felt like a low-stakes “monster of the week” romp that mostly existed to give the old crew a reason to hang out for a bit. <em>The Phantom X</em>, meanwhile, is the first time one of the <em>Persona 5</em> spin-offs has done something of substance. By sidelining the characters Atlus hasn’t done anything meaningful with since the enhanced edition, <em>Persona 5 Royal</em>,<em> </em>launched in 2019, <em>The Phantom X </em>has the potential to explore something truly different in this world for the first time in years. I haven’t had much time with Wonder’s version of the Phantom Thieves, but I’m interested to get to know new Persona users, even if they’re borrowing a previous crew’s aesthetic. But it’s hard to look forward to those possibilities when they’re all gated behind mechanics designed to tempt me to drop some cash.</p><p>I want to give <em>The Phantom X </em>its fair shake when it comes to mobile and PC on June 26, but I can’t lie, I’m skeptical. I hope I’m proven wrong.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

</span></figcaption></figure></div><div><p>I love fighting games, but I am by no means competitive. I am, however, a gear person. I have three different leverless controllers, two of which I made, and am currently <a href="https://aftermath.site/oh-no-i-bought-a-candy-cab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">restoring an arcade cabinet</a>. As a result I know a severe amount about fight stick hardware: <a href="https://paradisearcadeshop.com/collections/sanwa-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sanwa buttons</a>, <a href="https://www.brookaccessory.com/Fighting_Board/list.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Brook boards</a>, and how to wire a stick. And so I desperately need to know if Sony’s fight stick, code-named “Project Defiant,” is any good or not.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Project Defiant Wireless Fight Stick - Teaser Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oCeba1xfKxg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Though I have been critical of Sony’s hardware in the past, I always know its intended market. If you have a Steam Deck already, <a href="https://aftermath.site/chiaki-chiaki4deck-moonlight-playstation-portal-sunshine-streaming" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">you do not really need a Portal</a>. The DualSense Edge, while fine, I found to be overpriced, and I opted to just <a href="https://aftermath.site/i-modded-my-ps5-controller-and-you-can-too" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">take mine apart and do aftermarket mods</a>. Both of these products make sense if you just wanna go to Best Buy and buy something instead of dicking around with wires. And in Sony’s defense, they have been absolutely killing it in the headphone space.&nbsp;</p><p>Project Defiant was announced alongside <em>MARVEL Tōkon: Fighting Souls</em>, the new Marvel-themed 4v4 tag battle game from Arc System Works. While I would normally be wary of anything Marvel related at this point, the success of <em>Marvel Rivals </em>makes this much more promising, as does Arcsys’ track record with <em>Dragon Ball FighterZ</em>. It’s such a good get on Sony’s part that I like to imagine that someone at Capcom is getting yelled at right now.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fbfrV5qqnU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MARVEL Tōkon: Fighting Souls | Announce Trailer</a></p><p>Project Defiant seems similar to many of Sony’s hardware outings from the little we know about it. It claims to use the proprietary PlayStation Link format for low wireless latency. The <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/06/04/introducing-project-defiant-the-first-wireless-fight-stick-designed-by-sony-interactive-entertainment-for-ps5-and-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">product page</a> says it has toolless swappable gates on the stick, meaning you can have your stick movement as either circular, square or octagonal (hey, that’s pretty good!). It also claims to use mechanical switches, although Sony does not specify what kind. Given that this is a low profile stick, I have theories. There’s also a little touch pad on top, which is expected from any Sony controller. Buttons on the render appear to be that shiny translucent plastic on the DualSense, and just by eyeballing it the button layout appears to be something close to “<a href="https://www.slagcoin.com/joystick/layout.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sega 2P</a>.” If that’s the direction they’re going in I gotta give them credit, because it’s an interesting layout, better for your pinky, and also just generally a classy choice.</p><figure><figcaption>I can't tell the dimensions without measuring it but Sega 2P is a similar layout, although the spacing on the stick seems wider. Credit: <a href="https://www.slagcoin.com/joystick/layout.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Slagcoin</a></figcaption></figure><p>Aesthetically, Project Defiant follows the PlayStation 5 visual language, <a href="https://aftermath.site/ps5-pro-700-dollars-looks-bad" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which I still dislike</a>. Part of this is because I have such an undying love of Sony’s industrial design from the mid 80s all the way to the PS2 era. Sony’s house style used to be something special, clean with straight lines and very utilitarian. Sony devices often implied that you were holding something from the future. Even much of their consumer-facing stuff felt like it was treating you like a professional. This changed radically with PS3, got slightly better during the PS4 era, and then somehow reached its nadir during the current era. Though Project Defiant has the same swooping white accents of the PS5, it looks like they’re doing an OK job of making it more respectable than the console, but it’s hard for me to tell until it’s in my hands.</p><figure><figcaption>Credit: Sony Interactive Entertainment</figcaption></figure><p>One red flag: the white plastic. I have white controllers and it <em>never </em>ends well. White plastic controllers inevitably get grimy and yellow, showing wear more aggressively. This goes doubly so for fight sticks, and I can just see a sweat and wear pattern developing where the heel of the right hand lands. I will concede that it’s possible that the stock plastic in that part is just particularly wear and dirt resistant. I could also see a world where, like the PS5, the controller has swappable custom shells for that part. That would be a smart move, as half the fun of fight sticks is tricking them out with something garish.</p><figure><figcaption>Credit: Mark Julio/@markman23</figcaption></figure><p>A sign that Project Defiant is in good hands is that <a href="https://liquipedia.net/fighters/MarkMan" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mark Julio</a> announced on X <a href="https://x.com/MarkMan23/status/1930378135247446097" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that he’s involved with it</a>. Markman is someone who knows ball and has <a href="https://markman23.com/about/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">consulted on a bunch of sticks in the past</a>. Generally speaking it’s a good sign that they’re bringing in people that know what they’re doing.</p><p>Project Defiant comes out in 2026. I have no idea if it actually exists outside of a render at this point. No price point was announced, which will make or break the success of the device. Though I’m often skeptical, there's a lot about this I like: a wireless, mass market, low profile fight stick with a really good button layout sounds incredibly promising. But this is also a community Sony has to try harder with if it wants to be accepted.&nbsp;</p><p>People who play fighting games take pride in their sticks. Unlike regular controllers, which are traditionally harder to make from scratch, the culture of hand crafting or customizing fight sticks is tied up with the fighting game community itself. Everyone has preferences. Do you want Sanwas, Seimitsus, Qanbas, or Samducksas? How about a freak switch that uses moddable keyboard switches inside of it (I am currently <a href="https://github.com/OpenStickCommunity/Hardware/blob/main/3D%20Prints/OSBLP%20v2/Community%20submissions/OSBLP%20v2%20-%20SiTong%20Edition/README.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trying to make some of these from scratch</a>)? What potentially embarrassing art do you want on it? What layout do you want?&nbsp;</p><p>There’s an entire world of niche vendors like <a href="https://arcadeshock.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arcade Shock,</a> <a href="https://paradisearcadeshop.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Paradise Arcade Shop</a>, and <a href="https://focusattack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Focus Attack</a>. There’s people selling smaller parts like <a href="https://sgfdevices.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SGF!</a> and countless Etsy sellers making boutique works of art. There’s an entire project and community just devoted to open source controller firmware, <a href="https://gp2040-ce.info/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GP-2040CE</a>. It is a deeply competitive market, one with existing standards that encourage tinkering, tweaking and repairability. These devices are serious investments. And while Sony is a giant company that doesn’t live by that support, it substantially invested in it by jointly acquiring <a href="https://sonyinteractive.com/en/press-releases/2021/sony-interactive-entertainment-and-new-esports-venture-rts-jointly-acquire-the-evolution-championship-series-evo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Evo</a> in 2021. This is a community with lofty standards, and it would be an impressive feat indeed to make something worthy of the very tournament they own.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-yasumi-matsuno"><h3>Tell ‘Em</h3></a><p>'The will to resist is in your hands'</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/neightreign-is-good-but-lumpy-counter-intuitive-and-experimental"><h3>Nightreign is Uneven And Counter-Intuitive.

If you're looking to pick up any of these Switch games for the first time, we've put together a list of where to buy all of them.</p><hr><p>Many of the updated games now play in higher resolutions on Switch 2, and some also offer improved frame rates and HDR support. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-deals-on-pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-ahead-of-free-switch-2-performance-update/1100-6532029/" data-ref-id="1100-6532029">Pokemon Scarlet and Violet, for instance, genuinely looks like a different game</a> at 1080p and 60fps. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Super-Mario-Bros-TM-Wonder-Nintendo-Version/dp/B0C8VHZR14?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Super Mario Bros.

It's worth noting that Walmart and Amazon often have numerous store pages for each game, including imports from Europe and other regions. The Switch and Switch 2 are region-free consoles, so you can play physical copies released in other markets. We've made note of the imported editions below.</p><p>While we've only included the Switch games with <em>free </em>upgrades, don't forget that The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom have received proper "Nintendo Switch 2 Editions" with $10 upgrade fees.

That’s what one YouTuber tried to find out, wasting absolutely no time before putting a stomach-churning beatdown on Nintendo’s new hardware.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197565" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="122" data-playlist="197565,197567,196230" data-current="197565"><div><p>Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23089.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/@TechRax/videos&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/@TechRax/videos" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TechRax’s YouTube channel</a></span> is best known for smashing all sorts of high-end consumer electronics, usually iPhones and Apple Watches. Sometimes he throws golf balls at Tesla Cybertrucks. When he’s really feeling bored he pours laundry detergent into a car’s fuel tank just to feel something. Today, on June 5, as regular tech fans celebrate the launch of the Switch 2, TechRax decided to put the $450 console that fans spent hours standing in line for through a “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p33K1uuOk-A&amp;t=124s&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p33K1uuOk-A&amp;t=124s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">durability test</a></span>.” The results were hard to watch and minimally illuminating. </p><p>What kind of a beating can the Switch 2 survive? That was the question TechRax answered in his latest video. First he dropped it on the floor. No damage. So far so good! Then he pulled out a razor blade and scored the middle of the screen. “That was a big scratch line and that’s not coming off, so guys this is not like an iPhone 16 Pro or something. If you do something like that, that’s it, you are toast,” he said before cutting it a second time just to be sure. <br></p><p>Next, rather than pressing the buttons on the Joy-Con to release them from their magnetic grip slots on the sides of the Switch 2, he bent them until they snapped off. He did it multiple times and much to my surprise, despite the heart-stopping snapping sound, neither part of the connector appeared to be damaged. Good news for everyone whose kids are going to bend and flex the new Joy-Con a dozen times a week. </p><p>Finally, after successfully bending the metal hinge kickstand, TechRax concluded his survey with the hammer test. What is the hammer test? Exactly what it sounds like. First he drops a metal hammer onto the screen. Then he does it a second time from higher up. Eventually he just starts whacking it until the screen cracks. The Switch 2's new LCD screen stood its ground until hammer blow number 10. Not bad. Not bad at all. But if you see TechRax coming into your store, please don’t sell him any more Switch 2s. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
