<p>The ver. 1.1 update, 'The Threads of Fate', will launch at some point in "<strong>Early 2026</strong>" (the studios haven't been more precise than that at the moment), and will bring a healthy dose of new content alongside the usual tweaks and bug fixes.</p>
<p>First up is a batch of new 'Mystic Ordeal' challenges, which will let you add challenging quirks to your runs to put your skills to the test — you'll even be able to set your own rules and share them with others via a code. Select stages of your journey across Talamh will also become corrupted, with stronger enemies therein granting bigger rewards. Don't worry if you're finding the base game challenging enough; both of these will be completely optional.</p><div><figure data-videoid="NHONnA_kS_M" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NHONnA_kS_M?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytNHONnA_kS_M" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NHONnA_kS_M?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NHONnA_kS_M?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed64cc89qrtznp&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>The devs are also introducing newly evolved mounts that pack more of a punch, and a batch of fresh in-game skins and emotes, so you can get your party looking as sharp as they deserve.</p>

<p>The devs shared a full rundown of the upcoming changes in a blog post on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1904480/view/519732795817328673">Steam</a>, concluding by thanking everyone who has played so far: "We wanted to take a moment, once again, to thank you for joining our rebellion, and lending your skills, passion and personality to our resistance movement."</p>
<p>We had a great time with Absolum on Switch earlier this year, calling it "one of the best of its kind, whatever that kind may be" in our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/absolum">9/10 review</a>. Let's hope we don't have to wait too long in 2026 to see its updates come our way.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/18/samsons-main-story-will-last-around-10-hours-console-versions-confirmed/</link>
            <guid>1387288</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>A couple of weeks ago <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/05/samson-is-a-new-action-game-by-former-just-cause-devs-new-studio/">Samson</a> was revealed by Christofer Sundberg’s Liquid Swords studio, showing a gritty open world game set in the city of Tyndalston. The main story sees Samson in a mountain of debt so he needs to take on all sorts of jobs to try and clear it, or suffer the consequences. Now, a new FAQ about Samson has gone live, with the key points being the story is about 10 hours but exploring everything can take around 25 hours, and the game will be coming to consoles but after the PC launch.</p>
<p><iframe title="SAMSON | Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OQ4z_yQE5Xo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3634520/view/524236943144256435">Samson FAQ</a> has also confirmed that the game is expected in early 2026 and will be priced at $24.99. There is no multiplayer and no microtransactions, with Samson being a single player title. There will be localisation, with different languages steadily being rolled out, but this will only apply to text as voice acting will not be localised. For the gameplay, players will be able to unlock new perks but won’t have a standard weapon loadout. Instead items in the environment can be picked and used for fights, while vehicle combat will also be heavy and a core part of the game. There has been some influence from Just Cause, the series Christofer Sundberg is credited with creating, but not in the chaotic and silly sense. It will be much more grounded with outcomes that could be unpredictable. You can drive any car in the game, but you won’t be able to drag civilians out of their vehicles. Instead stealing cars that are parked seems to be the way to get a new ride, though this will draw attention. Each vehicle will have its own handling style, which then leans into each one being useful for different playstyles.</p>
<p>According to the FAQ the city will respond to Samson’s actions too. It says,<em> “Law enforcement escalates based on your actions. Civilians react to what you do and how you behave.&nbsp; For example you need to watch out if you steal a parked car, if the police are nearby, they will spot and pursue you. They’ll escalate their efforts as you try to shake them off, making for an intense experience, testing all of your skills and knowledge about the city to escape. The city responds. It does not just sit there.”&nbsp;</em>It goes on to say this about police chases. <em>“Law enforcement is something to respect. Chases escalate, pressure builds, and mistakes matter. The goal is tension, not spectacle for its own sake.”</em></p>

<p>The PC minimum specs have also been confimed for Samson and they are:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>OS:</b>&nbsp;Windows 11<wbr></li>
<li><b>Processor:</b>&nbsp;6 cores<wbr></li>
<li><b>Memory:</b>&nbsp;16 GB RAM<wbr></li>
<li><b>Graphics:</b>&nbsp;NVIDIA RTX 20-series or AMD 60-series card<wbr></li>
<li><b>Storage:</b>&nbsp;15 GB free space</li>
</ul>

            <title><![CDATA[Yakuza Kiwami 2, Splitgate: Arena Reloaded, and ARK: Lost Colony Get DLSS 4 Support, New GeForce Driver Released]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-support-yakuza-kiwami-2-splitgate-arena-reloaded-ark-lost-colony/</link>
            <guid>1387285</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/aion2-splitgate-arena-reloaded-dlss-4-multi-frame-gen/">Another five games have received support</a> for NVIDIA DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation this week, including Yakuza Kiwami 2, Splitgate: Arena Reloaded, and ARK: Lost Colony. Meanwhile, <a href="https://wccftech.com/techland-dying-light-the-beast-update-1-5-nightmare-experience/">Dying Light: The Beast</a> adds support for ray-tracing, Lost Ark added support for DLSS Super Resolution, and NVIDIA put out a new GeForce Ready game driver to support it all.</p>



<p>Splitgate: Arena Reloaded is <a href="https://wccftech.com/splitgate-2-relaunch-late-december-1047-games/">the return of Splitgate 2</a>, and the first Splitgate, as developer 1047 Games has opted to try and mash together the best of both games into one offering for players. It arrived as a free-to-play game on PC and consoles everywhere as of yesterday, December 17, and has support for NVIDIA DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation to ensure that you can get the most out of your hardware. It's also the exact kind of game you'd want to play at the highest frame rate possible, as a competitive first-person shooter.</p>



<p>If you are playing it, that is. Splitgate 2's launch went very poorly, and, while SteamDB numbers are never the full picture, at least on PC, the release of Splitgate: Arena Reloaded <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2918300/charts/#3m">doesn't seem to have turned things around</a> when looking at the concurrent player numbers.</p>



<p>For Yakuza Kiwami 2, a recent update to the game added DLSS Super Resolution and DLSS Frame Generation, and now, if you load it up alongside the NVIDIA app, you can boost your experience further with DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation with the app's DLSS overrides.</p>



<p>MMORPG Ashes of Creation, which recently launched as a new early access title on PC, also did so with DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation support. Also, speaking of SteamDB numbers, it's one of the <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/4124950/charts/">trending games on the platform at the time of this writing</a>. </p>



<p>ARK: Lost Colony and AION2 are the final two games to round out the five that are getting support for DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation, with AION2 getting support on December 24, 2025, as part of a new update, and ARK: Lost Colony featuring support for DLSS 4 today as part of a new update.</p>



<p>Lastly, today's new GeForce Game Ready driver will ensure that you're able to jump into all of these games without issue, as it fixes a colour issue from the previous driver and several other bug fixes.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/should-you-give-up-on-half-life-3-no-not-while-work-continues-on-hlx/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>A few weeks ago, the hopes of the Half-Life community were sparked by rumors suggesting that Half-Life 3 is not only in <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-playtested-summer-reveal/">active development</a></strong>, but also <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-hlx-optimization/">in the polishing and optimization phase</a></strong>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-hopes-reignited-insiders-suggest-its-announcement-is-still-coming/"><strong>close to an announcement.</strong></a> Now that we are so close to the holidays, however, it's unlikely that even a company like Valve that operates on its own set of rules will announce the project before the end of the year, as previously rumored.</p>



<p>The now-legendary game not being announced in 2025 has shattered the hopes of many, who no longer believe a new entry in the series will be released in the near future. However, the lack of an official announcement shouldn't make you lose hope, as the project rumored to be the third entry in the Valve series hasn't been abandoned. On the contrary, it has received a new update which is sure to spark new hope in fans.</p>



<p>As reported by <a href="https://x.com/Tyler_McV"><strong>Tyler McVicker</strong></a>, who has provided an in-depth look at the latest updates made to the HLX project found in the Source 2 engine in the past, the <a href="https://github.com/SteamDatabase/GameTracking-Dota2/commit/5688664efb6b3a0e6a52abec53f8d0d7990d1f71"><strong>Dota 2 December 16 2025 update</strong></a> introduced new strings of code directly related to the project rumored to be Half-Life 3.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Based on how the Half-Life community lately, should I even make a video detailing the dump of new information found in the latest DOTA 2 update? </p><p>I don't know...</p><p>I guess this game doesn't exist.... Oh well.... <a href="https://t.co/nFcNYv9ynt">pic.twitter.com/nFcNYv9ynt</a></p></div>— Tyler "Hype Merchant" McVicker (@Tyler_McV) <a href="https://twitter.com/Tyler_McV/status/2001331835373265408?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 17, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>While an in-depth explanation of what these new additions mean for the HLX project has yet to be provided, the community verified that these updates are real and confirmed on <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVINqBTwM=/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">this comprehensive community-managed Miro board</strong></a> that they are related to the Animgraph 2 system, a new animation resolve system designed to replace the previous system, which caused large bandwidth consumption in multiplayer games. For those not interested in game development, these additions are still important to know about, as it is undeniable proof that the development of HLX is proceeding.</p>



<p>What these updates don't suggest, on the other hand, is when the HLX project will be officially revealed. According to rumors, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-is-a-steam-machine-launch-game-valve-is-targeting-spring-2026/">Half-Life 3 will be a Steam Machine launch game targeting a Spring 2026 release</a></strong>, so if these plans haven't changed, it shouldn't be long until we will finally learn if and how the iconic series by Valve will continue following the VR game <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-alyx-unveiled-next-month/"><strong>Half-Life: Alyx.</strong></a></p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Santa Ragione have announced that they’ve repaid all the money they borrowed to develop their Surrealist horror game Horses, despite being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/saturnalia-creators-santa-ragione-will-wind-down-operations-after-valve-ban-horror-game-horses-from-steam">denied release on Steam</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/epic-ban-santa-ragiones-horses-just-before-release-with-a-weird-reminder-that-adult-only-nft-games-are-fine-though">the Epic Games Store</a>. It’s a better outcome than expected, given Steam’s centrality to PC gaming, and a strong demonstration of support for art that is prepared to disregard taboos and investigate something profoundly ugly. It’s also, however, not enough to keep Santa Ragione operational. </p>
<p>As warned when they broke their silence about the Steam ban last month, the developers are suspending operations and looking for other work. It’s possible they’ll get the band back together down the road, but this “will not be easy”.</p><!--more-->
<p>According to Santa Ragione, Horses has sold 18,000 copies across all platforms since launch on GOG, Humble and Itch, generating around $65,000 in net revenue. Back in November, the developers told us that they had borrowed roughly $50,000 from friends to complete development, following the Steam ban, with the overall budget running to $100,000.</p>
<p>“After paying the royalties owed to Andrea Lucco Borlera, the author and creator of HORSES, these proceeds will be sufficient to repay the loans we took to finish development,” reads a press release, sent to RPS last night. “We are extremely grateful to players and to everyone who supported the release by sharing the game and amplifying what happened around it. Paying our debts is a success, and we are relieved.</p><p>“At the same time, this result is not enough to begin production on a new game,” it continues. “The money primarily covers obligations created by a prolonged end of development. If sales remain steady, we may be able to fund a new prototype in the future, but the team has had to, and will continue to, take other jobs and projects in the meantime. Reuniting everyone will not be easy, even if it is something we would love.”</p>
<p>Steam rejected a work-in-progress version of Horses in June 2023. The platform holder’s reasons for doing so remain unclear, but according to a Valve statement circulated by Santa Ragione themselves, the platform holder’s reviewers were concerned about depictions of "sexual conduct involving a minor". The developers subsequently altered the game to make all the characters visibly over 20 years old. They have also argued that while Horses does contain portrayals of sexual abuse of many kinds, it does not seek to arouse or glorify.</p>
<p>I’ve <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/horses-review">reviewed Horses</a>, and while I haven’t played and therefore can’t speak for the WIP build from June 2023, this absolutely isn’t a work of child pornography. It’s a story of sexual oppression and brutalisation, which considers censorship as a form of sadism. The violence it depicts is portrayed as being technologically mediated via both an in-game projector and various self-referential pieces of design. It very clearly isn’t intended to be received as ‘unfiltered’ representation and endorsement. To claim otherwise is to misunderstand the game or, worse, twist it out of context.</p>
<p>In this week’s statement about sales, Santa Ragione write that the Steam ban precipiated “a prolonged scramble for funding, with debt, opportunity cost, and team members taking other work”. In other words, the studio had already begun to fragment long before Santa Ragione went public about Valve’s decision.</p><p>The developers also note that while Horses has been a relative hit at launch, the game will miss out on the long-term revenue from Steam’s many sales and bundle offers. “Steam’s economics rely heavily on multi-year long tail sales and, for our past projects, on Steam key distribution through bundles, which has also lately been restricted for low-selling titles,” they write. “These structural differences are why a strong two week result on smaller storefronts does not tell us what a full Steam release could have looked like.” </p>
<p>I’m interested to hear more about the key distribution situation. Santa Ragoine have previously criticised Valve for declining to give them Steam keys for a "great bundle opportunity" featuring <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/saturnalia">Saturnalia</a>, their previous well-regarded horror game.</p>
<p>The developers conclude by refocussing attention on Valve’s role as de facto industry regulator and censor, given the size of its share of the PC gaming market. They write that stronger-than-expected sales of Horses “should not distract from the broader issue at stake: the need for clearer rules, transparent processes, and meaningful accountability from near monopolistic distribution platforms and the systems they enforce. </p>
<p>“For every case like HORSES that becomes visible, there are many more games that are quietly banned, delisted, or trapped in indefinite review for unclear reasons, with developers too worried about retaliation or future approval to speak publicly,” the statement concludes.</p><p>To continue the theme from that closing sentence, the news that Steam had banned Horses came following <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-payment-networks-control-the-definition-of-acceptable-sex-in-videogames">a wider crackdown on adult games</a> across both Valve’s platform and indie storefront Itch.io. This summer, Valve and Itch <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-change-steams-rules-to-let-banks-and-credit-card-firms-prohibit-certain-kinds-of-adult-only-content">altered their</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/itchio-apologise-for-frustration-and-confusion-after-delisting-thousands-of-nsfw-projects">submission terms</a> to give international payment processing networks a say over the definition of acceptable adult material.</p>
<p>The payment networks themselves appear to have tightened their rules <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/anti-porn-group-who-tried-to-ban-gta-5-claim-credit-for-steams-sex-game-crackdown">under pressure</a> from anti-misogyny groups and anti-pornography activists with ultra-conservative leanings. There is a counter-campaign underway to force the payment networks to reverse policy, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/acvalens.com/post/3m7gd2poyk22y">organised</a> by community figures such as journalist and Youtuber Ana Valens. We will likely have more reporting on the subject next year.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[LG Clears This 32″ Ultragear Gaming Monitor (240Hz, OLED, 3ms, 4K), Now Cheaper Than 27″ Model]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/lg-clears-this-32-ultragear-gaming-monitor-240hz-oled-3ms-4k-now-cheaper-than-27-model-2000654534</link>
            <guid>1387264</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>OLED gaming monitors used to mean choosing between your rent money and screen quality, but that gap keeps shrinking: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6485/">LG’s 32-inch Ultragear just hit $876 on Amazon, dropping $523 from its $1,399 list price</a> to reach an all-time low right before the holidays. This isn’t some Black Friday leftover either, as <strong>Amazon guarantees delivery before Christmas if you order soon</strong>.</p>
<p>The combination of <strong>4K resolution, 240Hz refresh rate, 0.03ms response time and true OLED blacks</strong> makes this monitor work equally well for competitive gaming sessions and those movie nights when you want visuals that actually impress.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6485/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>When Flexibility Really Means Something Useful</h2>
<p>The Dual Mode feature is more important than most marketing fluff because it really changes how you use the monitor every day: When you’re playing open-world games or story-driven games where graphics quality is more important than quick reactions, <strong>switch to 4K at 240Hz</strong>. When you’re playing competitive shooters, MOBAs, or racing games where every millisecond counts and clarity isn’t as important as responsiveness,<strong> use a hotkey to switch to Full HD at 480Hz</strong>. That 480Hz mode isn’t just a number on a spec sheet: it really does make motion blur almost invisible when you pan the camera quickly or flick it quickly.</p>



<p>The<strong> 0.03ms gray-to-gray response time</strong> gets rid of ghosting and trailing that slower panels have, which is especially noticeable during dark scenes or when characters move quickly. This speed is possible because OLED technology lets each pixel turn on and off right away, instead of waiting for liquid crystals to twist like LCD panels do. You’ll be able to see enemies coming out of the shadows faster, follow moving targets more accurately, and play the game in a way that feels like it’s connected to your inputs instead of lagging behind them.</p>



<p>LG added Micro Lens Array+ technology to this Ultragear which boosts<strong> normal brightness to 275 nits and peak brightness to 1300 nits</strong> which makes it the brightest OLED gaming display in their lineup. That brightness is more important than you might think, because OLED monitors can have trouble in bright rooms but this panel does well against window glare and overhead lights. The VESA DisplayHDR True Black 400 certification means that the monitor meets strict industry standards for both brightness peaks and the very deep blacks that OLED displays are known for. The 1.5 million to 1 contrast ratio gives images depth that LCD monitors can’t match. It shows details in dark game scenes that would be lost in murky gray on lower-quality displays.</p>
<p>The a<strong>nti-glare coating</strong> cuts down on reflections without adding that annoying grainy texture that some matte screens have which means you can focus on the game instead of having to change the lighting in your room all the time. The built-in speakers make surprisingly punchy bass-driven sound that works for casual gaming and streaming without needing external speakers.</p>
<p>The LG Switch app turns the monitor into a productivity powerhouse between gaming sessions by letting you split the screen into up to six customizable sections for doing more than one thing at a time. You can manage video calls, look through documents, and keep an eye on chat windows all at the same time. You can also switch between your PC input and the built-in webOS streaming platform for Netflix and YouTube without having to touch your computer.<strong> DisplayPort 2.1 and USB Type-C connections</strong> make sure your setup will work with next-generation graphics cards and give you enough bandwidth to push 4K at 240Hz without compression.</p>
<p>The bottom line is this: In a market where similar specs usually cost $1,200 to $1,500, $876 for a 32-inch OLED gaming monitor with dual refresh modes, HDR 400 certification, and sub-millisecond response times is a great deal.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>After comments this week from Larian CEO Swen Vincke revealing that the </span><i><span>Baldur’s Gate 3</span></i><span> developer is </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/larian-gen-ai-divinity-baldurs-gate-3-rpg-2000653912"><span>using generative AI in its workflow</span></a><span> prompted a massive backlash on social media, several developers have been weighing in. While Vincke said most of Larian’s workers were “okay” with how the team had integrated the technology, the public outcry </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/larian-baldurs-gate-3-divinity-ai-swen-vincke-reaction-2000653934"><span>from fans and developers</span></a><span> told a different story. The latest games industry veterans to weigh in include </span><i><span>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</span></i><span> lead Daniel Vávra and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-last-of-us-co-directors-new-game-couldnt-be-more-different-2000653042"><span>ex-Naughty Dog director Bruce Straley</span></a><span>, and both of them seem to think generative AI is here to stay in game development, though one of them is at least standing firm against the trend for now.</span></p> <p><span>Vávra posted a lengthy response to Vincke’s statements </span><a href="https://x.com/DanielVavra/status/2001337278229279169"><span>on X</span></a><span>, saying that while he’s “no fan of of AI generated art,” detractors need to “face [the] reality” that it’s here to stay.</span></p> <blockquote><p><span>You know what I hate most about making games? The fact that it takes 7 years and 300 people and tens of millions of dollars to make. And the fact that Tom had to spend 500 hours in the studio recording completely generic heckling and generic bars.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>If AI can help me make an epic game in a year with a smaller team like in the old days, I’m all for it. That game will still have an art director, writers, programmers, graphic designers, but they won’t have to do the tiresome and boring tasks, they’ll have to focus on the essentials.</span></p> <p><span>I have ideas for lots of games, but I’m fifty years old and so far it’s taken me seven years on average to make one game. If AI helps me realize those ideas faster, I’m all for it.</span></p></blockquote> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">This AI hysteria is the same as when people were smashing steam engines in the 19th century. <a href="https://twitter.com/LarAtLarian?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@LarAtLarian</a>  said they were doing something that absolutely everyone else is doing and got an insanely crazy shitstorm. </p> <p>I've even seen someone accuse us of using AI in KCD2. I don't… <a href="https://t.co/l7pNbTxeIT">https://t.co/l7pNbTxeIT</a></p> <p>— Daniel Vávra ⚔ (@DanielVavra) <a href="https://twitter.com/DanielVavra/status/2001337278229279169?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 17, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>Vávra goes on to raise a bunch of hypotheticals about being able to ask NPCs anything and the technology generating appropriate answers and so forth, as if human writers can’t generate something more interesting.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Straley, meanwhile, also believes that generative AI is here to stay, but </span><a href="https://x.com/bruce_straley/status/2001390353262457071?s=20"><span>says that he’s taken a stance against it</span></a><span> at Wildflower Interactive, though he admits that he might not be able to do so forever.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>“We don’t need AI,” Straley said in an interview with </span><i><span>Kinda Funny</span></i><span>. “I really do think it’s the demise of the human species. Our brain…we need a frontal lobe. Hundreds of thousands of years of this supercomputer that’s built, and they’re making football fields and draining water supplies, etc. to try to replicate something that a human can already do. It just doesn’t make sense to me.”</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Is AI needed in gaming? Bruce Straley (Co-Director of TLOU) gives his thoughts. <a href="https://t.co/msJdOS9Rlm">pic.twitter.com/msJdOS9Rlm</a></p> <p>— Kinda Funny (@KindaFunnyVids) <a href="https://twitter.com/KindaFunnyVids/status/2001337156812296647?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 17, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>It’s nice to hear someone like Straley taking a stance against using generative AI, though it is disheartening to hear that he also thinks it’s an inevitability that it will stay in the industry. Vávra says that “absolutely everyone else is” using generative AI in some capacity in game development, and if that’s true now, it doesn’t have to be. You can want better for your creative medium than plagiarizing slop machines that leave talented people out of work. If believing that bad things don’t have to happen is foolish, then I’d rather be a fool than an AI shill. </span></p>

            <p>Falcom, creator of the Trails in the Sky and Y's series, has revealed during a recent shareholder presentation it has begun using AI during game development, stating they are proceeding "cautiously", but that it's been used in the early stages of development nonetheless.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/Umisuika/status/2001526978164539420#m">As reported by Umisuika on X</a>, attending the shareholders meeting in-person, a Falcom representative stated: "We are proceeding cautiously due to legal issues. We are using AI to brainstorm scenarios and do research. What used to take 2-3 hours can now be completed in 10 minutes. AI is also used to correct typos in the scenario."</p>
<p>It is worth noting that this is a rough translation from Japanese to English using Google's in-built browser tools, and therefore the intricacies of this statement could be off. Even so, it is seemingly a confirmation that Falcom is integrating AI into its workflow.</p>

<p>It is no secret that Japanese video game companies have started embracing AI en masse. At Tokyo Game Show this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/over-half-of-japanese-game-companies-are-using-ai-in-development-states-report-from-tokyo-games-show-organiser">over half of polled developers acknowledged that AI has been used in game development</a>. Sega has stated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-acknowledges-strong-resistance-as-it-turns-to-ai-but-says-itll-use-technology-appropriately">it'll start using AI "appropriately" in spite of pushback</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-chasing-nfts-and-the-metaverse-square-enix-wants-generative-ai-to-do-70-of-its-qa-by-2027">Square Enix wants AI to do 70 percent of its QA by 2027</a>.</p><p>It is far from a topic isolated to Eastern game development though. Only this week, the CEO of Larian <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/holy-fck-guys-were-not-pushing-hard-for-or-replacing-concept-artists-with-ai-larian-ceo-responds-to-genai-backlash">met firm backlash following an interview in which he revealed that AI was being used at his studio</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/video-game-publishers-developers-normalise-ai-tools-voice-work-ethical-unions-actors-fighting-back">acting unions continue to stand firm against the technology and the dangers it poses to the people they represent</a>.</p>

		<p>Project Cloud Games and Perp Games have confirmed that the action RPG <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/28/watch-over-eight-minutes-of-the-relic-first-guardian-gameplay/">The Relic: First Guardian gameplay</a> will be launching on May 26th for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series XS. To announce this release date, a new trailer has been released which appears to show another boss that players will have to try and take on as they try to piece together The Relic: First Guardian’s story.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Relic: First Guardian - 'A New Fate' Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iCifOcNbp98?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Relic: First Guardian is set in the world of Arsiltus which was sucked up by the void following the great relic’s destruction. The goal is to find the pieces of the broken relic across the Arsiltus while dealing with the dangers that now plague it since falling into the void, with the hope being that finding the relic pieces will save Arsiltus and close the void.</p>
<p>Players do not level up in the game but equipping runes and items, and crafting tools to help is what will determine success in each mission. Every single weapon, of which there are five types, and armour piece is unique with each one having its own story behind it, along with a specific vow that the previous owner made. These pieces can be found and used against the 70 bosses that make up the challenge of The Relic: First Guardian, with each again having its own unique backstory. Players will also have access to 12 skill trees allowing for a range of playstyles.</p>

As <a href="https://investors.micron.com/news-releases/news-release-details/micron-technology-inc-reports-results-first-quarter-fiscal-2026">part of its earnings report</a> released on Wednesday, Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said “tight industry conditions” across DRAM and NAND flash memory are expected to “persist through and beyond” 2026 as AI drives up demand.</p><p>With the AI boom in full swing, Micron is making more money than ever as companies like OpenAI, Meta, Microsoft, and Google fill their data centers with powerful chips that come packaged with high-bandwidth memory (HBM).

Micron also expects to start production at a new manufacturing facility in Idaho in 2027, followed by a new plant in New York in 2030.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTE2"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Emma Roth</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/847344/micron-ram-memory-shortage-2026-earnings]]></content:encoded>

              <p>If you like watching your favorite shows and movies wherever you go, a streaming stick is a veritable must-have. You can use it on just about any TV, and cue up all the streaming services you have in one place, all with one device.

Plus, it gives you access to Amazon’s library as well.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4359/">If that sounds like something you need to add to your travel arsenal, or just want an easy way to devour content at home, it’s just $19 at Amazon right now, down from its usual price of $35.</a> That’s a discount of $16 and 46% off.

That makes it especially useful if you’re letting kids have free rein of the streamer, because they can just say their favorite show or movie and find it instead of fumbling with the remote.</p>

<p>The memory shortage is hitting the GPU market. A new report suggest Nvidia is preparing to cut down on production of its GeForce RTX 50 Series graphics cards.</p>



<p>According to Chinese outlet <a href="http://www.boardchannels.com.cn/thread-130069-1-1.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">BoBantang</a> via <a href="https://benchlife.info/nvidia-will-adjust-geforce-rtx-50-suppy-due-gddr7-shortage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Benchlife</a>, Nvidia is looking to reduce supply of the latest series of cards by as much as 30-40% compared to the first half of 2025. The report adds that this is being done due to the memory shortage for GDDR6 and GDDR7 RAM. Across the industry, this shortage has seen <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pc-ram-costs-more-than-new-graphics-cards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">consumer prices skyrocket</a> as AI companies buy up all of the available supply.</p>







<p>In addition to the original report, Benchlife adds that various AIC partners and suppliers have told the outlet that the first cards to likely be cut back are the GeForce RTX 5070 Ti and GeForce RTX 5060Ti 16GB.</p>



<p>As of publishing, Nvidia hasn’t confirmed or denied the report. Insider Gaming has made attempts to contact Nvidia for an official statement on the matter, but, so far, all requests have gone unanswered. Should one come, it will be added to this story. </p>

		<p>A new update for RV There Yet? has been released by developer Nuggets Entertainment, adding the new location of Mt. Yurbuttsk. This new stop on the RV route allows players to get a spot of skiing in to relax during the winter months. That is all that has been added in this update with new animals, snowball fights, new tools, and new music. Nuggets Entertainment is also trialing localisation with this update for RV There Yet?, though most of this is concentrated in the Mabutts Valley.</p>

<p>RV There Yet? is a co-op game where players are travelling in their RV back from a vacation, but run into all sorts of issues on Route 65. Players need to find ways to survive this route and get their RV across challenge terrain, sometimes needing to winch it or jump it across gaps and up heights when there is road to follow. The RV does get damaged so finding scrap in the wild is also essential to keep it moving, lest you get trapped on Route 65 and never make it home.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/newzoo-expects-global-video-games-market-reach-197-billion-2025-exceeds-expectations/</link>
            <guid>1387171</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Global data firm <a href="https://newzoo.com/">Newzoo</a> has published its year-in-review <a href="https://newzoo.com/resources/blog/year-in-review-2025-to-date">report for January to November 2025</a> for the global video games market, a year marked by the release of the Nintendo Switch 2, and engagement-driven growth on PC, beating out consoles and mobile. </p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/physical-video-game-sales-hardware-sales-november-2025-lowest-in-the-us-since-november-1995/">After yesterday's news from Circana</a> outlining how November 2025 was one of the worst months for US physical game sales and hardware sales in 30 years, Newzoo's report on the global industry is a reminder that, at least on the consumer side, things are still trending in a positive direction. Issues like <a href="https://wccftech.com/tariffs-rising-costs-us-consumers-spending-less-video-games/">tariffs, the rising cost of living</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/after-dell-acer-asus-have-surrendered-to-memory-shortages/">now memory shortages</a> could have more of an impact in 2026, but as of the end of 2025, Newzoo expects the global games market to rise 7.5% compared to 2024 when all the 2025 numbers are tallied.</p>



<p>That's an increase to <strong>$197 billion</strong>, with mobile games expected to grow to  <strong>$108 billion (a 7.7%</strong> <strong>increase)</strong>, console gaming expected to hit <strong>$45 billion (a 4.2% increase), </strong>and PC gaming expected to grow to <strong>$43 billion (a 10.4% increase)</strong>. The PC and mobile growth is what exceeded Newzoo's expectations, and the key drivers behind the expected growth getting to just shy of $200B, though, if growth continues in the way Newzoo predicts, the industry will be far past $200B by next year.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Newzoo-Year-in-Review-Report-Jan-Nov-2025-6.png"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: Newzoo</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>While Newzoo expects mobile to remain strong due to its stock of ol'reliable titles from publishers like Tencent and Century Games and the momentum perpetuated by new hits, much like how the console industry is kept up by the routine and habits of console gamers going back to major franchises each year, growth on PC is a bit more interesting. </p>



<p>That's exemplified in the top 10 games on PC by revenue for the year. Some of the games are major franchises, but none of them are free-to-play titles, and all of them are games that were released in 2025. "<em>The 2025 outcome reflects players spending more deeply within games and ecosystems they already value, rather than growth being driven by a sudden expansion of the player base</em>," said principal market analyst, Michiel Buijsman.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Newzoo-Year-in-Review-Report-Jan-Nov-2025-1.png"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: Newzoo</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Two of the top 10 are indie titles, and three of the top 10 are brand new games not based on a pre-existing franchise on PC, which Newzoo says is "<em>reflecting a broad appetite for varied experiences</em>" and <em>"PC's relative openness to new IP and system-driven design</em>." It's also further signs that, while console games may take centre stage more often as far as what hits the mainstream, PC is still where the core industry is. </p>



<p>On console, the top 10 does clear one of the same bars that the PC list clears, which is that they're all games released in 2025, but none of them are indie titles or new franchises. They're all major franchises, and half the list are even annual releases. </p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Newzoo-Year-in-Review-Report-Jan-Nov-2025-2.png"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: Newzoo</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>EA is the winningest publisher with nearly half the list in its portfolio, though perhaps the most impressive inclusion is Pokemon Legends Z-A, which made it despite only being available on one platform.</p>



<p>Both of those lists are tallied by revenue, whereas the engagement lists (tallied by monthy active users) for PC and console are a different story. Only one of the titles in the top 10 on PC isn't based on a pre-existing franchise, while all of the games on the console list for the top 10 games by MAUs are major franchises.</p>



<p>As a side note, the top 10 console games by MAUs is in fact the only list in Newzoo's report where Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 makes the top 10. Battlefield 6 is still in that top 10, and made it on every the revenue and MAU list for both PC and consoles. It's still early of course, but at this point it feels safe to call it: Battlefield beat Call of Duty in 2025, and there's practically no question about it.</p>

</div>
</figure>



<p>Lastly, the final key points from Newzoo's report, as it looks back at 2025 and towards the future to 2026, is that indie games were a huge factor in this year's industry conversation, largely due to successes like Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, which capped off its stellar year by <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-winners-full-list/">winning a record number of awards at The Game Awards, including Game of the Year</a>. </p>



<p>And as we look ahead, 2025's most significant moves, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-claims-it-will-maintain-creative-control-if-55-billion-buyout-goes-through-saudi-arabia-silver-lake/">like EA moving to privatize</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-announces-imminent-closing-transaction-with-tencent-minority-stakeholder-vantage-studios/">Ubisoft's opening of Vantage Studios</a> mean that the industry is going through a massive shift. "<em>The EA deal reflects a broader structual shift toward ownership concentration and tighter portfolio management,</em>" said Manu Rosier, director of market intelligence at Newzoo.</p>



<p>"<em>A smaller number of companies now control a larger share of the industry's most influential IP, while platforms increasingly shape which games are funded, distributed, and scaled</em>."</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Dune Awakening Chapter 3 Brings ‘Bigger, Better’ Endgame, New Content and Lots More, Says Funcom]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-chapter-3-brings-bigger-better-endgame-new-content-and-more/</link>
            <guid>1387168</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Today, Funcom has unveiled Dune Awakening Chapter 3, an upcoming update for its survival crafting game set in the world based on Frank Herbert's novels and Denis Villeneuve's movies.</p>



<p>Dune Awakening launched in June 2025 on PC, <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-1-million-copies-sold-creative-director-announces-major-changes-deep-desert-pve-pvp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">selling one million copies in a couple of weeks</a> and becoming Funcom's fastest-selling game release to date. However, it was quickly evident that there wasn't enough content, and a lot of players left the game after a short while.</p>



<p>At Gamescom 2025, Game Director Joel Bylos <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-gamescom-2025-qa-we-just-need-to-keep-working-and-solve-the-problems-we-have-one-of-the-best-survival-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">told me</a> the team wasn't worried, as the core is among the best games in the genre and it just needed more content and fixes. Despite <a href="https://wccftech.com/funcom-announces-layoffs-despite-dune-awakening-being-biggest-release-in-32-year-history/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent layoffs</a>, that's exactly what Funcom plans to add to Dune Awakening, starting with Chapter 3.</p>



<p>First and foremost, the developers aim to deliver a 'bigger, better' endgame, powered by a comprehensive redesign of the Tier 6 experience. Players will find deeper progression choices and more meaningful advancement paths, thanks to specializations dedicated to Crafting, Gathering, Exploring, Combat, and Sabotage. This will allow non‑combat focused players to progress endgame content without forced PvP or dungeon raiding.</p>



<p>The Landraad system, Dune Awakening's server-wide political system where player guilds align with the Great Houses (Atreides, Harkonnen), complete weekly tasks, and vote on decrees that affect everyone on the server, has reportedly been remade from scratch and now features new repeatable missions, expanded reward tiers, and stronger incentives for participation. The Faction ranks progression has been extended, too. There will be new contracts specific to each faction's objectives (Atreides, Harkonnen, independent groups). </p>



<p>A completely new Augmentation Station is being introduced as an upgrade path for late‑game gear customization. Players will be able to attach powerful augments to Unique Tier 6 gear to customize their playstyle further. On the PvE side, Funcom is adding five brand-new overland 'challenge sites', including 'The Broodworks'. Completing these areas provides faction progress, increases Landsraad contribution, and grants Specialization XP. Furthermore, Dune Awakening Chapter 3 will introduce five new Testing Stations. These are repeatable, dungeon-like content featuring boss fights, increasing difficulty and appropriately valuable rewards. </p>



<p>The story is going forward, too. The player's narrative journey will continue with the introduction of unexpected allies, fighting through the Neo Carthag dueling ring, and delving deeper into the mystery of the player character's origins. When it comes to combat, the Rapier is being fully reworked, and a new 'Pyrocket' melee weapon (dual-wielded knives) will be available with the update.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Alongside Dune Awakening Chapter 3, Funcom will launch the paid Raiders of the Broken Lands DLC, which can be purchased for $9.99 (but is included with the $24.99 Season Pass). Its additions are cosmetic-only: 73 new building pieces and 17 decorations inspired by the Imperium's Smugglers, a dedicated stillsuit set, a light and heavy armor set, weapon variants, swatches, and emotes.</p>



<p>The game is available at a 35% discount, the largest one yet since launch, in the Steam Winter Sale that starts today. Funcom did not share a timeframe for Chapter 3 and the Raiders of the Broken Lands DLC, but more details should be released in early 2026. Later next year, the game is supposed to launch on consoles as well.</p>

              <p data-start="0" data-end="382">Amazon is currently offering a significant discount on <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6483/">the 2025 Apple MacBook Air with the M4 chip, bringing the price down to $949 from its usual $1,119.</a> This 21% reduction translates to a savings of $250, making it one of the best deals available for this model since its release earlier this year.

<p data-start="410" data-end="999">The 15.3-inch 2025 MacBook Air continues to be a top pick for users who value portability without compromising on performance. Weighing just 3.3 pounds and maintaining a sleek, slim design, this model upholds the Air’s tradition of ultra-light form while delivering performance on par with larger devices. Despite its compact size, Apple has equipped it with a 10-core CPU, an optional 10-core GPU, and support for up to 24GB of memory. With the new M4 chip, this MacBook Air offers speeds up to twice as fast as the M1-era model and up to 23 times faster than Intel-powered versions.</p>
<p data-start="1001" data-end="1291">Apple designed the M4 chip with Apple Intelligence in mind, optimizing the system for task management, efficient processing, and the ability to handle intensive workflows.

The built-in three-microphone array ensures clear audio, so you don’t need external equipment to be heard clearly.</p>


<p data-start="1782" data-end="2222">The fully backlit keyboard makes it easy to type in low-light conditions, while Touch ID offers quick and secure access to the laptop. On the sides, there are two Thunderbolt ports for fast data transfer and peripheral connectivity. The MagSafe charging port ensures your power cable remains securely attached but detaches safely if pulled. Apple has also kept the headphone jack—great for anyone who still prefers wired audio devices.</p>
<p data-start="2224" data-end="2430">For those fully integrated into the Apple ecosystem, the MacBook Air offers seamless features like AirDrop, iMessage syncing, and Handoff, allowing for smooth transitions between your iPhone, iPad, and Mac.</p>
<p data-start="2432" data-end="2790"><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6483/">The MacBook Air is available in several configurations, all of which are currently discounted. The 256GB model, priced at $949, offers a $250 savings</a>. The 512GB model is priced at $1,149, also reflecting a $250 reduction. For those needing more memory, the 24GB RAM and 512GB storage configuration has dropped by $250, bringing it down to $1,349 from $1,599.</p>
<p data-start="2792" data-end="3057" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">The MacBook Air is also available in four stylish colors: sky blue, silver, starlight, and midnight. With its impressive performance, ultra-portable design, and generous discounts, the 2025 MacBook Air is a standout option for anyone in the market for a new laptop—especially right now while its $250 off.</p>

<p>Techland is pushing out the first major update for Dying Light 2: Stay Human for some time. Now that Dying Light: The Beast is in the open and doing well, the team has reverted to focus more on the live-service Dying Light 2, which was released back in 2022. The new winter update is dubbed ‘Winter Tales: Gifts from Above 2025’, and it comes with some neat content.</p>



<p>This fresh update also boasts a new bundle called <strong>The Evolving Bundle</strong>. It’s an interactive set that gets better once you’ve bought it, with the various items in the set <em>evolving </em>and taking on new forms.</p>







<h2 id="h-winter-has-come-to-villedor">Winter Has Come to Villedor</h2>



<p>The festive theme lands in Villedor once a year, blanketing the map in challenges, exclusive rewards, and seasonal activities.</p>



<p>In a new press release published by Techland, the return of <strong>Baka </strong>was highlighted:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><strong>Baka is back in the Villedor</strong>&nbsp;with a set of new bounties for players to complete, progressing with him will unlock items in his shop based on the level players are at. These items can be bought with Candies collected from killing seasonal zombie enemies – including Naughty Biters, Naughty Bolters, Naughty Virals, Uncle Snow, and Ice Spitters.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>If you complete enough challenges, you’ll get your ‘Letter to Santa’ from Baka, which triggers a special airdrop guarded by fearsome enemies.</p>



<p>From today, December 18, community goals are being kick-started to allow players access to even more gear. Here’s the spread of challenges coming up:</p>



<ul>
<li>December 18 – December 23 – Week 1: Kill Naughty Biters – rewards include the Glacier Shank Knife and Snow Season Ornament Charm</li>



<li>December 23 – December 30 – Week 2: Kill Naughty Virals – rewards include The Guiding Star Mace and Gift Season Ornament Charm.&nbsp;</li>



<li>December 30 – January 8 – Week 3: Kill Uncle Snow – rewards include the Fractal Frost Axe&nbsp;and New Year’s Ornament Charm.</li>
</ul>



<p>One of the more unique elements of the Winter Update in Dying Light 2: Stay Human is the new <strong>Evolving Bundle</strong>. This has been dubbed ‘the first of its kind’, suggesting that more are coming, and this is why it’s so important for fans of the franchise:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The first bundle of that kind is the&nbsp;<strong>Night Wolf Evolving Bundle</strong>&nbsp;which evolves into the Crimson Werewolf set as players progress through a four-part questline. This way players can acquire two versions of a powerful rifle, an outfit, six gear pieces, and a paraglider skin. The bundle also contains the Wolf’s Claws melee weapon and an exclusive grappling hook variant.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>As you play the new questline, you’ll see your weapons and equipment evolving before your eyes, which is a super neat touch.</p>



<p>This announcement was made in addition to the team at Techland highlighting big discounts across the Dying Light franchise, which includes Dying Light: The Beast being up to 20% off right now.</p>
