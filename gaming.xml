			<p>Unknown 9: Awakening got a<a href="https://wccftech.com/unknown-9-awakening-gets-new-gameplay-footage/"> lot of buzz</a> before its release, but then it seemed that there was no news or rumblings about it after the game was released. There was just silence. As a result of the game not performing to Reflector Entertainment's expectations, the company has now been hit with layoffs. Unknown 9: Awakening was the first game that was going to be in a series of action-adventure games with an expansive multimedia universe surrounding it. This includes a podcast audio drama, novels, and even comic books. Whether this will happen now is uncertain. It's been posted on the official Reflector Entertainment website that 18% of the workforce has been laid off. However, the post announcing this has now been deleted from the Reflector website.</p>
<p>It's claimed that the layoffs are due to the studio entering a new phase of development, and those who were laid off were not "assigned to roles that our active projects require." To support those impacted by the layoffs, the company has said that they will be supporting them by providing severance packages, "as well as access to medical, emotional, and career planning support."</p>
<p>Considering we aren't out of the first month of the year yet, there have already been a stark number of layoffs, which is what everyone was hoping to see less of this year. There have been approximately 295 people laid off in the gaming industry this year thus far, according to the <a href="https://gaminglayoffs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gaming layoffs website</a> that tracks every known instance of layoffs.</p>
<p>At the moment it's not certain what areas of the company were impacted by the layoffs, but it's reported that it was employees from QA, marketing, art, and narrative. This includes employees like Narrative and Game Designer Anna Karina Bermudez as well as Brand Manager Manou Deneuvel, who have posted on LinkedIn about their new search for employment.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hervehoerdt/?originalSubdomain=fr" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chief Content Officer Herve Hoerdt</a> has also confirmed on LinkedIn that they have canceled a new project that was in the conceptualization phase. It's been said that they scrapped the project as it wouldn't be sustainable for the future of the studio, which has led to redundancies.</p>
<p>Hoerdt also goes on to state that the game's cancelation comes off the back of the "failure" of the company's "ambitious and courageous first project," which was Unknown 9: Awakening. While the specific numbers haven't been stated, he says that the game's sales performance "didn't come near the company expectations."</p>

<p>According to a press release,&nbsp;<em>Rogue Trader&nbsp;</em>has crossed one million sales across all of the platforms on which it's currently available, i.e. PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

<p>Studio head Oleg Shpilchevskiy says the milestone is a "sign" that Owlcat is "working in the right direction", and that he wants his team to "bring more stories to the endless universe of&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k</em>".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-rogue-trader-sales-1m-cassia.jpg?itok=lbT7y2F9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-rogue-trader-sales-1m-cassia.jpg?itok=KYWndPTW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Warhammer 40k: Rogue Trader&nbsp;</em>has hit an important sales milestone for Owlcat.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k: Rogue Trader</em>, it's a CRPG set in the grim darkness of the&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k&nbsp;</em>universe. As the title suggests, you play one of the titular Rogue Traders, who are essentially Imperium-sanctioned explorers and merchants given special permission to travel the galaxy.</p>

<p>As you'd expect from an Owlcat game, you'll meet a number of companions who represent several of the&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k</em>&nbsp;setting's races and character archetypes. Companions include a Navis Nobilite navigator, a tech-priest, and a warrior from the Adeptus Sororitas, among many others.</p>

<p>Released <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warhammer-40k-rogue-trader-alpha-goes-live-today" rel="nofollow">in alpha in 2022</a>, the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warhammer-40k-rogue-trader-release-date" rel="nofollow">scored a full 1.0 release</a> on PC and consoles in December 2023, and a number of updates both <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warhammer-40k-rogue-trader-update-biggest-yet" rel="nofollow">big</a> and small have been released for&nbsp;<em>Rogue Trader&nbsp;</em>in the intervening months.</p>




<p>In September last year,&nbsp;<em>Rogue Trader</em>'s first DLC,&nbsp;<em>Void Shadows</em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warhammer-40k-rogue-trader-dlc-void-shadows-delayed" rel="nofollow">was released</a>. It added lots of content to the game, including a new Death Cult assassin companion, new quests, and more.</p>

<p>Another major expansion,&nbsp;<em>Lex Imperialis</em>, is currently in the works, bringing a new companion from the Adeptus Arbite, which you can essentially think of as the Imperium's police force. Naturally, you can also look forward to new areas, mechanics, and plenty more in that expansion.</p>

<p>You can grab&nbsp;<em>Rogue Trader&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2186680/Warhammer_40000_Rogue_Trader/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/concept/10008102/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/warhammer-40000-rogue-trader/9p30bfhz1bkn" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.</p>

As such, Paramount has done another marketing push for the movie by releasing concept art of some of the film’s most pivotal moments. The images include what seem to be previous iterations of the movie’s post-credits scene, which was exciting, but a bit confusing. While the moment depicted in the art doesn’t appear in the final film, it still may nevertheless clear up one thing about the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sonic-hedgehog-3-4-post-credits-amy-rose-metal-shadow-1851726285&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-hedgehog-3-4-post-credits-amy-rose-metal-shadow-1851726285">post-credits scene</a></span> fans have been wondering about since the movie premiered in December.

Most of the moments shown in these (gorgeous) pieces made their way into the final film, such as Sonic and Shadow fighting as their super forms in space, Ivo and Gerald Robotnik duking it out inside the Eclipse Cannon, and Sonic’s family roasting marshmallows before G.U.N. comes to ask for their help stopping Shadow. But a few of them show scenes that were either cut from the film, or heavily altered for it. This includes two pieces that depict the characters introduced in the post-credits scene: <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sonic-3-post-credits-amy-reverse-sonamy-relationship-1851730058&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-3-post-credits-amy-reverse-sonamy-relationship-1851730058">Amy Rose</a></span> and Metal Sonic.</p><figure id="" data-id="60f44164e54cb5e92651aa073183f57c" data-recommend-id="image://60f44164e54cb5e92651aa073183f57c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1320" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Amy is shown standing on top of a destroyed robot as Sonic is laying down in front of it." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Amy is shown standing on top of a destroyed robot as Sonic is laying down in front of it." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="60f44164e54cb5e92651aa073183f57c" data-recommend-id="image://60f44164e54cb5e92651aa073183f57c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1320" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Amy is shown standing on top of a destroyed robot as Sonic is laying down in front of it." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The art of Amy closely resembles her introduction in the final movie. She’s shown wielding her hammer and taking down what looks like one of Eggman’s giant robots, seemingly saving Sonic from the threat. This is basically how she appears in the movie, except instead of taking down a giant, mostly non-descript robot, she saves Sonic from a squad of his metal doppelgangers. The art of Metal Sonic, however, is unlike anything seen in the final film. We see the robot standing guard next to Eggman, who is adorned in an extravagant red-and-gold robe and wielding a golden staff. In the background, we can see that the world behind him appears to have been desecrated, implying that Eggman and Metal Sonic have conquered it.</p><p>Notably, this image may clear up a question fans have had about Metal Sonic’s origins since <em>Sonic 3 </em>premiered. Metal Sonic does seem to have been created by Eggman, but perhaps not the one we’ve followed for three movies. Fans have been speculating that <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 4 </em>may take place in a far-flung future, and that Sonic may have broken the time barrier at the end of the third movie. Amy’s hooded vigilante outfit, seen in the post-credits scene, is evocative of a hero who is on the run from some kind of police-state-level force. There’s also the possibility that Sonic, rather than moving forward in time, may have instead shifted to an alternate timeline in which Eggman is still alive and perhaps didn’t have the change of heart shown at the end of <em>Sonic 3</em>. </p><figure id="" data-id="e42752224e2f6ae29ed0b6e110b11e95" data-recommend-id="image://e42752224e2f6ae29ed0b6e110b11e95" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1320" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Eggman stands next to Metal Sonic while wearing a long red-and-gold robe and holding a golden staff." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Eggman stands next to Metal Sonic while wearing a long red-and-gold robe and holding a golden staff." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e42752224e2f6ae29ed0b6e110b11e95" data-recommend-id="image://e42752224e2f6ae29ed0b6e110b11e95" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1320" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Eggman stands next to Metal Sonic while wearing a long red-and-gold robe and holding a golden staff." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It’s also possible this concept art tells us nothing about the movie that’s coming and is instead just a scrapped idea the team was toying with. But at the very least, this is the most concrete clue we’ve been given about Metal Sonic’s origins in the movies. It looks like he’s tied to Eggman in some way, even if the good doctor is supposedly gone. We’ll know more as we get closer to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sonic-4-sequel-confirmed-paramount-2027-sega-release-1851725410&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-4-sequel-confirmed-paramount-2027-sega-release-1851725410"><em>Sonic 4</em>’s release in 2027</a></span>, but for now, we have more to speculate on than that incredibly vague post-credits scene.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The developers behind Balatro have announced that the game has sold an impressive 5 million units to date.</p>



<p>The announcement came from the games X (formerly Twitter) <a href="https://x.com/BalatroGame/status/1881728578712474019" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">account</a>, where it was said that the game had sold 5 million units. To put that in perspective, at its $15 price tag, the game has generated roughly $75 million in-game sales alone. </p>



<p>Taking to X, the developers behind Balatro, LocalThunk, said, “The last few weeks have been pretty wild. To everyone who picked up Balatro after seeing it at</p>



<p>@thegameawards, we hope you’re having an amazing time with it! If this is your first time picking up an indie title, try to make it a habit!”</p>



<p>LocalThunk announced that the game had sold 3.5 million units before The Game Awards, a 1.5 million increase since it won at the event.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/balatro-trophy-guide-all-achievements-trophies/"><strong>RELATED – Balatro Trophy Guide—All Achievements &amp; Trophies<br></strong></a><br>Balatro has quickly become one of the best Indie games of not only the year, but arguably of all time and has been praised immensely due to its art style and fantastic gameplay loop.</p>



<p>Its success hasn’t been without problems, though. In December 2024, Balatro received an 18+ rating from PEGI because of “links to gambling”. Following the news, LocalThunk took to X to say, “maybe I should add microtransactions/loot boxes/real gambling to lower that rating to 3+ like EA sports FC” – A honestly hilarious dig to the rating board.</p>

    <p><span>Step into Grandma's slippers and take on her day-to-day house chores.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>Publisher <a title="Companies > Super Rare Originals [13 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/super-rare-originals">Super Rare Originals</a> and developer <a title="Companies > Wallride [3 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/wallride">Wallride</a> have announced <em><a title="Games > Grandma, No!" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/grandma-no">Grandma, No!</a></em>, a physics-based <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,001 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure game</a> where players become a grandma and take on her day-to-day house chores in chaotic fashion. It will launch for <a title="Platforms > PC [22,162 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2362680/Grandma_No/" target="_blank">Steam</a> in 2025. <span id="more-939390"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Super Rare Originals:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>In <em>Grandma, No!</em>, it’s up to the player to keep things under control, or the house turns into a whirlwind of chaos; a range of challenges and scenarios that need to be resolved await. What chaos ensues when Grandma gets stuck babysitting her grandkid out of the blue?</p><p><em>Grandma, No!</em> is a physics-based, laugh-out-loud adventure where the player steps into the worn-out slippers of a grandma who’s in way over her head. She is trying to survive her day without burning the house down—or maybe she’ll embrace the mayhem.</p><p>The gameplay takes a turn when “simple” tasks go off the rails. Taking out the trash may lead to somewhere unexpected, while cooking dinner could end up with more fire than flavor. Each challenge is designed to be wilder than the last, and new outfits for Grandma can be unlocked along the way, so she can tackle the mayhem in style.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->

<p>Updates regarding its development have been rare since it was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-has-been-delayed/1100-6513963/" data-ref-id="1100-6513963">delayed from its original 2023 release window</a>.

Nintendo will be hosting a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-revealed-launch-date/1100-6528762/" data-ref-id="1100-6528762">Direct presentation on April 2</a> focusing on the Switch 2, so it's possible that the game will make an appearance there.</p><p>Hollow Knight: Silksong is set to launch on PC, PlayStation, Switch, and Xbox. It'll also be coming to Xbox Game Pass on its release day.</p>

            <p>
The studio behind <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unknown-9-awakening-is-an-ambitious-new-transmedia-bid">bold Assassin's Creed-meets-Tomb Raider transmedia attempt Unknown 9</a> has signalled an end to the franchise, following the poor performance of last year's initial video game.
</p>
<p>
Unknown 9: Awakening, a generic globe-trotting adventure starring The Witcher TV series' Anya Chalotra, "didn't come near the company's expectations," the boss of developer Reflector Entertainment Herve Hoerdt said in a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/reflector-entertainment_activity-7287227402995269633-s4i-/">statement</a> today, "and didn't warrant any further exploration in this universe". Ouch.
</p>
<p>
One of the Reflector's two future projects - presumably another Unknown 9 game which had been in the "conceptualisation phase" - has now been cancelled, Hoerdt added. This therefore means the studio was "terminating this development line".

<p>
"This decision correlates directly with the failure of the studio's ambitious and courageous first project, a new IP with a rich transmedia universe," Hoerdt continued. 
</p>
<p>
Reflector had ambitious plans for Unknown 9 as an ongoing series, supported by podcasts, comics, novels, and several web series. While many of these have now been released, some ahead of Awakening itself, following a lengthy delay to the video game, none appear to have made any real impression.
</p>
<p>
Reflector will now go through a second round of redundancies, following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unknown-9-awakening-developers-report-layoffs">previous job losses reported back in November 2024</a>, as the company shrinks to a "single project approach the studio will adopt for the imminent future". 
</p>
<p>
This project is an "existing Bandai Namco IP" and is "shaping up well", Hoerdt concluded.

			<p>The Trump tariffs on imports from Mexico could have a strong impact on the video games market in the United States and lead to fewer disc-based releases and higher prices for both physical and digital games, according to an analyst.</p>
<p>Speaking on Bluesky, Circana Executive Director and Video Game Industry Analyst <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mat Piscatella</a> highlighted how 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico could lead to a "sharp downtick" in the number of physical releases in the United States, as much of the production infrastructure is located in Mexico. If they do get made, prices could rise for both physical and digital games, as digital games' MSRPs would be increased to remain at price parity with physical releases. No matter what happens precisely, however, Mat Piscatella doesn't see anything good coming for the physical video game market in the near future.</p>

<p lang="en">Alright, well, video games.</p>
<p>With 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico on the way, I can see a sharp downtick in the number of disc-based games that get released physically in the US, as much of that production infrastructure is in Mexico.</p>
<p>If they do get made, I expect higher prices both phys &amp; dig.</p>

<p lang="en">I would, were this to happen, anticipate digital MSRPs to increase to remain at price parity with physical, but who knows.</p>
<p>In any case, none of this is good for the physical video game market.</p>

<p>The analyst remarks that moving the production of retail releases to the US to avoid being impacted by the Trump tariffs is definitely possible with significant investment. However, this significant investment is unlikely to come, as annual US physical video game software spending is half what it was in 2021 and is declining rapidly. At the same time, moving production to the US wouldn't help when it comes to cost, so there aren't a lot of incentives to move production to the United States.</p>

<p lang="en">'Can't that production just be moved to the US?'</p>
<p>With significant investment, sure. But annual US physical video game software spending is now half what it was in 2021 and declining rapidly.</p>
<p>And this also wouldn't help when it comes to costs.</p>
<p>Not a good combo to incentive that investment. IMO.</p>

<p>No matter what is going to happen in the near future with the new Trump tariffs, it looks like a price increase for video games seems almost inevitable, and the whole industry seems to be pushing towards it, in one way or another. As highlighted in a new <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-growth-engine-pricing/">State of Video Gaming in 2025 presentation</a> by CEO of Epyllion Matthew Ball, much of the video game industry is hoping that Grand Theft Auto 6 will be priced higher than the current $70 barrier and thus re-establish packaged game pricing after decades of deflation despite rampant cost growth.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bohemia-interactive-revenue-up-2024<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>DayZ&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Arma&nbsp;</em>studio Bohemia Interactive has reported an "extremely successful 2024", contrasting against what the Czech studio calls the "global stagnation" of the gaming industry at large.</p>

<p>In a press release, Bohemia says its revenue jumped 34% in 2024, reaching a total of $60.8 million. The company managed to sell 4.85 million copies of its games across PC and consoles last year, with player numbers hitting 17 million around the world.</p>

<p>According to Bohemia, 99% of those sales came from "abroad" rather than from its native Czech Republic, with the US enjoying a 42% market share. Bohemia also reports "significant growth" in Ukraine, which saw player numbers doubling year-on year, and points to Brazil as a market of "growing importance".</p>

<p>The studio also says that fans can look forward to "interesting game surprises" over the coming year, including the "intensive development" of&nbsp;<em>Arma 4</em>, which is now expected to launch sometime in 2027.</p>

<p>More games under the Bohemia Incubator program, through which Bohemia gives smaller teams funding and publishing support for their games, will also be introduced this year, with action platformer&nbsp;<em>Brute Horse&nbsp;</em>and sandbox RPG&nbsp;<em>SkyVerse&nbsp;</em>both on Bohemia's 2024 infographic.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bohemia-interactive-financials-2024-infographic.jpg?itok=SzUDqc8D 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bohemia-interactive-financials-2024-infographic.jpg?itok=nUtvCWyy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Bohemia had a pretty good 2024, all things considered.</figcaption></figure><p>The "global stagnation" of which Bohemia speaks has seen a lot of game studios caught up in its field, with major studios like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-layoffs" rel="nofollow">Sony</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/take-two-interactive-layoffs" rel="nofollow">Take-Two</a> laying off staff members, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-shutdown" rel="nofollow">shutting down studios</a>, and even <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/concord-shutting-down-refunds" rel="nofollow">canceling live service games shortly after release</a> in 2024.</p>

<p>It's fair to say that Bohemia's growth certainly goes against the grain in that regard, although given the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-ceo-payrise-layoffs" rel="nofollow">eye-watering cash</a> some of these companies' C-suites <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-ceo-25-million-income-layoffs" rel="nofollow">took home for themselves</a> last year and the year before, I'd question whether those decisions were, in fact, made due to industry trends.</p>

<p>In any case, we'll bring you more on what Bohemia Interactive gets up to in 2025 as and when we get it, so stay tuned for that.</p>

The EA App is as clunky and frustrating as Origin ever was, a completely unnecessary obstacle between you and just double-clicking the icon for the game you want to play, but when you want to play <em>Burnout Paradise</em> for the 943rd time, it’s no more of an ordeal than it was before.</p><p>The real issues arrive if you’re running a 32-bit version of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://help.ea.com/en/help/ea/ea-app/update-operating-system-for-ea-app/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://help.ea.com/en/help/ea/ea-app/update-operating-system-for-ea-app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Windows</a></span> or <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://help.ea.com/en-gb/help/ea/ea-app/update-mac-operating-system-for-ea-app/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://help.ea.com/en-gb/help/ea/ea-app/update-mac-operating-system-for-ea-app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mac</a></span>.</p><p>The number of people who will be affected will admittedly be small, but a small number of a very big number still means an awful lot of people will be scuppered. If you’re in this group, the games you already own on Origin—despite not changing in any way—will not be playable via the EA app, and given Origin’s going to absolutely stop working entirely in three months, if you don’t upgrade your machine, you’re not going to be able to play them at all.</p><p>If you’re on Windows 11, you’re good, as Microsoft never released a 32-bit version of that OS, but Windows 10 users prior to 2020 could still buy a 32-bit version of the software, and upgrading it is a real pain in the ass. It involves entirely formatting the hard disk on which Windows is installed, and reinstalling Windows in its 64-bit incarnation. (If you’re not sure which you have, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/32-bit-and-64-bit-windows-frequently-asked-questions-c6ca9541-8dce-4d48-0415-94a3faa2e13d#:~:text=Upgrading%20from%20the%2032%2Dbit,you%20had%20on%20your%20device.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/32-bit-and-64-bit-windows-frequently-asked-questions-c6ca9541-8dce-4d48-0415-94a3faa2e13d#:~:text=Upgrading%20from%20the%2032%2Dbit,you%20had%20on%20your%20device." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this link will help</a></span>.) And that means you’ll need a CPU which can do that. Fortunately, you almost definitely do (follow that previous link and look for “System type” in the Settings window it pops open, and you should hopefully see “64-bit operating system, x64-based processor”).</p><p>If you don’t, however, your PC is probably extremely elderly, and to carry on playing your EA games, you’ll need to completely upgrade the whole thing. Or more realistically, replace it. So yeah, if you’re still running a decrepit old PC because that’s what you can afford right now, you will no longer be able to play the EA games you thought you owned.</p><p>That sucks.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Back in the '90s, there were several animated adaptations of popular video games, and two of them are headed to Blu-ray soon. Discotek has officially announced that the Street Fighter and Darkstalker TV series will be getting the Blu-ray treatment, which includes brand-new cover art and a surprising amount of extra content.</p><p>Just to be clear, these shows are products of a time when animated series followed a set of family-friendly guidelines. Violence was naturally toned down since the shows were aimed at younger audiences, and the storylines mixed references to the games with plots that were designed to get you to buy licensed action figures. Still, there's a certain charm to these classic cartoons, and Discotek is packing quite a few extras on each release.</p><p>Street Fighter: The Animated Series is a wonderfully weird adaptation, as it revolves around Guile leading an international task force of martial artists against M Bison and his Shadaloo syndicate. Yes, it's basically GI Joe but with more sonic booms and hadoukens. For the Blu-ray release, all 26 episodes have been included, you can view the original intro for the show in storyboard mode, an art gallery has been included, and there are game-inspired menus.</p><p>All 26 episodes come with commentary tracks narrated by notable members of the fighting game and YouTube community, like Matt McMuscles, Maximillian Dood, Justin Wong, Arin "Egoraptor" Hanson, Alexs Le, Lythero, and Guile Win Quote. Interestingly, the cartoon is a sequel to the iconic live-action film starring Jean-Claude Van Damme and Raul Julia, and if you're looking to get that film, a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Street-Fighter-Jean-Claude-Van-Damme/dp/B09HFXX64T?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">really nice steelbook version</a> was released not too long ago. It even comes with 100 Bison Dollars, which will be worth quite a few British Pounds once the King of England has been kidnapped and new exchange rates have been set.</p><p>Alternatively, you can pick up the recent 4K release of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CGWQSMJY?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Street Fighter 2: The Animated Movie</a>. This is a 4K HDR transfer of the original cut of the film, and both the uncensored and PG-13 versions are included. For the extras, you're getting the original Japanese and English dubs, production art, promotional materials, and several other extras.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4430517-street-fighter-1994.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4430517" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4430517-street-fighter-1994.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4430517"></a><figcaption>The Street Fighter 1994 movie, considered by many to be the Citizen Kane of video game movies.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4430517-street-fighter-1994.jpg"></figure><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Street-Fighter-Jean-Claude-Van-Damme/dp/B09HFXX64T?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Street Fighter: The Movie (Steelbook Edition)</a> -- $24.96 ($<del>35</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Street-Fighter-Extreme-Blu-ray-Jean-Claude/dp/B001L2ZSJE?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Street Fighter: The Movie (Standard Blu-ray)</a> -- $10 ($<del>15</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CGWQSMJY?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Street Fighter 2: The Animated Movie</a> (4K Blu-ray) -- $27.49 ($<del>35</del>)</li></ul><p>Darkstalkers only got a single 13-episode season, and it was a major departure from its source material. Loosely based on the first Darkstalkers game, the TV series was aimed at a younger audience and had a much more lighthearted tone in comparison. It also had animation that varied wildly in quality, nonsensical plots, and hilariously bad voice acting.</p><p>If you're looking for something that is so bad that it goes full circle and actually becomes good, then this time capsule of Saturday-morning-cartoon energy might appeal to you. Extras haven't been confirmed for the Blu-ray yet, but if the Street Fighter release is any indication, then you can count on Discotek to unearth some interesting archival material for this release.</p>

            <p>Balatro, the poker-themed roguelite, has now passed 5m copies sold.</p>

<p>Alongside the mobile release, Balatro was added to the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/apple-arcade">Apple Arcade</a> subscription service, but it would appear those players are not included in these 5m individual sales.</p>
<p>The news was shared on the Balatro social media account, which implored fans to try out more indie games.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-update-limited-time-mode<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bandai Namco has released a new&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero&nbsp;</em>update, and it comes complete with adjustments to the game's modes and battle system, as well as a new limited-time mode (although that technically hasn't arrived yet).</p>

<p>Somewhat confusingly, in the update's official <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/dragon-ball/news/update-dragon-ball-sparking-zero-changes-and-adjustments-features-and-battle" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">patch notes</a>, Bandai Namco says the Legendary Warrior Face-Off mode "has been added for a limited time", but players are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SparkingZero/comments/1i6498f/where_is_the_new_gamemode_at/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">reporting</a> that they're <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SparkingZero/comments/1i6446m/so_how_can_i_access_legendary_warrior_faceoff/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">unable</a> to access it, even though the update has been applied.</p>

<p>However, other players are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SparkingZero/comments/1i6498f/comment/m8940nx/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">speculating</a>&nbsp;that the new mode will arrive alongside the game's first major DLC, which is currently available for those who forked out for 72 hours' access but which is not on general release yet. It's set to arrive later this week.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-update-new-mode-gamma.jpg?itok=HD1MeMgG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-update-new-mode-gamma.jpg?itok=RPGUa0zH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The new&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero&nbsp;</em>mode will probably arrive later this week alongside the game's first DLC.</figcaption></figure><p>Per a <a href="https://x.com/BandaiNamcoUS/status/1880255701613711711" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on Bandai Namco's X page (which also doesn't confirm the release date for the mode), Legendary Warrior Face-Off will allow you to "challenge yourself against characters with sky-high power levels", with the first being iconic Saiyan Broly.</p>

<p>The patch notes clarify that you "cannot select this mode outside of the period" during which it's available, although rather unhelpfully, that period isn't specified.</p>

<p>The wording of Bandai Namco's post, however, suggests that there will be other warriors against whom you can face off, so presumably, this mode will cycle in and out periodically, offering different characters to fight.</p>

<p>As for&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero</em>'s first DLC, that's due out on January 24th, so that's probably also when Legendary Warrior Face-Off will become available. The "Hero of Justice" pack adds a number of new characters, including the likes of Gamma, new Gohan variants, and more.</p>




<p><em>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero&nbsp;</em>is the latest game in the&nbsp;<em>Budokai Tenkaichi&nbsp;</em>sub-series of&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball&nbsp;</em>games and the first to bear the series' original Japanese name in the West.</p>

<p>The game launched in October to the&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball&nbsp;</em>series' <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-series-best-steam-debut" rel="nofollow">best Steam debut ever</a>, going on to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-sales-3m" rel="nofollow">sell three million copies</a> across all platforms within its first day on sale.</p>

I’m particularly intrigued by the Radiant Night outfit as it looks like as a high-fashion version of <em>Resident Evil VII</em>’s Lady Dimitrescu.</p><p>Check it out as the website also has codes players can use to redeem helpful in-game items.<em> Infinity Nikki</em> has also released a trailer for the update showing off the Firework Isles, the new location that will be available during the season. Expect the the area to be chock full of scenic vistas for stylists to take their best pictures including a magical horse-drawn carriage that zooms through the sky.</p><p>The game’s also adding a new boss encounter, The Dark Bouquet, which will probably be added to the Realm of the Dark boss list for players to challenge weekly. The <em>Infinity Nikki</em> soundtrack is also launching on select music platforms which is a welcome development considering some of those tracks — especially the one for the Ghost Train dungeon — are incredibly funky for a generally lighthearted dress-up game. Fireworks Season starts January 23rd and lasts until February 25th.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-finally-reveals-its-next-gen-console-confirms-switch-2-name">announcement of a new Nintendo console</a>. The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tiktok-is-back-online-in-the-us-after-being-officially-banned-on-january-18">death and resurrection of TikTok</a>. And now, a new Grand Theft Auto VI Trailer 2 release date theory.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This one (believe it or not there are more than a few GTA 6 theories doing the rounds) was sparked into life by <a href="https://x.com/RockstarGames/status/1879925333790539845" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">another seemingly innocuous GTA Online promo tweet by Rockstar Games</a>. “Claim a free Vapid Dominator GT muscle car and more with GTA+,” the tweet reads. “Members also earn bonuses on Priority FIB Files and Terrorbyte Client Missions, save with Arcade Property discounts, and much more.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What information-starved GTA fans were most interested in, however, was the accompanying image, which includes a shot of a metal shipping container with a series of numbers printed on its side. One number is singled out with a slightly enlarged font and a rectangle around it: 2.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/21/gta-main-1737468480158.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The numbers Mason, what do they mean?! Image credit: Rockstar Games.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s all it took for eagle-eyed obsessives to set off on yet another GTA 6 theory brainstorm. The 2 must be a reference to GTA 6 Trailer 2, right? But what if you add up all the other numbers? Does that mean anything?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">X/Twitter account <a href="https://x.com/GTA6Plus" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@GTA6Plus</a> did the math and came up with the number 30. "They made sure to include the numbers in the post," GTA6Plus insisted. "They have to mean something."

It turns out the release dates for both Red Dead Redemption 2 and Grand Theft Auto V were announced on a Thursday. January 30, 2025 is a Thursday. Coincidence?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans have also pointed out that Rockstar parent company Take-Two is set to release its next set of financial results on February 6, so a release date announcement as part of a new trailer beforehand might make sense.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve been here before, of course. Multiple times. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-rockstar-officially-unveils-first-trailer-early-after-leak"><u>Rockstar released GTA 6 Trailer 1 to record-breaking viewership</u></a> in December 2023, but it hasn’t released a single asset in the 13 months since. The year-long wait for more information has fueled increasingly bizarre conspiracy theories about when Rockstar will release GTA 6 Trailer 2. These have included <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/on-the-gta-6-trailers-1-year-anniversary-fans-are-debating-youtube-playlist-updates-and-batting-away-misleading-ai-generated-images"><u>counting the holes in Lucia’s cell door net</u></a>, the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/were-now-at-the-bullet-holes-and-braille-stage-of-gta-6-fan-theory"><u>bullet holes in the car from Trailer 1</u></a>, and even analyzing registration plates. But chief among the conspiracy theories is GTA 6’s ongoing moon watch, which was, remarkably, proven to have accurately predicted the date Rockstar announced when it would release GTA 6 Trailer 1 last December, but <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-community-devastated-by-gta-6-trailer-announcement-no-show-after-moon-theory-proved-incorrect"><u>debunked as a hint at the release date for Trailer 2</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Crazy? <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rockstar-could-easily-announce-the-gta-6-trailer-2-release-date-but-its-staying-quiet-on-purpose-because-its-a-really-good-marketing-tactic-ex-dev-says">One former developer at Rockstar recently expressed his delight at the many wild conspiracy theories surrounding GTA 6</a>, insisting staff at the studio will be enjoying watching the community go off the deep end.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It <em>is</em> remarkable that Rockstar has gone a year without following up GTA 6 Trailer 1 with any new information at all.

                <p>One of the first executive orders that President Trump discussed on Monday after his inauguration was a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-energy-economy-inflation-ev-oil-gas-00be8d3d5216a328e129666032c889e1" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">new 25% tariff for Mexico and Canada that is expected to become effective February 1</a>. A good amount of production infrastructure for video game discs happens in Mexico, so what's the effect going to be for the end consumer? No one knows yet. And who knows if the order will even happen. But Circana analyst Mat Piscatella has now shared his thoughts on how the new tariffs could impact people who play video games, and he's expecting higher prices overall.</p><p>Posting on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lgb3euyyik2e" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">social media</a>, Piscatella said he expects to see a "sharp downtick" in the number of disc-based games that are released in the US, given that "much of that production infrastructure" is in Mexico. If companies still go ahead with making discs, then consumers can expect higher prices, he said. And not just for physical discs. Piscatella said he expects digital game prices to go up as well.</p><p>A digital game has no disc, of course, but companies may want to retain price parity all the same between physical and digital in the event of tariff-driven price increases, Piscatella said. He added that he doesn't know how this will all actually shake out and is only theorizing for now. However, he said, "None of this is good for the physical video game market."</p><p>Piscatella added that US-based video game companies could shift production out of Mexico and into the US, but not without "significant investment." That's probably not going to happen, in part because spending on physical games in the US is already half of what it was in 2021 and continues to decline "rapidly," Piscatella said.</p><p>Trump has also suggested he could implement a 60% tariff on goods from China, which could have significant ramifications on video games and video game hardware. But <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/will-trumps-tariffs-raise-video-game-and-console-prices-heres-what-we-know/1100-6528381/" data-ref-id="1100-6528381">many question if that's even feasible or likely to happen</a>.</p><p>Beyond video game price increases tied to potential tariffs, some in the video game business are wondering if <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-costing-as-much-as-100-could-help-video-game-industry-rebound-in-2025-analyst-says/1100-6528832/" data-ref-id="1100-6528832">GTA 6 could trigger a new industry-wide price increase on the MSRP for games, potentially up to $80 or above.</a> The most recent price increase from $60 to $70 was <a href="https://x.com/ballmatthew/status/1881071892557410389" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">embraced without issue</a>, experts say, and another increase could follow.</p>

            <p>If you fancy kicking off the new year with another Xbox controller variant, good news. Microsoft has revealed the latest edition to its Cipher family of controllers, and this one comes in a bright red hue.</p>
<p>The Pulse Cipher Special Edition features a translucent top case, so you can see the controller's inner workings. It follows the same overall design as Xbox's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-is-going-a-bit-90s-with-its-new-transparent-blue-sky-cipher-controller">Sky Cipher</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-unveils-ghost-cipher-special-edition-wireless-controller">Ghost Cipher</a> models, but with a different colour palette. It features a colour palette where "modern gaming meets enduring nostalgia", Xbox said.</p>
<p>You can see how it looks - front and back - in the image below.</p>

<p>The red Pulse Cipher Special Edition is available to pre-order today ahead of its launch on 4th February, priced <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/accessories/controllers/pulse-cipher-special-edition">£70</a>.</p>
<p>In September of last year, Microsoft also revealed some transparent Cipher Series top cases, along with some chromatic D-pad and paddles, for its Elite Series 2 controllers. These top cases are inspired by the "translucent tech of the '90s and early 2000s", and are available via <a href="https://xboxdesignlab.xbox.com/en-gb/configure/xbox-elite-wireless-controller-series-2">Xbox Design Lab</a>.</p><p>Elsewhere in Microsoft news, later this week the company is hosting an Xbox Developer Direct showcase. Things will kick off at 6pm UK time (that's 1pm Eastern or 10am Pacific) on Thursday, 23rd January, with Microsoft promising us a look at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-announces-xbox-developer-direct">Doom: The Dark Ages, South of Midnight, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 and a mystery fourth game</a> from an unknown studio.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/switch-2-release-likely-between-april-and-september-says-nacon.1087710/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/switch-2-release-april-september-nacon<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nacon, the company behind the likes of&nbsp;<em>Test Drive Unlimited: Solar Crown&nbsp;</em>and <i>GreedFall 2</i>, has released a new financial statement, and it contains a prediction regarding the Switch 2 launch window.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://corporate.nacongaming.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/CP_Nacon_CA-T3-2024-25-Diffusion-English.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">statement</a>&nbsp;covers the period between April and December last year, during which time Nacon's consolidated sales rose by 2.5%, driven mainly by its non-gaming ventures. The company's gaming business fell by 4.6% in that nine-month period when compared to last year.</p>

<p>Later in the statement, Nacon looks ahead to the first half of the next fiscal year, during which the company says it anticipates "the arrival of the Nintendo Switch 2 console". Nacon also says it "already has compatible games and a full range of accessories" for that console.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-release-window-nacon-prediction-dock.jpg?itok=PaZsI9mZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-release-window-nacon-prediction-dock.jpg?itok=QgRbPPmN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Nacon reckons the Switch 2 will launch between April and September this year.</figcaption></figure><p>Just as a reminder, since the financial year begins for Nacon in April, that means the company anticipates the release of the Switch 2 sometime between April and September.</p>

<p>Given that we know a Nintendo Direct presentation is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-officially-announced" rel="nofollow">due to air on April 2nd</a>, this release window timing, which is admittedly rather broad, would make a lot of sense. If I had to guess, I'd put the release in June, although that's just a gut feeling.</p>

<p>When Nacon says it already has games and accessories ready to go for the Nintendo Switch 2, the company is referring to a range of Switch 2 accessories it <a href="https://x.com/Nacon/status/1879938882244088080" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">unveiled last week</a>, including cases, controller housings, and more.</p>

<p>On the game front, while Nacon may well be referring to some of the games on its upcoming slate, it could also be pointing to the range of games it's already released for the Switch, since the new console will <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-successor-will-be-backwards-compatible" rel="nofollow">largely be backwards compatible</a> with the original.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nacon-nintendo-switch-2-prediction-ravenswatch.jpg?itok=Dm4gaf5r 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nacon-nintendo-switch-2-prediction-ravenswatch.jpg?itok=KSt-3P9T 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Nacon's range of Switch games (and, therefore, Switch 2 games as well) includes action roguelike&nbsp;<em>Ravenswatch</em>, plus many others.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, given that Nacon also says it has "around 10 new games" in its pipeline, it could well be referring to those as well.</p>

<p>The studio is set to reveal "the main ones" in that lineup during this year's Nacon Connect event, which will take place on March 6th. Previous Nacon Connect events gave us reveals for the likes of&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nacon-connect-2023" rel="nofollow">RoboCop: Rogue City</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/terminator-survivors-and-more-unveiled-at-nacon-connect" rel="nofollow"><em>Terminator: Survivors</em></a>, among others.</p>

<p>Reflector Entertainment, the developer behind Unknown 9: Awakening, is the latest studio to be hit by layoffs. The news comes after what its CEO calls the “failure” of the game.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/reflector-entertainment_activity-7287227402995269633-s4i-/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">lengthy statement</a> posted on LinkedIn, CEO Herve Hoerdt said that he made a decision to “not greenlight further work on a future project that was in the conceptualization phase and thus terminating this development line”. This decision, he says, wouldn’t have been sustainable for the company and, with it, comes layoffs.</p>



<p>“This decision correlates directly with the failure of the studio’s ambitious and courageous first project, a new IP with a rich transmedia universe,” Hoerdt said. “The performance of the release didn’t come near the company expectations, after numerous timeline adjustments and investments, both financially and other, and didn’t warrant any further exploration in this universe.”</p>



<p>Hoerdt added that the decision will also affect back-office staff as the studio moves its support teams to be inline with a “single project approach the studio will adopt for the imminent future.” </p>



<p>“Where possible, staff will be assigned to this project, based on an existing Bandai Namco IP, which is shaping up very well,” he said.</p>



<p>Hoerdt closed his statement by saying that those impacted will receive severance packages, health benefits, mental health support, and more.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Reflector Entertainment for clarification on the number of people let go in the layoffs. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story.</p>

<p>Sniper Elite Resistance is the latest sniper-centric release casting us into the heart of World War Two. It carries on a lot of the good work of the previous iteration and we’ve rounded up the crucial release details.</p>



<p>Rebellion Developments (more commonly known as Rebellion) has developed and published numerous games since 1991. But the Sniper Elite series has become one of its biggest hits in the last 10 years. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sniper-elite-resistance-revealed-at-gamescom-opening-night-live/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sniper Elite Resistance</a> is a continuation of the refined and reliably violent stealth shooter. I say stealth, knowing full well many of my missions over the years have descended into unbridled chaos.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, 2025’s Sniper Elite Resistance presents another war-torn power struggle with a new marksman at the lens. Here’s everything we know including its release date, price point, and platforms. </p>

<p><strong>Sniper Elite Resistance has a January 30 release date.</strong></p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/biggest-games-releasing-in-january-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">biggest games in January 2025</a> haven’t set the world alight. But Resistance is looking to be the bright spark that adds a bit of warmth and character to the year’s beginning. Who doesn’t want the searing heat and intensity of a whirring Sniper Rifle bullet whistling into their chest?</p>



<h2 id="h-sniper-elite-resistance-release-time">Sniper Elite Resistance Release Time</h2>



<p><strong>Until Rebellion says otherwise, we’re likely locking and loading for a midnight launch for Sniper Elite Resistance.</strong></p>



<p>Special launch times are sometimes issued for releases—deviating from the norm. But it’s looking like a basic midnight launch window for <a href="https://sniperelite.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Sniper Elite Resistance</a>. This means Rebellion’s newest shooter has the same start time, but where you live dictates how long it is until you get to sample the sniping for yourself.</p>



<p>New Zealand residents always get midnight launches first because of time zones. Releasing at the same time in every country isn’t common, and I don’t expect it to be the case here. </p>



<h2 id="h-sniper-elite-resistance-platforms">Sniper Elite Resistance Platforms</h2>



<p><strong>PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC are the main platforms for Sniper Elite Resistance.</strong></p>



<p>I’m quite surprised to see the continued support for old-gen consoles. This is good news for everyone as it allows more players to try out Resistance, and gives the release every chance to maximize its success. I think we call this a (fitting) bullseye.</p>



<h2 id="h-sniper-elite-resistance-price">Sniper Elite Resistance Price</h2>



<p><strong>Sniper Elite Resistance retails at $59.99 or £54.99 for the Standard Edition, and $89.99 or £73.99 for the Deluxe Edition.</strong></p>



<p>If you buy physical editions of games, you’re unlikely to pay this much. <strong>Various retailers are bound to offer it much cheaper</strong>, and the good news is the Deluxe Edition isn’t a digital exclusive—depending on how keen you are for more content.</p>



<h2 id="h-sniper-elite-resistance-editions">Sniper Elite Resistance Editions</h2>



<p><strong>You can buy a Standard or Deluxe Edition for Sniper Elite Resistance.</strong></p>



<p>Unfortunately, there’s no Collector’s Edition for die-hard fans. If you’re a long-time fan desperate for a replica Sniper Elite Rifle or a bizarre, lifesize eye replica—I’ve seen more unusual items in Collector’s Editions—you’re out of luck. </p>

<p>How long have you been a fan of the Sniper Elite franchise? Could Resistance be the finest release yet?</p>

                <p>After Marvel Snap was unexpectedly taken offline in the US due to the TikTok ban, developer Second Dinner has announced that the game is back online, and is taking steps to avoid future situations like this.</p><p>"Marvel Snap is back online in the US, but to make sure this NEVER happens again, we’re working to bring more services in-house and partner with a new publisher.

Due to the issue, players have been missing out on time-based content such as daily login rewards and missions. Second Dinner has already committed to making sure players that have been affected will be compensated, but the details have not been revealed yet.</p><p>Furthermore, the game was also removed from app stores, and Second Dinner is working on getting it restored. While in-app purchases remain unavailable, web-shop purchases are still working, and the team is looking to fix the issue.</p><p>When TikTok briefly went offline on January 19, so did Marvel Snap, due to its publisher, Nuverse, being a part of TikTok parent company Bytedance (although <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-snap-publisher-suffers-layoffs-could-shut-down-report/1100-6519484/" data-ref-id="1100-6519484">Nuverse had already divested from Bytedance</a>). However, President Donald Trump <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/20/tech/tiktok-future-donald-trump-ban-sale/index.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">signed an executive action that delayed TikTok's ban for 75 days</a>. Second Dinner is presumably looking for a new publisher in the meantime so Marvel Snap isn't at risk of being banned again in case the TikTok ban delay expires.</p>
