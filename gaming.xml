			<p>When Cyberpunk 2077 was yet to be released, CD Projekt RED planned at least two major DLCs for the game, just like with The Witcher III: Wild Hunt, which received the widely acclaimed expansions Hearts of Stone and Blood and Wine.</p>
<p>However, Cyberpunk 2077 shipped in a way buggier state than The Witcher III: Wild Hunt. On previous generation consoles like PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, the game's state was even more dire, requiring a lot of work from the developer to bring the level of polish that users had come to expect from CD Projekt RED.</p>
<p>That was a major reason behind the studio's decision to ultimately produce only one big DLC, Phantom Liberty, which launched in September 2023. Phantom Liberty was a resounding success, helping uplift the overall perception of Cyberpunk 2077 as a whole. Here's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-shiny-firmware-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">what I wrote back then</a>:</p>
<p><em>Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty builds upon what was an already great game to deliver more fantastic storytelling (with a spy thriller theme, this time around), exciting combat, and very high-quality side content. The perk tree overhaul is a major improvement to progression, and additions like vehicle combat and the overhauled police system are very welcome</em></p>
<p>Phantom Liberty sold exceedingly well, too. Just a few days ago, CD Projekt RED <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2-is-in-pre-production-phantom-liberty-has-sold-10-million-units-the-witcher-3-60-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> that the Cyberpunk 2077 expansion surpassed 10 million units sold to date.</p>
<p>Perhaps that's why the studio appears to be working on some additional DLC for the game. Some fans on Reddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/1l2x5z2/new_cyberpunk_dlc_being_written_and_developed_by/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discovered</a> the info from the LinkedIn profile of a Senior Writer at Virtuos (the company behind The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered and Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater):</p>
<p><em>• Analyzed existing Cyberpunk 2077 character voices to inform writing their dialogue in multiple new side quests. </em><br>
<em>• Coordinated with the Narrative Designer to conceive, write, and polish side quests for upcoming DLC releases. </em><br>
<em>• Worked with the English Adaptation Specialist to ensure all in-game dialogue and text adhered to English/American and Cyberpunk standards using Red Engine tools. </em></p>
<p>To be clear, though, it is unlikely that this DLC would be something even remotely as large as Phantom Liberty. More likely is a bundle of new DLC missions, or perhaps even a tie-in of sorts with another Cyberpunk 2077-themed Netflix anime following Edgerunners.</p>
<p>Whatever the case, we'll be sure to report any further evidence of a new DLC that arises.</p>

Last year, CD Projekt Red released their final update for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>. Version 2.2 of the game added in fixes, a few more customisation options for you and your trusty steed (car), alongside some secrets. This version itself got patched with a few more fixes, but 2.2 was meant to be the last big one. Turns out, they lied! As in a stream held earlier today mostly to do with that new video game console that just came out with the kart driving plumber on it (more like Switch 2 another channel, am I right), <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/cd-projekt-red">CD Projekt Red</a> shared that a 2.3 version is on the way to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world game</a> later this month.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Global community director at CD Projekt Red Marcin Momot <a href="https://x.com/Marcin360/status/1930653122650579400">took to Jitter</a> to share that the team is "not done yet! Stay tuned for more info about the next Cyberpunk 2077 update coming later this month. We’ll start spilling the beans closer to the release of patch 2.3 (that’s its name), so for now, we ask for a bit more patience. Let the team cook!"

<p>
Details were very scarce with this update, but it is coming June 26th, a few weeks away. Associate game director Pawel Sasko <a href="https://x.com/PaweSasko/status/1930657862054707704">also said</a> that he's "taking care of the update personally" and that more details will be coming when they're ready to be shared.
</p>
<p>
I wouldn't expect anything massive, it'll probably be similar to what 2.2 offered, especially because CD Projekt Red are all in on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a> right now - they even showed off an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-witcher-4-shows-off-a-swanky-ue5-tech-demo-at-state-of-unreal-2025-with-ciri-hunting-monsters-and-visiting-circuses-in-kovir">Unreal Engine 5 tech demo of that one</a>. Really excited for all the side by side comparisons when the game comes out captioned "what a downgrade". <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077s-sequel-is-now-cyberpunk-2-and-is-therefore-about-burial-mounds-bows-and-pottery">Cyberpunk 2 is in pre-production now too</a>, that's its name now by the way, but again, don't expect much from that for a while either. Just keep your expectations low in general actually, they probably won't be met.

<p>But this kind of online gaming moderation is typically designed for situations where players could be exposed to random strangers in online matches. Nintendo's GameChat is already strictly limited to users whom players have manually added as friends on their system, who would be the only ones able to send a report of bad behavior to Nintendo. GameChat users also have to confirm a phone number matching the one on their Nintendo account for added identification purposes.</p>

<p>Nintendo also goes to extra lengths to ensure parents are informed when it comes to minors using GameChat. If a Switch 2 system has accounts for both an adult and a minor, the GameChat setup requires the adult to <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/mobile-apps/parental-controls/?srsltid=AfmBOooJWfbrQwaOeC16VIyZLs5_iPR0NboxtHDQ9c4UMZIN7TVWTxKV">download the Nintendo Parental Controls app</a> to a smartphone and sync it to the console with a code. Setting up that app gives parents the option to approve all new friends added to the child's account and even to require explicit permission through the app when the child wants to use video chat.</p>
<p>Overall, the time-limited, local-unless-reported recordings Nintendo makes here seem like a minimal intrusion on the average GameChat user's privacy. Still, if you're paranoid about Nintendo potentially seeing and hearing what's going on in your living room, it's good to at least be aware of it.</p>
<p>Below, we've copied the full text of the relevant sections of the GameChat Terms (as of June 5, 2025), which currently don't seem to be available for viewing anywhere aside from the Switch 2 consoles themselves, as far as we can tell.</p>
<blockquote><p>GameChat allows players to enjoy voice or video chat with friends while playing on Nintendo Switch 2 (video chat requires a separately sold USB camera). Use of GameChat is subject to the Nintendo Account User Agreement, including our Community Guidelines, which can be found on our website. Please familiarize yourself with our Community Guidelines, which outline our expectations for behavior while using our products and services. Your contribution to creating a positive online experience plays an important role in Nintendo's online community. If a GameChat session violates the Nintendo Account User Agreement, users involved may have their access to online play, including but not limited to GameChat, restricted.</p>
<p><strong>Your chat is recorded</strong></p>
<p>To support our ability to uphold our Community Guidelines, chat content, including your audio and voice chat, is recorded and stored temporarily on your system, and on the systems of others you chat with. If an interaction that violates our Community Guidelines occurs, report it to us. We encourage you to report all violations immediately when they occur. To report chat content during a GameChat session, press the C Button to select the person you would like to report. If you prefer to submit a report after a GameChat session ends, press the C Button, open the Settings menu, select Report, and follow the on-screen instructions. You can review a recording of the last three minutes of the latest three GameChat sessions and select the portion of the recording to be highlighted for review. These recordings are available only if the report is submitted within 24 hours.</p>
<p><strong>We review reported chats to uphold our Community Guidelines</strong></p>
<p>When a GameChat session is reported, the recorded chat content and other information on the GameChat session (e.g., the time and date of the chat, camera usage, and traffic details) will be transmitted to our server. Nintendo may access and review the reported information for violations against the Nintendo Account User Agreement and the Community Guidelines. We will base this review primarily on the submitted information, but may also consider the past review history of the reported user(s) and the reporting user, their report history and information related to their Nintendo Account. We may disclose certain information to third parties, such as authorities, courts, lawyers, or subcontractors reviewing the reported chats. The purpose of our review is to protect GameChat users, especially minors, and to enforce our Nintendo Account Use Agreement to maintain a safe and family-friendly online environment.</p>
<p><strong>Withdrawal of your consent</strong></p>
<p>You can withdraw your consent at any time in the GameChat settings (under GameChat Terms), without affecting the lawfulness of our handling and processing of recordings or chat content created before the withdrawal. Once you withdraw your consent, GameChat will no longer be available to you. Please note that any chat content recorded prior to your withdrawal may still be reported by other users and reviewed by us.</p></blockquote>

Why, though? I asked Walmart.</p><p>A Walmart spokesperson told Aftermath that this was, indeed, an intentional companywide effort, rather than a cheeky instance of a few stores going rogue. They said Coke and Pringles were “included in all deliveries” for the purpose of creating a “feel-good moment.” Though the rep did not specifically mention <a href="https://www.cbr.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent Switch 2 preorder cancellation woes</a>, one could surmise that Walmart might have felt more pressure to create a feel-good moment than usual.</p><p>Why Coke and Pringles specifically, though? No matter how widespread gaming becomes, Gamers – as a singular monolith and, of course, voting block – will never be able to shake certain stereotypes.</p><p>"We kinda know the stereotypical gamer, and of course they're gonna need snacks while they game," the Walmart rep told Aftermath.</p><p>All people who play games are not created equal – especially the wider-than-average audience that buys Nintendo products. There is a world in which some Switch 2 earlybirds might have preferred carrot sticks and sparkling water, and though the latter would make them reprehensible to me, personally, we have to respect that. However, by the same token, I doubt anyone has ever been upset to receive free chips and soda, so whatever. At least Walmart did not send them <a href="https://kotaku.com/i-ate-the-giant-game-controller-gummy-and-i-felt-like-1846282889" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one of these things</a>.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/sony-fight-stick-project-defiant-announced"><h3>I Need To Know If Sony’s Fight Stick Is Good Or Not</h3></a><p>Along with a new game from Arc System Works, Sony's announced their first fight stick code-named Project Defiant.

Wargaming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/world-of-tanks-dev-calls-on-fans-to-help-buy-ambulances-for-ukraine-with-new-charity-bundles/1100-6518517/" data-ref-id="1100-6518517">has also raised money in support of Ukraine</a>, which would be a crime under current Russian law. Lesta Games--which took over the local Russian rights for World of Tanks--has repeatedly stressed that it has no relationship with Wargaming. That wasn't enough to prevent Russia from seizing control of Lesta Games.</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/mmo/russia-assures-world-of-tanks-players-they-wont-end-up-in-prison-as-it-takes-full-control-of-the-studio-in-charge-of-it-domestically-accusing-it-of-funnelling-funds-to-ukraine/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>, Moscow has frozen all assets that belong to Lesta Games, and accused the company's co-founder, Malik Khatazhaev, of being part of an "extremist group" under the control of Wargaming CEO Viktor Kisly. The evidence cited in court reportedly drew upon footage of Wargaming's support for Ukraine.</p><p>Russian media is reportedly telling World of Tanks players in the country that they won't be arrested for spending money on the game that might have gone to Ukraine. Duma's Information Technology Committee's deputy chairman, Anton Gorelkin, also told players that Lesta Games' assets will likely be handed over to "a specialized Russian company."</p><p>It bears repeating that the World of Tanks game rights in Russia are only limited to that country. Wargaming still has its World of Tanks assets and rights in other countries. Lesta Games isn't the only video game developer to be affected by the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. Developer GSC Game World continued to develop <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl/" data-ref-id="5000-82469">Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl</a> even as some of the devs either fled the country or remained to fight.

			<p>The next three free games on the<a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/deathloop"> Epic Game Store</a> have been revealed, and this time the list includes Arkane Lyon's latest game,<a href="https://wccftech.com/deathloop-and-dishonored-are-set-in-the-same-universe-dev-confirms/"> Deathloop</a>.</p>
<p>Ogu and the Secret Forest from Sinkhole Studio and Moonlab Studio is the other game, along with Deathloop, that's available to redeem from now until next week on <strong>June 12, 2025</strong>, before Two Point Hospital is the following free game players can pick up from <strong>June 12-19.</strong></p>
<p>Deathloop is the most recent release from beloved studio Arkane Lyon, the team behind Dishonored. It's also the last game <a href="https://wccftech.com/deathloop-director-arkane-austin-closure-gut-stab-redfall-development-ceases/">Arkane Lyon fully worked on in collaboration</a> with their sister studio, Arkane Austin. The Austin-based division, the team that led development on Prey, was also the team to lead development on <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-redfall-refunds/">Redfall</a>. After the vampire shooter failed, <a href="https://wccftech.com/arkane-austin-studio-director-gives-emotional-goodbye-to-colleagues-wonders-about-the-sweet-spot-team-size/">Microsoft shut the Austin team down and laid everyone off</a>.</p>
<p>Deathloop, Ogu, and Two Point Hospital replace Tiny Tina's Wonderland and Limbo, which were free for the past week, and are the last free games for the <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-store-2025-mega-sale-live-now-dead-island-2-available-for-free/">Epic Games Store 2025 Mega Sale</a>, before Epic goes back to its regular cadence of free games.</p>
<p>Since the sale began on May 15, Epic has given away nine games, including today's new freebies. Here's the full list of what you could have grabbed since last month, with only the bottom two available now until June 12.</p>
<ul>
<li>Limbo</li>
<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tiny-tinas-wonderlands/">Tiny Tina's Wonderland</a></li>

All in all, it was a solid showcase. But throughout, I noticed that a <em>lot </em>of games were getting September or early October release dates announced. It seems that after <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/grand-theft-auto-6-gta-vi-new-trailer-gameplay-story-1851779368&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/grand-theft-auto-6-gta-vi-new-trailer-gameplay-story-1851779368"><em>GTA 6</em></a></span>, which was previously expected to arrive in that time frame, recently <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gta6-grand-theft-auto-6-release-date-delay-may-2026-1851778799?_gl=1*1t8rgtv*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDkxNDcxMzYkbzEyMSRnMCR0MTc0OTE0NzEzOSRqNTckbDAkaDA.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gta6-grand-theft-auto-6-release-date-delay-may-2026-1851778799?_gl=1*1t8rgtv*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDkxNDcxMzYkbzEyMSRnMCR0MTc0OTE0NzEzOSRqNTckbDAkaDA.">got delayed until May 2026</a></span>, everyone is feeling more comfortable launching a game in late summer or early fall. However, this is leading to a jam-packed September. </p><p>Here’s every game that got a  September or October release date announced during State of Play: </p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><em>Hirogami </em>- September 3</li><li><em>Baby Steps </em>- September 8</li><li><em>Silent Hill F </em>- September 25</li><li><em>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</em> - September 30</li><li><em>Digimon Story Time Stranger </em>- October 3</li></ul></blockquote><p>It’s very likely that at least some of these games were slated to launch in September or October even before <em>GTA 6 </em>was delayed. And perhaps some of them would have still launched in that timeframe even if <em>GTA 6</em> didn’t get pushed back into 2026. But I also suspect that at least one or two of these games were likely to get pushed back to avoid Rockstar’s open-world behemoth. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gta-6-delay-bloomberg-chaos-ea-battlefield-publishers-1851780047&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-delay-bloomberg-chaos-ea-battlefield-publishers-1851780047">But now that it’s gone from 2025, they can stick to the plan</a></span>, and everyone can publicly lock down a date in late summer/early fall. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gta-6-release-october-borderlands-4-take-two-rockstar-1851764006&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-release-october-borderlands-4-take-two-rockstar-1851764006">It was reported in February</a></span> that “everyone” in the game industry was waiting for Rockstar to announce a <em>GTA 6 </em>date. And when <em>Borderlands 4</em>'s September release date was announced by 2K Games and Gearbox earlier this year, that provided the first clue that it might be safe to drop your game in that timeframe. Take-Two owns both Rockstar and 2K Games. Now, everyone knows for certain that the last few months of 2025 are open for business, and that’s led to a log jam forming in September. </p><p>Here are just some of the games launching in September. Keep in mind some of these dates were announced before the delay:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><em>Hirogami </em>- September 3</li><li><em>Hell Is Us</em> - September 4</li><li><em>Everybody’s Golf: Hot Shots</em> - September 5</li><li><em>Daemon X Machina Titanic Scion</em> - September 5</li><li><em>Terminator 2D No Fate </em>- September 5</li><li><em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> (Switch 2 port) - September 5</li><li><em>Baby Steps </em>- September 8</li><li><em>Borderlands 4</em> - September 12</li><li><em>Marathon </em>- September 23</li><li><em>Silent Hill F </em>- September 25</li><li><em>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</em> - September 30</li></ul></blockquote><p>Yowza, that’s a lot of games! And I wouldn’t be surprised if a few more big games arrive in September as we get more release dates during this year’s ongoing Not-E3 / Summer Game Fest season.

While the enhanced version’s director, Kazutoyo Maehiro, spoke about new features, and art director Hiroshi Minagawa spoke about pixel art sprites and 3D polygons, Matsuno—who is returning to re-edit the script and provide additional dialogue—drew out <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em>’ political parallels to the modern world. At one end is an entrenched underclass and at the other are those in power who exploit them for their own gain. </p><p>“And now, in 2025—a time when inequality and division are still deeply rooted in our society—I offer this story once again,” he wrote. “The will to resist is in your hands.” Resist what, exactly? Matsuno doesn’t say. But it’s not hard to guess: bigotry, demagoguery, authoritarianism. <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> is an incredibly complex and fun strategy game to unravel, but it’s also an eye-opening look at ideological capture and how it prevents people from imagining a better world, let alone fighting to bring it about. </p><p>This has given rise to all sorts of memes about political radicalization which, as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://aftermath.site/penality-crime-fine-final-fantasy-tactics&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://aftermath.site/penality-crime-fine-final-fantasy-tactics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Aftermath </em>previously reported</a></span>, even led to made-up <em>Final Fantasy Tactics </em>quotes that felt so aligned with the core theses of the game that people just started pretending like they were actually from the game. “If the penalty for a crime is a fine, then that law only exists for the lower class,” reads the most famous one, which is exactly the kind of thing a <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> character would say before they make a deal with the devil and then beat your ass in one of the most <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/finalfantasytactics/comments/c5mqb7/how_did_you_beat_wiegraf/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/finalfantasytactics/comments/c5mqb7/how_did_you_beat_wiegraf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">unfair fights</a></span> in all of gaming. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/why-everybody-loves-final-fantasy-tactics-5973196&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/why-everybody-loves-final-fantasy-tactics-5973196">One of <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em>’ best tricks</a></span>, though, is how it avoids the pitfalls of sounding preachy or didactic. It’s about big ideas and weight problems, but they’re always viewed through the prism of authentically realized characters who get swept up by the churn of history just like everyone else. “It was a story of a peculiar destiny, in which friendship and betrayal intertwine,” Matsuno wrote this week. I can’t wait for new players to get to experience that deftly spun tale later this year, and also see what subtle new turns he may have added as part of the remaster. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/4-upgraded-sega-games-on-the-nintendo-switch-2<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The day has finally arrived — the Nintendo Switch 2 is here! Unless you’ve been living under a rock, you probably already know that. What you might not know is that Sega has four games coming to the console, three of which are available now and one with a release date fast approaching.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This <a href="https://www.sega.com/nintendo-switch-2" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>batch of games</u></a> brings some titles to the Switch for the first time and covers a range of genres. From pure action to platforming to puzzles, there’s a little something for everyone, whether you’re a solo gamer or want something to play with friends. If you’re one of the many people who has a shiny new Switch 2, here are some options to get the most out of it.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/31/switch-2-pre-order-970x250-english-updated-1748650575893.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Yakuza 0 Director’s Cut</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">This is the definitive edition of the Yakuza series’ origin story, loaded with new content that makes it a standout of the Switch 2’s third-party launch lineup. If you’ve never had the chance to dive into the Yakuza series, this is the best starting point.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You play as yakuza Kazuma Kiryu and former yakuza (also current cabaret club manager) Goro Majima in a crime drama exploring the decadence and danger of 1988 Japan. Both characters have three unique fighting styles that you can switch between on the fly while making use of your surroundings by turning street signs, bicycles, motorcycles, and traffic cones into makeshift weapons.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But Yakuza 0 isn’t all about cracking skulls. When you want to take a break from fighting, you can live it up on the neon-lit streets of Japan and enjoy a variety of optional side content: over-the-top substories, karaoke and dancing rhythm games, bowling, and even a full-blown retro Sega arcade.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Director’s Cut adds English voice acting and more than 25 minutes of new cutscenes, providing deeper insight into character backstories and key moments of the main story. It also adds a new online mode called Red Light Raid, where you can join forces with up to three teammates to take on hordes of enemies while fighting the clock to face down a final boss. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Defeating enemies and winning raids gets you money to unlock and upgrade characters — there are 60 in all, each with their own health, defense, and attack stats. An online leaderboard will track your lifetime earnings, so you and your friends can fight your way to the top.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yakuza 0 Director’s Cut is available now for the Switch 2. For more info and trailers, visit <a href="https://www.sega.com/like-a-dragon-yakuza/yakuza-0-directors-cut" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>the official website</u></a>.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Raidou Remastered: The Mystery of the Soulless Army</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">This is a remastered version of the 2006 action RPG that’s part of the Devil Summoner series, a spinoff from Shin Megami Tensei, and it marks Raidou’s debut on a Nintendo console. You play as a demon-summoning detective protecting the streets of an alternate version of 1931 Tokyo, where the Taisho era is still ongoing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It all begins with a mysterious schoolgirl who asks Raidou to kill her, but she’s kidnapped by armored soldiers before she can explain why. On top of that, demonic incursions are on the rise across the city. You’ll need to make use of Raidou’s ability to capture and fuse demons as you try to solve this strange case that will lead him to discover a sinister conspiracy that threatens all of Japan.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The remaster adds demons that weren’t in the original, for a total of more than 120 this time around. They can fight beside you in combat but also join you on the field, and you can use their unique abilities to affect the environment and help solve cases. Some demons let you read minds, others light up areas to help find hidden objects, while others can freeze water or fly over impassable areas.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are also several new improvements to visuals, audio, and performance. Characters that are part of the main storyline now have full voice acting, bringing them to life in a new way. The graphics have been upgraded across the board, the UI has been revamped, and you can save your game from anywhere on the field. Plus, the battle system has been overhauled. You can now fully control the camera during combat, navigating menus has been streamlined, you can command multiple demons, and Raidou has new abilities. If you want to hear more about all of this from someone who’s gotten to play it, you can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SytUPOBBt4Q&amp;t=4793s" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>listen to IGN’s Michael Higham discuss it</u></a> as part of a recent episode of Unlocked.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Raidou Remastered releases on Nintendo Switch, Switch 2, PS4/5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on June 19. There will be five DLC packs (and a bundle of all five packs in one) also available at release, and you can get the cosmetic item Raidou Glasses for preordering either the digital or physical version of the base game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you <a href="https://cp.sega-account.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>sign up for a Sega Account</u></a>, you can claim* the Survival Pack Light Gear for free between June 19 and July 31, 2025. The pack comes with these in-game items: Soma x2 (fully restores Raidou’s HP and MAG), Survival Erudition x5 (automatically revives Raidou one time with full HP, but can’t be used in “Sleuth” difficulty).</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>*Available in select regions. Regional age restrictions may apply.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more information about the game, its characters, and where to preorder it, you can visit <a href="https://www.sega.com/raidou/raidou-remastered-the-mystery-of-the-soulless-army" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>the official website</u></a>.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Sonic x Shadow Generations</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">This is a two-games-in-one package that combines Shadow Generations with a remastered version of Sonic Generations. IGN <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-x-shadow-generations-review"><u>gave the original release a 9</u></a> and said it “takes an already excellent game and spring jumps it to new heights at a blistering pace by doubling up the campaign length with creative level design, fantastic bosses, plenty of collectibles, and an appreciable graphical upgrade.” In the Switch 2 release, those upgrades are pushed even further. Both games have been optimized and enhanced for Nintendo’s new console, with improvements to resolution and graphics.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The games play similarly, but with some marked differences. Sonic Generations sees you switch between “classic” and “modern” versions of Sonic, with gameplay inspired by different eras of the franchise. “Classic” is purely side-scrolling, like the original Sonic games of the ’90s. “Modern” plays more like the 2000s era, with a mixture of side-scrolling and third-person. You use a main hub to access each level, which all have a “classic” section and “modern” section. Some of the levels are more than just inspired by previous eras, they’re full-on remakes of iconic levels from the series — like the classic Green Hill Zone from the original Sonic and City Escape from Sonic Adventure 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As the name implies, Shadow Generations stars Shadow the Hedgehog as the protagonist. It also has two sections of each level, one side-scrolling and one 3D, but Shadow has different powers than his blue counterpart. As he defeats enemies, he fills a gauge in the corner of the screen. Once full, you can activate Chaos Control, which stops time, freezes objects, and opens alternate paths. You can also discover new abilities known as Doom Powers, which unlock new attacks and abilities that drastically alter Shadow's platforming capabilities.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The upgraded version of Sonic x Shadow Generations was part of the Switch 2’s launch lineup and is available now. For more details on the story and to see it in action, check out <a href="https://www.sega.com/sonic-the-hedgehog/sonic-x-shadow-generations" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>the official website</u></a>.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">This unique puzzle game lands on Switch 2 as an exclusive, bringing a ton of new features along with it in Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S, which combines two beloved series into one and lets you choose how to play. You can play it like Tetris, placing blocks and eliminating them by filling lines across the screen. Or like Puyo Puyo, eliminating colored blobs by matching colors and setting up combos. Or you can combine the two in crossover game modes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then there’s the exclusives: an all-new game mode and features you can only experience on the Nintendo Switch 2 that take advantage of the new hardware in fun ways. The Puyo Tetris® Doubles mode lets you compete in 2v2 battles with pairs using the same board, allowing you to set up devastating combos. Gameshare lets you use one copy of the game to play with up to three of your friends from anywhere around the world, camera functionality lets you put yourself into the game and become the background of a stage or the game board through a live video feed, and there’s also mouse control support using the Joy-Con 2. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">On top of that, there’s an extensive single-player adventure and 12 game modes that can be played solo or in local and online multiplayer. Plus, there’s a roster of 40 playable characters, including Sonic the Hedgehog, each with their own unique stats and abilities.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S was also a Switch 2 launch title and is out now. You can find more details and order it on <u>the official website</u>.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

In the video below from YouTube account TechRex, we see the host perform an extreme durability test on the console, culminating in a test that the Switch 2 was never going to survive.</p><p>The test begins with a simple drop test, where the Switch 2 is dropped from a tabletop height. As you can see in the video, the Switch 2 survives multiple five-foot drops with no issues, at least in this specific test environment. The video also has the host slashing the Switch 2's screen with a box cutter trying to snap off the Joy-Cons improperly, and attempting to apply force to break the kickstand.</p><p>Finally, the host drops a hammer on the screen and then smashes it with a lot more force. It's painful to type these words and even more painful to watch the video, but alas, here it is for your own enjoyment or punishment.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p33K1uuOk-A" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/p33K1uuOk-A" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>No mass-market technology product is designed to withstand the kind of abuse that TechRex subjected the Switch 2 in this video. But it's good to know the Switch 2 has a fighting chance to survive a drop from a day-to-day height like a coffee table or dining table. </p><p>For what it's worth, Nintendo <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dont-remove-switch-2s-protective-film-nintendo-says/1100-6531977/" data-ref-id="1100-6531977">officially recommends that you keep the Switch 2's film screen on</a>, but that likely would not protect it from scratches with a box cutter. For that, you might want to invest in a tempered screen protector, or make changes to your personal life.</p><p>If you're unlucky enough to need a repair for your Switch 2 (<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/some-switch-2-owners-have-holes-in-their-screen-thanks-to-gamestop/1100-6532136/" data-ref-id="1100-6532136">or if GameStop stapled your Switch 2 screen</a>), you can <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68227" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">pay Nintendo for an official repair</a>. Also worth mentioning is how the Switch 2 packaging itself does not contain much in the way of protection for the console.</p><p>The Switch 2 launched today, June 5, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-9-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6528874/" data-ref-id="1100-6528874">Mario Kart World</a> as its marquee <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-nintendo-switch-2-launch-game/2900-6401/" data-ref-id="2900-6401">launch title</a>.

The first mission you beat, Tricephelos, counts as one of them.</p><h2 id="h123693"><a id="1"></a>Preparation</h2><p>As a being of darkness, <strong>Heolstor is primarily weak to Holy damage</strong>, so focus on finding weapons that inflict that element. Try to reach as high of a level as you can before taking Heolstoron. During your run, prioritize passives and buffs that either increase your Rune acquisition from defeated enemies <em>or </em>ones that give you a lump sum of Runes. Being at least level 13 is recommended for this fight as Heolstor can hit very hard.</p><p>As for party composition, a Raider is probably the most useful and important class for this fight. This is because of his massive damage output and ability to stagger Heolstor easily. You want every opportunity to pile the hurt on Heolstor so that it doesn’t devastate you in return.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-iron-eye-single-shot-mark-ranged-1851783356&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-iron-eye-single-shot-mark-ranged-1851783356"><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>: A Beginner’s Guide To Mastering Ironeye</a></span></p><p>Heolstor is a slow-moving boss, which makes it a perfect target for Ironeye to constantly apply pressure with his arrows from a safe distance.

At the start of the fight, it’ll assume the form of The Shape of Night. This first form is very easy compared to its second form, so you shouldn’t really have any issues taking it down here. It’ll use some very basic melee attacks that aren’t really worth explaining in depth here.</p><figure id="" data-id="13861d669adad7aa62cc1e1325231327" data-recommend-id="image://13861d669adad7aa62cc1e1325231327" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1075" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The party fights a boss during its easier phase." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The party fights a boss during its easier phase." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Fromsoftware / George Yang / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="13861d669adad7aa62cc1e1325231327" data-recommend-id="image://13861d669adad7aa62cc1e1325231327" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1075" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The party fights a boss during its easier phase." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Just be patient when attacking The Shape of Night. Keep your HP high by not getting hit in the first place; you’ll want to conserve your healing flasks for the second phase. Conserve your Ultimates for the second phase too.</p><p>After taking down The Shape of Night, it’ll transform into Heolstor, the Nightlord. Its attacks are now cloaked in fire, becoming faster and stronger. As mentioned before, Heolstor walks slowly, but will very quickly close the distance by charging towards you and swinging its sword. These slashes come out fast and hit a wide arc, so be careful to time your dodges. Even at a distance, you’re not safe as his slashes can emit energy blades, and he can sometimes charge at you with a stab.</p><p>Heolstor can also summon fissures into the ground when it does slashes; look out for those too. Just watch the ground and avoid the glowing yellow lines.</p><p><strong>Heolstor likes to attack consecutively, but it has a cooldown period afterwards; this is the best time to come in and attack</strong>. When it gets up, back off and wait for the next opportunity to attack. The key to this fight is to be patient and not overextend. Don’t be afraid to use your UItimates, stagger Heolstor, or revive downed teammates quickly.</p><p>In another major attack, Heolstor will cover the entire battlefield in darkness before summoning a bunch of homing projectiles. This one is surprisingly easy to dodge by continually rolling out of the way. Heolstor can also be hit out of this attack by an Ultimate.</p><figure id="" data-id="e642edac0d41568b330ccda3a3c44263" data-recommend-id="image://e642edac0d41568b330ccda3a3c44263" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1070" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Darkness closes around the party as they fight an enemy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Darkness closes around the party as they fight an enemy." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Fromsoftware / George Yang / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e642edac0d41568b330ccda3a3c44263" data-recommend-id="image://e642edac0d41568b330ccda3a3c44263" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1070" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Darkness closes around the party as they fight an enemy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>After getting down to around 60 percent of its HP, Heolstor will enter its final phase. It’ll fly up high into the air and create a giant tear in the sky. <strong>Don’t waste your Ultimate thinking that you can knock it out of the air (I’ve tried; it doesn’t seem possible). </strong>This transition is inevitable. Once you see this, run away as fast as you can. Once Heolstor enters this phase, a giant explosion will occur and you don’t want to get caught in it.</p><p>As if Heolstor wasn’t already hard enough, small random pockets of the battlefield will explode with fire during the final phase of the fight. Avoid those. Be patient and just wait for the right opportunities to attack the boss and it should eventually go down.</p><p>After beating Heolstor, congrats! Sit back and watch the cutscenes and ending of <em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But how exactly you access those upgrades can be mildly confusing, so be warned.</p><p>When you transfer your data from a Switch to Switch 2, it will start downloading various software from your old system. Once it's done downloading one of the Zelda games, you might think the rest happens automatically--but no. Instead, starting up Tears of the Kingdom starts the Switch version, with a menu option at the bottom to upgrade to the Switch 2 version. Selecting that menu item forwards you to the Nintendo eShop store page, or you can find the store pages manually.</p><p>But here's where the process may trip up unsuspecting Hyrulians. The store page displays two different buttons. On the left side, next to the "Online + Expansion Pack" label, is "Download." On the right side is "Continue." The Continue button is noticeably much bigger and brighter, and located where you'd usually go to complete a transaction. But the free option for subscribers is the "Download" button.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4507548-switchzeldaupgrade.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4507548" data-ratio="0.55186509964231" data-width="1957" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4507548-switchzeldaupgrade.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4507548"></a><figcaption>Tears of the Kingdom's eShop page</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4507548-switchzeldaupgrade.jpg"></figure><p>You can still hit Continue to buy the content, which means you would continue to have access to it even if you let your Switch Online subscription lapse. But if that won't be a problem for you, there's no reason to pay the $10 premium.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/xdefiant-producer-leaves-ubisoft-and-game-industry-after-xdefiant-servers-shut-down/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisofts-xdefiant-will-be-closing-down-for-good-in-june-2025/">XDefiant</a> is officially offline, after its servers shut down earlier this week. Shortly after the game was shut down, the failed multiplayer shooter's executive producer, Mark Rubin, announced that he would be leaving Ubisoft and the game industry.</p>
<p>Rubin, who worked on the original Call of Duty: Modern Warfare games and their remasters before leaving Infinity Ward for Ubisoft to make XDefiant, announced his departure on <a href="https://x.com/PixelsofMark/status/1930403826378649786">his personal X account</a>, thanking those who played XDefiant and the former members of the now-shuttered Ubisoft San Francisco who helped build the game along with Rubin.</p>
<p>"<em>It's a sad day for fans of XDefiant and for all of the passionate devs that worked so hard on this game,</em>" Rubin began. "<em>I want to thank everyone who played it and everyone who promoted it whether you were a big content creator or just a fan. Every voice mattered</em>."</p>
<p>At one point, XDefiant looked like it would be the next big hit for Ubisoft. The company was <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-division-heartland-has-been-canceled-ubisoft-to-reinvest-in-xdefiant-and-rainbow-six/">investing in it over other projects</a>; it <a href="https://wccftech.com/xdefiant-registered-11-million-players-in-five-weeks/">hit huge player milestones in a matter of weeks</a> when it released, and even when there were reports of internal trouble for the game, Rubin was confident in its longevity, <a href="https://wccftech.com/xdefiant-isnt-shutting-down-after-season-4-says-producer/#comments">with plans being laid for future content beyond the game's initial year</a>.&nbsp;Which made it all the more unfortunate when Rubin's <a href="https://x.com/PixelsofMark/status/1846272225491484763">public statements</a> saying the game wouldn't be shut down so soon were proven to be flat-out wrong.</p>
<p><iframe title="XDefiant: Launch Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NoNpmAzGyB8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>XDefiant wasn't a perfect game, but regarding why it didn't last, Rubin seems to point to the game having "<em>very little marketing</em>," as a key reason why XDefiant was struggling to grow its player base post-launch.</p>
<p>But it wasn't the only issue that XDefiant faced. "<em>For one we had crippling tech debt using an engine that wasn't designed for what we were doing, and we didn't have the engineering resources to ever correct that</em>," Rubin wrote. "<em>I do personally think that in-house engines are not the valuable investment that they used to be and they are often doomed to fall behind big engines like Unreal</em>."</p>
<p>Rubin also highlighted network issues the game had that couldn't be properly fixed due to a lack of resources, and alluded to features that never made it into the game that could've "<em>completed the game in a way that I felt it should have been for launch.</em>" He essentially makes it seem like Ubisoft had XDefiant set up to fail, and then gave up on it before giving it a chance to rise above its issues. Though he adds that those who worked on the game, from its developers to the leadership at Ubisoft headquarters, had their hearts "<em>in the right place.</em>"</p>
<p>He closes out his long statement by announcing his departure from Ubisoft and from the game industry, choosing to spend more time at home and with his family, and that while he won't be making another game, he hopes "<em>that someone else can pick up the flag that I was trying to carry and make games again that care about the players, treat them with respect and listen to what they have to say</em>."</p>

It also has additional buttons for screenshot capture and pairing, along with a USB-C charging port.</p><p>That said, its compatibility is limited. It won’t work with standard Switch 2 games and is instead restricted to the GameCube titles available through the Switch Online Expansion Pack.

If you are a longtime <em>Final Fantasy</em> fan jumping into the popular TCG for the first time, this guide will tell you everything you need to know about the event!</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197580" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="GameStop Doubles Down On Crypto With Massive Bitcoin Purchase As Stores Close" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="88" data-playlist="197580,197576,197567" data-current="197580"><div><p>GameStop Doubles Down On Crypto With Massive Bitcoin Purchase As Stores Close</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197580/197580_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197580/197580_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197580/197580_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23101.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h165208"><a id="1"></a> What is a Pre-Release? </h2><p>As the name implies, a Pre-Release is an event that shops will run usually the week before the release of an <em>MtG </em>set as a way to get cards into the hands of excited players before the full release. <strong>While different sets will have minor differences, in general attendees will receive a Pre-Release kit with a number of booster packs and some additional goodies</strong>. For example, the upcoming <em>Final Fantasy</em> Pre-Release comes with six booster packs, an exclusive spindown (<em>MtG’s </em>20-sided, spindown die used as a life counter), a deck box, and a traditional rare (or mythic rare) foil card. The <em>Final Fantasy</em> Pre-Releases start Friday, June 6 (with some stores choosing midnight events) and technically go through Thursday, June 12, however most stores will be running them this weekend.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/magic-gatheirng-final-fantasy-cloud-sephiroth-pack-set-1851782830&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/magic-gatheirng-final-fantasy-cloud-sephiroth-pack-set-1851782830">Everything You Need To Know To Get Into <em>Magic: The Gathering</em>’s <em>Final Fantasy </em>Set</a></span></p><p>Players will then be given a set amount of time to open the boosters and build a limited, 40-card deck using the cards from those packs. After that, you will play three games against other participants in a “tournament”. The tournament is Swiss Style, which means you play against other people with your record, ie: if you lose in Game 1, you play against someone who also lost in Game 1, and if you lose that too, you would play someone who lost twice in Game 3. There is usually a winner who is given a small prize such as a booster pack or sleeves or something small, but most people are there just to play some games. Given the randomness of the boosters in each pre-release as well as the the structure of the tournament, Pre-Releases are pretty casual events which make them great for <em>FF </em>fans coming to <em>Magic</em> for the collaboration.</p><h2 id="h165209"><a id="2"></a> What else do I need to know? </h2><figure id="" data-id="a6aebedb81680e83ea4d732ef2d735f7" data-recommend-id="image://a6aebedb81680e83ea4d732ef2d735f7" data-format="png" data-width="1206" data-height="2622" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows upcoming events for Magic: the Gathering." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows upcoming events for Magic: the Gathering." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Wizards of the Coast / Simon Estey / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a6aebedb81680e83ea4d732ef2d735f7" data-recommend-id="image://a6aebedb81680e83ea4d732ef2d735f7" data-format="png" data-width="1206" data-height="2622" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows upcoming events for Magic: the Gathering." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As mentioned above, most local game stores that sell <em>Magic: the Gathering </em>products will be holding <em>Final Fantasy </em>Pre-Releases. The easiest way to find stores near you, is by downloading the “<em>Magic: the Gathering</em> Companion” App. You can then navigate to the “Locator” Tab and type in your zip code and you will see a list of all the events in the area (not just the <em>Final Fantasy</em> Pre-Releases), as well as their date and start time. </p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-commander-cloud-tidus-1851782536&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-commander-cloud-tidus-1851782536">How To Pick the Right Commander Deck For <em>Magic: The Gathering</em>’s <em>Final Fantasy </em>Set</a></span></p><p>Choosing one will also give you more info including additional store rules including how to sign up as well as the cost of the event. It’s a good idea to check a couple different events that you are interested in since pricing will vary depending on the store. In my experience, it appears that most stores are charging between $45 and $60, but don’t worry about paying less as the product received is exactly the same. Once you pick a specific time-slot, if sign-up rules weren’t listed on the event page in the Companion app, give the store and call and ask how you can sign up!</p><h2 id="h165210"><a id="3"></a>Additional tips</h2><p>If you have never played a TCG and have limited deck-building experience, here are a couple rules to get you started: <strong>Open all your packs and sort your cards by color</strong>. An <em>MnG</em> deck usually has two colors, so pick the two colors you have the most cards in as this will generally give you the most options. </p><p>If you get a particularly strong Mythic Rare in your box, it could also be worth choosing that as an option. Now, any <em>Magic </em>deck needs Mana, and a lot of it, so <strong>your deck should have between 17-18 “Land” Cards</strong>. I wouldn’t recommend using the ones contained in your boosters, because each pack only contains one, so you will be short by a lot. Your store should provide lands, so just use theirs this way you don’t get mixed up on which are yours and which are the stores. That only leaves 22-23 cards to pick from your boosters. Here is a good general breakdown for a well-balanced deck:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>1 Cost Cards: One or Two</li><li>2 Cost Cards: Seven or Eight</li><li>3 Cost Cards: Five or Six</li><li>4 Cost Cards: Three or Four </li><li>5 Cost Cards: Two or Three</li><li>6 Cost Cards: At Most One</li></ul><p>These are just general guidelines, and these numbers can be flexible if you think of a strategy that will work well. For example, if you want a Rush Deck to flood the battlefield with low level creatures, you will probably want less 5 Cost Cards and more 2 or 3. Play around with what you think will work, or just pick cards you like! Once you have your 40 cards selected, you should sleeve them. This is to protect your cards, and it makes them a little easier to shuffle. Your store will definitely have sleeves on sales. Dragon Shield is a popular brand as they are very well-made, affordable and have a lot of cool color options, but most likely any sleeves will do. Your store may even have <em>Final Fantasy</em> Sleeves for sale!</p><figure id="" data-id="32701ca4d96fc78e30ad73aa023f48f8" data-recommend-id="image://32701ca4d96fc78e30ad73aa023f48f8" data-format="png" data-width="744" data-height="1039" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Magic: the Gathering card shows a Chocobo and Mog." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Magic: the Gathering card shows a Chocobo and Mog." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Wizards of the Coast / Square Enix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="32701ca4d96fc78e30ad73aa023f48f8" data-recommend-id="image://32701ca4d96fc78e30ad73aa023f48f8" data-format="png" data-width="744" data-height="1039" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Magic: the Gathering card shows a Chocobo and Mog." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If you are at all curious about <em>Magic: The Gathering</em>, you should definitely attend a Pre-Release. They are great for newcomers, as people are excited to play with new cards and with no real prizes, most veterans won’t try to build an overpowered deck. As an added bonus, given the excitement around the <em>Final Fantasy </em>set, there will probably be a lot of newcomers to the game too, so you won’t be alone if you are unsure about specific rules or card abilities. You also know you already have something in common with everyone who is there. Who knows? Maybe you’ll meet your next <em>FFXIV </em>Raid Group and have a new Friday Night Hangout.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
