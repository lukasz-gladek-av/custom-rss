Here's everything you need to know before placing a preorder.</p><h2>Phantom Brave: The Lost Hero Preorder Bonuses</h2><p>There are currently no preorder bonuses for Phantom Brave: The Lost Hero. The game doesn't yet have a firm release date, so it's possible preorder bonuses could be revealed once a specific date is set.

Along the way, she'll use a special power to interact with phantoms scattered through the world, enabling her to unleash unique abilities in combat. Throughout the journey, you'll meet over 50 characters and attempt to master over 300 skills--giving you plenty of ways to customize your fighting style. Toss in a tactical turn-based system that uses free movement on a gridless map, and you've got a strategic RPG that's shaping up to be a great successor to the original Phantom Brave from 2004.</p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lord-of-the-rings-4k-blu-ray-box-set-amazon-preorder/1100-6524366/">Lord Of The Rings 4K Blu-Ray Steelbook Collection Is Back In Print, Preorders Live At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/official-xbox-controllers-get-significant-discounts-at-amazon-and-walmart/1100-6524341/">Official Xbox Controllers Get Significant Discounts At Amazon And Walmart</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/zelda-links-awakening-is-back-in-stock-for-40-at-amazon/1100-6511630/">Get Ready For Zelda: Echoes Of Wisdom With This Great Link's Awakening Deal</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More Best Gaming &amp; Tech Deals This Week Links (2)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/save-big-on-nintendo-switch-joy-con-controllers-at-amazon-and-walmart/1100-6523566/">Save Big On Nintendo Switch Joy-Con Controllers At Amazon And Walmart</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/inside-out-2-fans-should-check-out-the-new-lego-mood-cube-set/1100-6524400/">Inside Out 2 Fans Should Check Out The New Lego Mood Cube Set</a></li>   </ul> </div>

                <p>Another month has dawned, and that means Humble has another bundle of PC games available for its Humble Choice subscribers ($12/month). This month, there are eight games available in the bundle, including some big-name indie sequels like A Plague Tale: Requiem and Ghostrunner 2, plus a selection of shooters, strategy games, and action games, all of which are yours to keep forever, even if you cancel your Humble Choice subscription. On top of the games, this month's bundle also includes a surprising bonus: a month of DC Universe Infinite, which lets you read thousands of DC Comics in the DC Universe app. </p><h2>Humble Choice July 2024 games</h2><ul><li>Ghostrunner 2</li><li>A Plague Tale: Requiem</li><li>Starship Troopers: Terran Command</li><li>Sticky Business</li><li>Zoeti</li><li>Figment 2: Creed Valley</li><li>Heretic's Fork</li><li>Hyperviolent</li><li>Bonus: One-month subscription to DC Universe Infinite</li></ul><p>This month's headliner is <strong>A Plague Tale: Requiem</strong>, a steath/action sequel about a teen girl and her little brother trying to survive during the Black Death. It's a particularly fascinating sequel, because the first game came out in late 2019 just months before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, and Reqiuem was released in 2022--you can see in this game a bit of that shift in perspective that we all experienced over the past four years.</p><p><strong>Ghostrunner 2</strong>, another glossy indie, is a parkour-based action game in which the player and their enemies alike die with a single hit from a blade--this franchise is like Mirror's Edge and Dishonored had a baby that was really intense but also fun. And it's nice to have a hardcore action game that skews away from soulslike norms.</p><p>Moving away from the action genre, we've got <strong>Starship Troopers: Terran Command</strong>, a real-time strategy title that's all about humans vs arachnids. If you've been enjoying the Starship Troopers-esque Helldivers 2 and are itching for a change of pace, Terran Command will hit the spot.</p><p>What's cool about Humble Choice is the variety you get from the bundle each month, and July's has some particularly interesting titles. Like <strong>Sticky Business</strong>, a game about designing stickers and selling them online--Etsy Simulator, basically. Then there's a pair of deck-builders--turn-based rogue-lite <strong>Zoeti</strong>, and the casually quirky <strong>Heretic's Fork</strong>. <strong>Figment 2: Creed Valley,</strong> meanwhile, is a well-timed choice, because it's a franchise that takes place in the human mind, with a player character who is an emotion--it's a game that pairs well with a viewing of Inside Out 2. And no Humble Choice would be complete without a boomer shooter, and this month it's <strong>Hyperviolent</strong>, which plays like Doom but has the atmosphere and structure of System Shock.</p><p>And, finally, a bonus: a month of DC Universe Infinite, which will give you access to thousands of digital comics from DC in the DC Universe app and on the web. A month of DC Universe usually costs $8, and a normal free trial for the service is only seven days. So this is a nice little addition.</p><p><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dpbolvw.net%2Fclick-100770772-14555742%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fmembership%2Fhome&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fhumble-choice-july-2024-bundle-includes-a-plague-tale-ghostrunner-2-starship-troopers-and-more%2F1100-6524664%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">A subscription to Humble Choice will run you $12 per month or $129 for a year</a>. As soon as you sign up, you'll be able to access Steam keys for all eight games in the bundle, as well as a code for the DC Universe Infinite trial. Since you're getting Steam codes for the games, that means you get to keep them forever. And while you're subscribed, you'll get discounts from the Humble Store, and access to a rotating library of indie PC games.</p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lord-of-the-rings-4k-blu-ray-box-set-amazon-preorder/1100-6524366/">Lord Of The Rings 4K Blu-Ray Steelbook Collection Is Back In Print, Preorders Live At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/official-xbox-controllers-get-significant-discounts-at-amazon-and-walmart/1100-6524341/">Official Xbox Controllers Get Significant Discounts At Amazon And Walmart</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/zelda-links-awakening-is-back-in-stock-for-40-at-amazon/1100-6511630/">Get Ready For Zelda: Echoes Of Wisdom With This Great Link's Awakening Deal</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More Best Gaming &amp; Tech Deals This Week Links (2)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/save-big-on-nintendo-switch-joy-con-controllers-at-amazon-and-walmart/1100-6523566/">Save Big On Nintendo Switch Joy-Con Controllers At Amazon And Walmart</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/inside-out-2-fans-should-check-out-the-new-lego-mood-cube-set/1100-6524400/">Inside Out 2 Fans Should Check Out The New Lego Mood Cube Set</a></li>   </ul> </div>

                <p dir="ltr">Like everything else in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/" data-ref-id="5000-463450">Destiny 2</a> in the aftermath of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-the-final-shape-guides-hub/1100-6523936/" data-ref-id="1100-6523936">The Final Shape</a>, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-iron-banner-guide/1100-6524661/" data-ref-id="1100-6524661">Iron Banner</a> has been altered. The PvP event now sports a two-week duration instead of one and is adding two weapons to its current pool of rewards--both of which are former Iron Banner weapons that now have new perks and rolls. The first of those, Claws of the Wolf, is an extremely deadly pulse rifle with a lot of aim assist that might help you snap some headshots over the next two weeks of competition.</p><p dir="ltr">You can get Claws of the Wolf easily enough from Iron Banner, but there are a lot of combinations you probably won't want, especially with its mixed-up perk pool. Here's how you can nab Claws of the Wolf and what perks are worth chasing on it.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#How_To_Get_Claws_Of_The_Wolf">How To Get Claws Of The Wolf</a></li><li><a href="#Claws_Of_The_Wolf_God_Rolls">Claws Of The Wolf God Rolls</a><ul><li><a href="#Claws_Of_The_Wolf_PvP_God_Roll">Claws Of The Wolf PvP God Roll</a></li><li><a href="#Claws_Of_The_Wolf_PvE_God_Roll">Claws Of The Wolf PvE God Roll</a></li></ul></li></ul></div><h2 dir="ltr" id="How_To_Get_Claws_Of_The_Wolf">How To Get Claws Of The Wolf</h2><p dir="ltr">Now that Claws of the Wolf is back in the Iron Banner loot pool, there are a couple of ways to get ahold of one. The simplest is to just play Iron Banner matches--there's a chance that, with each match, you'll get a random weapon or armor drop, and that drop might be Claws of the Wolf. Even with only playing a handful of matches, I've already nabbed two, and since there are so many Pinnacle rewards and Iron Banner challenges to complete, odds are good that you'll get a few without any thought required.</p><p dir="ltr">If you don't get a lucky drop early on, though, you're guaranteed a Claws of the Wolf for ranking up your Iron Banner reputation. The reward at reputation level 4 is one of these pulse rifles, which will add it to your Collections. At that point, you can expect it to drop from random Iron Banner engrams, and you're also able to focus those engrams to get more Claws of the Wolf from Lord Saladin.</p><p dir="ltr">Like the other reputation vendors, Saladin offers the ability to focus engrams into specific weapon drops, allowing you to choose the thing you get (although the cost is higher than if you let the engrams drop a random item instead). So once you've got Claws of the Wolf, you can burn your stocked Iron Banner engrams for new drops in an attempt to get the roll you want.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4328200-20240702112242_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4328200" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4328200-20240702112242_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4328200"></a><figcaption>Claws of the Wolf</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4328200-20240702112242_1.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr" id="Claws_Of_The_Wolf_God_Rolls">Claws Of The Wolf God Rolls</h2><h3 dir="ltr" id="Claws_Of_The_Wolf_PvP_God_Roll">Claws Of The Wolf PvP God Roll</h3><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Barrel</strong>: Smallbore / Arrowhead Break  <ul><li dir="ltr">Smallbore: +7 Range, +7 Stability</li><li dir="ltr">Arrowhead Break: +30 Recoil, +10 Handling</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Magazine</strong>: Ricochet Rounds  <ul><li dir="ltr">+5 Range, +10 Stability</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>First Perk</strong>: Headseeker / To The Pain  <ul><li dir="ltr">Headseeker: Body shots increase precision damage and aim assist for a short period of time. Body shots landed while the perk is active refresh the time.</li><li dir="ltr">To The Pain: While this weapon is equipped, taking damage increases handling and aim assist until this weapon is stowed. Taking more damage increases the effect.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Second Perk</strong>: Zen Moment / Rampage  <ul><li dir="ltr">Zen Moment: Causing damage with this weapon reduces recoil and flinch over time.</li><li dir="ltr">Rampage: Kills with this weapon temporarily grant increased damage. Stacks up to three times.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Masterwork</strong>: Range / Reload Speed</li></ul><p dir="ltr">There are a few good combinations for Claws of the Wolf in the Crucible, depending a bit on your playstyle and what you're going for. Generally, you want to favor stats like Range and Stability in your barrel and magazine choices, although if you really like Kill Clip, try to boost Reload Speed.</p><p dir="ltr">The main benefit of Claws of the Wolf is that, while its bullets don't hit too hard, it fires <em>extremely</em> quickly and pretty accurately. Thus, pairing Headseeker, which gives you increased precision damage when you land body shots, and Zen Moment, which increases your aim assist and decreases your flinch the more you land shots, leans into the accuracy Claws of the Wolf already sports. You're firing so many bullets so quickly that you're getting a lot of benefit out of the synergy.</p><p dir="ltr">Alternatively, To The Pain, a new perk in The Final Shape, gives you a similar benefit when you're under fire, increasing your aim assist as you duel and boosting your handling--great if you need to quickly whip out a shotgun to seal the deal. Zen Moment can also pair with To The Pain, but if you'd prefer a damage perk, Rampage gives you a 10% boost when you land a kill, which can help knock down secondary targets. Kill Clip can be even better--the damage boost is 25% when you reload within three seconds of a kill--but the reload on Claws of the Wolf can be painfully slow, so Rampage's automatic activation might be the better call.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Claws_Of_The_Wolf_PvE_God_Roll">Claws Of The Wolf PvE God Roll</h3><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Barrel</strong>: Arrowhead Break  <ul><li dir="ltr">+30 Recoil, +10 Handling</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Magazine</strong>: Flared Magwell  <ul><li dir="ltr">+15 Reload speed, +5 Stability</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>First Perk</strong>: Repulsor Brace  <ul><li dir="ltr">Defeating a Void-debuffed target grants an overshield.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Second Perk</strong>: Destabilizing Rounds  <ul><li dir="ltr">Final blows cause nearby targets to become Volatile.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Masterwork</strong>: Reload Speed</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Though it's not really a PvE weapon in most cases, Claws of the Wolf does benefit from the Void double-whammy of Repulsor Brace and Destabilizing Rounds, giving it some serious synergy with Void builds. To start, though, your choices on barrel and magazine are pretty open, but Handling and Reload Speed are good places to put your focus; Range and Stability matter a lot less when you're not fighting other Guardians.</p><p dir="ltr">Your main focus is on getting Repulsor Brace and Destabilizing Rounds together, which gives Claws of the Wolf some serious power in PvE. First, Destabilizing Rounds cause targets near any enemy you kill to become Volatile, which debuffs them and makes them explore, spreading around more Volatile. If you use Claws to kill a Volatile enemy, you'll trigger Repulsor Brace, which gives you an overshield. So especially when dealing with groups of weak enemies, the combination creates its own feedback loop that makes your killing more effective and your defense even stronger. Add this combo to a Void build that spreads around and takes advantage of more debuffs, and you'll get even more shields for your trouble.</p><p>Check out the rest of our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-the-final-shape-guides-hub/1100-6523936/" data-ref-id="1100-6523936">guides for The Final Shape</a> for god rolls and more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/dr-disrespect-pubg-escape-from-tarkov-rogue-company<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last week, Guy “Dr Disrespect” Beahm <a href="https://aftermath.site/dr-disrespect-twitch-ban-minor-whisper" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">saw his career implode</a> following tweets from an ex-Twitch employee saying that he’d been banned from Twitch in 2020 for exchanging inappropriate messages with a minor. One by one, the dominoes fell, with his video game company, Midnight Society, dropping him and, eventually, YouTube <a href="https://x.com/ethangach/status/1806516098717679789" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">demonetizing his channel</a>. Numerous companies also <a href="https://x.com/Vahn16/status/1805653300433633471" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">washed their hands</a> of the suddenly-radioactive streamer, including 2K Games, which said it intends to <a href="https://dexerto.com/nba-2k/nba-2k-to-remove-dr-disrespect-content-following-twitch-ban-scandal-2798463/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">patch Dr Disrespect out of <em>NBA 2K24</em></a>. However, a small handful of other video game companies remain conspicuously silent on the matter.</p><p>PUBG Studios, Battlestate Games, and Hi-Rez Studios – the studios behind <em>PUBG</em>, <em>Escape From Tarkov</em>, and <em>Rogue Company</em>, respectively – have yet to say what they intend to do about the presence of Dr Disrespect-themed cosmetics in their games. In the latter’s case, Hi-Rez appears to have <a href="https://x.com/BravaBackshots/status/1806461920792203736" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">quietly disabled <em>Rogue Company</em>’s Dr Disrespect skin</a>, but while <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RogueCompany/comments/1dq745e/it_be_pretty_disrespectful_if_theres_not_a_refund/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community chatter suggests</a> that a refund is on the way for those who purchased the skin, the company hasn’t confirmed this via any of its official channels. The game also contains a Dr Disrespect-themed level called The Arena, which players who claim to have spoken with Hi-Rez say <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RogueCompany/comments/1dq745e/comment/lanjz8l/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will be removed</a>. Aftermath reached out to Hi-Rez multiple times but did not receive a response.&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, there does not appear to be any motion on <em>PUBG </em>or <em>Tarkov</em>’s ends, despite <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/1dog8vs/take_dr_disrespect_armor_out_of_the_game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">requests from <em>Tarkov </em>players</a> to remove official Dr Disrespect armor, which can be found and equipped during matches. <em>PUBG</em>, on the other hand, added Dr Disrespect weapon skins as part of a limited-time promotion <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/578080/view/4580680095902954038" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">all the way back in 2018</a>, meaning they’re pretty hard to come by these days. Neither Battlestate Games nor PUBG Studios replied to requests for comment from Aftermath.</p><p>Scrubbing in-game items and issuing refunds where necessary is likely a more complicated process than terminating a deal with the disgraced streamer, but it’s still notable that while the likes of Mountain Dew and the San Francisco 49ers moved quickly to distance themselves from Beahm, a trio of major video game companies continue to tiptoe around the issue without even cluing players in to their future plans. Perhaps they need more time, or perhaps this is simply not a priority for them.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24191083/how-to-pronounce-scadutree-elden-ring<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="vt1KBU">Was anyone going to tell me I’ve been pronouncing “scadutree” wrong, or did I have to find out from a TikTok comment?</p>
<p id="7jSsdB"><em>Elden Ring</em>’s <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> DLC introduces consumables called Scadutree fragments. These are found at Sites of Grace in the Land of Shadow, and they’re used to power up your character.</p>
<p id="eB165C">“That’s a silly-looking word,” I thought when I first read about them, mentally pronouncing it as “skad-oo-tree.”</p>
<p id="jTDG1N">But the word “scadu” is derived from the Old English “<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sceadu">sceadu</a>,” and should be pronounced more like “shadu,” or, you know, “shadow.” Shadow-tree. This information comes from distressed linguistics majors and history enthusiasts all over the internet, including <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/1doh93s/scadutree_pronunciation/">Reddit</a>, <a href="https://x.com/DrDeComposing/status/1805786548887003200">X</a>, and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@polygon/video/7385239706390252842">the comments of our own TiKTok page</a>.</p>
<p id="2ObjOS">This shouldn’t exactly have come as a surprise. <em>Elden Ring</em> has long used Old and Middle English, as well as Welsh and Irish words that Americans never learned to pronounce. I certainly breathed a sigh of relief when certified Irishman Cian Maher did us yanks a service by <a href="https://twitter.com/cianmaher0/status/1501160125716963333">tweeting the correct pronunciation</a> of the Lands Between’s Siofra River before I ever had to say the word out loud.</p>
<div id="MQ0TsG">
<blockquote>
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Gonna blow all non-Irish Elden Ring players' minds: Siofra is pronounced Sheef-rah</p>— Cian Maher (@cianmaher0) <a href="https://twitter.com/cianmaher0/status/1501160125716963333?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 8, 2022</a>
</blockquote>


</div>
<p id="JXuMSc">The devotion to including Celtic languages like Welsh and Irish in translations of FromSoft games is genuinely cool. Over decades of English colonization <a href="https://www.transceltic.com/blog/deliberate-repression-of-celtic-languages">these languages were repressed, often banned</a>, and are still considered endangered.</p>
<p id="QFLwoK">Old and Middle English words like “scadu” and “gaol” are from a different linguistic family, but it’s always exciting to learn how not to embarrass myself when I talk.</p>

            <link>https://www.polygon.com/24190684/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-improvements-lidar-terrain-magic</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/uh-oh-somebody-told-the-microsoft-flight-sim-2024-devs-about-lidar.917607/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24190684/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-improvements-lidar-terrain-magic<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="H4NMB0">The developers of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2020/8/19/21374936/microsoft-flight-simulator-review-pc"><em>Microsoft Flight Simulator</em></a> have a lot to be proud of. Last month, at the <a href="https://flightsimexpo.com/">FlightSimExpo 2024</a> in Las Vegas, representatives crowed about their 15 million users and one billion flight sessions logged — numbers Asobo Studio claims put them at the top of the heap as the most-played flight simulation ever published. Now the studio is back on that grind cranking out <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24172090/microsoft-xbox-showcase-june-2024-announcement-reveal"><em>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</em></a>, due out this fall. Asobo calls it “the most ambitious sim ever undertaken,” and given its track record, I’m inclined to believe them.</p>
<p id="34V1gL">The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/a6riRXgRsCU?si=YsNMzmobIUpM1vDS">lengthy talk</a>, delivered by head of Microsoft Flight Simulator <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23179045/microsoft-flight-simulator-space-shuttle-update-gliders-40th-anniversary">Jörg Neumann</a> and Asobo Studio co-founder and CEO Sebastian Wloch, stretches over an hour and a half. But those 90 minutes include lots of delicious morsels for dedicated virtual pilots — enhancements such as app-based offline flight planning, increased density of ground traffic at major airports, and the ability to actually step out of the cockpit to perform pre-flight checks in first-person. </p>
<p id="8Cbmxp">But the tidbit that should turn PC and console player’s heads the most is the invocation of a new partner, a company that Microsoft recently acquired called <a href="https://www.vexcel-imaging.com/">Vexcel Imaging</a>.</p>
<p id="RUiMdw">Vexcel is a groundbreaking imaging company known for its UltraCam line of aerial survey cameras. These multi-spectrum arrays include more traditional RGB color sensors alongside near-infrared sensors. Combined with their software, the result is a dramatic increase in the resolution of image data being shared with the team of designers at Asobo — as evidenced by <em>MSFS 2024</em>’s recent teaser trailer, shown at the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24172090/microsoft-xbox-showcase-june-2024-announcement-reveal">Xbox Games Showcase</a>.</p>
<div id="BvMwti"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rvzlC4iCtns?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="xMISN7">Neumann used a bit of his time on stage at FlightSimExpo to let fans peek behind the curtain, so to speak, at what was actually being shown in that trailer — specifically in its opening moments as a single-engine airplane flies over Monument Valley in Arizona. </p>
<p id="4WuLN3">“The natural environments are something that people have never seen before,” Neumann said. “Not on this scale, certainly not in this level of detail.” Then he handed the reins to Wloch to go a little bit deeper. You can watch the full segment around <a href="https://youtu.be/a6riRXgRsCU?t=848">the 14-minute mark</a>. </p>
<p id="bPgT37">What’s important to understand is that previously, <em>Microsoft Flight Simulator</em> had been applying three-dimensional assets — things like houses and trees — automagically on top of two-dimensional data. But there’s only so far you can take that kind of automation, which is why the first time I flew over the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/9/30/20885197/microsoft-flight-simulator-bing-maps-hands-on-demo">Great Pyramid at Giza</a>, the complex of pyramids was surrounded by a forest of oddly brown deciduous trees instead of sand dunes. Using UltraCam data to do <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2016/3/17/11251930/star-wars-battlefront-gdc-photogrammetry-at-at-foot">photogrammetry</a> — that is, 3D reconstruction of real-world elements from nothing but image data — gives Asobo’s terrain-rendering software a lot more to work with.</p>
<p id="DxWhJr">“We now have the ground, which is all 3D, instead of [...] 2D with a texture,” Wloch said. “There’s a lot of different 3D materials [including] the grass, the rocks, and the trees. Everything is now 3D [...] and everything is procedurally generated on top of the world data.”</p>
<p id="s1awiZ">But Vexcel’s camera technology isn’t standing still. This summer, <a href="https://youtu.be/LN2vAIBb0Lo?t=415">the Austrian company is adding LIDAR to its arrays</a> as well. That will likely add <a href="https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/lidar.html">altitude and relative distance</a> to the data being shared with Asobo in addition to graphical data. And that, my friends, could enable procedurally generated environments the likes of which no one has ever seen in a commercial flight simulator.</p>
<p id="FCmC5A">Expect more on <em>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</em> ahead of its <a href="https://www.flightsimulator.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-release-date-announcement/">Nov. 19 launch date</a>, when it will become available for purchase and as part of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/best-games/22372750/best-game-pass-games-xbox">Xbox Game Pass</a>.</p>

<p>The Esports World Cup is now live in Riyadh, and from here, eight weeks of competition will unravel. This staggering, industry-leading event is set to change history, boasting a $60 million prize pool and more than twenty esports titles, covering everything from CS2 to League of Legends, and from Call of Duty to Rennsport. </p>



<p>The Esports World Cup Foundation put on an opening ceremony to open the monumental event – and what a spectacle it was. Despite some of the concerns around the EWC, there’s no doubt this was one of the most impressive moments in the history of esports.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-an-event-to-remember">An Event To Remember</h2>



<p>The Esports World Cup is an all-new tournament being held in Saudi Arabia. It’s a gargantuan effort that more than 1,500 esports competitors are supporting, representing around 400 teams from a whopping 100 countries. It’s the most diverse and valuable event ever seen in the ever-developing world of esports, and it all began with a stunning opening ceremony.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2187462186" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the broadcast</a>, a grand stage was showcased in Riyadh, and before long, a group of masked dancers started laying down their moves. The EWC trophy was revealed under a sky illuminated by a plethora of fireworks, and a display of LED drones paraded around, painting the EWC logo high in the sky above Saudi Arabia. </p>



<p>Behind the scenes, a panel of superstar guests and presenters welcomed esports fans from around the world, with some taking the time to present some of the tournament stages that will play host to the world’s biggest gaming organisations, all of which are headed to Riyadh with the hope of winning millions of dollars.</p>



<p>Over the next eight weeks, the Esports World Cup will play out – which organisation will secure the grand prize in the Club Championship, which comes with a cash prize worth $7 million?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/neva-is-a-stunning-new-puzzle-platformer-from-the-makers-of-gris<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>I think Neva and I are going to get along quite well.</p><p>To this end, people who know me know what kinds of games I like: first-person shooters, point-and-click adventures, story-driven third-person action-adventures, and puzzle-platformers – or as I like to call them, Limbo-likes. If your game tells a poignant, emotionally compelling story with a beautiful art style, gorgeous music, and no dialogue whatsoever, then there is a good chance that I’m going to really like that game. It doesn’t always pan out, though; Black The Fall was a shameless and mediocre clone of Playdead’s seminal 2016 masterpiece Inside. Somerville was made by an ex-Playdead developer but couldn’t quite reach the narrative heights of Limbo or Inside. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Neva Slideshow - Tribeca Festival</h3></div></output><p>But Neva, the new Limbo-like from the developers of 2018’s outstanding GRIS? I played the first 45 or so minutes of it and it is checking every good box there is for this subgenre. Let me start with the obvious: no, not the art style. I’ll get to that. But the dog. OK, so Neva isn’t a dog, but she’s this universe’s mythical equivalent of a canine companion. I must’ve held the Y button down five times in the first five minutes to pet Neva, and I hope the developers at Nomada Studio include an unlockable achievement for doing so.</p><p>Anyway, Neva’s beautiful opening sequence instantly made me care about Neva and protecting her at all costs from the dark forces that are corrupting this previously pristine world. And pristine it is. As I started to mention earlier, the art style in Neva is as colorful as it is unique. I adore the full use of the color palette that’s on display here, from the muted greens of the dark forest to the bright yellow of the open plains, Neva’s world is absolutely stunning.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Fortunately, it shows the initial signs of having the gameplay to back it up, too. While the first three-quarters of an hour I played only served to slowly introduce the combat mechanics, eventually intertwining them with the platforming in order to create the puzzle-platforming these types of games are known for, that meandering path was an engaging one. I was riveted the entire time, wondering what might come next. My hope is that Neva’s combat and puzzles continue to stack and layer on top of each other to create more and more intricate gameplay as the campaign winds on, and the boss fight that concluded my demo was a welcome sign that this indeed might be the case.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Neva was one of many games I played during June’s various summer gaming preview events, and it’s one of the few I’m still thinking about weeks later.</p></div><p>In addition, I was pleased to stumble upon a couple of secret items during my demo, suggesting that while there might not necessarily be enough meat on the bone here for multiple repeat playthroughs, there should hopefully be a bit more to look for that’s slightly off the campaign’s seemingly linear golden path. All told, Neva was one of many games I played during June’s various summer gaming preview events, and it’s one of the few I’m still thinking about weeks later. It looks like it has the potential to be very, very special.</p><p><em>Ryan McCaffrey is IGN's executive editor of previews and host of both IGN's weekly Xbox show, </em><a href="https://www.ign.com/watch/unlocked">Podcast Unlocked</a><em>, as well as our monthly(-ish) interview show, </em><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/04/ign-unfiltered-every-episode-ever">IGN Unfiltered</a><em>.

                <p>The First Descendant launched today for PC, PlayStation, and Xbox. Given its free-to-play and multiplayer structure, The First Descendant would benefit from mechanics such as cross-play and cross-progression with different platforms. Cross-play lets players play with and against each other, regardless if they're on PC, PlayStation, or Xbox. Cross-progression lets players carry over progress from one platform to the other.</p><p>The good news is that The First Descendant supports both cross-play and cross-progression between PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S. However, players must sign up for a Nexon account in order to use cross-progression. Here are step-by-step instructions on how to activate cross-save.</p><ol><li>Go to the Nexon <a href="https://tfd.nexon.com/en/signin" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow ">account linking page</a></li><li>Click on the icon of the platform you're playing on (Steam, PlayStation, Xbox)</li><li>You'll redirected to the login page for that platform and now enter your credentials</li><li>When you're logged in, authorize the link between your game account and platform</li><li>Follow the rest of the instructions and complete the authorization process</li></ol><p>The First Descendant has had a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-looter-shooter-the-first-descendant-is-off-to-a-big-start/1100-6524651/" data-ref-id="1100-6524651">strong start so far</a>, with over <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/mostplayed" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">200,000 concurrent players today on Steam</a>, peaking at #5 on the Steam's most played games list. The Destiny-like game follows the Descendants who have special powers to fight against the Vulgus, a race of aliens seeking the destruction of the fictional world of Ingris.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/stardew-valley/" data-ref-id="5000-168503">Stardew Valley</a>, the massive indie farming simulator, lets you and up to three friends run a farm together, via online play or couch co-op. However, since multiplayer was added post-launch and the majority of development is done by one person, there are a few modern features missing from the multiplayer. One of those features is cross-platform play, which isn't in Stardew Valley.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Stardew Valley cross-platform details</h2><p dir="ltr">Stardew Valley currently does not have cross-platform multiplayer, and it seems likely that it never will. That means if you want to play multiplayer, everyone will need to be in the same family of platforms, like Xbox or PlayStation. If one person is on Nintendo Switch and the other is on PC, you cannot play together.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Stardew Valley - Multiplayer Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Stardew Valley developer Eric Barone--also known as ConcernedApe--has not commented on cross-platform multiplayer in recent years, but did mention back in 2018 that <a href="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/1036993838613651459" rel="nofollow ">"technical barriers are very high,"</a> expressing that it's a feature that he would want to add, but it might not be possible. The developers comments are reminiscent of those from Bethesda's Todd Howard, who discussed why <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-76-doesnt-have-cross-play-because-it-wasnt-designed-that-way-says-todd-howard/1100-6523054/">Fallout 76</a> doesn't have cross-play, citing difficulty in adding it to a game that wasn't initially designed for it.</p><p dir="ltr">One of the other important things to know about Stardew Valley multiplayer is that multiplayer saves are stored by the host. That means in order to play on your co-op save, the host needs to be present, otherwise you cannot access the save file.</p>

The iconic deckbuilding game, designed by a former <em>Magic; The Gathering</em> pro champ and published by Stone Blade Entertainment will be getting a new standalone expansion, <em>Ascension Legends</em>. An expansion designed for both veterans and new players alike.</p>
<h2>The <em>Ascension Legends</em> announcement</h2>
<p>According to an official press release, <em>Ascension Legends</em> is a new expansion compatible with other sets released for the game. Stone Blade Entertainment is reprinting decks and promotional cards from previous sets as part of the campaign. This is so new players can enjoy the wide variety of cards and mechanics introduced over the game's history.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ascension-legends-featured-cart-artwork.jpg?itok=VyB65OM_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ascension-legends-featured-cart-artwork.jpg?itok=G_d4Ly2g 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Enjoy the glow-up folks.</figcaption></figure><p>The expansion will introduce new gameplay mechanics. These include a Legendary Track, dual-faction cards, Remnant monsters, and Emissary heroes.</p>
<p><em>Ascension</em> was originally released in 2010. It is a game set in a fantasy world where two to four players recruit heroes and wield powerful constructs to defend the realm of Vigil from the monsters of Deoful. It has received fifteen expansions, videogame adaptations, and even a spin-off in 2020, <em>Ascension Tactics</em>.</p>
<p>Tabletop fans attending San Diego Comic-Con will have a chance to play <em>Ascension Legends</em> early. Stone Blade will set up demo tables at the convention from July 25 to July 28. The tables will showcase <em>Ascension Legends</em> alongside <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interview/solforge-fusions-inception-and-future-with-richard-garfield-and-justin-gary" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Solforge </em></a><a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interview/solforge-fusions-inception-and-future-with-richard-garfield-and-justin-gary" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Fusion</em></a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/you-gotta-be-kitten-me-coming-to-target" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>You Gotta Be Kitten Me</em></a>.</p>
<p><em>Ascension Legends</em> and its reprinted cards will be available through a crowdfunding campaign on <a href="https://gamefound.com/en/projects/stoneblade/ascension#/section/project-story">Gamefound</a>. Stone Blade confirms in the campaign's comments that reprints of the Center Deck Sets will be available as campaign add-ons. These sets will be cheaper than the original sets since they will not include starting hands, game boards, or the original box.</p>
<p>The campaign also promotes two promotional cards for those who follow the campaign early.</p>
<p><em>Ascension Legends</em> will begin its Gamefound campaign on July 24.</p>

  <p id="xOylvI">It’s come to our attention that not everyone yet has experienced the joy that is <em>Calvin and Hobbes</em>. Maybe it’s because they have been waiting for the right moment to dive in. Maybe they grew up without knowing about Bill Watterson’s seminal comic series.

Of course, what those complaints don’t tell you is that a lot of the people behind them are also skipping through large swaths of the story. It’s not a new problem to <em>Final Fantasy 14</em>, but it is one that <em>Dawntrail </em>is bringing back to the forefront. Some <em>Final Fantasy 14</em> players have a problem of their own, and it’s a lack of willingness to engage with the game’s methodical storytelling in its entirety.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195519" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="I Didn’t Play Final Fantasy XVI ‘Right,’ And That’s OK" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="148" data-playlist="195519,196646,196394" data-current="195519"><div><p>I Didn’t Play Final Fantasy XVI ‘Right,’ And That’s OK</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21013.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The discourse over how <em>Dawntrail</em>, and<em> Final Fantasy 14</em> at large, tells its story heated back up thanks to a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/qtrcirclejab/status/1807515855489515874&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/qtrcirclejab/status/1807515855489515874" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post on X</a></span> from a user complaining about story-critical information being put in non-voiced cutscenes during the latest expansion. For non-Warriors of Light, <em>FF14 </em>tells its story in three main ways. The first is voiced cutscenes, which are typically climactic story moments brought to life by the game’s wonderful cast. Second are non-voiced cutscenes, which use text bubbles at the bottom of the screen for dialogue between characters. Finally, the most low-stakes dialogue and story details are typically communicated outside of cutscenes through text bubbles when picking up quests. As demonstrated by the initial social media post, many players have created a hierarchy in their heads of how story-critical each type of cutscene is to determine if they can skip it or not.</p><p>It should surprise no one that skipping large swathes of dialogue can make it hard to understand the tale Square Enix is trying to tell. As an MMO, <em>FF14’s</em> narrative threads sometimes play out over an entire expansion, or multiple expansions. In the case of <em>Dawntrail</em>,<em> </em>the MSQ (or main story quest) consists of 100 individual quests that will take most players roughly 50 hours to complete. Most of the cutscenes throughout will not be voiced, which for a certain type of player means that a majority of the game is skippable purely because it requires reading. That’s a fundamentally flawed way to interact with the game, as it assumes one of its primary ways of communicating with the player is meaningless.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="0580f237e5a6bb741140f5fb83ff52c3" data-recommend-id="image://0580f237e5a6bb741140f5fb83ff52c3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="716" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Alisaie, Alphinaud, and Wuk Lumat talk using dialogue boxes" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Alisaie, Alphinaud, and Wuk Lumat talk using dialogue boxes" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0580f237e5a6bb741140f5fb83ff52c3" data-recommend-id="image://0580f237e5a6bb741140f5fb83ff52c3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="716" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Alisaie, Alphinaud, and Wuk Lumat talk using dialogue boxes" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>To try and give credit to the argument that unvoiced cutscenes are skippable, I think it’s fair to say that many of these can feel like massive exposition and lore dumps. I get that running through such a long story can be tedious, but this attitude ignores the fact that you typically need some exposition and table-setting in a plot to reach a point where a climax can happen.

The MSQ is labeled as such because the devs have created a critical story path. If you want to learn about the nitty-gritty lore of a new location and the various groups living and fighting within it, that’s what side quests and the game’s Unending Codex are for. But everything done in the MSQ is purposefully crafted to lead you along the story’s emotional highs and lows. Yes, that sometimes includes dialogue you have to read. It’s already labeled as part of the MSQ, I don’t know what more some players need in order to understand that it’s probably important.</p><p>This failure to engage with <em>Final Fantasy 14</em>’s storytelling on its own terms seems to be rooted in a need to rush through the expansion as fast as possible, as well as a lack of value placed on anything without voice acting. To do some math, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://howlongtobeat.com/game/88046&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://howlongtobeat.com/game/88046" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Howlongtobeat.com</a></span> has an average playtime of 50 hours for the main story of <em>Endwalker</em>. A <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXvoMNUoML4&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXvoMNUoML4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube compilation</a></span> of all the voiced cutscenes from that expansion is a little under 16 hours long. That means you’re spending roughly one third of your time in voiced cutscenes, while the other two thirds are mostly spent actively questing in the world. Dungeons, Trials, and even boring fetch quests make up a large part of that remaining two-thirds, meaning that unvoiced cutscenes make up a relatively small percentage of playtime. Credit where it’s due, that’s in part because each expansion has upped the amount of voiced cutscenes. <em>Shadowbringers</em>, the expansion immediately before <em>Endwalker</em>, had roughly nine-and-a-half hours of voiced cutscenes. While the revelation that unvoiced cutscenes are relatively few may make you think it wouldn’t be a big deal to skip them, I’d argue that it just means they aren’t as much of a hurdle to the attention span as some suggest. Yes, the voiced cutscenes may be where the most iconic, action-packed, or emotionally resonant moments typically occur, but as I’ve said, they only work with the weight of all the unvoiced dialogue that helps to establish the conflicts playing out and how much is at stake.</p><p>It’s not that<em> Final Fantasy 14</em>’s storytelling is perfect. I think <em>Endwalker </em>suffers from bad pacing, though it still manages to pull off its emotional finale. But the discussion of un-voiced dialogue as something we should be able to skip without any impact on our investment in and understanding of the overall story isn’t in the same ballpark as real criticisms of the game’s narrative. It’s a dissatisfaction with the vehicle through which that story is told. </p><p>I think <em>Dawntrail </em>is getting accused of many of the same flaws that <em>A Realm Reborn</em> did, and there is a reason for that. Both <em>ARR</em> and <em>Dawntrail </em>are the beginnings of larger stories. It took a decade and four expansions for every story thread whose groundwork was laid in <em>ARR</em> to pay off. Because of that, <em>ARR </em>is an introductory arc that on its own may feel unsatisfying, which is why it’s so derided despite being so essential. <em>Dawntrail </em>is in the same place now. It’s laying the groundwork for the next decade of <em>FF14</em>. That doesn’t mean it sucks, it just means it’s part of an as-of-yet incomplete tapestry. </p><p>The rushed mentality of so many players, that they must skip through the perceived unimportant scenes to finish a painstakingly crafted expansion in the course of a weekend, is part of a larger issue with a lack of patience in the grand storytelling the game is constantly doing. Eorzea is a living, breathing world of players and NPCs that is meant to be the setting for a wondrous adventure. Adventures like that need breathing room, which requires breaks and time, not just to get through but to digest. It’s no wonder that a scarfed-down meal doesn’t agree with players, it’s not meant to be consumed that way. As simple as it sounds, what players need is patience. </p><hr><p>I’m sure <em>Dawntrail </em>has its issues, and I bet the story isn’t perfect (based on early impressions), but the only way you can know that and really engage with it is if you read the fucking text.</p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

For the first time, the usually week-long event will now span <em>two</em> weeks. It also brings some reprised guns back for you to chase, complete with new perks.</p><p dir="ltr">While the Iron Banner is pretty straightforward--it's a 6-on-6 multiplayer event with its own set of rewards, reputation track, and Triumph seal--there are a few idiosyncrasies to keep in mind, particularly if you're new to Destiny 2 or haven't played in a while. Wearing and using Iron Banner gear offers some significant benefits, for example. Here's everything you need to know about Iron Banner, how it works, and how to make the most of your time earning weapons and Pinnacle rewards.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#New_Iron_Banner_Format">New Iron Banner Format</a></li><li><a href="#Iron_Banner_Weapons">Iron Banner Weapons</a></li><li><a href="#Earning_Iron_Banner_Reputation">Earning Iron Banner Reputation</a><ul><li><a href="#Iron_Banner_Armor_Set_Bonus">Iron Banner Armor Set Bonus</a></li><li><a href="#Challenges_Offer_Big_Bonuses__But_Not_All_At_Once">Challenges Offer Big Bonuses, But Not All At Once</a></li></ul></li></ul></div><p dir="ltr">First and foremost, there's the new, two-week change that's come to Iron Banner with the latest expansion. Iron Banner will now span two weeks rather than one, but each of those weeks will have its own game mode for you to play.</p><p dir="ltr">In the first week, starting on July 2, the Iron Banner mode is Control, where you and your teammates try to capture three points on a given map, with points scored for kills increasing with control points secured--one point scored with one location locked down, two points for two locations. If one team gets all three points, they trigger a brief period in which they score three points per kill before the locations reset and have to be captured again.</p><p dir="ltr">The second week of Iron Banner starts on July 9 will feature the Tribute mode, in which players drop a crest item when they're killed, and you score points by nabbing your opponents' crests and picking up your teammates' crests so the other team can't. When a team gathers enough crests, a control point appears in the center of the map, guarded by powerful Cabal turrets. Capturing the point increases that team's score while it's owned, so it's a chaotic dash for everyone to converge on the control point and take it over to maximize the scoring potential.</p><p dir="ltr">Iron Banner ends on July 16 with the weekly reset, so get your matches in before then.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4328200-20240702112242_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4328200" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4328200-20240702112242_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4328200"></a><figcaption>Claws of the Wolf</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4328200-20240702112242_1.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">This Iron Banner event sees two guns added to the loot pool: Claws of the Wolf, the Void pulse rifle, and Crimil's Dagger, a Kinetic hand cannon. Both guns have appeared in Iron Banner before and you might even have versions of them in your vault, but these both can roll some of the new perks that have been added with The Final Shape.</p><p dir="ltr">To unlock the guns, you need to play Iron Banner. They might drop as random rewards for completing matches, but you're guaranteed both new weapons as you level up Lord Saladin's reputation track. Claws of the Wolf unlocks at reputation level 4--you'll probably have that within three matches--and Crimil's Dagger unlocks at level 7.</p><p dir="ltr">Once you've added both guns to your Collections by earning one of each, you're free to focus them in Lord Saladin's vendor menu using Iron Banner engrams you get from playing matches. That allows you to try to get specific rolls for the guns, rather than wait for them to drop as random rewards.</p><p dir="ltr">Like other activities throughout Destiny 2, Iron Banner has a reputation track where you get rewards as you level up. But unlike those other tracks, you can fast-track your Iron Banner rep and earn more rewards more quickly by unlocking multipliers that increase the amount of reputation points you earn for each Iron Banner match you play. There are two main ways to do that: wearing Iron Banner gear and completing Iron Banner challenges.</p><p dir="ltr">The more Iron Banner gear you wear while playing matches, the bigger a bonus you get to your reputation gains. This includes both armor pieces and weapons, up to a total of five--so with an Iron Banner gun and four pieces of armor, you're still able to use an Exotic armor piece for your build. You also get this benefit whether you're <strong>actually using Iron Banner armor</strong> or just <strong>transmogrifying your armor with Iron Banner ornaments</strong>.

All Iron Banner armor now carries the Iron Lord's Pride trait, which gives you a chance of earning an Enhancement Prism at the end of an Iron Banner match. The chance of a Prism dropping stacks with each Iron Banner armor piece you're wearing, up to a total of four pieces, so it can be worth it to actually use the Iron Banner armor, and not just transmogrify for it.</p><p dir="ltr">Iron Banner armor will drop randomly from matches, and you can also focus Iron Banner engrams into armor from Lord Saladin's menu. He offers the option to purchase old Iron Banner ornaments if you missed any over the years, too.</p><p dir="ltr">You also get a reputation bonus for using an Iron Banner emblem while playing in the event, so don't forget to equip one.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Challenges_Offer_Big_Bonuses__But_Not_All_At_Once">Challenges Offer Big Bonuses, But Not All At Once</h3><p dir="ltr">Finally, there are Iron Banner challenges. These are goals that unlock in succession as you play matches, usually focusing on earning kills in a specific way, completing objectives like capturing control points, or winning matches. Each time you complete a challenge, you earn a reputation bonus, and you'll usually do so pretty quickly just by playing the mode normally.</p><p dir="ltr">The only thing to remember about challenges is that they only become available over time, as the Iron Banner mode continues. Thus, you can only complete the first challenge on the first day of Iron Banner; on the second day, two challenges are available, while there are three on the third and four by the fourth, with all four available from then on. So if you have limited time to play Iron Banner, don't overdo it early on in the week--save your heavy playtime for after all four challenges are available.</p><p dir="ltr">You can complete challenges on multiple characters, however, and those challenges are unlocked on the account level. Therefore, if you complete the first challenge on three characters, you'll get three challenge bonuses for any character you play. The total bonuses you can earn from challenges is four, but if you're looking to unlock or gild the Iron Banner seal, you'll want to chase the Triumph for completing all four challenges on three characters in a single event.</p><p dir="ltr">With all the bonuses for challenges, gear, and emblems, you can eventually get your Iron Banner reputation multiplier up to 10x, which can make it very quick to earn rep and even reset your Iron Banner rank. You now have two weeks to do that, making it a little easier to earn that Iron Banner seal and unlock a ton of rewards, too.</p>

The page says Xbox’s account and profile services are experiencing a “major outage.”</p><p>“You may not be able to sign-in to your Xbox profile, may be disconnected while signed in, or have other related problems,” the update says. “Features that require sign-in like most games, apps and social activity won’t be available.” </p><p>Issues with Xbox Live seemed to have started around 2PM ET, with <a href="https://downdetector.com/status/xbox-live/">Downdetector reports</a> beginning to rise around that time.

At around 4:10PM ET, <a href="https://x.com/XboxSupport/status/1808231362702254404">Xbox said</a> its investigation is “taking longer than expected.” <em>The Verge </em>reached out to Microsoft with a request for more information but didn’t immediately hear back.</p><p><em><strong>Update, July 2nd: </strong>Added an update from Xbox.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/15/22979436/elden-ring-speedrunners-world-record-race-30-minutes">speedrunners and content creators have found the best / most busted builds</a>, while the developers haven’t had the time to nerf them yet. People post all kinds of wild videos of bosses melting within seconds, going down so fast they don’t even have time to trigger their second or third phases. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/17/22982776/elden-ring-patch-notes-hoarfrost-stomp-mimic-tear-ashes-nerf">It happened in vanilla <em>Elden Ring</em> with Hoarfrost Stomp</a>, and it’s happening again with <em>Erdtree</em>’s perfume bottles.</p></div><div><figcaption>Erdtree<em>’s lightning perfume bottle weapon in action.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: FromSoftware</cite></p></div><p>I’m typically not one to go after gimmicky builds. I like how I’ve built my character — using a mix of glintstone sorceries, dragon incantations, and melee weapons whose attack power scales with my high intelligence. Such a build was good enough to get me through the base game, so it <em>should</em> be good enough to get me through the DLC. But it’s not, or at least not enough for my patience level. And herein lies some of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24183692/hidetaka-miyazaki-interview-shadow-of-the-erdtree-difficulty">the problem with <em>Erdtree</em>’s difficulty</a>.</p><p>In the base game, bosses were resistant to certain attacks and weak to others, but nothing so much that they couldn’t be beaten no matter what your build was. Rennala didn’t phase me even though she was highly resistant to magic damage; I could still smack her to death with my sword instead of my staff. But it doesn’t feel like that same philosophy has carried over to <em>Erdtree</em>. In the expansion, some bosses feel like they’ve been overtuned to resist certain builds no matter what, forcing players to either completely respec or keep throwing themselves at the boss in hopes of a lucky break. That’s what happened with me and Rellana, Twin Moon Knight. </p><p>She, like her similarly named counterpart from the base game, has a high magic defense. But she’s <em>also</em> resistant to slashing damage, which completely shuts down both my main sources of damage and, in turn, totally negates the way I’ve chosen to play. For a game like <em>Elden Ring</em> — with all of its classes, weapons, spells, and equipment to choose from — every build should be viable when combined with learning the patterns of a boss. I’d feel totally different if, while trying to take her down, I felt I was still making progress against her. But even with a fair number of upgrades to my attack power and finding a combination of weapons and spells that <em>should</em> have worked against her resistances, I still could barely put a dent in her health bar.</p><p>Enough.</p><p>I’d heard that the perfume bottles were broken in <em>Erdtree</em>. I even had one in my inventory after making my way through one of the harrowing gaol dungeons that has some unfortunate implications for our dear pot warrior friend Iron Fist Alexander. So I gave it a shot, figuring I’d use it for this one boss and respec back to my original build.</p><p>I picked up the lightning perfume bottle and the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ash+of+War:+Rolling+Sparks">Rolling Sparks Ash of War</a> and changed my stats to fit them just like I had seen in videos. For a test run, I snuck up on one of those huge armored knights with the big shields and massive hammers — enemies I just run from because, like most elite enemies in <em>Erdtree</em>, they’re too deadly for the scant rewards you earn from killing them. I aimed at his feet, unleashed Rolling Sparks, and... it was like the finger of god reached into the game’s code and hit “delete” on this guy. He just disappeared. Here’s what that looks like in action.</p><p>With my trial successful, it was time for the real test: Rellana. </p><p>Needless to say, it worked.</p><p>I can’t go back now. I don’t <em>want</em> to go back. Having this kind of power at my disposal has completely changed my approach to <em>Erdtree</em>. I do <em>not</em> have to slink around, fearful of every dark corner, or run past anything larger than an electric sheep. </p><p>But I’m not totally fearless. A good sneak attack or recklessness with a boss will take me out. I’m also not all-powerful. I still tend to avoid the uterus monsters and the big flame golems — I don’t want the smoke, you see. The build is also very temperamental. To do the kind of face-melting numbers seen in videos, I can’t lock on in order to aim at my opponent’s feet while praying they don’t move too much. Even though this build is pure grade-A uncut cheese, I don’t feel like I’m cheating. (Besides, according to game director Hidetaka Miyazaki, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/miyazaki-says-finishing-his-elden-ring-playthrough-was-difficult-i-absolutely-suck-at-video-games/1100-6524564/">I’m supposed to use everything at my disposal anyway</a>.) I still have to play <em>Erdtree</em> with the same healthy respect for strategy and my enemies that I did in the base game.</p><p>I know this won’t last. Just like with Hoarfrost Stomp, I’m reasonably assured the perfume build will be depowered to the point of uselessness and I will have to return to my original build.</p><p>But for now, I am deeply enjoying being a walking tactical nuke who smells <em>amazing.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

So let me try to concisely give you some background before we hop into the viral event. </p><h2 id="h34181"><a id=""></a>Who are IShowSpeed and Crawley the TikTok Wizard? </h2><p>Speed is a famous YouTuber, streamer, and rapper primarily known for playing games like <em>Fortnite </em>and <em>NBA 2K</em>. He’s been creating content on YouTube since 2016, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/8aC7S-XPnKA&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/8aC7S-XPnKA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">but started blowing up in 2021</a></span> as clips of him <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/youtuber-streamer-ishowspeed-ban-valorant-riot-keemstar-1848764368&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/youtuber-streamer-ishowspeed-ban-valorant-riot-keemstar-1848764368">yelling at his teammates or the game</a></span> he was playing became more and more popular. (Yes, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dr-disrespect-normal-people-explainer-non-gamer-twitch-1851560300&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dr-disrespect-normal-people-explainer-non-gamer-twitch-1851560300">it’s another streamer</a></span> who became famous for shouting a lot.) </p><p>Anyway, fast forward to 2024 and he has over 25 million subscribers on YouTube and hundreds of thousands of followers on Twitch. He’s become one of the most popular content creators out there and is currently in Europe to watch the 2024 Euro Football Championship. And that’s how he ended up meeting TikTok’s popular wizard.</p><p>Crawley, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/PA1X7hzYMWw&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/PA1X7hzYMWw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">which is the TikTok wizard’s name (please keep up)</a></span>, has been going viral on the video platform since late June. The videos are created by Russian TikTok user Crawley-Possessed and feature him dressed as a tiny gnome-like wizard who <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@crawly_possessed/video/7384959854328237345?is_from_webapp=1&amp;web_id=7263609629661087234&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@crawly_possessed/video/7384959854328237345?is_from_webapp=1&amp;web_id=7263609629661087234" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">crawls around malls</a></span> and other places while wearing a green robe. The videos have millions of views and led to people creating fan art inspired by the odd wizard. And that leads us to their barking match. </p><h2 id="h34182"><a id=""></a>The crossover everyone has been waiting for (I guess...) </h2><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.dexerto.com/youtube/ishowspeed-gets-into-barking-match-with-viral-green-wizard-2805535/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.dexerto.com/youtube/ishowspeed-gets-into-barking-match-with-viral-green-wizard-2805535/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As reported by <em>Dexerto </em>on July 2</a></span>, Speed encountered the TikTok wizard while visiting Poland. Now, I would assume that a young viral content creator like Speed is well aware of Crawley, but maybe not. Regardless, once he sees the tiny wizard he yells “What the fuck is that!” and then hops to the ground on all fours and begins barking at Crawley. </p><p>In response to this action, Crawley begins to make strange—I guess <em>wizard</em> noises—back at Speed and the two do this for an uncomfortable amount of time. At one point Speed grabs the wizard by the shoulders, stands up, and begins barking loudly in Crawley’s face as dozens and dozens of fans look on and cheer. When it’s all over, Crawley shouted back: “You are a knight!” and that’s that. </p><p>The clip has gone viral online, with at least one upload of it racking up nearly 5 million views in less than a day. Reactions are all over the place, with some fans of Crawley upset that he was barked at while others, presumably fans of Speed, find it hilarious and are calling it the ultimate crossover of 2024.</p><div><p>Meanwhile, I’m sitting here just trying to wrap my head around all of this and wondering if it’s time to shut off the internet for a few weeks and let us all calm down for a bit. </p><p>&nbsp;.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
