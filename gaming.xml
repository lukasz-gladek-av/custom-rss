            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24167467/league-of-legends-risen-legend-ahri-bundle-fan-reaction<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="VxH6Rf"><em>League of Legends </em>is free to play, but Riot Games makes money off in-client purchases. If you’re a fan of a specific champion, you can purchase alternate cosmetic skins with new lore. In the mainline lore, Ahri is a nine-tailed fox looking to find the secrets of her people... but with skins, she can be an international star, an evil witch in the woods, or a magical girl squad captain. One new skin has raised a furor among fans, because at its top tier, it costs a whopping $500.</p>
<p id="ZT6qJR">Riot has started a new initiative to honor the <a href="https://halloflegends.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/">best of the best of the <em>League of Legends</em> esports scene in the Hall of Legends</a>, a commemorative list of the game’s greatest figures. The first player to be inducted is an obvious choice: Faker, a multi-time world champion widely considered to be the GOAT. The Hall of Legends comes with an in-game pass, with 100 levels of unlockable rewards. This includes a Risen Legend LeBlanc skin, a ward, banner, and other emotes and icons.</p>
<p id="UKB1LW">The second skin associated with Faker is the one garnering all the controversy. There are three tiers of Ahri skins: Risen Legend, Immortalized Legend, and the Signature Immortalized Legend. These skins can only be unlocked through collections, and the Signature Immortalized Legend Collection is 59260 RP, which is equivalent to around $500. It comes with banners, borders, Faker’s signature on the splash art, a complete event pass, and in-game upgrades to Immortalized Legend Ahri.</p>
<p id="3G2ExI">That’s a hefty price tag, and understandably, fans are shocked. “Sorry to my rioter friends but riot is absolutely batshit with this, NO digital cosmetic is worth 30K or 60K RP. None. Faker is NOT that cool bro,” wrote one player on X. <a href="https://x.com/Kapban2/status/1795623388251344986">Another player posted a Discord convo</a>, in which one participant asks: “Does it come with a fucking handjob from Ahri herself?”</p>

<p id="9loIMB"><a href="https://x.com/KenApplepi/status/1795474762421948779">Other fans noted that it’s ironic to have such an expensive skin</a> to honor Faker, as the player is known to play without any skins. There have been esports skins in the past, but none have ever hit this price tier — and even with their comparatively modest prices, Faker has stated that he <a href="https://x.com/WhatleyLeague/status/1795869047130579204">waits to purchase skins like SKT T1 Ryze when they’re on sale</a>. It’s hard to see the value behind a macrotransaction such as this, especially when $500 could purchase a full console, or several incredible triple-A games. Some fans have joked that they’ll start permanently banning Ahri from their games, ensuring that <em>no one</em> can use the skin, no matter how much it costs.</p>

<p id="9zAEoh">Ahri is a popular champion, and Faker is an icon of <em>League of Legends, </em>but the price point has many fans outraged. Polygon contacted Riot for comment, but did not receive any additional information. It remains to be seen how many superfans pony up for this purchase — and if they end up catching any heat from the rest of the playerbase. </p>

Just don't ask them to play The Pussycat Dolls — they don't take requests, and frankly, the suggestion is kind of offensive. <em>—AJ</em></p>

        </h3>
        <p>A pet harness has to be strong enough to survive years of an energetic dog tugging their human on daily walks. But it also needs to be soft enough to be comfortable for the pup. And ideally, it needs to look nice, because it will be a dog’s daily fashion statement. The Puppia harness does all of the above and comes in a wide variety of styles and colors. Plus, it’s competitively priced. Our first harness lasted six years, and we only bought a new one because the original — while still sturdy and soft — was looking a bit grimy after half a decade of neighborhood hikes. —<em>Chris Plante</em><br> </p>

        </h3>
        <p>While there are a number of styles available, each Fi collar works the same way, using any nearby LTE network to keep tabs on your dog via GPS. AirTags can tell you where your dog is provided they're within 200 feet of an iPhone, but the Fi collar will let you know where they are, no matter how far. While the collar itself is free, the app requires an annual subscription to function. However, if you visit the great outdoors with your dog, or regularly let them off leash, the Fi dog collar is an extra bit of insurance that can pay real dividends. <em>—AJ</em></p>

        </h3>
        <p>A cat scratcher is essential if you own a cat. To keep my cat from destroying every fabric surface in my house, I like to keep a cat scratcher in basically every room. There’s always a better option available than the couch, daybed, curtains, headboard... I can go on. That means I have a lot of cat scratchers — so why not have some fun? My personal favorite is the Boston Bruins hockey rink scratcher, which has a plush puck to play with, a jingling ball to push around the rink, and a scratching board. <em>—Nicole Carpenter</em></p>

        </h3>
        <p>You need pet insurance, and you need to get it early. Most pet insurance carriers are quite similar: They cover most issues, unless they are preexisting. For instance, I took my dog to the vet to get treated for allergies before I got Trupanion, so allergies are considered a preexisting condition. But anything that developed after is fair game. The hot tip is to get it early: Trupanion has saved me spending thousands — like, a lot of thousands — on treatment. <em>—NC</em></p>

        <p>Our cat, Eartha, is what you’d call a micromanager. She’s always watching us work, making sure we’re not oversleeping, and she keeps us on our toes. It should come as no surprise that she loves the Cloud Nine Window Hammock from Tuft and Paw. During summer, she loves sunbathing on this super attractive hammock in the summer months. The hammock attaches with these barely there suction cups that are equal parts supportive (up to 30 pounds) and easy to remove (in case Eartha gets bored of us and wants to watch birds outside instead). <em>—Tercius Bufete</em></p>

There’s also now an option to pause the game in single-player in case you need to take a minute away from the game without fear.</p><p><em>Redfall</em>’s final update also revamps a few of the game’s major systems to be more rewarding and streamlined. The neighborhood system has been retooled and equipped with a new meter called Community Standing, which increases upon “​​unlocking a new Safehouse, completing Safehouse missions, rescuing civilians, or killing an Underboss.” The community standing meter has six ranks that players can blast through, and there are 39 rewards to be earned from completing all of them.</p><p>The updates also introduces elder nests to <em>Redfall</em> which, akin to the heart nests already in the game, are boss-focused arenas that “challenge you to destroy dangerously modified special Vampires.” Completing an elder nest will grant players rewards as well as a temporary buff called a heart shard, which scales in effectiveness to the difficulty of the game. The harder the elder nest encounter, the longer the buff lasts.</p><p>Though the patch notes available aren’t complete, the final update also brings new enemy encounters, improvements to enemy AI, a new weapon, accessibility options, and more. As the update’s been promoted, many Arkane Austin developers, including former creative director <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/arkane-austin-dishonored-closure-harvey-smith-1851463271&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/arkane-austin-dishonored-closure-harvey-smith-1851463271">Harvey Smith</a></span>, have begun spreading news of its arrival and bidding farewell to <em>Redfall</em>, its dedicated community of players, and fans of Arkane Austin.</p><p>Some outside developers, including <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/microsoft-xbox-arkane-evil-within-3-prey-2-layoffs-1851461099&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-xbox-arkane-evil-within-3-prey-2-layoffs-1851461099">Dinga Bakaba</a></span>, director of sister studio Arkane Lyon, have also chimed in to congratulate the team on its hard work and pay respects to the studio as it closes.</p><p><em>Redfall</em>’s final update is obviously a bittersweet one. Arkane Austin was clearly in the middle of addressing the concerns that players raised about the game when it launched last year. If the update is any indication, the team was fully ready to overhaul the game and its systems to improve the experience and make <em>Redfall </em>into the game that many hoped it would be. Now, as it pushes one last update out and closes its doors for good, <em>Redfall </em>will never get the shot to reach the height of its ambitions, and it’s nothing short of tragic.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

You can attach them to your Switch just like Nintendo's official controllers for handheld mode, or you can keep them connected together to have a chunky GameCube-style controller for docked play.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4310301-switchcube-controller.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4310301" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4310301-switchcube-controller.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4310301"></a><figcaption>NYXI Wizard Controller</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4310301-switchcube-controller.jpg"></figure><ul><li><a title="https://www.amazon.com/Switch-Controller-Nintendio-Programmable-Mechanical-Nintendo/dp/B0CLNF52FF" href="https://www.amazon.com/Switch-Controller-Nintendio-Programmable-Mechanical-Nintendo/dp/B0CLNF52FF?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">NYXI Wizard Controller (Black)</a> -- $52.49 ($<strike>70</strike>)</li><li><a title="https://www.amazon.com/Switch-Controller-Nintendio-Programmable-Mechanical-Nintendo/dp/B0CPSBQQ1K" href="https://www.amazon.com/Switch-Controller-Nintendio-Programmable-Mechanical-Nintendo/dp/B0CPSBQQ1K?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">NYXI Wizard Controller (Orange)</a> -- $56 ($<strike>70</strike>)</li><li><a title="https://www.amazon.com/Switch-Controller-Nintendio-Programmable-Mechanical-Nintendo/dp/B0CLNVTN1L" href="https://www.amazon.com/Switch-Controller-Nintendio-Programmable-Mechanical-Nintendo/dp/B0CLNVTN1L?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">NYXI Wizard Controller (Purple)</a> -- $59.50 ($<strike>70</strike>)</li></ul><p>Beyond the familiar shape and input arrangement, the controller also comes with Hall Effect joysticks, which are far more durable and more resistant to drifting than the sticks on a typical Joy-Con. The ABXY face buttons feature customizable color effects that sync with your gaming actions, there are two programmable back buttons, and six-Axis gyroscope motion-sensing technology for games that require twists and turns. Pretty useful for Mario Kart 8!</p><p>Additionally, the programmable buttons have adjustable turbo response and vibration intensity and the mechanical triggers can be fine-tuned to provide rapid-fire accuracy in competitive games. Overall, this makes for a robust and feature-packed controller, especially for when you want to play ports of classic GameCube titles on your Switch. For the colors, you can choose from black, orange, and purple models.</p><p>For a more conventional alternative for handheld play, Switch owners will want to check out the Nitro Deck, a slick cradle for your Switch when you're on the move. This connects to the Switch via the USB-C port on the bottom of the console for faster response times, and other features include Hall Effect joysticks, four programmable back buttons, Bluetooth support, and more. Normally $60, you can grab one now for $45 from a selection of five different colors.

                <p>The final patch for Redfall--the much-maligned co-op shooter from Arkane Austin--has <a href="https://bethesda.net/en/article/57LBTGVNF2rYof6K3yMGLP/redfall-game-update-4-available-now" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">arrived</a>, and it brings a large number of new changes and systems to the game. These include a "Community Standing" mechanic that rewards you for completing objectives, a new type of vampire nest to take down, and the introduction of an offline mode.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/Harvey1966/status/1796203861448983007" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Redfall's final patch is live. Months of work by the team on this, the ReVamp version, and a Herculean effort by all involved over the last few weeks. Big systems refactor, more encounter types. Have fun, always. <a href="https://t.co/ZOBYXMI8jx" rel="nofollow ">https://t.co/ZOBYXMI8jx</a></p>  — Harvey Smith (@Harvey1966) <a href="https://twitter.com/Harvey1966/status/1796203861448983007?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 30, 2024</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">Community Standing is arguably the biggest addition here, as it affects many aspects of Redfall from the ground up. Players will now earn this reputation by unlocking Safehouses, completing Safehouse missions, rescuing civilians, and killing an Underboss. You can then spend this reputation to unlock rewards from the Safehouse Skill Tree, which has 39 different rewards that are tiered through six different ranks.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Redfall Review - Half-Staked</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The new Elder Nest is the other headline inclusion, which are boss-focused encounters that challenge players to defeat particularly difficult vampires. Once you defeat the powerful boss within, you'll receive big rewards, as well as a temporary buff called a Heart Shard, which gives you and your party members a randomized bonus, like holstered weapons regenerating ammo.</p><p dir="ltr">This update also brings a number of quality-of-life changes to the game, including the inclusion of offline mode, which allows you to play the game without being connected to the internet. It adds single-player pausing, so that players no longer have to find a safe corner to hide in to adjust their kit.</p><p dir="ltr">Notably, there are no full patch notes for Update 4, and that the update text states that it has other additions for players to find. This makes sense, given that this is the final patch for Redfall due to the closure of its developer Arkane Austin. Microsoft <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-is-shutting-down-four-studios-including-arkane-austin-and-tango-gameworks/1100-6523227/">shuttered the studio</a> as part of a wave of closures that included Hi-Fi Rush studio Tango Gameworks. Arkane Austin was reportedly pitching an "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arkane-austin-was-pitching-immersive-sim-prior-to-closure-more-cuts-at-xbox-coming-report/1100-6523286/">immersive sim</a>" similar to its previous game Prey before the hammer dropped. Microsoft has stated that Redfall will remain online.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/best-ea-fc-24-icons-for-every-position/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=best-ea-fc-24-icons-for-every-position<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="179" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">This list of best<em> EA FC 24</em> Icons includes legendary names from the world of men’s and women’s football, providing an idea of how to cover your team in every position. </p> <p data-characters="354" data-current-count="354" data-injectable="false">Unlike the last few years, EA Sports has released many more versions of Icons in Ultimate Team. The addition of women’s cards has introduced names like Homare Sawa, Camille Abily, and more, which has resulted in plenty of choices for the players. However, few Icons are always better than their counterparts as far as the in-game meta is concerned.</p> <h2 id="h-best-ea-fc-24-icons-at-every-position" data-injectable="false">Best EA FC 24 Icons at every position</h2> <p data-characters="219" data-current-count="573" data-injectable="true">Icons are always popular choices, as they have great stats and offer bonuses to squad chemistry as well. It’s no wonder that some of the most-used items, even in the esports scene, include the best<em> EA FC 24</em> Icons.</p>
 <ul data-found-items="10" data-current-count="400" data-injectable="true"> <li>GK: Petr Cech (TOTY), Lev Yashin, Iker Casillas (Thunderstruck), Edwin Van Der Star (Birthday)</li> <li>CB: Paolo Maldini (Future Stars), Marcel Desailly (Golazo), Rio Ferdinand (TOTY)</li> <li>RB/RWB: Cafu (Golazo), Carlos Alberto Torres (Birthday), Gianluca Zambrotta (Birthday)</li> <li>LB/LWB: Roberto Carlos (Golazo), Ashley Cole (Golazo)</li> <li>CDM: Patrick Vieira (TOTY), Lothar Matthaus (TOTY)</li> <li>CM: Andrea Pirlo (Birthday), Camille Abily (Birthday), Ruud Gullit (Birthday)</li> <li>CAM: Zinedine Zidane (Birthday), Zico (Future Stars), Kaka (Golazo)</li> <li>LW/LM: Ronaldinho (Future Stars, only at LW), George Best (TOTY)</li> <li>RW/RM: George Best (TOTY), Hristo Stoichkov (Birthday)</li> <li>ST/CF: Pele (Birthday), Cruyff (Golazo), Ronaldo (TOTY)</li> </ul>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via EA Sports</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="194" data-current-count="494" data-injectable="true">Some of these Icons can also be played at alternate positions. Ronaldinho, for example, will do as well as a CAM as he will at LW. Similarly, Pele can also operate as a CAM if utilized properly.</p>
 <p data-characters="270" data-current-count="270" data-injectable="false">That said, this list of the best <em>EA FC 24</em> Icons will eventually undergo some changes. The ongoing TOTS promo hasn’t featured Heroes or Icons. However, the Euro 2024 promo is rumored to be released next in Ultimate Team, and it could feature a new version of Icons.</p> <p data-characters="373" data-current-count="643" data-injectable="false">Do note that if any of the Icons mentioned here get new versions in the future, they will undoubtedly rank among the best. Most of these names on the list of best<em> EA FC 24</em> Icons are there for a reason – they perform well, have solid stats, and they’re top-tier items. Beginners and veterans can rely on them across all the different game modes and difficulties.</p>

<p data-characters="167" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Were you holding off on grabbing <em>Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth</em> until you could get its two discs marked down? Amazon has one lined up for you. How does 20-ish% off sound?</p> <p data-characters="248" data-current-count="248" data-injectable="false">Right now, you can nab <a href="https://geni.us/lhBPaA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><em>Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth</em> from the US Amazon site</a> for $54.99. I’ve checked my home and native land Canada’s site, and it’s marked down to $69.99 Canadian Loonies. It’s also discounted on Amazon in Germany and the UK.</p> <p data-characters="484" data-current-count="732" data-injectable="true">It’s a decent price for a grand and varied adventure. It’s a lot of adventure. Maybe too much. But it’s a very different sort of adventure compared to <em>Final Fantasy VII: Remake</em>. Sure, it still features the same mechanics, characters, and feel. Sure, it’s a continuation of the previous story (and the middle part of a trilogy), but both tonally and in terms of setting, it’s an entirely new ballgame. Also, there’s lots of time to appreciate Barrett. Barrett’s so great.</p>
 <p data-characters="103" data-current-count="103" data-injectable="false">Don’t take my word for it, you can also <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-final-fantasy-7-rebirth/">check out Destructoid’s own Chris Carter’s 9.5/10 review</a>.</p> <p data-characters="333" data-current-count="436" data-injectable="true">There’s no doubt this won’t be the last time you’ll be able to grab it at a discount, but if you’ve been itching to get it without completely depleting your funds, it’s a good opportunity. It probably won’t be permanently reduced for quite a while, especially with ports to other platforms that might be coming next year.</p>
 <p data-characters="140" data-current-count="140" data-injectable="false"><em>Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth</em> is currently available for PS5. Amazon doesn’t say how long the sale will go on, so you may want to jump on it.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/united-states-government-ukraine-game-jam-esports<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Disinformation is the mother of all tricky subjects. How do you counter it in a day and age when anybody can say anything and theoretically gain traction? How do you debunk something millions of people have already seen? And who even decides what constitutes “good information” in the first place? The United States government thinks games can be part of the answer.&nbsp;</p><p>In April, the US Department of State began accepting submissions for <a href="https://www.grants.gov/search-results-detail/353456" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a $1,000,000 grant</a> to help a nonprofit develop “an evergreen game in a sandbox platform, with an existing fan base, in which participants play a game that builds cognitive resilience to authoritarianism and promotes democratic norms and values.” Around the same time, the Department of State also started offering <a href="https://grants.gov/search-results-detail/353454" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a $250,000 grant</a> for a nonprofit to spin up a Ukraine-based esports program in which “athletes will receive counter disinformation/conflict resolution training to confront foreign propaganda and disinformation in competitive online gaming spaces.” While the submission period for those two grants ended on May 22, the government continues to offer $800,000 for a “<a href="https://grants.gov/search-results-detail/353831" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">United with Ukraine game jam</a>” with the goal of creating games that will “increase player skepticism of foreign propaganda and disinformation.”</p><p>These joined other recent government-backed programs that include <a href="https://grants.gov/search-results-detail/353455" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">research of</a> “the scope and scale of foreign propaganda and disinformation occurring in games and game-adjacent platforms in Eastern Europe” and <a href="https://grants.gov/search-results-detail/352956" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an experimental learning program</a> in Turkmenistan that, among other things, aims to organize a Network of Academic and Scholastic Esports Federations (NASEF) “<a href="https://www.nasef.org/farmcraft" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Farmcraft</a>” competition for students ages 10-18. This program “uses the popular game <em>Minecraft </em>to introduce the basics of agricultural science, food security and climate change.”&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>NASEF</figcaption></figure><p>These programs largely focus on Eastern Europe and especially Ukraine due to Russia’s ongoing invasion of the country, which the United States has <a href="https://www.crfb.org/blogs/congressionally-approved-ukraine-aid-totals-175-billion" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spent over $100 billion</a> in aid and military assistance to counter.</p><p>“Since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, so much of the country has been mined and menaced that it is not always safe for children to play outside. For the time being, the future of play in Ukraine will largely be indoors. One popular avenue for safe, indoor play is video games,” a State Department official told Aftermath. “The ability to communicate in games and game-adjacent spaces is an important vector for engaging with hard-to-reach audiences targeted by disinformation narratives, especially Russian youth, to advance our efforts to counter Russian disinformation and propaganda. Russia clearly already understands the power of gaming, as they have deployed their propaganda and disinformation apparatus to spread pro-Kremlin and anti-Ukraine narratives <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/30/technology/russia-propaganda-video-games.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on games</a>. These funding opportunities offer a way to empower Ukrainian storytellers, developers, and gamers to recognize propaganda and disinformation that is commonly spread through games and harness their design skills and playing abilities to effectively push back against it.”</p><figure><blockquote><p>The ability to communicate in games and game-adjacent spaces is an important vector for engaging with hard-to-reach audiences targeted by disinformation narratives, especially Russian youth, to advance our efforts to counter Russian disinformation and propaganda.</p></blockquote></figure><p>These are <a href="https://eca.state.gov/cultural-heritage-center/highlight/UnitedwithUkraine-Game-Jam" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not the first</a> games-focused grants offered by the United States government, but the official told Aftermath that they represent the “largest investment to-date in gaming and digital media literacy” on the part of the Global Engagement Center, an agency within the Department of State that <a href="https://www.state.gov/about-us-global-engagement-center-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">aims to</a> “recognize, understand, expose, and counter foreign state and non-state propaganda and disinformation efforts aimed at undermining or influencing the policies, security, or stability of the United States, its allies, and partner nations.”</p><p><a href="https://www.gamesforchange.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Games for Change</a>, a nonprofit that seeks to use games as a means of achieving social good, has worked with and received funding through the United States government for about half a decade.&nbsp;</p><p>"There have been a couple really effective people within subgroups in the State Department who've championed games, and they've been listened to,” Games for Change executive director Susanna Pollack told Aftermath. “And there's a number of opportunities that have arisen out of the championing of these kinds of opportunities."</p><p>Pollack said that some of those prior government-backed projects took place in Ukraine before Russia’s invasion, including a 2020 game design workshop on how to create “impact games” that offered Ukrainian developers access to US-based experts and culminated in a game jam, as well as an opportunity to pitch projects to potential investors. (One winning team, according to <a href="https://gamesforchange.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/G4C_Ukraine_Serious_Games_Case_Study_v3.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a case study of the event</a>, received a prize of $5,000 to support their game further, along with “$500 USD in Amazon Credits.”)&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Games for Change</figcaption></figure><p>But how effective are<em> </em>government-backed video game programs at achieving their stated goals? Connecting developers in different nations to share tricks of the trade seems straightforward enough, but what about higher-minded concepts like diplomacy and dispelling disinformation? Can games act as a means to achieve those ends?&nbsp;</p><p>The US government’s recent disinformation-related games initiatives draw on the science of “<a href="https://inoculation.science/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prebunking</a>,” which researchers like University of Cambridge professor of social psychology Sander van der Linden suggest can inoculate people against disinformation – unlike debunking, which often, well, doesn’t work.&nbsp;</p><p>"Once you're exposed to a falsehood, it settles in your memory,” Van der Linden said in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jqt7B857ooM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a Cambridge University video</a>. “It makes friends with other things that you know to be true, and people tend to retrieve false info from their memory even when they acknowledge a correction. And so prebunking – trying to preemptively protect people before that damage occurs – is much more effective than debunking."&nbsp;</p><p>The idea, then, is to preemptively expose people to a “weakened” version of false information or a demonstration of the techniques underlying it. Games from the University of Cambridge’s Social Decision-Making Lab, including the US State Department-backed <a href="https://inoculation.science/inoculation-games/harmony-square/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Harmony Square</em></a>, do this by putting players in the shoes of a malicious disinformation agent. In a fictitious setting, they ruin a peaceful, democracy-loving town by posting hyperbolic headlines and stoking online flame wars between citizens. Another State Department-backed game, <a href="https://catpark.game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Cat Park</em></a>, iterates on this idea, again casting players as a media-manipulating sower of chaos, but in a full-blown visual novel with recurring characters and a collection of app-based tools. These games hammer home a series of relatively simple lessons: emotional content over facts, lies are fine as long as they accentuate the feeling of the moment, and memes must be vaguely coherent, if nothing else.&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p>Prebunking – trying to preemptively protect people before that damage occurs – is much more effective than debunking.</p></blockquote></figure><p>These single-player games already come across as a little dated – Twitter tends to be their main point of reference when it comes to interface – and unfold in a linear fashion that sometimes feels like lecturing. They also try not to be too specifically political, opting for lighthearted fantasy scenarios to cast their nets as wide as possible. Of them, <em>Cat Park</em> is the most effective; it lets you mess around with headlines and memes, and it eventually reveals the opportunistic motivation of the forces that have been coaching you through the process of dismantling an otherwise-harmless city park for cats. The game is clear in what it’s trying to convey, where other, similar games get so bogged down in details as to become boring or overwhelming.&nbsp;</p><p>Studies of both<em> </em><a href="https://misinforeview.hks.harvard.edu/article/breaking-harmony-square-a-game-that-inoculates-against-political-misinformation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Harmony Square</em></a> and <a href="https://americanspaces.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/292/22-Cat-Park-Lesson-Plan.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Cat Park</em></a> conducted by the University of Cambridge found that players were more likely to spot disinformation after playing, with the former game leading participants to “find misinformation significantly less reliable after playing,” become “significantly more confident in their assessment” of disinformation, and come away “significantly less likely to report sharing misinformation,” while the latter game resulted in players who were “19 percentage points more likely than a control group to spot disinformation and 15 percentage points less likely to want to share disinformation.”&nbsp;</p><p>That said, these games’ focus on broad, obvious examples makes them feel ill-equipped to inoculate players against what is increasingly becoming the reality of the modern internet: misinformation and disinformation oozing from all cracks, baked not just into contentious or emotional subject matter, but seemingly innocuous memes or entertainment news, with the goal of <a href="https://aftermath.site/sweet-baby-detected-conspiracy-theory-steam" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leading you down whatever the far-right rabbit hole of the week might be</a>. At one point, another, similar game studied by the University of Cambridge, <a href="https://www.getbadnews.com/en/play" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Bad News</em></a>, balked at my decision to deem the headline “Celebrity Accused Of Inappropriate Behavior” as misleading. <a href="https://aftermath.site/its-exhausting-trying-to-read-video-game-website-headlines" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I beg to differ</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The State Department official told Aftermath that <em>Harmony Square</em> and <em>Cat Park</em> have been deployed in educational settings overseas, boasting that the former is available in 18 languages, the latter in 9, and that the two have been played “well over a half million times.” These games will function as a blueprint for more ambitious projects going forward, like the aforementioned “evergreen” game for which the Department of State recently offered $1,000,000.</p><p>“We have been extremely pleased with the success of <em>Cat Park </em>and <em>Harmony Square </em>in reaching foreign audiences, and now see an opportunity to expand this work through the wider world of online gaming overseas,” the State Department official said.&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;</em></p><figure><figcaption>Cat Park</figcaption></figure><p>Mattie Brice, an assistant professor at UC Santa Cruz’s Performance, Play, &amp; Design Department who has <a href="https://www.playistheantidote.com/work" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">helped nonprofits create games and interactive workshops</a>, has her doubts about the broader direction of some of these efforts. She believes they’re too rooted in traditional notions of what constitutes a video game. That, she thinks, will always interfere with their ability to have their desired impact, just as many attempts at so-called gamification teach people to care more about gamified systems than specific skills or subjects. (How else do you explain, for example, <a href="https://kotaku.com/duolingo-app-cheats-hacks-leagues-xp-why-duohacker-1850506482" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Duolingo’s cheating problem</a>?)</p><p>“The majority of game developers who make work for these [nonprofits and non-governmental organizations] are using entertainment product design for video games as their methodology, since frameworks on how to design games at all are relatively new and mostly stem from professional networks and the crossover between game devs and academia,” Brice told Aftermath. “This kind of game design is suited for creating conventional games, but is problematic when you apply this to work that is supposed to literally affect people, such as engaging folk with a particular stance on foreign propaganda.”</p><p>Arguably, many of these programs teeter precariously atop the knife’s edge of <em>being </em>propaganda. Who decides, after all, what constitutes disinformation or propaganda? And who benefits most from these interventions, especially when countries with spotty human rights records are involved?&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2022/07/08/game-exchange-program-games-for-change/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A recent project</a> backed by the Stevens Initiative – which is funded by the State Department and the Bezos Family Foundation, <a href="https://www.stevensinitiative.org/about-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">among others</a> – saw 450 students across the US, Israel, United Arab Emirates, and Bahrain <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2022/07/08/game-exchange-program-games-for-change/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">participate in a 10-week game design program</a> that was meant to “bring these young people from different cultures together as a way to foster communication and understanding,” according to Games for Change’s Pollack.&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p>This kind of game design is suited for creating conventional games, but is problematic when you apply this to work that is supposed to literally affect people, such as engaging folk with a particular stance on foreign propaganda.</p></blockquote></figure><p>"From a US perspective, kids had never heard of a country in which they were paired and where their peers were living, and it gave an opportunity to offer a different lens to four different cultures,” said Pollack.&nbsp;</p><p>She also mentioned that Games for Change has partnered with the US Consulate in the United Arab Emirates to run a Games for Change summit in Abu Dhabi, which is funded by the US State Department and a UAE-backed initiative called Abu Dhabi Gaming. Each year, the event welcomes over 400 developers for talks about topics like “the industry itself, about distribution, about how AI is affecting the games industry, as well as more Games For Change impact-type topics.”</p><p>Broadly, Games for Change hopes to foster diplomacy and a global game development culture, but the aforementioned locations – UAE, Bahrain, and Israel – are eyebrow-raising, to say the least. The former two are notorious for human rights violations, with UAE investing in “a strategy to paint the country as progressive, tolerant, and rights-respecting while carrying out repression against dissent” <a href="https://www.hrw.org/middle-east/north-africa/united-arab-emirates" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to Human Rights Watch</a> (on top of its contributions to the humanitarian crisis in Yemen, <a href="https://www.actionagainsthunger.org/story/after-9-years-of-conflict-yemen-is-still-one-of-the-worlds-worst-humanitarian-crises/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one of the worst of our time</a>), while Bahrain’s authoritarian monarchy, an ally of the United States, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/05/world/middleeast/bahrain-political-prisoners-freed-pardon.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">crushed a pro-democracy uprising</a> in 2011, and <a href="https://www.hrw.org/middle-east/north-africa/bahrain" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">continued</a> to torture, imprison, and kill critics of the government afterward. Israel, meanwhile, has maintained an apartheid state in Gaza for decades and, following a Hamas attack last year that claimed over 1,000 lives, has retaliated with a genocidal assault that has <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/longform/2023/10/9/israel-hamas-war-in-maps-and-charts-live-tracker" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">killed over 35,000 Palestinians</a>.

Saudi Arabia’s playbook has recently expanded to include video games, with the country investing billions in <a href="https://savvygames.com/savvy-games-group-completes-acquisition-of-scopely/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">video game companies</a> and <a href="https://www.jacobwolf.report/p/saudi-statebacked-esports-world-cup-host-league-legends-tournament" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">esports</a> and – as of last week – even <a href="https://aftermath.site/rolling-stone-glixel-savvy-gaming" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">helping Rolling Stone launch a gaming vertical</a>.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Abu Dhabi Gaming</figcaption></figure><p>Despite the potential of video games and game design programs to further countries’ goals of depicting themselves as more humane than they actually are, Games for Change views itself as politically neutral.&nbsp;</p><p>"There's a game developer community in Israel and a much smaller one in <a href="https://aftermath.site/making-a-skating-game-set-in-palestine-has-become-an-act-of-resistance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Palestine</a>. There's one in Ukraine. There's one in Russia,” said Pollack. “There's a universal game developer community that we embrace, regardless of where they are, as long as they are working on games that have some positive impact on the world. That's what really unifies us as a community."</p><p>When it comes to countries with human rights abuses on their records, Pollack hopes Games for Change and other nonprofits working with the United States government can push for improvement from the inside.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>"When we think about working in regions where there are human rights issues, our perspective is that we'd like to be part of the change, and we'd like to help and encourage and empower others to be part of positive influences that could change things culturally,” she said. “So when we come in as Games For Change, we are making a point of bringing women and people of color to speak and positioning them as experts in the field. I think there's a meaningful approach to demonstrating best practices and ways in which we see this industry and how we want to encourage changes that could take place in those regions."</p><figure><blockquote><p>There's a thin line between 'spreading awareness' and propaganda for many social impact games.</p></blockquote></figure><p>Brice, however, is skeptical of this approach.</p><p>“There's a thin line between 'spreading awareness' and propaganda for many social impact games, a huge ethics problem that largely remains unsolved – or not cared about, frankly – by the nonprofit sector of games,” Brice told Aftermath. “Nonprofits that make or commission social impact games instrumentalize games rather than seeing them as a form of expression, though of course they use the aesthetics of games in order to influence people who play them, much like any game designer who is typically trying to influence the player to feel a range of emotions that is often summarized as fun. So you can see why there are not many radical activists in a space that claims to be about social change.”</p><p><em>Thanks to Aftermath subscriber CookieMom for the tip that eventually blossomed into this story.</em></p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/videos/24167860/beasts-of-balance-overboard-jenga-stacking-board-game<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="9TTLyl">A tower of precariously placed objects presents a classic board game conundrum. <em>Jenga</em> is the famous example, but <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/193042/junk-art">many others</a> <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/218129/catch-the-moon">also put dexterity</a> <a href="https://www.polygon.com/videos/23780048/tokyo-highway-table-top-board-game-overboard-lets-play">to the test</a> as players build and deconstruct towers until they inevitably fall over. <em>Beasts of Balance</em> uses that foundation to make something new: a cooperative (or competitive) building game designed around a companion tablet app and RFID reading pedestal. The result is engaging at just about any age.</p>
<p id="BB5Dus">Playing the game is simple: Just grab an artifact (as the game’s pieces are called), scan it on the plinth, and add it to the tower. You can choose from polygonal beasts like eagles and octopi, point juicing elements, or maybe a “cross” piece that combines the points and DNA of two beasts in play. The tablet app helpfully illustrates this by showing you the “hawktopus” you’ve just created, adding it to your compendium of crossbred creatures.</p>

<p id="4gy1IJ">The app works almost seamlessly and we only encountered a few hiccups getting pieces to scan. Most of the time the app integrates well into the experience, tracking your score, showing off your chimeric critters, and even adding additional building challenges. For example, you might need to keep one finger on the app while you place your artifact with your other hand (for extra points, of course).</p>
<p id="2YzlaE">The most thoughtful designs in the game are the artifacts, which are designed to be stacked, hung, and yes, <em>balanced</em> on top of each other. The animal pieces are especially fun to handle, with striking angles and soft-touch plastic. Even without the added gameplay elements of the app, the simple act of stacking pieces is immensely satisfying.</p>
<p id="szLCfK">The game can be played cooperatively, with everyone taking turns selecting artifacts and adding them to the tower. If the tower falls, players have a short time to put it back together before the game ends. Alternatively, players can go head-to-head, swiping each others’ beasts or even making them go extinct.</p>
<p id="OxdD1Y">You can see how both modes work in our Let’s Play at the top of this post.

  <p id="l0iLc1">There’s yet another new SMG in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/modern-warfare-3-guides"><em>Modern Warfare 3</em></a>, this time in the form of the <strong>Superi 46</strong>. While it’s a very solid all-rounder. the Superi 46 doesn’t immediately stand out as having best-in-class stats, but with the right attachments it can compete with some of the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/modern-warfare-3-guides/23912779/best-weapons-guns-call-of-duty-mw3">best guns</a> in the game.</p>
<p id="A6ExzC">This versatility means it can be built out to support any type of playstyle, though in our testing we’ve actually found keeping it as an all-rounder is the best option. It means you can deal with enemies up close while also taking foes down from afar after reducing the recoil and increasing the bullet velocity.</p>
<p id="UM7afK">Here’s the <strong>best Superi 46 loadout in </strong><em><strong>Modern Warfare 3</strong></em><em> </em>and details on how to get your hands on it to begin with.</p>
<hr id="awoEr8">
<h2 id="Zn4o8R"><strong>How to unlock the Superi 46 in MW3</strong></h2>
<p id="kgxUP4"><strong>To unlock the Superi 46 in </strong><em><strong>Modern Warfare 3 </strong></em><strong>Season 4, you must complete Sector 6 in the battle pass. </strong>This is over on the far left of the grid, so the quickest path there from the start is to complete Sectors 1, 2, and 4, followed by 6 above it. As always with new weapons, the Superi 46 is completely free, so you don’t need to fork out money on the battle pass. You just need to play the game enough to earn a sufficient amount of tokens.</p>

<p id="zBrRa8">Here is the <strong>best Superi 46 loadout</strong> in <em>Modern Warfare 3</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li id="c0heS4">
<strong>Barrel: </strong>Houndguard Heavy Barrel</li>
<li id="gjiWwK">
<strong>Underbarrel: </strong>FTAC RS-9 Stealth Angled Grip</li>
<li id="z4Pacx">
<strong>Optic: </strong>Holo Craft Optic</li>
<li id="U2Y507">
<strong>Stock: </strong>Rescue-9 Stock</li>
<li id="trvce5">
<strong>Rear Grip: </strong>Phantom Grip</li>
</ul>
<p id="WOBIJk">Kicking things off is the most impactful attachment here, the <strong>Houndguard Heavy Barrel</strong>. This is the attachment that will allow you to compete in long-range gunfights, as it gives a significant buff to bullet velocity and range. However, the trade-off is that it nerfs a lot of the mobility you’ll get with the Superi 46, so the rest of your loadout will need to account for that.</p>
<p id="eorLPg">The <strong>FTAC RS-9 Stealth Angled Grip</strong> may seem like a slightly unorthodox pick, but it’s for one good reason: The <a href="https://www.polygon.com/modern-warfare-3-guides/23955189/mw3-tactical-stance-tac-stance-get-use-controls">tac stance</a> spread buff. With this build, you’ll want to use the tac stance whenever fighting up close because the <strong>Holo Craft Optic</strong> is geared towards longer-range engagements.</p>
<p id="tmV8Uh">Then we have the <strong>Rescue-9 Stock</strong>, which is a huge help for some of the mobility-based offerings, including your movement speed. It also helps manage recoil, while the <strong>Phantom Grip</strong> is essential for reacting to surprise fights up close. The only downside is the nerf to your flinch resistance, so when you’re fighting at range, you’ll want to be ducking in and out of cover constantly to avoid getting hit.</p>

<p id="SOUMHo">Here is the <strong>best Superi 46 class</strong> in <em>Modern Warfare 3</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li id="7KcwXR">
<strong>Vest: </strong>Modular Assault Rig</li>
<li id="NB8wID">
<strong>Secondary: </strong>Renetti</li>
<li id="o8oCp6">
<strong>Tactical: </strong>Flash Grenade</li>
<li id="VD1Ybt">
<strong>Lethal: </strong>Frag Grenade</li>
<li id="0rjjdS">
<strong>Field Upgrade: </strong>Dead Silence</li>
<li id="Q31stu">
<strong>Gloves: </strong>Marksman Gloves</li>
<li id="yOGKum">
<strong>Boots: </strong>Stalker Boots</li>
<li id="MXzWtS">
<strong>Gear: </strong>Ghost T/V Camo</li>
</ul>
<p id="2ri9qv">The <strong>Modular Assault Rig</strong> is a vest that allows you to carry two lethal and tactical grenades, and you can have equipment in every slot. You also spawn with max ammo and you can resupply your grenades from dead players, so you’ll basically never run out, even when you’re on a streak. In the secondary slot, go for the standard <strong>Renetti</strong> because it’s so reliable. Do the same for both grenades: You can’t beat the classics, so the <strong>Flash</strong> and <strong>Frag Grenades</strong> are your best bet.</p>
<p id="qU5rQa">In the field upgrade slot, equip <strong>Dead Silence</strong>. This may seem like a slightly odd choice, but footsteps are quite loud in <em>Modern Warfare 3</em>, so making them as quiet as possible is helpful, especially with a build like this where you’ll often be flanking and moving from one position to the next.</p>
<p id="1FxScI">The <strong>Marksman Gloves</strong> assist at long range, especially in helping to regain some of that flinch resistance lost with the Phantom Grip, while the <strong>Stalker Boots</strong> improve your movement speed while strafing and aiming down the sights. Finally, much like Dead Silence, the <strong>Ghost T/V Camo</strong> assists your stealthiness as it means you can’t be seen by UAVs or enemy radar sources when you’re moving.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24167466/cuckoo-director-tilman-singer-preview-interview-hunter-schafer<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="ISa1Jd">Sam Levinson’s drama series <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22950817/euphoria-recaps-memes-social-media-internet-watch-party"><em>Euphoria</em></a> has been a spectacular launching pad for new movie stars, with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24091605/dune-2-zendaya-movie-star-best-performance">Zendaya</a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24099874/immaculate-review-sydney-sweeney-nun-movie">Sydney Sweeney</a>, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24030564/saltburn-what-happens-fandom-explained-tiktok">Jacob Elordi</a> all seeing their film careers take off after the show’s first season. Hunter Schafer is the latest <em>Euphoria</em> player heading for film stardom, with her first leading role coming up in Neon’s late-summer horror movie <em>Cuckoo</em>. Schafer plays Gretchen, an American teenager reluctantly joining her father, stepmother, and mute half-sister at a remote German resort run by a deeply creepy man (<em>The Guest</em>’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24133463/abigail-review-horror-comedy-vampires-scream">Dan Stevens</a>) whose excessively friendly front is obviously hiding some deeper motivations.</p>
<p id="E2d89T">It’s a dark, strange movie, built around a central character who’s initially hard to like, then impossible not to root for as she takes more and more physical abuse and the odds stack up against her. And given the distinct gap between how the first trailer portrays the film and what’s really going on, <em>Cuckoo</em> is likely to be a significant surprise for a lot of viewers. Avoid spoilers if you can. (You won’t find any below.)</p>
<div id="3Opru1"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NuON7HH0UkQ?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="3AiTyn">Writer-director Tilman Singer, a German-born filmmaker making his second feature-length project after 2018’s horror-mystery <em>Luz</em>, told Polygon in a pre-release interview that he cast Schafer for the movie years ago, before the first season of <em>Euphoria</em> had even aired. When COVID-19 delayed his production, though, he was gratified to see her building a fan base through the series — because while <em>Cuckoo</em> is an R-rated movie, he’s stealthily hoping that younger teenagers find ways to slip into a theater and see it.</p>
<p id="TXuMqX">“We had to push [production] one more time because <em>Euphoria</em> was shooting season 2, and by then, it was super hype,” Singer said. “We knew all of that was really, really good for us. It made me happy, because first and foremost, I thought, <em>Wow, she has a </em>lot<em> of young fans, and these young people may go watch our weird movie.</em> I remember when I was a young teenager, the first really weird, strange movies I saw, that kind of overwhelmed me, that I didn’t fully understand at the time — I was so thankful that happened to me. I was fantasizing that something like that happens to other young people now, with our movie.”</p>
<p id="raL4zb">While <em>Cuckoo</em>’s initial festival run produced a number of reviews comparing it to movies like Stanley Kubrick’s <em>The Shining </em>and Ari Aster’s <em>Hereditary</em>, Singer would rather people didn’t call it “2024’s <em>Hereditary</em>” — he says he’d rather people call it “2024’s film that young people managed to sneak into and see too early.”</p>

<p id="wpGt6J">Singer looks back with a particular joy at movies that he saw “too early,” like Alex Cox’s 1984 cult movie <em>Repo Man</em>. “I love that movie,” he said. “I was, like, 14. My uncle gave it to me on VHS in English. My English was really bad. But I was into punk music, and I just watched it over and over. I had no fucking idea what was going on. The other one — around the same age, I watched David Lynch’s <em>Lost Highway</em>. And these just opened me up. So that’s a beautiful thing.”</p>
<p id="1lm7LR">He compares the sensation of this kind of formative, often illicit cult-movie experience to having your heart or brain torn open. “Sometimes, something hits you with a force, because you’re not used to hearing or seeing [anything like] that, and it just cracks open your skull,” he said. “[…] I think that’s one of the most formative and beautiful things.”</p>
<p id="9W0B7Z">Will <em>Cuckoo</em> hit young viewers that way? It’s certainly possible. Singer’s horror movie is a singular film, full of narrative surprises, an intense and emotional central performance from Schafer, a terrific mystery in Stevens’ character, and vivid images that stick in the memory long after the final shot. Singer shot <em>Cuckoo </em>on 35mm film because, as he told Polygon, he prefers the “big choices” of having to pick lighting and framing in advance for a limited number of shots over “all the little trial-and-error choices” of real-time, on-set digital manipulation. That gives the film a lush, hyper-real look that, again, may remind viewers of <em>The Shining</em>.</p>
<p id="ny6qwB">Singer is fine with the comparison — he says<em> The Shining</em> was just one of the influences pressing on him as he made <em>Cuckoo</em>, but it was certainly an influence. “I absolutely watched it a billion times,” he laughs. “Then when we were on location, scouting, and I found this large hall that we turned into our hotel reception lobby, <em>The Shining</em> just <em>washed</em> over me. I was like, ‘Oh my God, we <em>have</em> to shoot here, <em>we have to shoot here</em>!’ Our production designer was like, ‘This place is in disarray. This place will fall apart.’ And I was like, ‘We don’t even have to do anything! The patina is already there!’ They were like, ‘Yeah, we do have to do <em>one or two things</em> here.’”</p>

<p id="ve7lOE">Singer says all old hotels “always have something ominous to them,” and anything shot in an old hotel is likely to take longtime horror fans back to Kubrick’s movie. But he hopes horror fans see his other influences in <em>Cuckoo</em> as well.</p>
<p id="4SPFJS">“Especially with a movie that feels so much like it wears its influences directly, you know, on its face,” he says. “I think that’s just what I do. I tend to write really unconsciously, to tap into my subconscious and let it flow, and then later understand what [I’ve written], and form it together with the actors. With that process, it’s just like a ton of visuals and sounds and structure pours out of my head.” </p>
<p id="iRpXDF">One thing he approaches a little more consciously, though, is a conviction that horror movies need some sense of hope. “I wanted to make a horror film, or a thriller with horror elements, or however you want to call it, that is not as grim, and not as spiraling down into an absolute doomsday scenario,” he told Polygon. “I think horror is a very beautiful genre, because horror is effectively forcing you to face death, or all the incarnations of death. It could be violence, sexual violence, all of this stuff? And the only remedy to death is a form of religion.”</p>
<p id="A3XNOA">Singer was quick to clarify that he doesn’t mean organized religion: “I’m not talking about Christianity or Islam or something. I’m talking about a higher sense for humans. How to deal with death. You could call it love, you could call it music, whatever. I think <em>Cuckoo</em> has a lot of that idea — we can overcome death, or if not overcome it, just live with it. I’m not going to spoil the last shot, and it’s not that crazy if you just described it. But that very last shot for me is the essence of the whole movie.” </p>

<p>Wouldn’t it be nice to live in a world where exclusivity was eliminated altogether? When a game launches, it is released to all available systems so that everyone can enjoy the experience. Unfortunately, that’s an idealistic dream. There’s money to be made by launching a console-exclusive title. That brings us to Stellar Blade. Will Stellar Blade come to PC?</p>



<h2 id="h-is-stellar-blade-coming-to-pc">Is Stellar Blade Coming to PC?</h2>



<p>Currently, there is no confirmation or information surrounding a PC release of Stellar Blade. Of course, it’s likely to happen, as most console exclusives wind up coming to the PC, but it’s a matter of time and money. Will Sony want to port the game to another platform? Yeah, likely.</p>



<p>We suspect Stellar Blade will eventually be on Steam. Most PlayStation exclusives wind up on the Valve-owned platform; we must remain patient and show Sony that we don’t mind waiting.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-long-does-it-take-for-playstation-exclusives-to-launch-on-pc">How Long Does it Take for PlayStation Exclusives to Launch on PC?</h2>



<p>For the most part, a PlayStation-exclusive title takes approximately one to two years to launch on PC. If we look at games such as Horizon Forbidden West, it was around two years before the console exclusivity ended. That said, it took Ghost of Tsushima four years to launch on PC. </p>



<p>There is, unfortunately, no concrete window. I mean, look at Bloodborne. There’s likely more going on behind the scenes, but Bloodborne on PC is one of the most requested titles in history, but it’s still not happening.</p>



<p>We could wait two or more years before Stellar Blade comes to Steam!</p>

                <p>Ahead of the launch of The Final Shape expansion next week, Bungie has unveiled a Dungeons &amp; Dragons crossover for Destiny 2. Like previous collaborations, players will be able to don stylish armor sets inspired by the popular tabletop game franchise, including Faerûn inspired armor for all classes. The new armor sets include the Apex Draconic set for Titans, the Spectral Displacer set for Hunters, and the Flayer’s Dominion set for Warlocks. There'll also be an Owlbear Chariot, Queen of Dragons ship, the Eye Tyrant Ghost Shell, and more added to Destiny 2 when the crossover rolls out.</p><p>It's worth noting that these are purely cosmetic pieces of armor and they have no effect on your gear's stats or properties. These premium armor ornaments typically require you to spend some cash to own them and previous collaborations have been priced at 2,000 Silver, or around $20 in real-world cash. This isn't the first time Destiny 2 has crossed over with another popular franchise, as previous team-ups have seen <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-mass-effect-crossover-brings-some-stylish-n7-fashion-to-the-game/1100-6520702/" data-ref-id="1100-6520702">Mass Effect</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-adding-the-witcher-skins-with-season-of-the-wish-launch/1100-6519381/" data-ref-id="1100-6519381">The Witcher</a>, and Fortnite armor sets added to the game for a limited time.</p>

<p data-characters="270" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">I’ve always looked past <em>Call of Duty </em>Blackcell bundles, mostly because I don’t feel like breaking the bank with its paywall. But, with the release of <em>MW3</em> and <em>Warzone</em> <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/mw3-season-4-early-patch-notes-new-maps-modes-killstreaks-and-equipment-items/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 4</a>, that has since changed with the thieving abilities of the Copy and Dupe Operators.</p> <p data-characters="430" data-current-count="430" data-injectable="true">What makes them so extraordinary is their Identity Theft Finishing Move, which can steal another player’s skin and place it on to your own Operator. So, if you see someone causing havoc as <em>The Boys’</em> Homelander, you can put ’em in their place by taking and using their skin. <em>Call of Duty</em> reposted a snippet of what it looks like in action, where the player Speros copies the skin of an unfortunate <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/warzone-and-mw3-players-question-not-banning-ranked-play-cheaters-completely/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Warzone </em>player</a>.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="221" data-current-count="521" data-injectable="true">While the result of copying the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/yes-its-real-gundam-is-coming-to-call-of-duty/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Operator skins</a> is the primary show-stopper, it doesn’t hurt that the ability just looks cool. It’s as if Copy or Dupe are sucking the life out of someone, using a cloudy effect.</p>
 <p data-characters="257" data-current-count="257" data-injectable="false">The only downside is that the Blackcell Operator’s stealing technique is temporary. That means you’ll immediately lose out on the skin upon death. However, it could bring about a challenge to see how long you can last with a particular Operator.</p> <p data-characters="169" data-current-count="426" data-injectable="true">The Blackcell bundle will also still cost you, going for a price of $29.99 in the COD shop. This comes with the Season 4 Battle Pass, too, and a few more valuable gear. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="211" data-current-count="511" data-injectable="false">Despite its paywall, getting ahold of Copy and Dupe in <em>MW3</em> and <em>Warzone</em> could be worth it. You could think of it as an investment, since it gives you other exclusive skins for free, at least in a temporary sense.</p>

<p data-characters="177" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">In collaboration with Treyarch, Sledgehammer Games made substantial changes in the past two <em>Modern Warfare 3 </em>updates, which have major implications for the <em>Call of Duty League</em>. </p> <p data-characters="504" data-current-count="504" data-injectable="true">As part of the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/mw3-season-4-early-patch-notes-new-maps-modes-killstreaks-and-equipment-items/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 4 update</a>, <em>Modern Warfare 3 </em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/mw3-season-4-change-pushes-players-away-from-using-covert-sneakers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">decreased footstep sounds</a> for enemies, reworked the Hardpoint hills on 6 Star to exclude the pool point, removed exploding propane barrels on Highrise, buffed the MCW headshot multiplier, buffed Rival-9 damage ranges, and buffed the Cruise Missile damage range. Going back even further, the Trophy System was reworked in the Season 3 Reloaded update to be destroyed in two shots instead of three and the entire Boots Perk category saw a massive overhaul. </p>
 <p data-characters="384" data-current-count="384" data-injectable="false">Dexerto’s Jacob Hale <a href="https://x.com/JakeHaleee/status/1795827934571508109" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">says</a> <em>Call of Duty League </em>Major 4 will be played on the latest patch. This means all of these changes will be present in league matches starting on Friday. Previously, the <em>Call of Duty League</em> used an old patch and didn’t use the Season 3 or Season 3 Reloaded updates, and there was no guarantee that the pro players would use the latest update either. </p> <p data-characters="558" data-current-count="942" data-injectable="true">Because enemy footsteps make less noise, we will likely see professional players experiment with new Boots since Covert Sneakers eliminating footstep audio is no longer as important. And there will be plenty of options given the buffs to other Boot options in Season 3 Reloaded. In addition, it will be interesting to see how the Rival-9 and MCW changes have on SMG and AR players and how they stack up statistically against each other. Lastly, matches should flow better, given the 6 Star rotation changes, and players will die less frequently on Highrise. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Season 4 comp changes: </p><p>– Footstep sounds decreased<br>– 6 Star HP: hills reworked (no pool)<br>– Highrise: exploding Propane removed 🙌<br>– MCW headshot multi buff<br>– Rival-9 damage ranges buff<br>– Cruise missile damage radius buff <a href="https://t.co/8Lm6BZACc8">pic.twitter.com/8Lm6BZACc8</a></p></div>— Breaking Point (@GGBreakingPoint) <a href="https://twitter.com/GGBreakingPoint/status/1795841826773164069?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 29, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure> <p data-characters="337" data-current-count="637" data-injectable="true">Historically, the <em>Call of Duty</em> League doesn’t rotate new maps or weapons into its regular rotation. Treyarch has been much more active during the <em>Modern Warfare 3</em> season, keeping the viewing experience fresh and exciting. It all started in late March, as Ranked Play hosted a <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/call-of-duty-league-makes-massive-map-pool-changes-ahead-of-major-3-qualifiers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">public playtest</a> to experiment with new potential maps. </p>
 <p data-characters="381" data-current-count="381" data-injectable="false">A mix of player and professional player feedback resulted in the<em> Call of Duty League </em>adding Vista and 6 Star in place of Invasion and Skidrow. Then, Treyarch held a public playtest in Ranked Play to test out new weapons to potentially replace the Rival-9 and MCW. This trial didn’t amount to any changes, yet its still promising to see future changes aren’t ruled out. </p>

<p data-characters="207" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The Wojciech Szczesny Serie A TOTS SBC is now available in <em>EA FC 24</em> Ultimate Team. After a long wait, EA Sports has released a goalkeeper SBC, perhaps wonderful news for those who have Serie A-based items. </p> <p data-characters="227" data-current-count="227" data-injectable="false">Szczesny also becomes the last Serie A TOTS release, as the promo will expire tomorrow on May 31. To get this card, all you need to do is complete the tasks associated with the SBC before it’s removed from Ultimate Team. </p> <h2 id="h-what-are-the-ea-fc-24-wojciech-szczesny-serie-a-tots-sbc-tasks" data-injectable="false">What are the EA FC 24 Wojciech Szczesny Serie A TOTS SBC tasks?</h2> <p data-characters="208" data-current-count="435" data-injectable="true">The latest TOTS challenge has only one task, and the conditions are pretty simple as well. As this SBC is easy to complete, beginners should aim to complete this one — especially if they need a goalkeeper. </p>

With so many objectives currently available in Ultimate Team, completing this challenge shouldn’t be an issue for anyone. </p>

 <p data-characters="302" data-current-count="302" data-injectable="false">After completing the challenge, you get a 94-rated GK item.

One such amazing challenge is the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ea-fc-24-henrikh-mkhitaryan-tots-sbc-solutions-tasks/">Henrikh Mkhitaryan SBC</a>, which features an excellent card. </p>

<p>It is the closest thing to a full on <em>Monster Manuel</em> the Essence20 system has received so far, containing tons of interesting tokusatsu threats as well as more tailored threat creation rules for GMs.</p>

<p>And for Essence20 GMs out there, I do highly recommend this book. Not just for how it translates various fan favorite monsters to the system, as well as repurpose characters and elements seen in <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/power-rangers-heroes-of-grid-review"><em>Heroes of the Grid</em></a>, but for the wellspring of inspiration those monsters' unique Perks and Powers can spark.</p>

<p>While there is plenty of creativity found in this 303 page book, ten of those threats personally stood head and shoulders over the rest.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/finsters-monster-matic-cookbook-craterite-artwork.jpg?itok=9Ke2ctwY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/finsters-monster-matic-cookbook-craterite-artwork.jpg?itok=3Dvqdb-P 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This is what happens when the holodeck fails</figcaption></figure><h2>10. The Craterites</h2>

<p>The Craterites are a somewhat obscure monster from <em>Power Rangers in Space</em>. They are essentially hardlight projections of a training program gone horribly wrong. They are also the first monster in the series to be made up of several smaller versions of itself.</p>

<p>This is reflected in their respective statblocks. A group of Craterites has a Leader among their ranks. At any point in a fight, this Leader can command the swarm to form on them and combine.</p>

<p>Once all the Craterites reach the leader, they turn into a gigantic Craterite Conglomerate.This conglomerate gets various bonuses and extra health based on how many minions make it up.</p>

<p>Not only is it a novel take on a monster of the week, it adds some new dynamics to handling minions and navigating a scene.</p>

<p>Plus, it might just inspire similar hivemind monsters at your own table.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/finsters-monster-matic-cookbook-death-revenant-artwork.jpg?itok=FviEltSA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/finsters-monster-matic-cookbook-death-revenant-artwork.jpg?itok=wRKypWxn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Kill it with fire.</figcaption></figure><h2>9. The Death Revenants</h2>

<p>A Threat from the Boom! Studios comic continuity, the Death Revenants are reanimated dead, made to serve a dark master like the Death Ranger or Necrolai.</p>

<p>They are also the perfect template for having zombies in your campaign. With some reflavoring, they are perfect cannon fodder for Halloween or horror-themed one-shot adventures.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/finsters-monster-matic-cookbook-rinshi-warrior-artwork.jpg?itok=pdVhzr7t 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/finsters-monster-matic-cookbook-rinshi-warrior-artwork.jpg?itok=sl-eF6QQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It might turn into a toad monster or a scorpion. Really.</figcaption></figure><h2>8. The Rinshi Warriors</h2>

<p>The elite footsoldiers of Dai Shi from <em>Power Rangers Jungle Fury</em>, the Rinshi Warriors are another minion with a really novel spin.</p>

<p>In addition to a Perk that gives them Edge against targets suffering certain conditions, the Rinshi Warriors can transform into a different Threat once they hit a certain amount of health.</p>

<p>These different forms are also in <em>Finster's Monster-Matic Cookbook</em>. There is even a handy chart for GMs to roll.</p>

<p>And with some extra work, it's a wonderful framework for GMs that want to spice up late game encounters against minions.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/finsters-monster-matic-cookbook-blobgoblin-artwork.jpg?itok=13sBSOYx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/finsters-monster-matic-cookbook-blobgoblin-artwork.jpg?itok=dwXx_SeR 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>My favorite kind of monster. Silly looking but secretly dangerous.</figcaption></figure><h2>7. Blobgoblin</h2>

<p>Blobgoblin is a great early threat for GMs that want to lean more into playful mischief. His whole gimmick isn't being a direct powerhouse, but being an amorphous blob that can take over electronics, vehicles, and even Zords if given enough time. Like a superhero take on <em>Poltergeist</em>.</p>

<p>It's just the right level of impish and fun that can spice up any table.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/finsters-monster-matic-cookbook-dramole-artwork.jpg?itok=M7cGnPPf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/finsters-monster-matic-cookbook-dramole-artwork.jpg?itok=jfHO66cX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>He has a perk called Surprise. Guess why?</figcaption></figure><h2>6. Dramole</h2>

<p>Dramole is a classic <em>Mighty Morphin'</em> monster, one that is great to throw at early to mid game players that might lean too hard on combat stats.</p>

<p>Not only can Dramole burrow through the ground and turn out the lights, he has various attacks and powers that target Willpower Defense. Those same attacks and powers can mesmerize or disorient the team, forcing them to rethink their battle strategy.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/finsters-monster-matic-cookbook-gravezord.jpg?itok=t2yqBtSG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/finsters-monster-matic-cookbook-gravezord.jpg?itok=8xrvJlu- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>What happens when the villains repurpose destroyed Zords?</figcaption></figure><h2>5. The Gravezord</h2>

<p>Another Boom! Studios original, the Gravezord is exactly what it sounds like. A Frankenstein's monster of various Zord parts cobbled together into a war machine.</p>

<p>Not only is it a powerful mid game threat, it is the perfect template for an evil mech piloted by the bad guys. High defense, solid damage, and it even has some creative hang-ups to help players think outside the box.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/finsters-monster-matic-cookbook-kamdor-artwork.jpg?itok=s84hqH9J 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/finsters-monster-matic-cookbook-kamdor-artwork.jpg?itok=eyoaiuCA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>He'll honor a one on one duel, but treat you like a dog.</figcaption></figure><h2>4. Kamdor, Master of Miratrix</h2>

<p><em>Operation Overdrive's</em> Kamdor is a peak example of the “dark knight” monster in <em>Finster's Monster-Matic Cookbook</em>. An extremely powerful general to the big bad that is characterized by some sort of warrior code of honor.</p>

<p>This nobility can add a lot of character to the usual menagerie of mindless monsters and maniacal despots.</p>

<p>Plus, his Hang-Ups give him just the right level of arrogance to make him novel to face. Whether you use him as is or as a template, Kamdor is a standout.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/finsters-monster-matic-cookbook-lord-drakkon.jpg?itok=c_sLjpfS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/finsters-monster-matic-cookbook-lord-drakkon.jpg?itok=glt5EnqK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The face of a man that lead a war against multiple dimensions</figcaption></figure><h2>3. Lord Drakkon and His Forces</h2>

<p>Taking number three in this list is the iconic Lord Drakkon from the Boom! Studios comic crossover event, <em>Shattered Grid</em>.</p>

<p>As an endgame Threat, Drakkon is a beast. Not only does he have defenses over 20 across the board, he is more than capable of downing an entire team with just a few attacks.</p>

<p>On top of that, he has his own Personal Power pool, allowing him to mind control teammates and even shut down characters from using their own Personal Power pools.</p>

<p>But Lord Drakkon isn't alone in this book. Every one of his generals and soldiers are also in <em>Finster's Monster-Matic Cookbook</em>. The Ranger Slayer, Black Dragon, nine different types of Ranger Sentry, and even some of his war zords all have statblocks.</p>

<p>And since Drakkon is an interdimensional threat, this means you could have his attempt to conquer the world the focus of an entire campaign arc. It's all here, in this book, ready to go.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/finsters-monster-matic-cookbook-rita-repulsa-artwork.jpg?itok=zfmud7ov 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/finsters-monster-matic-cookbook-rita-repulsa-artwork.jpg?itok=mUSnQ03B 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>What spell is she conjuring now? Seriously, I don't know.</figcaption></figure><h2>2. Rita Repulsa &amp; Lord Zedd</h2>

<p>The absence of the most iconic evil power couple in the franchise from the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/power-rangers-roleplaying-game-review"><em>Power Rangers Core Rulebook</em></a> has finally been corrected in <em>Finster's Monster-Matic Cookbook</em>. And it was worth the wait.</p>

<p>What makes both of them the stuff of legend as endgame Threats are how they showcase this supplement's brand new Sorcerous Magic system. This point-buy system lets you make surprisingly tailored spells, powers, and attacks with the trade-off of some skill tests costing the caster some health.</p>

<p>Rita and Zedd embody this magical cruelty. Massive area of effect blasts. Ongoing auras that inflict conditions and sap Personal Power. And, of course, the ability to instantly make themselves or an ally grow to gigantic size and escalate the battle.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/finsters-monster-matic-cookbook-finster-and-psycho-rangers.jpg?itok=5lqBTsWZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/finsters-monster-matic-cookbook-finster-and-psycho-rangers.jpg?itok=p4FQJiWD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Let's see, how can I make them more bloodthirsty?</figcaption></figure><h2>1. The Psycho Rangers</h2>

<p>If you are familiar with the Essence20 supplements released for <em>Power Rangers</em> so far, The Psycho Rangers appearing in <em>Finster's Monster-Matic Cookbook</em> might surprise you.</p>

<p>The Psycho Rangers already have statblocks. They were introduced in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/power-rangers-across-stars-review"><em>Across The Stars</em></a> supplement. In fact, those statblocks were perfect in portraying them in the game.</p>

<p>Well, in <em>Finster's Monster-Matic Cookbook</em>, there are rules for making your own Psycho Rangers. All six Psychos have their own Player Roles in this book, all themed around different forms of antisocial or psychotic behavior.</p>

<p>Not only are these rules great for making darker, alternative ranger PCs, it is also a great way to make bespoke GM-controlled PCs as Threats. Want a dark counterpart to the group's outgoing extrovert? The Path of Stone's emotionally dead bruiser is right there. Want to contrast with the empathic caregiver in the group? The Path of Cruelty's sadistic streak works just fine.</p>

<p>The new Psycho Ranger Roles are one of the biggest additions <em>Finster's Monster-Matic Cookbook</em> brings to the game, giving not just the GM options for threats, but players options to embrace their dark side as well.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24167967/life-eater-strange-scaffold-stalking-horror-game<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="EVofsr">Most games’ protagonists are heroes, gunning down bad guys or trying to save the princess. You could argue the protagonist of <em>Life Eater</em> is kind of like a hero. Sure, he stalks people relentlessly before murdering them in the service of a dark god. But if he didn’t do that, the world would end. So really, when you think about it, this is a noble mission — and by enacting Zimforth’s will, I’m saving the world.</p>
<p id="3Z41vf"><em>Life Eater</em> is a weird little game that is unlike anything I’ve ever played before. When I first played it upon its release in April, I noticed the striking visuals and audio effects, and the short cutscenes between campaign chapters sent chills down my spine, but I found the actual meat and potatoes of the game to be fairly minimal. </p>
<p id="wicyLB">Here’s how it works: I get presented with targets, each of whom has their own schedule. Each victim’s personal timetable starts out blank; I have to uncover the details of my victim’s life by poking and prodding at them. For instance, I can discover that my target has breakfast at around 9 a.m. by leisurely rattling their doorknob and then scampering away. Hacking into their computer gives me a hint as to their weekend habits, and hiding in the bushes is a good way to learn whether they commute or not. It’s only when I truly understand the victim and their schedule that I can strike, sacrificing them in the dark to buy our world another year of peace.</p>

<p id="IQOP9N">At first, I bounced off <em>Life Eater</em> hard. The ending ritual to sacrifice the victim would always be the same — remove <em>this</em> organ if they have a commute, and break <em>this</em> rib if they slept a certain number of hours per day. It took a lot of the joy out of poring over a victim’s life, because I always knew the exact facts I needed to gather, so I had little curiosity to do anything else. The campaign also introduces multiple targets early on, but some of them are innocent and must not be touched. I had a hard time ascertaining which person was the “right” sacrifice, and eventually I grew frustrated with the game and put it down, thinking it was ambitious and admirable but not for me.</p>
<p id="EIVmjr">A recent update from developer Strange Scaffold has changed things. The ending sacrifice is now much more varied, and now I want to go into the ritual with as much information as I can possibly glean. Furthermore, a new Endless Mode has been added to the game, and I found this to be a good way to practice my stalking skills. After a few rounds of Endless Mode, I felt like I could tackle the campaign, and the narrative weight of the story finally got its claws into me. </p>

<p id="LGqixG">The trick to <em>Life Eater</em> is that every action takes time, which is a finite resource, of course. Furthermore, a failed action raises suspicion — if I try to break into someone’s house and they catch me, I’m at risk of being discovered and possibly stopped by the police. I can ease suspicion by doing any number of non-stalker actions, like going to work, sleeping, or socializing… but that burns into my time, and if the clock hits zero without me performing the necessary sacrifice(s), the world ends.</p>
<p id="Lgu4rq">The minimal style of the game pays dividends here, because each one of the procedurally generated victims can end up being relatively complex. The game never straight up <em>tells</em> you if someone lives alone — but I can review the information I’ve uncovered and see the blocks of time where the victim is alone and figure out whether they have company at any given hour of the day. And sometimes I find some truly grisly secrets, like a Saturday ritual where my target goes to the woods to drink blood with their buddies. It’s a game that actually makes me <em>feel</em> like a stalker, which is a truly novel horror experience. </p>

<p>While initial plans placed Marvel Rivals firmly in the PC camp, it appears that’s about to change with an upcoming announcement. The word around town is that Marvel Rivals is coming to consoles, including PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. So, when can we play Marvel Rivals on Xbox?</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-marvel-rivals-on-xbox-series-x-s">Can You Play Marvel Rivals on Xbox Series X|S?</h2>



<p>Following various leaks on social media and mysterious code appearing on the game’s official website, it seems Marvel Rivals on Xbox Series X|S isn’t a pipedream. It’s happening; it’s just a matter of when.</p>



<p>Throughout the next few weeks, we have numerous upcoming gaming events, including the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-the-playstation-showcase-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation State of Play</a> and the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-the-xbox-showcase-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Games Showcase</a>. These events, along with Summer Game Fest, would provide the perfect stage for developer NetEase Games to announce console versions of Marvel Rivals. </p>







<h2 id="h-does-marvel-rivals-support-cross-platform-play">Does Marvel Rivals Support Cross-Platform Play?</h2>



<p>While we’re pretty sure of the upcoming console versions of Marvel Rivals, there’s no official word from the developer yet. As such, there is no official cross-platform support for Marvel Rivals, but it’s coming. There’s code within the PC version indicating crossplay and cross-platform functionality between PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>



<p>Since the basis is already in place, this functionality will likely become activated when the game officially launches on all three systems. In this case, I don’t suspect we’ll have to wait for a post-launch update.</p>

<p>It’s always fun to see a highly anticipated title expand its reach. Previously, developer NetEase Games planned Marvel Rivals as a PC-only title. But that’s changing. There’s new information surrounding the hero-based shooter that points towards a console release. So, is Marvel Rivals on PS5? Is it coming soon?</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-marvel-rivals-on-ps5">Can You Play Marvel Rivals on PS5?</h2>



<p>While you can’t play Marvel Rivals on PS5 yet, it’s happening. A recent code revealed on the game’s website indicates the superhero shooter is coming to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S alongside the PC version. </p>



<p>Anyone on a console who was hoping for a chance to rampage through an arena as Hulk or Iron Man will soon have their chance. However, there is no console release date for Marvel Rivals. With so many upcoming events, like the PlayStation State of Play and Summer Game Fest, we’ll likely see a reveal soon enough, though!</p>







<h2 id="h-is-marvel-rivals-crossplay">Is Marvel Rivals Crossplay?</h2>



<p>While Marvel Rivals isn’t yet available on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S, supposedly, code within the current build indicates full crossplay infrastructure is ready for launch day.</p>



<p>However, whether or not we’ll see some restrictions in place remains to be seen. It’s not uncommon for a game to offer cross-platform or crossplay support but lock the feature to PC and Xbox Series X|S, like with No Man’s Sky. But if Marvel Rivals features genuine crossplay support, we’ll see lobbies full of superheroes across all supported systems.</p>



<p>Let’s hope the studio can balance heroes well enough to prevent any one system from having an unfair advantage!</p>

The first is a documentary created by award-winning Canadian filmmaker Rob McCallum, and the second is a scripted drama series about the life and storied career of video gaming's original rock star.</p><p>Naomi Harvey, executive producer of both projects under her Golden Possum Productions banner, said, "John's story is incredibly powerful—not just the part about the revolutionary games he created, but his profound impact on those around him. His story is one of triumph over trauma, filled with compassion and inspiration."</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It's an unbelievable rock n' roll,&nbsp;boundary-shattering,&nbsp;thrill ride.</p></div><p>McCallum added: "Romero's journey is the missing antidote for all of us misfit toys looking for hope and kindred spirits in the darkness of the world. It's an unbelievable rock n' roll, boundary-shattering, thrill ride grounded in humanity, integrity, patience, and clever chess moves slathered in innocence, tenacity and pure coolness."</p><p>Romero is considered by many as the godfather of the first-person shooter, having co-founded id Software and designed their early games, popularizing the genre. He was <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/john-romero-mabel-addis-game-developers-choice-awards-2023">honored with a Lifetime Achievement Award</a> at the Game Developers Conference (GDC) in 2023 for his outstanding contribution to the video game industry.</p><p>His autobiography, published in July 2023, chronicles a "difficult childhood and storied career, beginning with his early days submitting Apple II game code to computer magazines and sneaking computers out the back door of his day job to write code at night," according to the book's blurb, which calls it an "inspiring" tale.</p><p>"Talking with both Rob [McCallum] and Naomi [Harvey], I knew they were the perfect team to bring Doom Guy to life," Romero said of the adaptations. "Our backgrounds and aspirations have uncanny similarities, and I trust them to tell the story."</p><p><em>Adele Ankers-Range is a freelance entertainment writer for IGN.

Zero</u></a>. Much like <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-official-master-and-apprentice-trailer"><u>past themed character trailers</u></a>, this one centered on the mega-popular shonen series’ smorgasbord of fusion characters. </p><p>First up is Goku and Vegeta’s rambunctious Saiyan kids, Goten and Trunks. The pair premiered in Dragon Ball Z’s Buu arc, where the pair fused, forming the formidable Gotenks. Unlike most Saiyans, their move set is pretty unorthodox.</p><p>Key among them is the Super Donut, an ability that turns enemies into a volleyball, and Super Ghost Kamikaze Attack, which, as its name suggests, spews explosive ghost clones from their mouth.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Kale and Caulifla, Saiyans from Universe 6, were first introduced in the Tournament of Power arc in Dragon Ball Super. Caulifa serves as the de facto Saiyan leader of Universe 6 whereas Kale, for all intents and purposes, exists as Universe 6’s Broly.</p><p>Unlike Goku and company, Kale and Caulifla quickly mastered transforming into Super Saiyans. Their fusion, Kefla, also exists as one of the strongest fusions in the series, putting Goku on the backfoot until he unlocked his newly minted Ultra Instinct form.</p><p>Moving right along are Gogeta and Vegito, two fusion forms of Goku and Vegeta using the fusion dance and potara earrings, respectively. Keeping in spirit with the energy of Dragon Ball Z fandom debates, the trailer leaned into the discourse over which Saiyan combo is the best—going so far as to have Vegito trash talk Gogeta’s fusion dance poses—before cutting away from their beam struggle.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/30/thumbnail-fourth-character-revea-1717083231223.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Sparking! Zero's roster is filling up.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Fused Zamazu, a villainous potara fusion between Goku Black and Zamasu in Dragon Ball Super, also got some play in today’s fusion-centric trailer. </p><p>Sparking! Zero's roster has now increased to a whopping 82 characters, though most of the roster is occupied by a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-goes-super-saiyan-heavy-with-reveal-of-first-24-characters">swarm of Goku and Vegetas in various Super Saiyan forms</a>.</p><p>Based on Bandai Namco’s trend of releasing character trailers a month apart, we’re likely to receive yet another character trailer sometime toward the end of June 2024. WheneverDragon Ball: Sparking! Zero gets around to revealing its officiial release date, players can look forward to its inevitable launch on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S. </p><p>Isaiah Colbert is a freelance writer for IGN.
