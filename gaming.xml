            <p>Kinetic Games has confirmed <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/phasmophobia">Phasmophobia</a>'s next content drop, Chronicle, will release on 24th June, and it'll be its "biggest update yet".</p>
<p>As well as introducing a "total overhaul" of how evidence is collected, the team said Chronicle will expand investigations with three new evidence types, a completely redesigned Journal, reworked levelling and progression, a refreshed Main Menu UI, and "many eerie surprises still lurking in the dark".</p>

<p>But at the "heart" of the Chronicle update is the debut of the all-new Sound evidence. An entirely new haunting paranormal proof type can be captured through the new Sound Recorder, bringing "a new dimension to gameplay, revealing subtle clues that might otherwise be drowned out by terrified screams". Available in the customary three upgrade tiers, players will be able to record audio from ghost events, Spirit Box responses, and Paranormal Sounds like those detected by the Parabolic Microphone.</p>
<p>It's this new evidence type that's necessitated a Journal upgrade, too. The Photo tab will be rebranded as "Media", and keep all your photos, videos, and new sound recordings in one place. Importantly, you'll have to fill your journal with all these unique media types, including "EMF spikes to ghostly interactions and fleeting glimpses of otherworldly forms", to complete a "perfect" investigation.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Kinetic Games</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>"Chronicle will also introduce a revamped media quality system," Kinetic teased. "The first evidence capture of any media type will be marked as 'Unique', granting extra cash and XP rewards at the end of each contract. Any subsequent captures of the same evidence type will be classed as 'Duplicates', offering smaller rewards. The new system will also add tier bonuses based on the equipment used and adds all media captures into the Reward Multiplier, making every shot, sound, and sight count even more toward player’s final payouts."</p>
<p>Don't forget that this year, Phasmophobia will also rework Grafton Farmhouse, following Bleasdale Farmhouse's recent overhaul. Before then, though, we'll also get to see the new levelling and progression system and Main Menu UI when Chronicle arrives at the end of June.</p>

            <p>
Yesterday, ZeniMax Workers United-CWA, the union made up of more than 300 quality assurance workers at Microsoft via its subsidiary <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/zenimax-media">ZeniMax Media</a>, reached a tentative contract agreement with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/microsoft">Microsoft</a>. The union was formed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/zenimax-qa-workers-just-formed-the-largest-union-in-video-games">back in 2022</a>, and has been bargaining with Microsoft in the intervening years since. Last month, the union was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/union-workers-at-fallout-and-elder-scrolls-company-ready-to-strike-against-microsoft-after-two-years-of-haggling">preparing to potentially strike against Microsoft</a>, but now it seems like this may be avoided.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
If fully agreed to, the contract will bring in "substantial across-the-board wage increases as well as new minimum salaries for workers", according to a <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/video-game-workers-reach-historic-tentative-contract-agreement-microsoft">press release</a> from the CWA. On top of that, there would be protections against arbitrary dismissal, grievance procedures, and a "crediting policy that clearly acknowledges the QA workers’ contributions to the video games they help create." The press release notes that the agreement would also include an agreement made in 2023 in relation to how AI is used in the workplace.
</p>
<p>
To be clear, this contract isn't set in stone just yet. Explanation meetings need to be held for members over the coming weeks, and according to the CWA a ratification vote should be completed by June 20th. If it goes through, it will be a huge win for the workers, and should set a big precedent for game workers employed at a Microsoft-owned studio.
</p>
<p>
Earlier this month, a union made up of almost 200 <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> devs <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/overwatch-devs-have-formed-an-almost-200-person-strong-union-with-the-cwa-called-the-overwatch-gamemakers-guild">was also formed alongside the CWA</a>, called the Overwatch Gamemakers Guild. Microsoft have already recognised this union as well. If things continue to go well for ZeniMax Workers United-CWA, perhaps we'll see wins at other unions further down the line. I for one have my fingers deeply tied for such results.

            <p>The Communications Workers of America (CWA) says it has reached a "historic tentative contract agreement" with ZeniMax Media staff at Microsoft.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/video-game-workers-reach-historic-tentative-contract-agreement-microsoft">statement</a>, the union calls the deal a "first for the video game industry", and revealed it had been negotiating for a first contract for "nearly two years".</p>
<p>"QA workers from across the country continue to lead the charge for industry-wide change," said Page Branson, Senior II QA Tester and ZeniMax Workers United-CWA bargaining committee member. "Going toe-to-toe with one of the largest corporations in the world isn’t a small feat. This is a monumental victory for all current video game workers and for those that come after."</p>

<p>The new contract is said to set "new standards for the industry" and includes "substantial across-the-board wage increases as well as new minimum salaries for workers". It also includes protections against arbitrary dismissal, grievance procedures, and a crediting policy that "clearly acknowledges the QA workers' contributions to the video games they help create", as well as a <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/zenimax-workers-reach-agreement-microsoft-contractors-and-ai">previously announced agreement</a> on how artificial intelligence is introduced and implemented in the workplace.</p>
<p>"Workers in the video game industry are demonstrating once again that collective power works. This agreement shows what's possible when workers stand together and refuse to accept the status quo," added CWA President Claude Cummings Jr. "Whether it's having a say about the use of AI in the workplace, fighting for significant wage increases and fair crediting policies, or protecting workers from retaliation, our members have raised the bar. We're proud to support them every step of the way."</p>

<p>As game development becomes increasingly insecure all over the world, more and more developers and performers are organising collective bargaining.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cliffhangers-black-panther-game-reportedly-would-have-built-upon-the-famously-patented-nemesis-system<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/ea">EA</a> did the thing they oh so frequently loves to do, which is making a bad decision. This time, it was cancelling <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/black-panther">Marvel's Black Panther</a>, alongside <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ea-shut-down-studio-they-opened-less-than-two-years-ago-cancel-black-panther-game">shutting down the two year old studio that was making it, Cliffhanger Games</a>. As every single announcement like this over the past few years has been, it was an incredibly frustrating one that can't be justified. Now, a new report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-05-30/why-ea-canceled-a-new-black-panther-video-game-and-closed-cliffhanger-studios?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc0ODYyODA1OSwiZXhwIjoxNzQ5MjMyODU5LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTWDM2MEFEV1JHRzAwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.5NJqkn46ldc6n5M7d2faM7HRVe-P6bpFT21kj1vHHl8&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">Bloomberg</a> has shed a bit of light on why it was cancelled, as well as what the game might have been like.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
For starters, according to the report, the announcement came as a shock to Cliffhanger staff. This was in part because the studio was actively hiring, and Black Panther had passed a "gate", a term EA use for when executives look at how a game is doing and decide whether production should continue. 
</p>
<p>
Some sources did also say that EA executives were still frustrated it hadn't left pre-production despite being in the works for four years. That slowness was apparently due to the fact that a lot of now laid off staff were hired within the last year, even just the last few weeks and months.
</p>
<p>
The game itself sounded interesting too. Cliffhanger were being led by former Monolith head Kevin Stephens, the same studio behind the Middle-earth: Shadow series of games. Monolith's beloved (and patented) Nemesis System was apparently going to be the basis of a new system in Black Panther expanding on those ideas. This included things like being able to play as T’Challa, Killmonger and Shuri, all of which would be competing for the Black Panther role.
</p>
<p>
You'd be able to play as one of them, with the other two becoming rivals that you could form relationships with. There would be Skrulls, shapeshifting aliens, that would have been trying to overtake Wakanda, some of which might pretend to be allies, others acting based on previous things you as the player might have done. You can see the similarities to the Nemesis System.
</p>
<p>
However, showing off this feature to executives was apparently difficult; building a game and a studio side by side was part of the struggle here, reportedly. On top of that, Cliffhanger were based in Kirkland, Washington, an expensive city that meant staff would need appropriate (and deserved) wages. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ea-employees-upset-and-confused-at-return-to-office-mandate">EA also recently put in a return to office mandate</a>, so it all seems to add up to the game not being far enough along with a studio that costs too much to run, in their eyes. Probably worth a reminder that EA CEO Andrew Wilson and EA Entertainment president Laura Miele <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ea-execs-earned-60-million-in-2024-despite-layoffs-and-office-closures">took about $40 million home last year</a>.
</p>
<p>
The whole thing is just tremendously unfair, and a massive shame. I would have loved to have seen a studio build upon the Nemesis System, easily one of the most interesting gameplay systems in the past decade locked behind something as stifling as a patent. As always, big solidarity to those affected by the layoffs.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/line-of-fire-burnt-moon-undaunted-but-not-as-we-know-it<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><i>If it isn't intergalactic miners, it's hackers trying to make things difficult for us. The&nbsp;Lunar Frontier Authority is simply trying to make a better life for everyone amongst the stars. Of course, there's profit to be made, but that simply funds future endeavors.

I want you to throw everything at them, make them wish they'd never tested us. Welcome to the Line of Fire, Burnt Moon.</i></p>

<p><em>Line of Fire Burnt Moon</em> is a new deck-building lane battler from Osprey Games. We've covered the full range of their <em>Undaunted</em> series on the site, from the recent <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/undaunted-2200-callisto-old-mechanics-new-tricks" rel="nofollow"><em>Undaunted 2200 Callisto</em></a>&nbsp;to the original <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/undaunted-normandy-north-africa-and-reinforcements-review" rel="nofollow"><em>Undaunted Normandy.</em></a></p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/line-of-fire-burnt-moon-4.jpg?itok=4uFZhHV1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/line-of-fire-burnt-moon-4.jpg?itok=Ov5S5dG4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Line of Fire Burnt Moon</em> includes 4 different types of units.</figcaption></figure><h2>Send In The Drones</h2>

<p><i>Line of Fire Burnt Moon&nbsp;</i>is listed as a card game, deck-building lane battler. It uses some mechanics from the awesome <em>Undaunted</em> series, but in a more compact package. It takes place in the same setting as <em>Undaunted 2200 Callisto</em>, with the LFA batting a group of hackers, rather than a group of protesting miners.</p>

<p><em>Line of Fire Burnt Moon</em> keeps the deck-building elements, action, and damage elements of <em>Undaunted</em>, meaning that you play each turn using the cards in your hand. 1 card is played each turn for its initiative value, and the remaining 3 are used for actions, either to place a drone on one of the 5 lanes, activate a drone already in a lane that matches the card being played, or gain an effect from a personnel card.</p>

<p>When a unit is damaged in <em>Line of Fire</em>, as with <em>Undaunted</em>, you remove a matching card from your hand, discard pile, deck, or board in that order, meaning that taking damage also affects your ability to activate a unit in the future, possibly that turn. You start the game with a set deck, and certain cards allow you to draw from your supply to your discard pile, waiting for your current deck to run out so they can be shuffled in. This allows you to tailor your deck as you play, drawing in the units that will be the most useful to you.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/line-of-fire-burnt-moon-3.jpg?itok=v0embd7Y 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/line-of-fire-burnt-moon-3.jpg?itok=PVnup-bp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Rather than on a game board,&nbsp;<em>Line of Fire Burnt Moon</em> takes place in lanes.</figcaption></figure><h2>Pick A Lane</h2>

<p>The deck-building elements are where the similarities to <em>Undaunted</em> end. Rather than taking place on a map with tokens, each player has 5 lanes that they are trying to control. <em>Line of Fire</em> is won when either player has 8 control points on the 5 lanes, or if their opponent has no MOSS-type units on the board. This changes the style of play from <em>Undaunted</em> dramatically, removing the strategic movement of the map and replacing it with lane control. This makes the board space a lot more compact for <em>Line of Fire</em>, but also means that you're going to be in your opponent's face, right from the start.</p>

<p>This immediacy has an effect on game length too, and games of <em>Line of Fire</em> can be extremely fast compared to <em>Undaunted</em>. There's also no randomness in the attacks, with attack and defence values fixed to the units and zone, and modified by controlling the zone, having certain types of units in the lane, and having fortifications present. This means that you always know in advance if your attack will be successful or not, and puts a focus on the activation order that you will take each round.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/line-of-fire-burnt-moon-6.jpg?itok=sJ9L5-sI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/line-of-fire-burnt-moon-6.jpg?itok=b8cNX7S_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Lanes in&nbsp;<em>Line of Fire Burnt Moon </em>can be controlled, and have fortifications built and destroyed on them.</figcaption></figure><h2>Choose a Side</h2>

<p><em>Line of Fire Burnt Moon</em> has 2 different factions, the corporate LFA and the POSIWID hackers. They both come with identical decks and a set of 5 identical lanes and are identified by unique artwork and the icon colors (blue for the LFA and pink for POSIWID). I initially felt like I wanted a difference in the forces, the different troop types in <em>Undaunted 2200 Callisto</em> gave each force a unique feel, but after a few games, the tighness of play and the ability to tailor your deck as you play means that an initial deviation in forces could have a signification impact on balance.</p>

<p>The short length of <em>Line of Fire</em> games means that every turn counts, and poor draws can have a big impact. There's a balance to be found in going first (which is a big advantage as you can decimate your opponents' turn by removing cards from their hand), with high initiative cards usually having the best abilities, and once used for initiative, they can't be used that round, and saving that card for a big effect, if you get a chance to after your opponents turn.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/line-of-fire-burnt-moon-2.jpg?itok=1hCytoQo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/line-of-fire-burnt-moon-2.jpg?itok=5Bc5CWl2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I'm a huge fan of how compact and tidy the&nbsp;<em>Line of Fire Burnt Moon </em>components are.</figcaption></figure><p>The game length also means that if you are decimated, draw poorly, or make some bad supply draw choices, the game is usually over quickly, and you can jump straight back into another game. The quick setup and play also mean that you don't get heavily invested in a game, and losing and starting again isn't as painful as an evening-long strategic masterpiece.</p>

<p>It's also worth noting how well all the components fit together in the small box. Both forces have their own colored box to keep them separate, which also fits the fortifications and site tiles. The only other components are an initiative card, 4 player aid cards, and two tiny rulebooks, which makes the components as tight, clean, and compact as the table space it takes up, and the gameplay itself.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/line-of-fire-burnt-moon-5.jpg?itok=rZpqeI_B 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/line-of-fire-burnt-moon-5.jpg?itok=ADbaJq6Q 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Personel cards in&nbsp;<em>Line of Fire Burnt Moon </em>have an ingame effect but aren't played into the lanes.</figcaption></figure><h2>Line of Fire Burnt Moon Final Thoughts?</h2>

<p>My first thought was, 'Why is it not called <em>Undaunted</em>? I love <em>Undaunted</em> and this is <em>Undaunted</em>, right?' But I think that the <em>Line of Fire</em> name makes it clear that while there are <em>Undaunted</em> elements, this is new, and while players of <em>Undaunted</em> will feel comfortable, players who find <em>Undaunted</em> too complex, random, or too large on the tabletop shouldn't approach this expecting any of those things.</p>

<p><em>Line of Fire Burnt Moon</em> has gameplay as light and tight as the components that fit perfectly into the small box, but gameplay that well outgrows the small package. Games are fast and can be brutal, but the small play time means that if your opponent decimates you, you can get right back in for another quick game. The deck-building element means that small changes can have a big impact (good or bad), but the short game lengths mean that poor picks won't affect you for long. Players who like long-term deck-building strategy won't find it here, but players looking for a quick and sharp deck builder will love it.</p>

<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> is, to the surprise of no one, <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1928451382111052101">off to a bit of a flying start</a> (even if not everyone is completely in love with it just yet). I have no intention of diving into it just yet, in part because the solo experience doesn't interest me all that much, and I don't really want to be matched up with two other randos that would surely abandon me the moment I forget what my character can do. There isn't a duos option either, the thing I'm actually after, something that was a bit forgotten about during development, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/couples-afraid-of-being-third-wheeled-rejoice-fromsoftware-might-add-in-a-duos-option-to-elden-ring-nightreign">but might be coming further down the line</a>. The power of modding always comes through however, as despite only launching yesterday, there's already a seamless co-op mod that allows for duos.
</p>

<p>
Aptly titled <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenringnightreign/mods/3">Seamless Co-op (Nightreign)</a>, those of you that have previously indulged in a bit of seamless co-op in other <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/fromsoftware">FromSoftware</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-soulslike-games">Soulslikes</a> won't be surprised to hear that it comes from none other than Yui. She made <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-seamless-co-op-mod-lets-you-play-the-entire-game-with-a-friend">the original Elden Ring Seamless Co-op mod a few years ago</a>, alongside a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-the-duskbloods-who-needs-them-now-that-dark-souls-seamless-co-op-mod-is-here">Dark Souls Remastered one last month</a>.

<p>
Much like those two mods, this one allows you to play online with a friend without all of the usual faff you'll find in FromSoft's games, even if it is easier to play with others in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-best-character-tier-list">Nightreign</a> than usual.
</p>
<p>
Right now, the mod is pretty simple. You can either create two or three player lobbies, and play online with them. Yui says that "there will be more to come, but whilst the current game lacks 2-player modes, this mod will be available in this state." Don't worry about it banning you from regular online either, as it prevents your game from even connecting to any matchmaking servers in the first place. What more could you ask for!

            <p><strong>UPDATE 6.07pm:</strong> FromSoft has issued a follow up suggestion for players still struggling with matchmaking on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> Neightreign.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1928822575318126753">In a post on X/Twitter</a>, the developer said: "If you have difficulty matchmaking on PS4 &amp; PS5, please check your NAT type. NAT type 3 may affect matchmaking on PSN.</p>
<p>"Check your NAT type with the following steps: Home &gt; Settings &gt; Network &gt; Connection Status &gt; Check Connection Status.</p>
<p>"Thank you for your support."</p>

<p><strong>ORIGINAL STORY: </strong> If you're jumping into <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> this weekend and are struggling to find a Player 2 - and/or a Player 3 - you're not alone.</p>
<p>In a brief statement posted to official Elden Ring social media accounts about an hour ago (Saturday, 31st May), developer FromSoftware is recommending players "restart the matchmaking process" if they're struggling to find a co-op partner.</p>

<p>"Nightfarers. If you encounter issues finding other players when launching an expedition in<a href="https://x.com/hashtag/ELDENRING?src=hashtag_click"> </a>Elden Ring Nightreign, please try restarting the matchmaking process," the brief message suggested.

<p>It may not quite fix the issue for all players, however; as one commenter asked in the replies: "How often am I supposed to restart it? Yesterday I spend [sic] several hours restarting it on PS5 to not even play one match…"</p>
<p>Finding a co-op partner is pretty important for Nightreign players. As Ed wrote yesterday, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/should-you-play-elden-ring-nightreign-solo">he wouldn't recommend Nightreign as a solo game</a> at this point as it's clearly not the intended way to play. However, it seems FromSoftware is aiming to respond to the current backlash to make solo play more feasible, with the studio previously stated it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-could-receive-two-player-mode-post-launch">considering a two-player option post-launch</a>, acknowledging it was "something that was overlooked during development".</p>
<p>"FromSoftware's multiplayer spin-off is an exhilarating rush and a celebration of the studio's prior achievements Souls veterans will devour," Ed wrote in our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-review">Elden Ring Nightreign review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Sony is also offering a range of accessories at a discount, including the high-end <strong>DualSense Edge</strong>. Regularly $199.99, the customizable controller is available from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-DualSense-Wireless-Controller-Gaming-Console/dp/B0BSYFB99D/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fsony-dualsense-edge-wireless-controller-black--white%2F6532912.p%3FskuId%3D6532912" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a>, and <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdirect.playstation.com%2Fen-us%2Fbuy-accessories%2Fdualsense-edge-wireless-controller" rel="sponsored">Sony</a> for an all-time low of $169 through June 11th. </p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->169</span></p><div><p>Sony’s pro-style controller, the DualSense Edge, might suffer from shorter battery life than the standard DualSense model, but it features great software integration with the PlayStation 5 and plenty of customizable components.</p></div></div><p>If you’re looking for a highly customizable controller, the Edge is a great option that offers excellent software integration with the PS5. The premium gamepad lets you effortlessly switch between up to four personalized profiles, each of which lets you customize things like stick sensitivity and rear button controls. It’s just as easy to swap out stick modules, too, allowing you to quickly replace the stick tops should they ever wear out. What’s more, the rear triggers feature adjustable stops, so you can control how far they can be pressed and fine-tune your response time in shooters and other competitive games.</p><p>Additionally, the Edge offers the same haptics and adaptive triggers found on Sony’s standard DualSense controller, along with two styles of rear paddles, each suited to a different grip preference. Its charging cable also features a handy locking mechanism to ensure it won’t get yanked out while gaming; however, the Edge is limited to approximately eight hours of battery life when used wirelessly, meaning it doesn’t last quite as long as the OG DualSense. I guess that’s the price you pay for souped-up components and software, at least with Sony.</p><div><p id="more-ways-to-save-this-weekend"><h2>More ways to save this weekend</h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span>Now through tomorrow, June 1st, you can grab the last-gen <strong>Oura Ring Generation 3</strong> at Wellbots in the <a href="https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1264455&amp;u=1225169&amp;m=83747&amp;urllink=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wellbots.com%2Fproducts%2Foura-ring-gen3-heritage" rel="sponsored">Heritage configuration</a> for $195 ($104 off) or the <a href="https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1264455&amp;u=1225169&amp;m=83747&amp;urllink=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wellbots.com%2Fproducts%2Foura-ring-gen3-horizon" rel="sponsored">Horizon config</a> for $210 ($90 off) when using coupon code <strong>OURAVERGE25</strong>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-switch-2%E2%80%99s-promising-start-hides-an-uncertain-future.1203501/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/677301/the-switch-2s-promising-start-hides-an-uncertain-future<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>With the Switch 2 launch days away, analysts and consumers are watching to see how well Nintendo can follow-up the best selling home console in its history. Judging from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/655361/nintendo-switch-2-preorders-sold-out-walmart-gamestop-target">the pain of trying to secure a Switch 2 pre-order</a>, it seems like Nintendo has nothing to worry about – at least at launch.</p><p>Down the line, however, concerns about tariffs, a steadily rising cost of living, and a saturated market might cast a shadow on the Switch 2. <em>The Verge</em> talked to analysts, journalists, and normal video game playing people to put the Switch 2 launch in perspective. The key takeaway? While the console will assuredly have another blockbuster debut, its future looks much less certain.</p><p>The Wii U gets brought up a lot in the conversation surrounding the Switch 2, as it’s the most famous example of a Nintendo failure. “The Wii U, with its confusing controller-screen gimmick, sluggish user interface, and lack of a great <em>Custom Robo</em> game, was one of Nintendo’s worst flops,” <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/"><em>GameFile</em></a> author Stephen Totilo explained in an email to <em>The Verge</em>. </p><p>It sold less than 14 million units, a dramatic drop from the Wii, which sold over 100 million. And while Nintendo expects to sell one million more Switch 2 units in its first year than the Wii U sold in its life, that’s not necessarily indicative of long-term success. “The Wii U nevertheless sold out at launch back in November 2012,” Totilo said, “pulling in sales that <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lifestyle/arts/nintendo-wii-u-hardware-sales-411119/">reportedly</a> topped the US launch sales of the Xbox 360 and PS3.”</p><p>When looking at launch sales projections and predictions, Mat Piscatella, video game analyst for Circana, warned that what a console does during its launch period is no indication of what it’ll do overall. </p><p>“Sales around the launch period are more reflection of available supply than anything,” Piscatella said. Another, more important factor for a console launch is the audience. “With anything regarding gaming right now, we have to separate the enthusiast market from the mass market, because they’re behaving very differently,” Piscatella added. </p><p>According to Piscatella, it’s the enthusiasts driving most of the Switch 2 hype we’re seeing, particularly since the last major console launches – the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S – happened five years ago. “We haven’t had new hardware designed for the masses in a long time,” he said. “So we have a big pent up demand just for something new.” </p><p>We’re seeing part of that demand satisfied by the Switch 2 pre-order frenzy. The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/643616/nintendo-switch-2-us-preorders-date">day pre-orders opened in the US</a> (after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/643483/nintendo-switch-2-preorders-delayed-tariffs">a few weeks’ delay</a> because of President Donald Trump’s tariff chicanery) they sold out within hours. GameStop held in-store pre order events that saw people <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/655949/switch-2-in-person-preorder-gamestop">lining up outside storefronts</a> for hours to secure one.</p><p>But what will really determine the success of the console is how the bigger, mass market reacts, the same one that made devices like the Wii and original Switch such hits. Piscatella says this group is biding its time right now, “leaning into free-to-play and the content they already have.”</p><p>It’s a tricky time for the industry. New blockbuster titles are getting ever more expensive to make. Consumers, in turn, are buying fewer of them in favor of spending their time and money in established games, all while persistent layoffs three years running are making it harder for new games to come out on time. Add that to 2025’s unique and volatile US tariff situation and the associated price increases, and now is one <em>hell </em>of a time to launch a video game console.</p><p>“A games console is for a lot of people [...] an unaffordable luxury, especially for families,” said <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/keza-macdonald">Keza MacDonald</a>, video game editor at <em>The Guardian </em>and author of a forthcoming book about Nintendo’s history. MacDonald believes that most people who want a Switch 2 will have already pre-ordered one and that Nintendo’s real work will be to convince everyone else they want one too – a job the company doesn’t seem to be doing that well.</p><p>Silvie Krekow, a gamer who works at Vox Media as a creative director, says she knows “almost nothing” about the Switch 2. She doesn’t frequent gaming websites or consume gaming media, but she noted it was odd that “a 33-year-old gamer with disposable income who owns a Switch, PS4, and Xbox One” didn’t casually come across at least <em>some</em> Switch 2 information.</p><p>Other colleagues and self-described “gaming casuals” I spoke to expressed similar sentiments. According to MacDonald, Nintendo is handling this launch period very conservatively. “It’s like, ‘We know everyone’s going to buy this anyway. We don’t have to sell you on it,’” she said. “But I’m not sure if that’s true.”</p><div><p>At the Switch 2 Direct in April, Nintendo showed off a console with some <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/23872810/nintendo-switch-2-next-generation-console-features-trailer">slight quality-of-life and performance upgrades</a>. That may work for the enthusiasts – <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24344511/nintendo-switch-2-features-specs-handheld-dock-upgrade-comparison">they get more of what they already liked about the original</a>. But without something more to entice consumers beyond the diehards, the Switch 2 may struggle to find its audience.</p></div><p>“As for the [Switch 2 features] I’m not particularly excited,” said Kushal Raval, an operations manager at Vox Media. “The rolling controller sounds interesting, but the voice chat feature seems a bit pointless.” </p><p>Kushal owns a Switch, which he said didn’t run games like <em>Fortnite</em> as well as he wanted. And while the Switch 2’s technical upgrades will likely improve this, Kushal said, “With a $450–$500 price tag, I’m leaning much more toward getting a Steam Deck.”</p><p>The Switch 2 also has to compete against people content with its predecessor. “I have a Switch Lite that I bought during the pandemic,” said Jackie Noack, a video producer at Vox Media. “My husband has the Switch 1, and I don’t think we use them quite enough to justify replacing them.” For Noack, the console’s price is also a major factor. “$500 does seem steep to me!”</p><p>The Switch 2 will not be a dud like the Wii U, but it likely will not reach the heights of the original Switch. The price and lack of defining new features are two reasons, but perhaps the biggest is that the circumstances that fostered the OG Switch’s success were incredibly unique.</p><p>“The Switch really picked up <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22188452/animal-crossing-new-horizons-coronavirus-pandemic-year-2020">during the pandemic with <em>Animal Crossing</em></a>. That was an enormous hit,” MacDonald said. “And obviously that was such a unique combination of circumstances, I’m not sure that could happen again.” Piscatella agrees: “The Switch is an outlier success. I think [the Switch 2] is unlikely to do Switch numbers in the long term.”</p><p>The lead up to the launch of the Nintendo Switch 2 has been filled with so much built-up pressure from the anticipation of hungry gamers eager for any news, which was exacerbated by prolific leaks and Nintendo’s typical propensity for silence. With the console’s official reveal and the enthusiastic response from dedicated fans, that pressure could not be higher – and with launch coming next week, the release valve is finally about to open.</p><p>“Simply because of the logo on the box, it’s safe to say that the Switch 2 is too Nintendo to fail,” said Totilo. “At least in the early going.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The studio, founded by ex-Call of Duty developers, is responsible for Apex Legends and the Star Wars Jedi games, and was reportedly working on a third game in its beloved Titanfall series before its staff roster was cut. Now cancelled, the rumours suggest that this Titanfall project was an extraction shooter – a difficult-by-design PvPvE genre that currently only enjoys niche popularity. But an extraction shooter set in the world of Titanfall and Apex Legends could have been the genre’s ticket to the big leagues. So if not EA, who will take the “Tarkov-like” beyond its enthusiastic niche and into the mainstream? The answer may be just months away.    </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"As part of our continued focus on our long-term strategic priorities, we’ve made select changes within our organization that more effectively aligns teams and allocates resources in service of driving future growth," an EA spokesperson said of the layoffs that cut away at Respawn. It’s a sentiment EA employees have heard before. This move follows a rash of downsizing in other segments of EA’s portfolio, including at developers <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/f1-developer-codemasters-suffers-round-of-layoffs">Codemasters</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-developers-reveal-theyve-been-laid-off-after-bioware-puts-full-focus-on-mass-effect">BioWare</a>, and a more general <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-to-lay-off-around-670-to-advance-the-way-we-work">670 company-wide employees</a> back in March of last year. This trend has many decrying the state of the games industry as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ive-never-seen-it-this-bad-game-developers-explain-the-huge-layoffs-hitting-riot-epic-and-more">unsustainable</a> and calling for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/video-game-workers-form-first-north-american-industry-wide-union-with-communications-workers-of-america">unionization</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But what of that rumored Titanfall extraction shooter? Naturally, its apparent cancellation has many fans disappointed; the existence (and lack of public appearance) of a new Titanfall game has become something of an in-joke in recent years. Further, rumors of a new extraction shooter from a triple-A studio has shone a spotlight on a style of game that has struggled to garner a significant audience thus far. And whether or not the cancelled Respawn title was indeed an extraction shooter, more people are discussing the potential of a genre that is in its infancy.  </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“This is an enthusiast genre which has, thus far, not significantly broken out to the mass market player,” Mat Piscatella, Video Games Industry Advisor at Circana, tells IGN.   </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last month, developer Bungie finally revealed gameplay footage for Marathon, the upcoming extraction shooter that some predict will launch the genre into the mainstream. It's a game that's already found itself in hot water, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marathon-developer-bungie-launches-thorough-review-after-once-again-being-found-to-have-used-work-from-an-uncredited-artist">accused of plagarising art assets</a>. But while there are ethical questions around Marathon's production, the response to the game itself after press went <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marathon-hands-on-preview-can-bungie-do-to-escape-from-tarkov-what-fortnite-did-to-pubg">hands-on with it </a>seems largely positive. Perhaps this is to be expected from the studio with a reputation for stellar first-person shooter experiences like Halo and Destiny. But, come September, Marathon will be launching into a very different market, and the extraction shooter is a relatively untested genre. Will pedigree and tight FPS design be enough to carry the game to success? Analysts say: perhaps.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“If I were to bet on any developer being able to bring this genre to the mass market it would be Bungie,” Piscatella says.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For those unfamiliar, extraction shooters tend to be made up of a combination of player-versus-player and player-versus-environment gameplay loops. Small squads of players are dropped into a world, where they fight AI enemies and sometimes other player-controlled squads, to complete goals and gather resources, then escape the map. The genre was popularized by Escape From Tarkov, an incredibly unforgiving take on the formula characterized by its high-risk, high-reward firefights, which garnered a respectable audience during the COVID-19 lockdowns. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>If I were to bet on any developer being able to bring this genre to the mass market it would be Bungie.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Since then, a number of other developers have tried their hand at the genre with varying degrees of success. One of the most prominent is last year’s Helldivers 2, developed by Arrowhead Game Studios and published by Sony. It leans heavily on a campy schtick, community engagement, and in-game events, which has made it a standout among extraction shooters. Also, and perhaps most importantly, it’s a co-op only affair, with none of the tense PvP encounters that make games like Escape from Tarkov so challenging. According to Piscatella’s data, Helldivers 2 was the eighth most-played game on Steam in April, and ranked 34 on PlayStation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Helldivers 2 is the outlier success among this group,” Piscatella explains. “In April, approximately 9% of US active Steam users played Helldivers 2, while around 3% of PS5 players engaged with the game at least once. No other [extraction shooter] reached more than 2.3% of active players on any platform on which that particular game was played.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s immediately obvious that these stats are small when compared to more popular genres like battle royale or multiplayer FPS games. As hugely popular as Helldivers 2 seems to dedicated PlayStation owners, the mainstream is Fortnite, Call of Duty, and EA’s FC – games that garner much, much larger audiences. But Piscatella is quick to point out that the extraction shooter is a burgeoning genre with a great deal of potential, and it faces the same challenges as any other genre does in its early days.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Small or developing genres often only get big after one game makes it so,” he says. “The dance/music genre was a pretty small niche until Guitar Hero showed up. Console FPS games didn't usually sell all that well at all until Halo. MMOs comprised a relatively small portion of the market until World of Warcraft became the biggest thing in the world. Maybe Marathon does that for extraction shooters. Maybe it doesn't. Nothing is guaranteed for any new game in today's market.”</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/16/marathon-1-1747388849733.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Other popular games in the extraction shooter genre include Deep Rock Galactic, Hunt: Showdown 1896, and Delta Force. The latter is a free-to-play title launched late last year and has been enjoying a steady rise in popularity in recent months: as of this writing, it ranks 15th in daily players on Steam, with somewhere around 135,000 players at peak. This is a respectable number, but nowhere near the numbers consistently put up by the battle royale genre and its titans. And let’s face it: executives have exhibited a certain amount of tunnel vision chasing the high monetization bars set by the Fortnites, Warzones, and PUBGs of the world. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s an argument that this sort of fixation has led to a certain amount of creative stagnation in the development space, and studio heads are less willing to take a chance on an unproven genre such as extraction shooters (it’s perhaps telling that Call of Duty’s attempt at it was an under-supported, now abandoned mode added to Warzone, rather than its own flagship release). In that way, Marathon represents the first significant triple-A effort to bring the genre to the masses. And it’s going to need all the help it can get along the way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Bungie being the developer certainly does not guarantee Marathon success,” Piscatella says. “In order for [it] to break through it would certainly help if the game could win over dedicated fans of the genre so they could advocate for the game among family and friends.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The biggest challenge facing Marathon is the untested nature of the extraction shooter genre as a whole.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Beyond word of mouth, Bungie will need to ensure smooth onboarding for prospective players. In particular, converting core players familiar with first-person shooters will likely figure into Bungie’s rollout strategy, but long-term retention will all boil down to the gameplay. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It would…be helpful if Marathon were to have a ramping path for people that are more familiar with the big FPS titles like Call of Duty to help initiate trial and conversion,” Piscatella explains. “It would also have to nail the whole ‘easy to pick up, difficult to master’ trick that many mass market hits are able to pull off.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The reality is that these are all the same problems faced by any new title, and the one true decider of success or failure is the market, which, as Piscatella points out, is extremely unwelcoming.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It is a very fickle market at the moment. People have their favorite long-running games that are constantly being updated, are familiar, have significant social and monetary hooks, and many of these titles are free-to-play or easily accessible without an upfront purchase price. So, the challenges facing Bungie and Marathon are not dissimilar to those facing any new game.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fickle market notwithstanding, the biggest challenge facing Marathon is the untested nature of the extraction shooter genre as a whole. Escape From Tarkov has enjoyed its accolades, but that game benefitted from an audience inflated by pandemic lockdowns, as well as a gameplay loop that appealed to the core gamer segment. Subsequent titles have only seen middling performances (with Helldivers 2 being the outlier), so it’s easy to understand why studios have been reticent to devote significant resources to such a project, especially when the battle royale genre has proven its dominance.   </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In that way, Marathon should prove to be a useful litmus test for the rest of the industry. It’s surprising to see a studio like Bungie going all-in on an extraction shooter in this environment, and if it receives a strong reception you can expect other developers and publishers to take its lead. Of course there are dozens of factors to account for - things like monetization and market trends - and nobody can predict how things will unfold. But Bungie certainly has the clout and design chops to make something special. And it’s going to take something special to take the extraction shooter genre from niche to mainstream. You can be sure that, come September, the industry will be eagerly watching the launch of Marathon. </p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/31/relationships-through-the-lens-of-football-manager-2024/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>For those who are not familiar with Football Manager, it is easy to assume that the series is just about football. After all, you choose a team to manage, get a squad together, pick some tactics, and hope they work out to take your team to glory. It is easy to come to that conclusion. It is also wrong. Football Manager 2024 is a game that’s about so much more than just football. It’s really just the cover to a game about interpersonal relationships, and the importance of how managing them is integral to success or failure.</p>
<h2>The connection between players and manager</h2>
<p>The most crucial relationships in Football Manager 24 are between you and your players. You are managing people at different stages of their careers, from the youngsters just taking their first steps into the world of professional football to those who are experienced and close to retirement. Just like any workplace, each individual has their own needs, wants, and goals. If you’re a good manager, you will help each of these players to meet their expectations and exceed them in some cases. One player may want to be seen as the most important player at the club, while another will want to go out on loan to gain valuable experience. Others can make demands of you to make improvements to the club or push you to back other players in the squad.</p>
<p>Dealing with the different demands and promises made of a small group is hard enough, but now imagine that for a squad of 25 or more players? Not everyone will get what they want, no matter how hard you try. If you have two players wanting to play in the same position, and there is one who is clearly better than the other, your job as manager is to pick the better player for the good of the club. You can do your best to support the other player, such as placing them on loan, but this can upset them just as much as not playing. Making too many promises comes with its own issues. Break a promise to one player and you might get away with it, depending on their influence on the team, but keep breaking promises and the squad will turn on you making it almost impossible to get success on the pitch, putting your own job at risk.</p>



<p>No manager really wants to admit it, but everyone has their favourites. Some players will be backed no matter what because of how good they are, while a player who doesn’t take their chances will start to be ignored, leading to a breakdown in your relationship. However, your favourites can also turn on you when the transfer windows open, demanding to be sold to someone else, no matter what you say. At the same time, the player you ignored may not want to leave and try to prove they can be better.</p>

<p>All of this just scratches the surface of how relationships with players works in Football Manager 2024, and it can be a source of more frustration than losing 1-0 in a league match where your team had 15 shots while the opposition had one. Players are not the only group you have to have a good relationship with though.</p>
<h2>The connection between the backroom staff and manager</h2>
<p>The players are the public-facing part of the football club, with their performances there for all to see. However, those performance and player development depends on the hidden engine which is the backroom staff. Assistant managers, coaches, the medical team, and the recruitment team all influence the club’s success, with the advice they can give you and how they help your players.</p>
<p>The relationship system with your backroom staff is not as deep as it is with players, but it still matters. For example, if you find an exceptional coach that is great for your team’s development you will want to keep them happy, lest another club comes in and offers them a job. You can convince them to stay with you, usually with a better contract, but if you do not know their needs they will decide to leave.</p>

<p>The whole backroom squad is also reliant on your for their jobs, and at times you need to be ruthless. Better coaches and scouts may become available, meaning you weigh up keeping a current staff member or deciding to get rid of them and bring someone with better attributes in. It is not a simple decision, because firing someone usually means paying them some compensation which can also impact your club finances.</p>
<p>The backroom team has as much power as you allow them to have. As a manager you might want to control everything or, like me, delegate responsibility for things like training. You can choose to have meetings regularly with your staff too, discussing things like recruitment policies and player development. Their suggestions can help you decide if a staff member fits your vision, or is providing information that is useless, so firing them is the better option. Like the players, it is all about managing staff expectations and doing what is best for the club, even it means letting people go and angering them in the process.</p>
<h2>The connection to the board</h2>
<p>While you have management power over players and the backroom staff, you are not the final authority. Just like most of us in real life, you also have a boss in Football Manager 2024 and you need to meet their expectations to keep your own job. When you start at a club, the board will set you targets to meet. Unhappy players and staff can be managed, but an unhappy board of directors is a sign you are not going to last long in your post.</p>

<p>What you have to do here is apply techniques of managing upwards, influencing your board to come to your way of thinking. Some boards are easier to persuade than others, especially those with some money behind them. Those with poor finances will need convincing that your requests will turn the club around. When you make a request a board may decide to implement it or reject it. If they reject you can try to convince them or give them an ultimatum. Much like real life, ultimatums rarely work so it probably isn’t a good idea unless the board really likes you.</p>
<p>Boards will like you if you are meeting their targets, which vary club to club. Some will want you to focus on building up the youth squad for long term success, so convincing them to build better youth training facilities should be easy. Others will want you to focus on club finances by buying and selling players for profit or reducing the wage budget. Meet these expectations and the board will listen to you. Fail and you’ll be sitting in front of them convincing them to keep your job.</p>
<h2>The connection between the fans, media and manager</h2>
<p>There are two other groups that will help decide your fate with those being the club fans and the media. As a manager you have a responsibility to engage with these stakeholders too. Fans are similar to the board in that they have their expectations, and if they are unhappy that will influence the board. Their expectations usually align, so the only way to keep them happy is to meet or exceed them, as there is no direct way to chat to a fan spokesperson about club issues.</p>

<p>The media is another matter. They will contact you for quotes about club happenings, grill you over new signings, and want to chat post-match. Each sports journalist will form an opinion of you, with some loving you and others absolutely loathing you. How they view you impacts the way they write their stories, which will influence relationships with others other managers, the fans, the players, and the board.</p>
<p>How do you manage the media? By providing them some juicy quotes and tidbits, so they want to keep you happy so you provide more information. How do you turn the media against you? Well, keep your information close to your chest or just don’t engage with them. They will write stories that are not great for you, but as a manager you need to put the club first.</p>

<hr>
<p>Football Manager 24 is not just a football management game. It is a relationship game which is set in the world of football. You have to meet the expectations of players, the board, fans, and staff. Just like real life relationships, each one has different ways to navigate them so that people feel valued, but just like in reality, you cannot keep everyone happy all of the time. Sometimes things will work out for you and the relationships are all positive which is great, but if things start to break down it can lead to a messy breakup with the club.</p>

This attack spreads out in a cone, so be sure to dodge roll <em>behind </em>Caligo. There is another breath attack where Caligo will stand on its hind legs and breathe fog directly down in front of it. The same strategy as before applies here—get behind Caligo. This attack can also form icicles on the ground that will inflict damage and build up frostbite should you touch them. Avoid these.</p><figure id="" data-id="2b8ab69af04e76df142abba951dd364b" data-recommend-id="image://2b8ab69af04e76df142abba951dd364b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The entire sky is blotted out with a icey fog." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The entire sky is blotted out with a icey fog." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->FromSoftware / George Yang / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2b8ab69af04e76df142abba951dd364b" data-recommend-id="image://2b8ab69af04e76df142abba951dd364b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The entire sky is blotted out with a icey fog." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Eventually, Caligo will cover the entire screen with fog.

Unfortunately, right now it seems like the only way to avoid this attack is to run as fast as you can away from the noise and pray that you’re out of the ice sheet’s range before the fog lifts and the sheet comes crashing down.</p><figure id="" data-id="01c94fc1c780c0268f489d4ab1506062" data-recommend-id="image://01c94fc1c780c0268f489d4ab1506062" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Ice forms around the player while the dragon boss flies into the sky." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ice forms around the player while the dragon boss flies into the sky." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->FromSoftware / George Yang / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="01c94fc1c780c0268f489d4ab1506062" data-recommend-id="image://01c94fc1c780c0268f489d4ab1506062" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Ice forms around the player while the dragon boss flies into the sky." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Caligo will also fly around and summon meteors to hit you. This is the most mobile it’ll be through the entire fight. Fortunately, this move is rather rare and easier to dodge than Caligo’s other ones.</p><p>Arguably, Caligo is a more annoying boss battle than it is a hard one, especially due to how much space its attacks cover. Timing your expedition with the Mountaintop event will make the fight significantly easier, so make sure you get every advantage you can.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/677197/playdate-season-2-game-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>A lot of games have been released for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23025390/playdate-handheld-portable-gaming-console-review">the Playdate since it launched in 2022</a>, as a quick browse of <a href="https://itch.io/games/tag-playdate">itch.io</a> or <a href="https://play.date/games/">the Catalog shop</a> will attest. But still, there’s something unique about the handheld’s seasonal format, which just kicked off its second iteration. When it first launched, the Playdate came with 24 games from notable indie developers that were steadily released on a weekly cadence, making a perfect introduction to the little yellow device and its crank. Now, a few years later, we finally have season 2, and it’s off to a solid start — and it even includes a bizarre mystery.</p><p>The new season runs for the next six weeks and totals a dozen games, two of which will drop each week. <a href="https://play.date/games/seasons/two/">The entire collection will run you $39</a>. To start, we have a pair of very different games. <em>Fulcrum Defender</em>, from <em>FTL: Faster Than Light</em> developer Subset Games, is sort of like a modern take on <em>Asteroids</em>. You control a little ship in the middle and fire guns at little squares flying toward you. The twist is that you use the crank to rotate the ship around and aim your shots. There’s also something of a roguelike element, where you steadily unlock random upgrades like new weapons or a larger spread for your bullets. The goal is to last for 10 straight minutes.</p><p>It’s a pretty challenging game — so far, I’ve only really had success on easy mode — but it’s also surprisingly chill, eliciting that sort of zen state that the best shooters and puzzle games can create. This is helped by its lo-fi soundtrack that pretty much demands you play with headphones on. It’s an absorbing game.</p><p>On the other end of the spectrum is <em>Dig Dig Dino!</em>, developed by Dom2D and Fáyer, who brag that the game “is perfect to play while watching TV! No time pressure, no quick reflexes needed!” It’s a puzzle game where you travel to different dig sites to uncover dinosaur bones, artifacts, and trash. You only have a limited amount of moves per dig, but you can upgrade your capacity over time — while also getting new tools to smash rocks or dig deeper — letting you dig both more and for longer. It’s sort of like a really cute take on <em>Minesweeper</em>, one clearly designed for short play sessions. It’s not exactly difficult, but there’s still something satisfying about uncovering a large dinosaur bone when you’re just about to run out of moves.</p><p>These two games do a good job of showing the breadth of games possible on the Playdate; one is meant for quick bursts, the other for longer, more focused sessions. But the launch week package is rounded out by something a whole lot weirder. It’s called <em>Blippo Plus</em> and, well, it’s a series of TV channels you can flip between using the crank. Some are nothing but static, while others have giant FMV videos of strange TV shows or commercials. One show, called <em>Tantric Computing,</em> is nothing but closeup shots of someone using a computer mouse. Another, <em>Werf’s Tavern</em>, is some kind of musical talk show. There’s also a messaging tool and some kind of fax service.</p><p>What’s most interesting about <em>Blippo Plus</em>, though, isn’t just that it’s odd. It’s also a mystery that seems like it will evolve over the course of the season. Playdate maker Panic says that “Playdate season 2 owners should tune in weekly and make sure they are connected to WiFi when season 2 updates at 10 AM PT on Thursdays.” There are lots of other promising games planned for season 2, including the point-and-click adventure <em>Shadowgate PD</em> and whatever the heck <em>Long Puppy</em> and <em>Tiny Turnip</em> are.</p><p>But an FMV mystery that unfolds over the course of weeks is something that’s pretty unique to this format — and further evidence that the Playdate exists in its own parallel universe.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<ul>
<li><strong>TSBonyman’s&nbsp;</strong>sadly run into a progress breaking bug in Oblivion and doesn’t fancy replaying a whole chunk of the game to rectify it.

  </p>

    

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Geralt, the hero of The Witcher series of games, nearly had a considerably different face. He actually did, briefly, but the game's community disliked it so much CD Projekt Red panicked and changed it back.</p>
<p>The problem? Anatomical correctness. The community didn't think Geralt was alien-looking or ugly enough.</p>
<p>The year was 2010 and CD Projekt Red was ready to debut its brand new Witcher game, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-2-assassins-of-kings">The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings</a>, to the world. A couple of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekt-unveils-the-witcher-2">leaked videos preceded the formal announcement</a> but when a clutch of screenshots was eventually released, it debuted a different looking Geralt to the one people were used to from The Witcher 1.</p>
<p>Whereas Geralt had previously had the proportions of a triangle, roughly, which angled to a point on his nose and didn't seem to involve a chin of any kind, he now had much easier-on-the-eye proportions and looked like an actual person. He was even, dare I say it, handsome. It simply wouldn't do.</p>
<p>Some of this was to be expected. The transition from Witcher 1 to Witcher 2 included a transition for the game's engine, moving from BioWare's Aurora engine, which once powered <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/neverwinter-nights">Neverwinter Nights</a>, to CD Projekt Red's internally made engine Redengine. A facial design that worked well in one engine wouldn't necessarily work in both.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>"The problem was that The Witcher 1 was heavily stylised," CD Projekt Red art director Pawel Mielniczuk explained to me. "From an art point of view, it was a much simpler visual fidelity than was in The Witcher 2 and Witcher 3. It was based on this Aurora engine from Neverwinter Nights - low poly, you know - so the character looks great there but the face of Geralt in The Witcher 1 wasn't very anatomically correct. It was making a good impression.</p>
<p>"When we got to The Witcher 2, we had a better engine - larger budgets for polygons, more artists to sculpt nice faces, and we actually got better at making characters, already being a studio that released one game. And Geralt's [existing] face just did not match the style of the rest of the characters," he said. "It was not realistic human proportions."</p>
<p>The solution was clear: redesign Geralt's face. "Let's make Geralt from scratch - nobody will notice that," Mielniczuk said, and laughed at the memory. "So we made it at the very beginning of The Witcher 2 production and we released it with this first bunch of screenshots to see what the response was, and the response was horrible! Our community just smashed us on the forums - there were almost riots there."</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>Sadly I can't find those riots on those company forums now; 15 years of chatter has buried it. But Mielniczuk told me the comments there were to the effect of: "True Geralt: he's supposed to be ugly and inhuman!" CD Projekt Red backtracked as a result of the backlash, and it would take a further two years of tinkering, and testing and re-evaluating, to get Geralt's look right for the game. "And was a hybrid of The Witcher 1 Geralt and a real human," Mielniczuk said.</p>
<p>By the time <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3</a> development came around, in around 2011-2012, the opportunity once again presented itself to tinker with Geralt's face, but this time the studio resisted. "With The Witcher 3, we actually used exactly the same model from Witcher 2, added more polygons, updated textures, but we did not touch it," Mielniczuk said.</p>

<p>That's not to say Mielniczuk didn't want to alter Geralt's face for the third game. He was the lead character artist on The Witcher 3. He hand-sculpted both Ciri and Yennefer's face, and he could see glaring issues with Geralt's. "If you look at the profile of Geralt: he has this incredible profile but the tip of his nose is a completely straight line from his forehead, kind of Greek proportions, and it was not fitting his face, so we wanted to fix that. But we did not," he said. "We made a decision, 'Okay, that's Geralt, he's recognisable, people are loving our character. We pass. We cannot make this mistake once again.'"</p>
<p>Which brings us around to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a>, which is now in full production and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/geralt-of-town-that-was-definitely-doug-cockles-white-haired-monster-hunter-in-the-witcher-4s-reveal-trailer">we know will include Geralt to some degree</a>. The new game will also move the series to a new engine, Unreal Engine 5, so once again there's an opportunity for a Geralt-face redesign. Will CD Projekt Red take it?</p>

<p>"It's such a grounded character right now I would really not dare to touch it," Mielniczuk said. "And in general, it's a very successful character because his face is recognisable, probably also because of these features of inhuman proportions in the upper part of the body. So no, I wouldn't update anything, just textures, normal maps, adding more details on the face, make it realistic through the surfaces, but not through the anatomy and proportions."</p>
<p>But there is one thing that might tempt Mielniczuk to update Geralt's face, or rather one person, and that's Henry Cavill, the former star of The Witcher Netflix TV show. Mielniczuk is a big fan of his. "Henry was just perfect," he said. Then he added, laughing: "If I would do something to the face, I would be easily convinced to scan Henry and put him in The Witcher 4!"</p>
<p>I spoke to Pawel Mielniczuk as part of a series of interviews <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-worked-in-the-witcher-3-and-what-didnt-looking-back-on-a-landmark-rpg-with-cd-projekt-red">looking back on The Witcher 3, a decade on, through the eyes of the people who made it</a>.

</span></figcaption></figure></div><div><p><em><a href="https://bigfriendly.guide/category/guides/elden-ring-nightreign/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elden Ring Nightreign</a></em> is the new standalone, not-DLC set in the world of <em>Elden Ring</em> by FromSoftware.</p><p><em>Nightreign</em> is condensed and distilled <em>Elden Ring</em>. It even takes place in a smaller version of the Lands Between. But that distillation also makes it faster, denser, and even more challenging. As weird as it is to describe any FromSoftware game this way, <em>Nightreign</em> makes <em>Elden Ring</em> look positively cozy in comparison.</p><p><strong>The following starter guide was <a href="https://bigfriendly.guide/guides/elden-ring-nightreign/nightreign-what-you-should-know-beginners-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">originally</a> published by our friends at <a href="https://bigfriendly.guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Big Friendly Guide</a>, a new website devoted to game guides.

Below, we’re going to break down some important things you should know before diving into <em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>.</p><h2><strong>What the hell is Elden Ring Nightreign?</strong></h2><figure><figcaption>Image: FromSoftware/Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure><p><em>Nightreign</em> is a multiplayer, battle-royale-but-PvE game with roguelike elements. And what that means is, let’s just say it here, it’s kind of <em>Fortnite</em>-ified <em>Elden Ring</em>. You start an Expedition — a run — by <em>gliding</em> onto an <em>island</em> where there’s a shrinking <em>circle</em> that damages you if you get caught outside.</p><p>It’s not a battle royale, though. It’s you and two teammates against a parade of <em>Elden Ring</em> enemies that come from a wide range stages in the base game.</p><p>Your Expedition takes place across three days. Your ultimate goal is to earn Runes (by killing enemies) and pick up items throughout the day to level up both your character and your gear. Then, when the Night’s Tide (that shrinking circle) forces you to an arena at the end of that day, you’ll need to defeat a boss to progress to the next day. Day 2 is similar to day 1, and you and your buddies will need to work hard to get strong for the boss battles to come.&nbsp;</p><p>After the night fight on day 2, you’ll be teleported to just outside of a boss arena where you can level up if you have enough Runes or shop at a nearby merchant. You and your squad can then take on the Night Lord, the big boss that comes at the end of each Expedition. If you kill it, you win, and will progress the game. If you and your teammates go down during the boss fight — or any of the previous night fight — you’ll fail and will need to start a new Expedition from scratch at <em>Nightreign</em>‘s version of the Roundtable Hold.</p><p>And you’re going to fail. Often.</p><h2><strong>Leveling up is streamlined</strong></h2><p>Just like in <em>Elden Ring</em> proper, killing enemies earns you Runes, but you’re not out to kill every single enemy on the map. You’re here for one reason — to survive until the third night, which means surviving three circles, defeating at least three (probably more) bosses, and then fighting the chosen Night Lord. And doing that means leveling up.</p><p>You do this at Sites of Grace scattered around the island. In <em>Nightreign</em>, the leveling up process is much simpler than in <em>Elden Ring</em>. You only have one stat to adjust — your level — and that adjusts all of your other stats.</p><p>How fast and easy <em>Nightreign</em> makes leveling up is good because …</p><h2>Elden Ring Nightreign is chaotic</h2><p>When you head out on an Expedition, it’s chaos. It’s you and two strangers — who you can’t talk to, as there’s no in-game voice chat — dropped onto an island with a lot of shiny distractions and no plan for where to go.</p><p>If you want to survive, stick with your party and watch for the shrinking circle of deadly (tick damage) rain. Use the pin function on the map to suggest destinations, but be ready to head in the opposite direction if you get outvoted (or your teammates just ignore your pin).</p><p>Speaking of …</p><h2><strong>Resist the urge to act like you’re playing solo</strong></h2><figure><figcaption>Image: FromSoftware/Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure><p><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em> is a multiplayer game. And while you can play solo, it is both very tough and removes the down-but-not-out state, which is a real (literal) lifesaver in combat. Solo runs are theoretically doable, and there’s no doubt that some absolute heroes out there will make it work for them, but it’s definitely not ideal for your first time through the game. It’s much more fun to play with other players — even if you don’t know them and aren’t communicating at all — than playing by yourself.</p><p>With that in mind, it’s important to play with your team once you do actually load into a match. You’re at your strongest when you’re playing together and working to help grow everyone’s power, not just your own.</p><h2>Item drops are shared</h2><p>When you kill an enemy, smash a crate, or open a chest, the items that drop aren’t for you alone — they’re shared and collectable across everyone in the party. Sometimes, that means you’re going to be racing to pick up the good stuff. Sometimes, that also means you’ll be better served by letting someone else grab that cool sword. Basically, don’t be a dick.</p><h2><strong>Treat smithing stones and extra flask charges like gold</strong></h2><p>Finding new weapons and leveling up is critical to success as you advance through <em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>. But there are other things you need to focus on as well in order to boost your power. Namely, you should be looking for smithing stones and visiting churches.&nbsp;</p><p>The smithing stones will allow you to upgrade your weapon’s rarity, which can drastically increase its damage output. While you’re leveling up, you should definitely save some Runes for a smithing stone before you take on the Night Lord at the end of your Expedition.&nbsp;</p><p>As you come across churches mid-Expedition, look for the giant, angelic statue. Interact with the altar in front of it to add a healing charge to your flask.</p><h2>Traversal is a lot faster and jumpier</h2><p>Jumping is a lot more important in <em>Nightreign</em>. And there’s a wall jump now that essentially lets you climb vertically on certain surfaces. Oh, and there’s no fall damage in this version of the Lands Between.</p><p>This is good, since every Expedition involves a lot of headlong sprinting across the landscape and you’re going to take some big falls when you’re not paying attention. But it also means there are more options for climbing and just generally getting around the island.</p><h2><strong>Just because you find a boss doesn’t mean you should fight a boss</strong></h2><figure><figcaption>Image: FromSoftware/Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure><p>As you sprint across the map with your buds, you’re going to encounter a ton of different enemies from <em>Elden Ring</em>. They’ll come from every stage, area, and difficulty of the game, all mixed together.</p><p>Some of those enemies will be bosses. Bosses can drop some great loot alongside a ton of Runes — both of which you’ll need for any successful run. But, if you’re not prepared, those bosses can also wipe out your entire party, ending your Expedition before it even gets started.</p><p>There’s only so much you can accomplish over the course of a day, so don’t get too caught up fighting the biggest and baddest thing you encounter. Sometimes it’s better to save those fights until you get more powerful.</p><h2>Relics make you more powerful</h2><p>Not every buff and stat increase happen during an Expedition. At the Roundtable Hold, you can equip Relics by performing Relic Rites.</p><p>Relics are color-coded items that give you benefits on all future expeditions. They do things like add poison damage to your starting weapon or increase your resistances — you’ll need all the help you can get.&nbsp;</p><p>You’ll earn Relics at the end of every Expedition, so even failed runs can benefit you.</p><h2><strong>Watch the UI for critical info</strong></h2><figure><figcaption>Image: FromSoftware/Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure><p>The UI in <em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em> is packed with obvious and not-so-obvious details that are extremely important to look out for. One of the more obviously helpful notifications is one that you can easily miss if you’re too focused on the fights happening all around you: the circle closing.</p><p>The game will tell you the Night Rain is coming toward you via a message box that says “rains gather, portending the tide of Night” in the upper right-hand corner of the screen, just under your Rune counter. Once you get the notification, you’re going to want to mark the safe zone and book it — depending on where you are in the circle, you won’t have much time to get to the next area.</p><p>A not-so-obvious helpful UI tip is that you can tell when you have enough Runes to level up just by looking at the top left-hand corner of your screen. To the left of your current level, you’ll see an arrow pointing up over and over again if you’re rich enough to jump to the next level. Levels are extremely valuable in <em>Nightreign</em>, so make sure you hit a Site of Grace before the next boss fight if you see that arrow.</p><p><strong>For more tips, tricks and guides, visit <a href="https://bigfriendly.guide/guides/elden-ring-nightreign/nightreign-what-you-should-know-beginners-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Big Friendly Guide</a>.</strong></p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-parrying-clair-obscur-ea"><h3>It’s Never Too Late To Talk About A Video Game</h3></a><p>It's also never too late to have *obviously correct* opinions about video game mechanics</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/zenimax-union-contract"><h3>Zenimax Union Reaches Tentative Contract With Microsoft</h3></a><p>The QA worker union has been bargaining for nearly two years</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Elden Ring Nightreign GameSpot Video Review</p>
      </div>
<p>Elden Ring Nightreign is intended as an online co-op game for three players, or solo, but with no option to only play in pairs unless they match with a random third wheel. While a three-person group is quite common in online games, including Apex Legends and Destiny, the lack of a duo option has not gone down well for folks who just want to play with a friend or partner. It's one of the criticisms highlighted amongst the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2622380/ELDEN_RING_NIGHTREIGN/#app_reviews_hash" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">negative reviews on Steam</a>, where the game is currently sitting at a "Mixed" rating. </p><p>The lack of a Duos Mode was made clear during Elden Ring Nightreign's announcement and game director Junya Ishizaki also explained in an <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-fromsoftware-game-director-explains-why-the-spin-off-exists-reveals-whether-george-r-r-martin-was-involved-and-why-fans-shouldnt-call-it-a-live-service" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> interview back in December that the reason behind focusing on three players was "largely a game balancing decision, rather than a game design decision." In a later <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-director-says-duos-were-kind-of-overlooked-and-neglected-as-main-focus-was-on-3-players" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> interview ahead of the game's launch, Ishizaki did however admit that duos were "kind of overlooked and neglected" and hinted that support may come post-launch.</p><p>While nothing has been officially confirmed, this is yet another example of modders stepping in to add such missing features to a game.</p><p>Elden Ring Nightreign is available now for PC, PS4, PS5, X.box One, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

Time to choose your Nightfarer and set out into Limveld in hopes of defeating the Nightlord before you’re lost to the rains. We’ve teamed up with Maxroll to bring you a variety of guides to help you get started, introduce you to each of the Nightfarers and help you navigate the dangers of Limveld.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Getting Started in Nightreign</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Maxroll’s <a href="https://maxroll.gg/elden-ring-nightreign/getting-started/elden-ring-nightreign-beginners-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nightreign <u>beginner's guide</u></a> goes over everything you need to get started: an introduction to each of the 8 playable characters, an explanation of the game's central hub, nagivating Limveld, the basics of combat, and how to handle the Nightlords, before wrapping everything up with a bit of information on Nightreign's metaprogression systems.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Maxroll Nightreign Character Guides</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Learn more about each of the game’s Nightfarers, how their skills work, and some additional information about each of their unique playstyles.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Wylder</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/30/nightreign-2-wylder-1748614589634.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Wylder is a well-rounded character, suitable for beginners. His Sixth Sense passive allows you to cheat death and stay up through one instance of fatal damage. As a generalist, he doesn't excel with any specific weapons, but can use most martial armaments. His favorite weapon is the Greatsword.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://maxroll.gg/elden-ring-nightreign/characters/wylder-character-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Wylder Character Guide</u></a></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Guardian</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/30/nightreign-3-guardian-1748614612549.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The Guardian is Nightreign's tank class. He's most comfortable wielding a large shield and a weapon that can be used while guarding, such as a Halberd, Rapier, or Hand Crossbow. The Guardian deals less damage than the other Nightfarers, but has immense durability and multiple ways to disrupt foes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://maxroll.gg/elden-ring-nightreign/characters/guardian-character-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Guardian Character Guide</u></a></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Ironeye</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/30/nightreign-4-ironeye-1748614631528.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Ironeye is the bow specialist, though his high Dexterity makes him proficient with a variety of other melee weapons such as daggers and curved swords. Unfortunately, his low durability makes him a poor choice as a front-line fighter, so use melee weapons with caution. Overall, his abilities are simple to use, making him an excellent choice for beginners.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://maxroll.gg/elden-ring-nightreign/characters/ironeye-character-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Ironeye Character Guide</u></a></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Duchess</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/30/nightreign-5-duchess-1748614659315.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The Duchess is a dagger-wielding Nightfarer who excels at evasive action to weave in and out of combat. Her starting weapon comes with a potent character skill, enchanting your blade with the Magic affinity for extra damage. In addition, she can adeptly wield Glintstone Sorceries due to her high intelligence, and she has decent Faith scaling for Incantations as well. For the Duchess, look out for weapons with the Magic or Frost Affinity, and those that can trigger statuses like Frostbite or Blood Loss.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://maxroll.gg/elden-ring-nightreign/characters/duchess-character-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Duchess Character Guide</u></a></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3 data-cy="title3">Raider</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/30/nightreign-6-raider-1748614679688.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The Raider has high Strength and uses large/colossal weapons to smash his foes. While he can use a variety of martial armaments well, his FP is extremely low, making it difficult to use weapon skills. The Raider's inherent durability makes him difficult to stagger, helping him ensure that his blows connect.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://maxroll.gg/elden-ring-nightreign/characters/raider-character-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Raider Character Guide</u></a></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Revenant</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/30/nightreign-7-revenant-1748614720933.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The Revenant is a support class, though her high Faith allows her to use offensive Incantations with ease. However, her ability to deal damage is limited as she has no method of FP recovery. Her passive ability summons the shades of foes to fight at your side, distracting enemies and dealing damage.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://maxroll.gg/elden-ring-nightreign/characters/revenant-character-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Revenant Character Guide</u></a></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3 data-cy="title3">Recluse</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/30/nightreign-8-recluse-1748614743897.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">A spellcaster adept who can use her character skill to restore FP, the Recluse excels at unleashing devastation from afar. Her stats favor Sorceries and Incantations, but she can use Magic, Frost, Fire, Holy, and Lightning affinity weapons. This character is a bit more difficult to play as you don't have as many defensive options, and need to manage FP in addition to your Health and Stamina. However, if you do everything correctly, she deals significant damage.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://maxroll.gg/elden-ring-nightreign/characters/recluse-character-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Recluse Character Guide</u></a></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Executor</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/30/nightreign-9-executor-1748614759386.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The Executor excels in single combat. He has high Dexterity and Arcane, giving him access to a majority of the game's smaller weapons. Look out for Katanas in particular, as these scale off of Dexterity while also triggering the Blood Loss status to enemies. Position carefully because the Executor has low durability.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://maxroll.gg/elden-ring-nightreign/characters/executor-character-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Executor Character Guide</u></a></p><h2 data-cy="title2">Nightreign Map Guides</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/30/nightreign-10-map-1748614774402.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The Limveld map is teeming with points of interest to explore. Maxroll’s <a href="https://maxroll.gg/elden-ring-nightreign/guides/limveld-map-key-locations" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Limveld Map &amp; Key Locations guide</a> teaches you about the various encounters, what mob types to expect, and the rewards you can earn for clearing them. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As you explore, you'll encounter random events known as <strong>Raid Events</strong> which often involve fighting a challenging foe. If you clear the raid, you earn a valuable Power for the remainder of your run; learn more with Maxroll’s <a href="https://maxroll.gg/elden-ring-nightreign/guides/raid-event-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Raid Events guide</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Defeating Nightlords unlocks Shifting Earth events. Each of these events transforms a quadrant of the map into a unique zone, frequently filled with lots of bosses to fight - and similar to Raid Events, they award a special power when cleared. Learn more with <a href="https://maxroll.gg/elden-ring-nightreign/guides/shifting-earth-events" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maxroll’s Shifting Earth event guide</a>.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Nightreign Resources</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/30/nightreign-11-resources-1748614809755.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Explore <strong>Roundtable Hold</strong>, Nightreign’s main hub area. Here, you can switch your characters, perform Relic Rites to prepare for the next expedition, test things in the Sparring ground, read up on the game with the Visual Codex, explore your character’s story at the Journal, and set out from the Table of Lost Grace to do battle against a Nightlord. Learn about all this in Maxroll's <a href="https://maxroll.gg/elden-ring-nightreign/guides/roundtable-hold" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Roundtable Hold guide.</u></a></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Relics</strong> and <strong>Vessels</strong> are part of Nightreign’s metaprogression system. At the end of each run, you earn Relics and Murk, which you can spend at the Small Jar Bazaar. Some Relics have random affixes that may or may not be useful, whereas others (often earned through character quests or by defeating bosses) have fixed stats and are quite powerful. As you progress in the game, you also unlock additional Vessels, letting you equip a different Relic combination on your Nightfarer. Learn more about this system with Maxroll’s <a href="https://maxroll.gg/elden-ring-nightreign/guides/relics-vessels-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Relics and Vessels guide</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Many of the Sorceries and Incantations in Nightreign belong to a specific Spell School. The Spell School determines which modifiers buff your spells - for example, a Glintstone Sorcery won't benefit from bonuses to Godslayer Incantations. This isn't very clearly explained, though, so if you’re curious on how to buff your Spells, check out Maxroll’s <a href="https://maxroll.gg/elden-ring-nightreign/guides/incantation-sorcery-types" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sorcery and Incantation School Guide</a>.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Maxroll's Nightreign Database</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/30/nightreign-12-database-1748614846283.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Browse Maxroll’s <a href="https://maxroll.gg/elden-ring-nightreign/getting-started/elden-ring-nightreign-beginners-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u><strong>Elden Ring Nightreign Database</strong></u></a> to learn more about the Weapons, skills, spells, Relics, Vessels, Relic modifiers, Talismans, passive traits, and Nightfarers available in the game.
