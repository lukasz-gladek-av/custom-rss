                <p>Microsoft announced some <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-price-hike-announced-now-costs-30-month-for-ultimate/1100-6535138/" data-ref-id="1100-6535138">significant changes for Xbox Game Pass today</a>, headlined by a 50% price increase for Game Pass Ultimate, bringing it up to $30/month. But it may not be the last change for the service, according to at least one expert.</p><p><a href="https://x.com/ZhugeEX/status/1973424993909211530" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">According to Niko Partners analyst Daniel Ahmad</a>, Microsoft is betting that its console players stay loyal to Game Pass even at the higher price while the company continues to release more and more games on rival platforms like PS5 and Switch 2, in addition to its ongoing efforts in the PC market. Ahmad also suggested Microsoft could look at an ad-based tier for Game Pass to help the subscription service remain sustainable.</p><p>"The primary concern for Xbox at this time is managing the transition from a closed-console-based ecosystem to an open multi-device ecosystem. Console sales have dropped considerably, PC Game Pass uptake has been slow, and cloud is still seen as an extension of existing play, rather than a primary entry point," he said.</p><p>"The bet that Microsoft is making here is that its existing console base remains loyal to Game Pass at higher prices (or current prices with Premium), while it looks to ramp up growth on PC, PS5 and Switch 2 via day one / late ports that are fully priced," Ahmad added.</p><h2><strong>A Game Pass ad tier?</strong></h2><p>Can Game Pass remain sustainable for Microsoft against this backdrop? That's the "big question," Ahmad said. The company may look to a variety of sources to help grow Game Pass in the future, including by introducing an ad-supported tier, Ahmad said.</p><p>"The big question going forward is if Game Pass can be a sustainable product off console and how best they can reach this audience. At the very least that's going to require a lower entry cost (Essential) and experimentation with cloud only, ad supported, or mobile-first offerings," he said.</p><p>It's expected that Game Pass will continue to evolve over time, but whether or not the things Ahmad said, like an ad tier, come to fruition remains to be seen. How an ad-based version of Game Pass could work is unknown. Back in 2012, Square Enix launched an ad-based streaming game service called Coreonline before <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/square-enix-kills-ad-supported-streaming-service/1100-6417195/" data-ref-id="1100-6417195">killing it off 15 months later due to a lack of uptake from players.</a></p><p>For now, Game Pass Ultimate is going up in price from $20 to $30 per month, while the Core and Standard tiers have been renamed Essential and Premium (with no price hikes). For the increased price, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/what-are-fortnite-crew-and-ubisoft-classics-the-new-game-pass-ultimate-perks/1100-6535143/" data-ref-id="1100-6535143">Ultimate subscribers are getting Fortnite Crew and Ubisoft+ Classics</a> added to their memberships, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/94-new-game-pass-games-released-today-heres-the-full-list/2900-7083/" data-ref-id="2900-7083">a lot more games.</a></p><p>The price increases for Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass come just ahead of the release of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-everything-we-know-about-rumored-black-ops-2-sequel/1100-6529073/" data-ref-id="1100-6529073">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> in November.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-gets-ubisoft-classics-fortnite-crew-and-a-ridiculous-price-increase.1314226/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Microsoft has announced a major shakeup of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Xbox Game Pass</a>, bringing more games to players across its four versions, including the addition of Ubisoft+ to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, but with the top tier getting a staggering, frankly ridiculous 50% price increase because of this.</p>
<p>Xbox Game Pass Ultimate has long been the go-to tier for Game Pass, giving access to a library of games, Day One access to a bunch of new releases (including all first party games), cloud game streaming, and online console multiplayer. Now, Microsoft is guaranteeing at least 75 day one games will be added each year, and the addition of Ubisoft+ Classic and Fortnite Crew.</p>



<p>The price of Game Pass Ultimate has crept up in the last few years, and has stood at $19.99 and £14.99 per month since last summer. Now, though, the price is going up by 50% to $29.99 and £22.99 per month.</p>
<p>That’s justified by the Fortnite Crew addition, which is valued at $12 a month as it gives you the Fortnite Battle Pass and 1000 V Bucks each month, and the Ubisoft+ Classics library, which is valued at $8 per month. It’s starting to sound a bit like cable TV or Sky Sports, where you pay through the nose for a huge package of channels, even if you only really want the one thing.</p>

<p>This now puts a massive premium on Game Pass Ultimate and, while there’s additions and more promises, it feels like Microsoft is readjusting the business model in a way to compensate for “lost” revenue from first party game sales. If you see no value from Fortnite Crew or Ubisoft+, then this is just a huge price increase.</p>
<p>The other way to get day one games, in a more limited fashion, is with PC Game Pass. This is only usable with Windows PC – and with the upcoming Ally X handheld – and is going up from $11.99 / £9.99 to $16.49 &nbsp;/ £13.49. The only change here is the addition of Ubisoft+, getting it for $4.50 / £3.50.</p>
<p>Game Pass Standard has now been rebranded as Game Pass Premium, thankfully holding onto the same $14.99 / £10.99 price point. This is actually just becoming a better deal, as while you don’t have day one games, you will get Xbox published games added within a year of launch, and there is now priority cloud gaming for the Game Pass Premium library and for select games that you own.</p>
<p>The runt of the litter remains Game Pass Essential, which replaced Xbox Live Gold a good while ago. Sticking with $9.99 / £6.99 per month (and I believe still with a 12 month purchase possible) this is required for online gaming, and includes a much smaller selection of games. That’s been doubled now, from 25+ to 50+ games, and you can now access cloud gaming.</p>
<p>All of this comes down to how you use Game Pass to consume games. Do you like the additions to Game Pass Ultimate, or would you be reconsidering your subscription at this price point?</p>

            <p>
There just doesn't seem to be a good time to release a game right now, does there? We all saw the way that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-walkthrough">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> scared away plenty of games, even games with completely different genres. And sometimes it's just a case of a particular month being stacked - just this month alone there's Ghost of Yotei, Battlefield 6, Pokemon Legends Z-A, Ninja Gaiden 4, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a>, Dispatch, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a>, the list truly goes on. So, I really can't blame developer Digital Sun, who've announced that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/moonlighter-2-the-endless-vault">Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault</a> has been delayed.
</p>
<p>
The developer shared word of said delay in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2350790/view/525355229451912554?l=english">Steam news post</a> earlier today, as the game was originally slated for release October 23rd, later this month. But, as they note, "the month has filled up with so many other great releases that we feel it has become too crowded for us. And as every wise shopkeeper knows, even the most precious gem can be overlooked in an overstuffed showcase." So now, you can expect the game to launch on November 19th, a little more than a month later.
</p>
<p>
As a little bonus to make up for the delay, Digital Sun will also be running some closed playtests to let you try the game out, in particular to get a feel for some of the changes made based on community feedback. More details on that are coming soon, apparently.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/moonlighter">Moonlighter</a> 2 looks like it's picking up where the original game left things off, gameplay wise at least, having now been transported to the realm of 3D. Based on an interview between the devs and <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/moonlighter-2-the-endless-vault-preview-inteview-hades-inspired/">TheGamer</a> earlier this year, you can also expect it to fully lean into being a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a>, which admittedly is a bit of an oversaturated genre right now. Fingers crossed the still fun concept of having to plunge into dungeons to stock your own shop is strong enough to find success this time around too!

<nav><ul><li><a href="#from-star-wars-to-the-matrix,-five-awesome-recreations-of-famous-ships" title="From Star Wars to The Matrix, five awesome recreations of famous ships">From Star Wars to The Matrix, five awesome recreations of famous ships</a></li><li><a href="#five-sick-original-ship-builds" title="Five sick original ship builds">Five sick original ship builds</a></li><li><a href="#five%e2%80%a6creative-ship-builds" title="Five…creative ship builds">Five…creative ship builds</a></li></ul></nav></div>
<p><i>No Man’s Sky</i> continues to impress with its regular updates, and the most recent one was surely one of the most eventful. That’s because it allows players to build massive ships of their own design, with fully explorable interiors, resulting in some epic ships their creators are sharing across the internet.</p> <p>If you frequent <i>NMS</i> spaces online, you’ve likely seen some of these. But whether you’re a regular spacefarer or it’s been some time since you’ve taken a look at Hello Games’ vast and ever-improving galaxy, I invite you to have a gander at some of the most impressive ship builds out there.</p>

 <h2><span id="from-star-wars-to-the-matrix,-five-awesome-recreations-of-famous-ships"></span>From <i>Star Wars</i> to <i>The Matrix</i>, five awesome recreations of famous ships<span></span></h2> <p>Give folks the ability to make stuff in a video game and you’ll quickly see recreations of beloved people, places, or things from TV shows, film, and other games. In <i>No Man’s Sky</i>, that mostly means ships, and there are tons of excellent recreations of famous ships out there in the <i>NMS </i>galaxy. Here are five standouts.</p>

 <h3>John_Dog_’s Millennium Falcon from <i>Star Wars</i></h3>  <p>It was hard to not just fill this list up with <i>Star Wars</i> recreations. Though it required a bit of glitching to make happen, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame/comments/1nui1ju/i_know_theres_been_a_lot_of_these_but_i_had_to/">this Falcon</a> is one of the most accurate I’ve seen.</p>

 <hr> <h3>Own–Astronomer-1296’s Sea Duck from <i>Duck Tales</i></h3>  <p>Maybe this one technically belongs in the collection of sillier ships you’ll find below, but given how ships can now land on water, there’s a satisfying fusion of form and function in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame/comments/1nhh5qz/i_think_ive_peaked_the_sea_duck/">this <i>Duck Tales</i> recreation</a>.</p>

 <hr> <h3>Due_Willow_137’s Pyramid ship from <i>Destiny 2</i></h3>  <p>No, this is not a screenshot from <i>Destiny 2</i>, though it <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame/comments/1nu8e1s/pyramid_vessel/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">sure as hell looks like one</a>.</p> <hr> <h3>solidsharkey’s Eagle 5 from <i>Space Balls</i></h3>  <p>Having spent countless weeks traveling and living out of a van myself, I’ve often dreamed of having my own <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame/comments/1ndkz7i/spaceballs_the_video_game/">Eagle 5</a> to just cruise space with.</p>

 <hr> <h3>AcoupleofIrishfolk’s Nebuchadnezzar from <i>The Matrix</i></h3>  <p>While the exterior design of this recreation of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame/comments/1n99tpb/the_nebuchadnezzar/">Morpheus’ ship from <i>The Matrix</i> looks sick</a>, it’s the faithfully recreated interior, complete with screens and cables running everywhere, that really sold this build for me.</p>

 <h2><span id="five-sick-original-ship-builds"></span>Five sick original ship builds<span></span></h2> <p>It’s wild how flexible <i>NMS</i>’ shipbuilding system is. I’ve particularly enjoyed seeing builds that deliver on aesthetics not normally found in Hello Games’ otherwise kinda cartoony presentation.</p> <h3>Barbed-Wire’s ‘Lived-in’ corvette</h3>  <p>Maybe I just have a thing for living out of vehicles?

 <hr> <h3>Beckhaver’s ‘Mini Salve Outrider with Trailer’</h3>  <p>I love the simplicity and originality of this two-part build.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-tactics-jobs-ranking-best-ivalice-chronicles-2000630679</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-best-jobs-in-final-fantasy-tactics-ranked.1314214/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-tactics-remaster-review-ivalice-chronicles-2000628040"><em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> is renowned</a> for its clever, quirky, and deeply customizable job system. It might be the best job system in any game ever. It’s certainly the best in Square Enix’s long-running RPG franchise (<em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> fans can fight me in the Dorter Slums after work). But how do you decide which one to choose? Here’s my list of the best ones, based on a combination of their sheer power and how fun they are to play with.</p> <p>A word of warning: you won’t find jobs like Time Mage, Mimic, or Arithmetician in the ranking below. That’s because while each of those contains some of the most powerful abilities in the game, they are each highly situational and/or better when paired with other jobs as the primary one. So while you should make sure everyone learns some of the Time Mage’s skills, you should never be fielding one just for fun. And while Mimic and Arithmetician are responsible for some of the deadliest combos in the game, they also both come with huge drawbacks that ultimately disqualify them for our purposes here.</p>

 <p>The jobs below are the ones that will get you <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-tactics-tips-guide-ivalice-remaster-jobs-2000630228">the most bang for your buck</a> and are the ones you’ll want to revert back to once your characters have mastered the rest of their skills.</p> <h2>10. Orator (Requires Mystic Lv.3)</h2> <p>Final Fantasy loves experimenting with offbeat character classes and in <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> that’s the Mediator. This job talks and carries a gun. That’s it. While not the most powerful or effective, it’s pretty versatile and lots of fun. Intimidate lowers a unit’s Bravery and can turn them into a chicken. Mimic Darlavon can put even some bosses to sleep. All of these abilities cost zero MP and have no cast time. Also the hat rules.</p>

 <h2>9. Geomancer (Requires Monk Lv.4)</h2> <p>What if a knight also had magic? This is <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em>‘ version of the Blue Mage. Geomancers can carry swords and shields but also hit enemies from far away with environmental magic based on what type of terrain they’re standing on. Each attack comes with its own chance to proc a debuff like slow or petrify. The attacks don’t do much damage but they are free, happen immediately, and can chip away at foes while you’re closing the distance.</p>

 <h2>8. Dragoon (Requires Thief Lv.4)</h2> <p>Dragoons have the tankiest stat growth and also the coolest-looking armor. They can hit from two squares away with javelins, keeping them out of harm’s way for enemy melee counters. Plus they can ignore elevation when moving, and Jump allows them to hit faraway enemies for extra damage while staying out of danger for most of their turn. They aren’t very flashy or fun but they can take a beating and still dish it out, one-shotting pesky enemy mages from far away.</p>

 <h2>7. Black Mage (Requires Chemist Lv.2)</h2> <p>Black Mages have the highest base magic attack power in the game and make things, including on occasion their friends or even themselves, go boom. All you really need to know.</p> <h2>6. White Mage (Requires Chemist Lv.2)</h2> <p>This is the most versatile magic class because it can revive fallen party members and attack with Holy. Like its Black Mage counter-part, Flare, Holy also only targets one square, letting you nuke enemies without fear of friendly fire. In addition to full-heal revives with Arise, Reraise lets you revive allies ahead of time before sending them to draw enemy fire. The only downside is that all of this costs a boatload of MP.</p>

 <h2>5. Summoner (Requires Time Mage Lv.3)</h2> <p>Summoners have the most powerful attack spells in the game. Unlike Black Mages, their summons can’t hurt allies and also have wider areas of impact. Cyclops and Bahamut do incredible damage and their casting times in <em>The Ivalice Chronicles</em> remaster have all been buffed. Plus Lich is absolutely necessary for late-game boss fights where enemies have over 1,000 HP. That’s because it does damage on a percentage of total HP basis, letting it hit for 999 damage. Also Golem is a great support summon for soaking up Archer fire in-between turns.</p>

 <h2>4. Ninja (Requires Archer Lv.4, Thief Lv.5, Geomancer Lv.2)</h2> <p>Two words: Dual-Wield. The only thing cooler than one sword is two swords, and the Ninja job gives you that. Or two flails if you’re an RNG sicko. Ninjas have great movement and speed, and can be outfitted with enough evasion to make their squishy HP less susceptible to being quickly depleted. The throwing attack isn’t the best but it’s another decent ranged option for picking enemies off from afar.</p> <h2>3. Samurai (Requires Knight Lv.4, Monk Lv.5, Dragoon Lv.2)</h2> <p>Okay, maybe I lied. The only thing cooler than two swords is one big sword that you lift up over your head to cast magic with. The Samurai is another interesting riff of the “what if Knight but also Mage?” question. The Iaido abilities scale with magic attack and let you heal, buff, debuff, and damage a big area around your character without having to worry about friendly fire. It can be expensive early on when your swords randomly break in-between uses, but more tanky-ness than the Ninja and Geomancer also adds to the appeal. Some other people would put Ninja ahead of Samurai, and that’s because they get a perverse satisfaction out of constantly having to revive them.</p> <h2>2. Chemist (Unlocked from the start)</h2> <p>Unlocked right from the start, Chemists are the true workhorses of the <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> combat economy. They’re far from flashy but they provide incredible value, instantly healing without needing to wait for spells to cast or hoping they have enough MP left in the tank. They also get guns and they automatically discover items hidden beneath them during battle sometimes. There is almost no battle in<em> Final Fantasy Tactics</em> you can’t eventually win simply by throwing dozens and dozens of potions and phoenix downs at it. Plus they have lots of fun pouches.</p> <h2>1. Monk (Requires Knight Lv.3)</h2> <p>The Monk. Where do I begin? They don’t need weapons or hats so you don’t need to spend a ton of money on upkeep. They have the best physical attack growth in the game and the Martial Arts ability is by far the most useful. They have ranged options and can revive allies or get rid of status effects for free. Plus they are the only Job that can restore MP to multiple characters at once, keeping your big Mage guns fueled up. The only drawback is these abilities are severely hampered by differences in elevation so you have to play smart. But when all else fails, just punch everyone in the face really, really hard. Works every time.</p>

<p>This collection doesn't just include the Blue Blur, either — both his sidekick Tails and Shadow the Hedgehog will be featured on much of the apparel landing in-store and online later this month.</p>
<p>The complete range will include a pair of Sonic-inspired Puma Inhales, pairs of Tails and Shadow-designed Puma Inverses, and a range of apparel such as matching track jacket and track pants, a hoodie, shorts, a racer shirt, cap, and waist band.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067sltqmz&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>835k</span></a></p>

<p>Plus, the collab doesn't end there — those racing around in CrossWorlds will be able to get in-game decals from Puma that you can use to customise your vehicles with.</p>
<p>Honestly? We kind of just want the little Tails and Shadow lace shrouds. They're pretty cute and we could make them work on <em>anything</em>.</p>
<hr>
<p>Well, we'll have to wait and see how much the collection will cost. For now, you can admire the press shots above and let us know what you think of everything in the comments<em>.</em></p>

In particular, the rise of online communities and how they are the modern day gathering place, the role of avatars, and how our communication changes due to that. How this affects studios and real life will be explored, and overall is dedicated to giving shape and context to why online communities are so powerful and different than what we might think. It ends off on the author’s philosophy on the top community desire, which is to be seen, heard, and like they matter. Thus, this section will be the guidepost to driving strategy in a positive direction.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="What is Community?">What is Community?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When I first joined Habbo Hotel, an online social game (A.K.A. chat rooms with avatars), it was pandemonium. Massive amounts of spam in the shared spaces, rampant not-safe-for-work rooms, and more. In particular, I was part of someone’s America’s Next Top Model community, where players would line up to have their outfits judged based on the theme, and the winner would gain access to the exclusive "friend group" and back area. Losers were kicked out of the room. It was fun, but most of all, the friendships I gained there felt real, and one older girl took me under her wing to guard me from creepy guys. I’d eagerly wait for school to end so I could go back to be part of what felt like an exclusive group.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/marketing/what-happens-when-a-colossus-like-silksong-scuppers-your-launch-plans-" target="_self" data-discover="true">What happens when a colossus like Silksong scuppers your launch plans?</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I wasn’t a part of the Habbo Hotel community because I signed up for an account. No—I became a part of the community when I actually started using the platform, talking to people, and actively participating in what it had to offer me.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the simplest terms: community is when a group of people have a shared sense of belonging that allows them to gather, engage, and connect with each other.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Community is more than just a group of people in a space. If it were simply that, anytime you opened the App Store on your iPhone, you’d be part of the "App Store community". There is a difference between being in the same space as someone and feeling like you matter and encouraged to reach out to people. You don’t even need a platform to have a community either! Obviously communities have long existed before Facebook was invented. They have evolved in terms of where people go to find community. As we dive into building up communities, we must keep in mind these questions:</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/marketing/xbox-explains-how-devs-can-make-the-most-of-streaming-showcase-spots" target="_self" data-discover="true">How developers can make the most of streaming showcases</a></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Who are the people we want participating in our space?&nbsp;</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Where is the space they are gathering in?</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">What is the common language, slang, jargon, customs they will participate in?</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Why are they there?

Community is what urges people into action. Community is what helps people grow, learn, and be exposed to a world outside of their own bubble. No matter where we are—online or offline—people crave a group of people like them. And the internet? It opens up a whole new level of exposure to people’s lives… and some new problems too. As community professionals we’re able to shape how these people connect and understand each other.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Communities are exactly the kind of thing developers are looking for in order to create better, more enjoyable game experiences. Metrics and data tracking will help quantify the most popular choices and issues in a game. A good community will work hand-in-hand with data to reveal even more: why something has occurred, the experiences and logic behind it, the emotions others may feel, and if this is something others would want.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/marketing/steam-defaults-to-language-specific-review-scores-to-provide-a-better-indication-of-user-sentiment-" target="_self" data-discover="true">Steam defaults to language-specific review scores to provide 'a better indication of user sentiment'</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Communities don’t just make sense culturally, but design and business-wise too.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="How Communities Form">How Communities Form</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bear with me as we dive into some solid sociology. How you tackle community management will start from the base assumptions you have of people and their interactions, and knowing your own base line will help you figure out what and why you decide to go a certain way, and if there is a different viewpoint that may help you gain perspective and understanding.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Culture and Community">Culture and Community</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Culture refers to the learned sets of meaning and behavior between members in a community. Interestingly, many people might not even be aware of their cultural nuances until they encounter a different one. Think of how a player might experience a cultural "shock" if they were to swap from playing multiplayer Stardew Valley to a competitive game of League of Legends. What is considered normal in one place might be entirely different in another.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Unlike a rigid method of living, culture can be considered more like a template that shapes people’s behavior. Almost like how a game can have a joint set of emotes players can pick from to add and remove as they wish. New members are able to pick up and learn the template, add their own spin to it, and the template can evolve overtime. These templates aren’t often followed in their entirety, but they give many people a starting point to learn how to interact in ways that both enhance bonds and minimize misunderstandings. It’s powerful!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Religion, marriage, and even memes are a form of culture. Culture change often moves MUCH faster than laws can (e.g. internet culture has evolved at a much faster pace than any entertainment or media law can keep up with), but sometimes law can move or define the culture (for instance, the death penalty.) And the communities we create inevitably have their own type of subculture within the larger "culture" of the gaming community.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This act of actually influencing and shaping behavior is called socialization. This is a life-long, active process—it can change overtime, and takes time to form as we. Children in particular soak this up quickly, but also will try to negotiate and limit test to see where the boundaries are. With each "failure" they have (e.g. every time they get in trouble for acting a certain way), they learn what behaviors are okay. (You may find that adults in your community will limit test too. But they’re not children. They’re just annoying. Heh. I’m joking. Kinda.)&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We’re able to shape not just communities, but literally the culture someone is in. I don’t say this to inflate us into some life changing entity, but we do have a large influence on how the spaces we work in progress and interact with each other. And the culture players are in is important, beyond just having someone to talk to! It also influences the kinds of people they’re exposed to, their resources, and even their attitudes and biases.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The Rise of Online Communities">The Rise of Online Communities</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So, fun fact, the internet is pretty popular nowadays. (This is the kind of groundbreaking insight you’re reading this book for, I know.) Especially when it comes to our games, whether AAA or indie, we rely on having a healthy community to give us feedback and sustain our studios.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There are three main areas in which your community may form as it relates to games:</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Social networks.</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> While social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and other services are generally not necessarily conducive to back and forth conversation between players, there’s no denying it’s an important part of how gamers interact and find each other, so would feel wrong not to dive into the most culturally relevant platform. &nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Forums.</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> I include instant chat services like Discord in this. Reddit, Steam forums, or your own hosted forums on a website. While not as prolific as before, these are one of the places some of your most hardcore fans will be.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>In-Game.</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> While this book will focus less on the actual in-game design of spaces (as those primarily lie with the game designer), the in-game community is inextricably linked to the community that gathers outside of it, so it’s important to take note of how they influence each other.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It doesn’t matter where you start out, so long as the players can find you. As your community gets bigger, it’s likely they will branch off and create communities not directly tied to you. This is good! It’s a sign of a successful game when you aren’t able to control every aspect of it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While we have fallen into a slight trap of the internet needing to be "entertaining" to be worthy—this is not the way we should be tackling it. As community builders, we can make the internet more than just entertainment. It is belonging, growth, and learning.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Third Spaces">Third Spaces</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I like to think of online communities working very similarly to real life cities or neighborhoods. A city is a conglomeration of people from all walks of life—different cultures, beliefs, socioeconomic backgrounds, and so on. Even in monocultural countries, there are still differences between people and their understandings of the world, plus tourists, in many cases. A well planned city has multiple places in which people can gather together—parks, libraries, public recreational areas, community centers, block parties, etc. There is lots of care and consideration for how people find each other in cities that aren’t necessarily profit driven. Online communities need that same amount of care and consideration—structuring and designing the space for it to survive in the long term, whether that’s for a business or not.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">These places where people gather in cities can be described by a term coined by the sociologist Ray Oldenburg: "third spaces". These places refer to spots that someone goes to that are not their usual social environments of the home and the workplace. (And now with remote work, sometimes there isn’t even a "second" place.) Third places can be things like parks, a cafe you frequent, public libraries, gyms, bars, churches, community centers, a comic book store, etc. Oldenburg argues these third places are incredible important for society, engagement, and feeling like you truly belong in a place.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">And with the prevalence of the internet, many people are starting to find an almost "fourth" place there. Or perhaps, in some scenarios, the internet IS someone’s third places due to a lack of accessible real life third places (distance, a global pandemic, etc.)&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Thinking about digital communication through the lens of the spaces we build is important because it encourages us to consider how that design and structure can shape relationships, rather than just using it to advertise products or exchange information. A community requires not only common goals or interests, but a sense of interactivity and understanding between each other.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If we look at what a third space needs to be considered one, we can see that the internet actually can contain a lot of similar characteristics:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Neutral ground: There is no obligation to be in the space and you are free to leave and come back whenever you want.&nbsp;</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Leveler: Your socioeconomic status, unless in a game that has pay-to-win tendencies, is not apparent nor overly important.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Conversation is main activity: Light-hearted and good-natured conversation is the main focus of the space, though not the only activity.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Accessibility &amp; accommodation: Must be accessible and provide for those the enter the space.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Regulars: A number of regular people that visit the space that set the mood, tone, and characteristics. Often they help newcomers feel welcome.&nbsp;</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A low profile: Not pretentious, accepting of people that come to it no matter their background.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Playful mood: Being playful and good natured is common and highly valued.&nbsp;</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Home away from home: A feeling of belongingness and regeneration by spending time there.&nbsp;</span></p></div></li></ul></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This is, of course, assuming all goes well and no laws are being broken. But if we take these characteristics and apply them to game communities, we can see many of our characteristics or at least goals aligning.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A well functioning community relies on collective efficacy, which is a group’s ability to trust each other and work together. There are shared expectations on behalf of the common good of the space (e.g. not throwing trash into your neighbor’s lawn.)&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The cool thing here is you don’t need strong social connections for collective efficacy to occur. You don’t have to like every single one of the people in your city to be able to make something happen, just a mutual sense of understanding and trust. And having this makes living or interacting in space that much more pleasant.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A mutual sense of trust is maintained by:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A willingness to help others out.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Taking actions to gain understanding.</span></p></div></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So in our roles, we want to encourage and create this sense of mutual working trust not only between players, but between the developers and players.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">And to combat any naysayers about internet communities being inherently "bad" – what does that mean? Before you can assign a judgment like that, we need to be clear about what the role and function of an online community is supposed to be.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This isn’t to say online spaces can replace (or should replace) real life third spaces. However, they’re an almost inevitable part of life, especially as the years go on. We still need strong resources, third spaces, and offline interactions, but there’s no denying a huge chunk of time for younger folks (wow I feel old) has been replaced by time spent on social media, or in our case, in games.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Because of this, we can’t just ignore online communities or treat them with blanket templates or rules. Community managers are the designers and maintainers. What are we doing then?&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Avatars, Personas, Anonymity&nbsp;">Avatars, Personas, Anonymity&nbsp;</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A special part of online communities in particular is the persona people can create—whether in game or on social platforms. Whether it’s a highly curated version of themselves, a completely new version, or even an anonymous entity, there are endless options for people to be what they want to be.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As social media has become more prolific and being an influencer as a career choice becomes more interesting to folks, you may also see a rebound effect where folks begin to overshare. Daily vlogs, relatable content, personal life confessions, even babies can be dragged into it before they’ve even begun to understand what consent is if parents begin to do it. We’ve evolved past the time where it’s weird to be friends with internet strangers. Arguably, it’s even expected and professional in games.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Even more than other industries, part of the fun of games is to adopt some sort of persona online. Game communities are great at being a leveler in that sense. Through avatars, profile pictures, and text chat, social identification is dependent on those chosen aspects rather than judging the actual face of the person behind it, or even the voice. (This is separate from badges or follower counts one may have, but at the onset, everyone starts from 0.) This isn’t to say that people don’t go by their real name or photos, but that a large part of gaming culture is the ability to embody the character or avatar you want to be. It’s common to refer to someone as only their online name—knowing them as an alias rather than their legal given name. To know their character more than they know your face. This creation of social identity—masking the background or visual cues (and sometimes things like accents) add to the interesting dynamic of social interactions in games, where the playing field seems "level" and it’s assumed at first glance, everyone is coming from a similar background and history as you.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While it’s great this happens, it also creates a higher chance of culture clash with the high levels of interactivity with low context.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Communication Changes">Communication Changes</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As communication channels evolve with the help of reaction GIFs, emotes, emojis, and memes, this creates further incentive for folks to chat with each other in a shared language. This is particularly helpful for people who may have struggled in real world communication.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">However, while removing face-to-face interactions means the nuances of expressions are gone (for better or for worse), it’s replaced by written nuances. Is typing in proper punctuation in a casual conversation seen as someone being tense or stoic? Is typing in all caps angry yelling or just fun excitement? What happens when voice chat is added to the mix, but again with no facial cues?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">These changes in communication styles are things we need to constantly keep in mind as online communities develop and attempt to understand each other.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Studios and Communities">Studios and Communities</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I can rant and rave about how wonderful and culturally significant communities are, but at the same time, I know what you’re here for. Community management falls under a larger marketing umbrella, and especially with independent studios, you often have the role of handling numerous aspects of social, marketing, public relations, and even sales.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So, while we will be tackling the values and ethics of communities, we can also acknowledge that while living in a capitalist society, there is a business value to maintaining communities too. While the two may seem to clash with each other, there are ways in which they find a happy medium that we must find. After all—we need to survive as community managers and studios too! We have games to make!&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For many, the actual business value of a community is hard to calculate. The value will be determined by the key players in your studio, here is a small example of what communities can do for a studio. (We will dive into actual tracking further on in the book, don’t worry!)</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Loyal fan bases for repeat customers</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Word of mouth marketing (the best!)</span></p></div></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Helping new players understand how to play a game/leading them</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Lightening direct lift of onboarding and teaching</span></p></div></li><li></li></ul></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In games, it’s wild to think we are willing to sit down for things like Nintendo Directs, E3 (RIP), and other similar showcases. While new game releases and updates are very cool, it all technically is just an advertisement.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Movies do have something similar, where you watch trailers if you are early enough to a movie premiere. But the closest thing you get to people wanting to willingly watch ads at such a hyper focused scale is something like an Apple presentation.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But this is why a community is so important. All these events have some sort of community surrounding them, willing to do something like watch 3 hours of advertisements but also willing to tell their friends about it. There is a level of identity and excitement. You can always copy the infrastructure of a community but you cannot copy the identity, relationships, and emotional depth of one. Your community is your own, and that’s what makes it valuable and so hard to cultivate. You can’t copy it!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Your community is willing to sit down and get excited with you. It’s an incredible power to be able to move people, particularly into action, which is why when we build and maintain our communities, we need to ensure we’re doing it right by them, the industry, and ourselves. This is where designing communities for kindness comes in.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Real Life Still Affects Life Online">Real Life Still Affects Life Online</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One of the things we need to acknowledge before we get into our own design of communities and kindness are the limitations we work in.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Communities are not a substitute for individual growth or real life interactions and everyday living. While online spaces can be many things—a reprieve, a place for growth and learning, a place of solace—it is not a replacement. It is an enhancement of one's own lived experiences and communities, expanding it and providing context that may have never come to be before. It can encourage actions and growth, but we are not beings that can detach our regular lives from our online spaces. The internet cannot completely rip away the importance of real life interactions and circumstances.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It’d be wrong to talk about community building without considering—gasp—capitalism. The fact we work in spaces that need to profit does change our interactions with it. And there’s nothing wrong with acknowledging that—in fact, we HAVE to. We need to understand what the boundaries are if we are to ethically engage with our communities in a way that is beneficial to both the people and the studio.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For instance—class and income levels can drastically affect who spends time online. According to a study by the PEW Research Center in 2015, teens who are from more affluent households are more likely than those from lower-income households to say they hang out with friends in person outside of school. Lower-income teens are also less likely to play online games with in-person friends as opposed to their more affluent peers.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So, as we create communities online, we need to account for and consider situations in which we are inadvertently making biased assumptions in both structure and management of them. For instance, when we create communities, are we considering how some of the most vulnerable groups are being onboarded and welcomed into the space? For example, we can account for:</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This is not to say we need to give up entirely or even that it’s a huge undertaking to consider these things. Merely that as you continue reading this book, keep in mind what kind of biases you may hold about a player (e.g. "ugh why are they using such an old rig to play this game and complaining) and consider how we can approach situations with the nuance they often deserve.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="How are Game Communities Different?">How are Game Communities Different?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game communities aren’t like other B2C communities. (Cue the "I’m not like other girls" joke here.) The audience will be influenced by a number of factors, including: studio culture/voice, game genre(s), game tone, and number of players. From this, you can judge where your primary community demographic will come from, and how you can design appropriately.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With games, we are closely tied to our players. This is also because games are such an intense bonding experience—you physically feel like you are in the game, taking on the character, experiencing the stories. So! The communities we create and what they bond over will be influenced by the structure and rules, but also the kinds of games the studio makes. They will attract certain kinds of people seeing a certain kind of experience. That being said, this doesn’t mean your horror shooter game cannot find a positive, warm audience. Merely that your structure may have to account for a different mindset going straight in.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Examples of the type of community ethos a certain game may attract:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Mastery: Comprehensive knowledge or skill in a subject or accomplishment. Example games: Dwarf Fortress, Darkest Dungeon, Cuphead, Monster Hunter</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Competitiveness: Having a strong desire to be more successful than others. Example games: Rocket League, League of Legends, Fortnite</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Kindness: friendliness, coziness, generosity, trust, or inclusion dynamics. Example games: A Short Hike, Tiny Glade, Animal Crossing, Slime Rancher</span></p></div></li></ul></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Of course, these are not exhaustive or exclusive. Communities can be and usually are a mixture of many people, personalities, and game genre interests. But by knowing what type of community ethos you’re aiming for, you can appropriately plan for things such as:</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="What kind of community design you want/how you will promote it.">What kind of community design you want/how you will promote it.</h2><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Types of social platforms needed/their structure.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Amount of moderation needed.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">What sorts of risks come with each community.</span></p></div></li><li></li></ul></div><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Accessibility to Creators">Accessibility to Creators</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There is a certain level of fanaticism games get, but also, a certain level of accessibility unlike other entertainment genres. When people get hyped over a movie, they can’t just join Christopher Nolan’s official Discord server to talk to the production team about Batman. They aren’t attending a game convention and hanging with the developers.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Self-Motivated Space Creation">Self-Motivated Space Creation</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game communities are incredibly organic. Even more than other industries, it is natural to create a game community of some sort, even if it’s just with your friends to get a good raid in together or form a guild. It has inherently been built into gaming culture from the get-go. With this kind of space creation for each other, we are actually frontrunners in terms of what many other industries wished their consumers did. But with this, we also tend to fall into the trap of taking these places for granted and not trying to build on them and improve them.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Conflict is Key">Conflict is Key</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Conflict or friction tends to be part of the core experience of a game! How do we work with this? Usually people would avoid this, but in games, we WANT conflict sometimes. We encourage it! Me VS you! So we need to ensure we are keeping the spirit of the game, while also encourage sportsmanship among our players.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Comfortable Conversation Starters (And Sometimes, Passionate Ones)">Comfortable Conversation Starters (And Sometimes, Passionate Ones)</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Playing games with others are especially helpful because they tend to bypass a certain awkwardness of real life conversations, and the struggle to find a common interest. After all, whether you’re new to games or not, the fact is you’re all playing and experiencing this one game. And better yet, things happen in games, and they’re often exciting, emotional, or surprising. This generates a huge opportunity for conversation starters and can even be great segues into deeper ones. Especially if you want to play with this person again, asking them or adding them as a friend online is entirely normal, and often done through a process that doesn’t feel as personal as, say, giving someone your Instagram account.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Taking these things into account, we’ll be structuring our community strategy to either encourage or manage expectations when it comes to these activities, and ultimately aim to use this to sustain the interest and longevity of our spaces.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="My Community Philosophy">My Community Philosophy</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">My main philosophy when it comes to dealing with anyone—players, coworkers, strangers—is that they want to feel seen, heard, and valued. I use these 3 points to always direct how I do community management and everything it touches, from social media strategy to writing a dev log.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As we dive specifically into game communities, here are some ideas to help drive your strategy in a positive direction:</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Interactions matter.</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> At some point, your community should not be built around your posts. It should be built in the replies—to you and to each other. Community is not a one way street.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Activity matters</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">—in all ways. While a community that talks and engages with each other is important, do not forget that lurkers and those that more passively consume content are just as important to the community. Most people do not interact in a space—that’s normal. But while we do want to encourage activity, know that some silence is normal.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Louder does not equal right.</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> While you may have more opinionated, angrier, or passionate members, remember their thoughts do not drive the direction of everything you do. They should certainly be taken into account, but part of your job is to figure out what is noise versus what is worth paying attention to.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Small moments matter. Paying attention to the details of a relationship will do wonders. If your partner hints that they love flowers, occasionally surprising them with small flowers and remembering their favorite treat will do more for you than a single grand gesture on Valentine’s Day. (Okay this isn’t a dating advice book, so I could be wrong, but also… I’m not. Shush.) Pay attention to the hints your community drops for what they appreciate. What parts of the game do they gravitate towards? Do you remember a mod’s birthday? Do you take the time to check in on folks?&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Be agile. Community moves just as fast as technology. New social platforms, new problems, new ways to connect. Ensure you’re keeping on top of the trends and don’t be resistant to change and experimentation.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A community needs kindness, resiliency, connection, and sustainability. We’ll dive more into this further on in the book, but these will ensure your community doesn’t just survive, but thrive.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As you continue reading on in this book, I hope you keep that exact philosophy in mind for your own activities! After all, this book is NOT here to tell you exactly how you should structure or run your communities. To treat communities as a generality is a disservice to their complex nature. Instead, this book aims to provide you with resources, suggestions, and ways in which you can understand how to best work with your communities no matter what size it is.&nbsp;￼&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="References">References</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Oldenburg, Ray. 1999.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Microsoft did what has become something of a habit for the company: raised the price of playing games on Xbox. This time, <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-x-s-prices-will-reportedly-go-up-again-in-us-microsoft/">instead of the consoles getting a price hike</a>, it was Xbox Game Pass this time, <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-is-rumored-to-drop-pc-game-pass-get-cheaper-ad-supported-tier/">with a 50% price jump for Game Pass and the overhauling of its three tiers</a>, which are now called Essential, Premium, and Ultimate.</p>



<p>Well, shortly after the news broke, <a href="https://x.com/_sunday_rain_/status/1973396317838684668">Pocket Tactics writer Sam Comrie</a> shared to X (formerly Twitter) that, perhaps somewhat unsurprisingly, the page to cancel your Xbox Game Pass subscription had essentially broken, likely thanks to an influx of users who decided they did not want to be paying $30/month for Game Pass Ultimate.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Users in the comments shared they were also having trouble accessing the cancel page, though for many more, the issues seem to have now been resolved, and you should have no problem cancelling your subscription.</p>



<p>Not everyone will move to cancel their subscriptions from this price hike; in fact it could be the case that many simply adjust their subscriptions from the top Ultimate tier and bump down to Premium or Essential based on their needs. </p>



<p>But this response to the latest price increases is just a sample size of what will continue to happen as playing games on Xbox gets more expensive. We know that Xbox won't be getting a return on its investments through hardware, <a href="https://wccftech.com/reports-confirm-costco-has-stopped-selling-xbox-series-consoles-in-us-uk/">especially with major retailers dropping the consoles entirely</a>.</p>



<p>It'll be interesting to see if the <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-revenue-grew-13-percent-this-quarter/">growth Microsoft previously reported for Game Pass</a> continues through its next fiscal year. Especially when considering that the company is apparently making its <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-making-largest-investment-in-game-pass-to-date-xbox-game-pass/">"<em>largest investment to date</em>" in the service</a>. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
When you review a game, if you don't know anyone else that's also reviewing it, it can be a bit difficult to guess how it might be received overall. There's normally some assumptions you can make, but with a series like Silent Hill, a series where the general consensus is all over the place from game to game, it's certainly not easy to predict. I myself ended up being quite fascinated by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a> in my <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/silent-hill-f-review">review of it</a>, but in a recent interview series producer Motoi Okamoto said that despite an overall positive reception, you shouldn't expect every consequent game to be just like it.
</p>
<p>
Speaking with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/NhEFMQmxm1g">IGN Japan</a> at TGS last month (as translated by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/future-silent-hill-games-wont-necessarily-follow-silent-hill-f-formula-producer-says-we-want-to-keep-experimenting-with-each-new-title/">Automaton</a>), Okamoto said how he expected responses to the game much more divided than they ended up being due to its "challenging" elements. This is where the but comes in. But! As he notes, "that doesn’t mean every future Silent Hill will be like Silent Hill f. Each one will have its own distinct flavor. We want to keep experimenting and be ambitious, both in terms of gameplay design and storytelling, so please look forward to the next Silent Hill as well."
</p>
<p>
The producer doubled down on this sentiment on <a href="https://x.com/obakemogura/status/1972230163380535537">Bitter</a>, the nothing app, saying he wants to be bold with the series and make it so that each subsequent game offers fresh gameplay. Though he doesn't want to abandon a key point about the series either - "I believe psychological stories are essential to what makes Silent Hill feel like ‘Silent Hill,’ and we’ll continue to place great importance on that in future works as well."
</p>
<p>
Part of the process I took with reviewing Silent Hill f was working out my own feelings on how necessary the series is now, and if there's anything it can offer any more. The answer, as it turns out, was yes, actually, so despite my curmudgeonly attitude towards it, I am curious to see where it goes next.

</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ea-saudi-bioware-ai-lgbtq-debt-junk-bond-2000630647</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ea%E2%80%99s-saudi-deal-fallout-junk-credit-ratings-risky-ai-bets-and-developer-fears.1314118/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>We’re two days out from EA’s announcement that it would <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-sale-saudi-arabia-madden-pif-jared-kushner-2000629829">sell to Saudia Arabia and private equity</a> for $55 billion, and as the dust settles, concerns continue to mount. Some inside the company are worried about possible cuts, layoffs, and censorship coming down the road, and the logistics of the deal don’t necessarily do much to reassure them. Downgraded credit ratings, rumors of ramped-up AI initiatives, and relative radio silence from the executives and investors involved isn’t helping.</p> <p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-29/s-p-says-it-expects-to-cut-electronic-arts-to-junk-status?srnd=phx-fixed-income"><em>Bloomberg</em> reported</a> that S&amp;P Global Ratings plans to lower EA’s credit rating to “junk status” once the leveraged buyout deal is completed sometime next year. It’s currently “BBB+” but would fall into the “non-investment grade” or “speculative” territory once saddled with the $20 billion loan required to pay off all of the <i>Battlefield 6 </i>publisher’s existing shareholders at a 25-percent premium. Moody’s Ratings announced it is <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-30/moody-s-says-it-s-likely-to-cut-electronic-arts-following-s-p?srnd=phx-deals">planning a similar reappraisal</a>. And the more context we get around the financing of the deal, the worse it looks.</p>

 <p>“JPMorgan made the commitment through its leveraged-finance arm, not its private credit strategy, and the biggest U.S. bank is expected to share the risk with rival firms to create a global syndicate of underwriters, according to people familiar with the deal,” <em>Bloomberg</em> reported yesterday. “The debt— expected to be rated in the single-B range—is set to be sold through high-yield bonds and leveraged loans in a cross-border, dual-currency transaction, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing confidential details.” Smells like <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3m23a2o4avs2f">high-interest-rate debt</a>.</p>

 <h2>BioWare on the chopping block</h2> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-saudi-arabia-battlefield-6-mass-effect-bioware-private-equity-2000629947">Some analysts who spoke to<em> Kotaku</em></a> have suggested that going private could free EA from the whims of a stock market based around quarterly earnings reports, but it could also be that being saddled with a ton of debt completely reshapes the decades-old gaming company as we know it. EA has an infamous reputation for buying up acclaimed studios with big creative ambitions and eventually gutting them when they fail to live up to the earnings potential of the loot-box machines fueling <em>Madden</em> and <em>EA Sports FC</em>.</p>

 <p>Respawn Entertainment recently faced multiple rounds of layoffs and saw multiple projects canceled, including a prototype for a long-awaited return to the world of <em>Titanfall</em>. BioWare has suffered even worse. Following a tumultuous development cycle for <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> due to shifting schedules and live-service goals, the RPG powerhouse is back to being a one-game studio (<em>Mass Effect</em>) and a shell of its former self. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bioware-staff-worried-about-studios-future/"><em>Insider Gaming</em> now reports</a> that EA was at one point looking to possibly sell off its $775 million acquisition from back in 2007. At least some developers there are just as worried about a future under Saudi ownership. They told<em> Insider Gaming</em> that it feels like only a matter of time before BioWare is downsized further.</p>

 <p>“For the studios that have more of a track record, especially a track record that maybe doesn’t line up with your own political views…you’re going to look at that studio and wonder how you make them fit into your new structure,” former BioWare project director Mark Darrah said <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNGc8oq9uq8&amp;t=50s">in a new YouTube video</a>. “It’s hard to imagine that you have BioWare pivot from having very progressive messaging to having the reverse because it’s what the government wants. It’s hard to imagine that the public perception of a game that comes out of BioWare, even if you do do that, isn’t apocalyptically bad.”</p>

 <h2>Pivoting away from human rights</h2> <p>In an <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/stephentotilo.bsky.social/post/3m23abrrwj22v">FAQ directed at employees</a>, one of the only pieces of communication EA has released since the deal was announced, the company claims, “There will be no immediate changes to your job, team, or daily work, as a result of this transaction.” Amid concerns about the abysmal human rights record of Saudi Arabia, where same-sex relationships are outlawed, EA has stopped short of reaffirming its long-standing commitment to inclusivity, which included asserting “<a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-trans-rights-star-wars-jedi-survive-apex-legends-res-1848998351">Trans Rights Are Human Rights</a>” as some US states pushed anti-LGBTQ+ legislation in 2022.</p>

 <p>“Andrew Wilson basically said ‘f you’ to all women and LGTBQ employees at EA with this deal,” one current EA employee <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/ea-saudi-arabia-pif-silver-lake-affinity-partners-deal">told <em>Game File</em> this week</a>. “It just shows how many people have been collateral this past year for executives to make out rich. Nothing feels great. And we know, when the deal closes, it’s going to get worse before it gets better, if better is even possible.” A separate employee, also speaking anonymously, reiterated those concerns to <em>Kotaku</em>.&nbsp;“Members of the Pride Employee Working Group are currently being very vocal about our concerns for our future,” they told me. “We’re worried LGBTQ content will be deprioritized or cut entirely and that LGBTQ and especially trans employees will be on the chopping block. Few of us feel heard right now.”</p> <p>There’s also concerns about what the new ownership arrangement will mean for EA’s ongoing push around generative AI. It was a big part of the company’s pitch <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-says-ai-is-the-very-core-of-its-business-what-does-that-mean">at its 2024 Investor Day</a>. At the time, CEO Andrew Wilson said AI was “the very core of our business” and “not merely a buzzword,” claiming there were over 100 “novel AI projects” the publisher was experimenting with to improve how it made games. These lofty promises have reemerged in light of the Saudi deal.</p> <h2>Banking on an AI revolution that may never arrive</h2> <p>Reporting on the sale earlier this week, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/be980240-13ec-498c-ba79-71eada30d133">the<em> Financial Times</em> wrote,</a> “investors are betting that AI-based cost cuts will significantly boost EA’s profits in coming years,” according to people involved in the transaction. It continued, “The deal is a huge bet that artificial intelligence can significantly cut EA’s operating costs, allowing the equity consortium to manage a large debt load on a company that historically carried limited net debt.”</p>

 <p>Some employees <em>Kotaku</em> has spoken with say EA has continued beating the drum of AI over the last 12 months, but with varying degrees of urgency. While developers are encouraged to experiment with AI tools as much as they can, none reported being forced to implement them directly into their workflows. At the same time, AI is being incorporated into customer service management, something the company behind microtransaction-fueled sports franchises does a lot of. Where some players might have been routed to humans for help with things like Terms of Service violation reviews in the past, their complaints may no be routed first to AI agents instead.</p> <p>The Saudi deal is the second-biggest gaming merger ever. The first, Microsoft’s purchase of Activision Blizzard, faced a surprising and prolonged level of scrutiny among regulators in the U.S. and abroad, including an entire lawsuit by the Federal Trade Commission. That was under the Biden Administration, however, which made anti-trust enforcement a priority for the federal government. Under the pay-to-play and pay-to-win mechanics of the current Trump Administration, EA’s sale to private equity and a foreign government isn’t expected to hit so many roadblocks, especially with the president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, as one of the buyers.</p> <p>“Kushner has a personal relationship and he has deep ties in Saudi Arabia. He is very comfortable operating in the Middle East. It created a basis of trust,” one source <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/61cef75e-ceba-43ee-80e3-040756c6154f">told the <em>Financial Times</em></a>.&nbsp;“We are in a regulatory environment that is welcoming of [Saudi Arabia]. We are not in what was the previous regime,” said another. And according to a third: “What regulator is going to say no to the president’s son-in-law?”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"We're like, we should have thought of that."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Capcom's upcoming new IP, Pragmata, features a main antagonist that's really a rogue AI on the moon making the life of a spaceman and his android buddy difficult. But as much as artificial intelligence is in the news lately, especially in gaming, the developers of Pragmata say they had absolutely no idea it would be such a hot topic when they started developing the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking to me at Tokyo Game Show 2025, game director Cho Yonghee and producer Naoto Oyama tell me that the concept for Pragmata simply came from Yonghee thinking about the moon, and asking the team to brainstorm ideas for a game set on the moon. From there, developers pitched a "black and white world" on the moon, and the concept of the enemy being AI came later.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But none of the team, they said, knew they were about to release a game about an enemy AI at a time when real-life AI was such a fraught subject.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"We really couldn't predict that AI would be this big from where we started from what you see now, but now that we have AI become this huge thing in the real world, we see like, 'Oh, maybe we should have added this or that from what you see in the AI right now,'" Yonghee tells me. "So we are like, 'We should have thought of that.'" </p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, the pair confirm that the real-world shifts around AI didn't impact the game's story or direction. By the time it became a hot topic, the direction was already set.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We have this sort of the idea of the AI in the game locked down very early in the development back when we released the concept trailer back a few years ago," Oyama says. "And so we had that as what you see in the game basically. And then we really couldn't predict that the AI would become this big right now."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Yeah," Yonghee adds. "So the real life AI's progression or development, it's been so fast that it's perhaps overtaken what do we have in the game right now. So what you see in the game might not look as amazing than what'd you compared to real life."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I laughed a bit at this and remarked that I didn't think we had Dianas running around in the real world just yet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We created to be in the near future, but the future has come closer," Oyama replies.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Yeah, just the word AI is getting a bit old right now," Yonghee says. "So maybe by the time that we reach the age or the time where Pragmata takes place, people are not using the word AI even anymore."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We recently got another look at Pragmata at <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/capcom-online-program-tgs-2025-everything-announced">Capcom's Online Program alongside TGS</a>, and we had a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pragmata-aims-to-break-the-rules-of-third-person-shooters-gamescom-2025">hands-on preview of the game at Gamescom earlier this year</a>. We also spoke with Oyama and Yonghee about early ideas for Pragmata, including the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pragmatas-early-concepts-for-diana-included-a-robot-animals-and-even-a-talking-dog">possibility that it might feature a talking dog</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">In the intro cinematic for World of Warcraft: Midnight, Lady Liadrin of the blood elves was joined by a conspicuously anonymous group of reinforcements to defend the Sunwell against this and last expansion's big bad, Xal'atath. And it turns out there's a reason for their ambiguous appearance: it's us, the players. The first moments of the next chapter of the Worldsoul Saga, which I've played through a big chunk of on an alpha build, had me emerging at that precise moment to put a stop to this shadowy invasion. And the revamped elven kingdom of Quel'Thalas beyond was worth the abrupt summoning.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">The Clock Strikes</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">If you aren't caught up on the events of The War Within, Midnight is something WoW has never really tried before: a direct follow-up to a previous expansion, and the midpoint of a planned trilogy that tells a single, overarching story. And at the end of The War Within, the manipulative Xal'atath used us to knock out a godlike being called a Void Lord and slurped it up to power her favorite plot bauble, which has enabled her to launch a full-scale void invasion of Azeroth. To bring about her plans, she has to snuff out the Light itself, hence starting her invasion at the logical place, the Sunwell.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The design of the new void creatures is diverse and evocative, especially with the more powerful lieutenants, and they help sell the stakes of the invasion well. I won't spoil exactly how this intro section ends, but Blizzard has once again done a great job using the skybox to tell a story.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The Eversong Woods one is one of my favorite zones since The Burning Crusade, and I was thrilled to come back and see it bigger, healed, and thriving.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I got a bit of a welcome breather once the immediate disaster was under control, though, as I was quickly shepherded into the new expansion hub of Silvermoon City. This was an awe-inspiring homecoming as someone who has followed the story of this elven kingdom since Warcraft 2 and would call myself kind of a Thalassaboo. The reimagined version is so much larger, richer, and more dense than the one that's been around since 2007. Quel'Thalas, and the adjoining troll kingdom of Zul'Aman, are also now fully, seamlessly connected to the Eastern Kingdoms, finally letting us fly across the entire continent without entering a different instance.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Where once the Dead Scar left by Arthas tore the city in half is now the Path of Dawn, a highway stretching all the way across the zone and through the capital. Only small remnants remain of the undead corruption and mana addiction that once plagued these lands. What were once the gloomy Ghostlands are now folded into the larger Eversong Woods zone, with the eternal light having returned to all but the furthest corners. It's been one of my favorite zones since The Burning Crusade, and I was thrilled to come back and see it bigger, healed, and thriving.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Summit of the World</h3><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In the city itself, most of the real estate is now a faction-neutral expansion hub with all of the vendors and services you'd expect. The Bazaar has been extended across the Path of Dawn to form a new city center, anchored by our command HQ in the war against Xal'atath – the imposing Sanctum of Light. What was once the Ruins of Silvermoon sub-area on the western side has been completely rebuilt with two lovely districts: Falconwing Square, new home of the Farstriders, and Thalassian University, a gleaming college of magic that's also the setting of one of the new delves. Murder Row, representing Silvermoon's shady back alleys, is also tweaked and now part of the faction neutral area.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Around a quarter of the city is still a Horde-only zone, taking up the remixed Path of the Elders, Royal Exchange, and Court of the Sun areas from old school Silvermoon. The old Farstrider Square has sort of been folded into the latter two, with the Exchange leading right up into the Court of the Sun, but there is also a new subdistrict on the Southeastern side called the Court of Blood, where all of the Blood Knight stuff has been relocated. The Sunfury Spire, center of the kingdom's government, is now a floating tower above the city that is also restricted to Horde only.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Alliance players who enter these areas will get a 10-second grace period before all the guards become hostile like any other faction capital, but this aggro can be cleared instantly by re-entering a sanctuary area. Overall, I'm pretty satisfied with the balance of cross-faction to faction-specific areas, even if it feels like maybe we should be ready to bury the hatchet at this point. The tensions between the visiting Alliance and their Horde hosts play out in the opening hours of the story, which makes for an interesting political drama.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Blinded By the Light</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The first conundrum we're sent to solve in Quel'Thalas is an odd and unexpected one, having just come from beating up a bunch of void baddies. It seems that the reignition of the Sunwell has also caused areas called Lightblooms to pop up, which have become overgrown with life and brightness. In fact, the entire zone looks a bit washed out, with an altered color balance that makes it feel like someone has turned a floodlight up too high. The ongoing story of WoW has long hinted that Light can be just as dangerous as Void if you have too much of it, and it seems like we might be dealing with both this expansion.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">World of Warcraft: Midnight Cinematic Images and First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This issue becomes even more dire in the first of Midnight's delves, Collegiate Calamity, which takes us inside Thalassian University where the Lightbloom has gotten out of control. Compared to The War Within's delves, it felt quite short, but I was playing it on a fairly low difficulty. On the other hand, it feels much more like a connected area, similar to a lot of WoW's best dungeons, as opposed to several War Within delves that were caves with no real sense of place. You can see the rest of Silvermoon in all its glory from the upper terrace, which really helps situate it as part of the world and the story.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Replacing the cheerful Brann Bronzebeard as your delve companion is the ruthless Valeera Sanguinar, a blood elf assassin who still dresses like every female video game character did in 2007. She's pulling it off, though. I like the new cape. I've only found a couple of her curios so far, so it's hard to say how she fights, but the tone is very different when you're running with a femme fatale edgelord instead of a happy-go-lucky explorer. The change of pace is kind of nice. I don't know if we'll be BFFs, but stranger things have happened.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">In Shadow I Serve</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">We haven't been able to play the new Haranir allied race yet, and Midnight isn't adding any new classes. But it does include a whole new spec for the Demon Hunter, the Devourer, using the Void to fuel its powers rather than demonic energies. Thematically, it's a very cool idea with a lot of grim reaper vibes and a rotation that encourages getting into melee for a bit, then getting some distance, and repeating that dance. If you've played a Red Mage in Final Fantasy XIV, it's kind of similar. The best part about Demon Hunters has always been how much their fighting style relies on movement, and that's still true here.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The biggest feature coming in Midnight is definitely player housing, and I was thrilled to discover how powerful the tools for customizing my own little abode in Azeroth are.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">As for my trusty Marksmanship Hunter, it's hard to compare apples to apples when this is still an alpha and my character on the test server is hilariously undergeared compared to my retail main, but it doesn't feel vastly different, at least in single target. I did my best to recreate my talent build as close as possible to how it is on the live version, and the biggest thing I noticed was that cast time reduction for Aimed Shot is much harder to come by, which slows down the tempo of my rotation quite a bit. The Sentinel hero talents have also seen a significant rework, as have our main multitarget damage-dealing abilities. We'll put a pin, or an arrow, in that.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Homecoming</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The biggest feature coming in Midnight is definitely player housing, and I was thrilled to discover how powerful the tools for customizing my own little abode in Azeroth are – from the floor plan, to the decor, to the walls and flooring. It seemed like adding multiple levels was a little bit buggy in this build, so I didn't get to mess with that much. But everything else works great.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Horde neighborhood of Razorwind Shores is triumphant, with everything from a blooming desert to rocky bluffs to tropical islands to a rugged pine forest. I do think the Alliance might be getting the short end of the stick here, though. Their neighborhood of Founder's Point seems really one-note in comparison. It's mostly just a sweeping, green fairy tale forest with a couple areas featuring different kinds of trees, one being mildly spooky.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's still a lot of the Midnight alpha for me to see. Try as I might, they wouldn't even let me into the mysterious realm of Zul'Aman! But having played it basically every waking hour since I got access, which was about 10 hours ago as I write this, I am certainly impressed with the new zones and the customization housing allows, and I'm excited to see where the story of the Worldsoul Saga goes next. World of Warcraft: Midnight is due out some time next year, but housing will be rolling out to anyone who owns the expansion in December.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/world-of-warcraft-midnight-the-first-hands-on-preview]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Welcome home, champion.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Over a year after its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/world-of-warcrafts-next-expansion-finally-adding-player-housing-after-years-of-requests-by-fans">announcement</a>, World of Warcraft's long-awaited housing feature is finally hitting prime time, and we now have a date. Early access for housing will start for players who pre-purchase the new expansion, Midnight, on December 2, 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This news comes directly from Blizzard, who shared it with us alongside <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/world-of-warcraft-midnight-the-first-hands-on-preview">an early alpha preview</a> of the game. During this preview, we actually got to mess around with the new housing system a bit: we explored some of the neighborhoods available to build houses in, moved some chairs and tables around, and dyed a couple of tablecloths.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Though we haven't yet had enough time to fully explore the promised wide range of options available, we can confirm there's already a lot one can do to customize the housing space even fresh out of the housing tutorial. And while we didn't get to experiment with some of the more advanced features, in a presentation shown off by Blizzard yesterday, we got a look at how players can add rooms of all sorts of different shapes, tweak item placement at a very granular level, and even decorate the outsides of houses with fancy chimneys and towers, elaborate gardens, and exterior styles themed around humans, orcs, blood elves, or night elves. If we'd had access to the full array of available decor from the get-go, we probably never would have left our house in the alpha.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To start with, players can pick a spot for their house in one of a number of different themed spaces within their neighborhood. For Alliance players, that includes spaces such as a farm, an autumnal forest, a coastal plain, and right next to the local graveyard. For Horde players, options include areas themed after the red rocks of Durotar, the plains of Mulgore, an oasis, and more. Some houses are clustered close to others, while others are spread apart. And you can either join a public neighborhood with strangers, or a private one with members of your guild or in-game community. And all of this is cross-faction, though you do ultimately have to pick either the Alliance- or Horde-themed neighborhood and get locked into one style of architecture or the other. Each player can have two houses per Warband: one in an Alliance neighborhood, and one Horde.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">World of Warcraft: Midnight Cinematic Images and First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">All of that is currently able to be explored by players with access to the game's alpha, so expect to see streamers, content creators, and us sharing more about housing in the coming weeks. But anyone who has pre-purchased World of Warcraft: Midnight will get access to this feature themselves on December 2, 2025, ahead of the actual expansion launch. We don't have a final release date for Midnight just yet, though it's expected in early 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more on Midnight, check out our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/world-of-warcraft-midnight-the-first-hands-on-preview">initial alpha preview impressions right here</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Marvel Rivals' next update, Season 4.5, launches next week on October 10, 2025, adding Daredevil to the roster as a new duelist. Beyond a new character, next week's update will add the beginnings of a highly requested feature: cross-platform progression support. The catch, unfortunately, is that it'll only be live for players invited to try it out, while everyone else will have to wait for cross-progression support to be available to all players with Season 5's launch.</p>



<p>As is routine with every major Marvel Rivals season update, developer NetEase has debuted two new videos. The first is a gameplay trailer showing off Daredevil gameplay and each of his skill and abilities in action. </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Daredevil: The Man Without Fear | Character Reveal | Marvel Rivals" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iV8lE08wGoE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The second is a Dev Vision video featuring the game's creative director, Guangguang, going over the key changes in the coming season, including being able to customize the background of your home screen, and how cross-platform progression will work once it's live for all users.</p>



<p>You'll be able to access a main character across PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms, though your statistics and rankings will be separate for each platform. </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Marvel Rivals: Season 4.5 Update! // Dev Vision Vol. 10" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RIrLxa_TgKU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Guangguang also teased that a new mode is going to be added to the game, with details set to premiere on October 17, and that the team is preparing a Halloween event with new cosmetics for various characters on the Marvel Rivals roster.</p>



<p>Marvel Rivals' fourth season has seen some major changes, including <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-ps4-release-date-season-4/">the addition of a PlayStation 4 version of the game</a> and the introduction of cross-platform progression. However, a bigger, and likely more controversial change is still to come, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/loot-boxes-might-be-coming-to-marvel-rivals/">rumours still loom that loot boxes will be added to the game</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Wizard Community College Kickstarter Brings Accessible Magic Hijinx]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/wizard-community-college-kickstarter-brings-accessible-magic-hijinx</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/wizard-community-college-kickstarter-brings-accessible-magic-hijinx.1314076/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new beginner-friendly role-playing game has gone live on Kickstarter. David Marron's first major campaign on the platform is <em>Wizard Community College</em>, an RPG that revolves around learning magic at a magic school. The twist is that magic can easily get out of control if you're not careful.</p>



<p>According to the campaign page, <em>Wizard Community College</em> is a role-playing card game designed for 3-8 players. Each game is meant to last about twenty minutes. As the name implies, the players are newly inducted student wizards, solving problems with spells that go horribly wrong. The promo material is light-hearted and comedic, invoking works like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/strixhaven-curriculum-of-chaos-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Strixhaven</em></a>&nbsp;and the TV show,&nbsp;<em>Community</em>.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wizard-community-college-game-pieces.jpg?itok=0fsvoz-e 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wizard-community-college-game-pieces.jpg?itok=mfX_qnqO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The game is promoted as a great gateway to role-playing games. The rules can easily be taught in about two minutes. The game is GM-less, allowing all players to contribute to the fiction. Lastly, it is designed to contain the best elements of a one-shot adventure. If you have been looking for a way to bring players into the hobby that isn't <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> or Monster of the Week, this may be the answer.</p>

<p>Setting up a game of <em>Wizard Community College</em> is simple. The scene is established by drawing an Event Card. This will give players objectives to complete. From there, players take turns in clockwise order, casting spells to solve the problem. Those spells are represented by spell cards.</p>

<p>Whenever a spell is cast, a disk is drawn at random from a bag. The symbol of the disk determines how the spell acts up. The color determines which player gets to explain how the spell messes up. The next player then reacts to the complication. This repeats until the main objectives are completed.</p>

<p>There is only pledge tier <em>Wizard Community College</em>: a physical copy of the game at an MSRP of $20 not including shipping. No add-ons or stretch goals are planned. This was an intentional choice by Marron to keep the project affordable and straightforward. A copy of the game contains the following:</p>

<ul><li>45 Spell Cards</li>
	<li>27 Magic Item Cards</li>
	<li>36 Major Event Cards</li>
	<li>18 Minor Event Cards</li>
	<li>8 Double-Sided Character Cards</li>
	<li>9 Player Aid Cards</li>
	<li>32 Colored Wooden Disks</li>
	<li>1 Drawstring Bag</li>
</ul><p>At the time of writing, Wizard Community College has raised&nbsp;<span><span>$3,380, which is just shy of its funding goal of $4,000. The campaign ends on October 31.</span></span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/marvel-cosmic-invasion-steam-demo-pc-console-2025-coolest-looking-game-2000630663</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/one-of-2025%E2%80%99s-coolest-looking-games-now-has-a-demo.1314070/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-cosmic-invasion-preview-beat-em-up-tribute-games-1851784757"><em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em></a> may not have a release date yet, but it does have a demo. The coolest-looking Marvel game in years, and a game many of us at <em>Kotaku</em> are excited to play later this year, now has a small demo up on Steam letting you play the superhero brawler alone or with a few pals.</p> <p>On October 1, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4013980/MARVEL_Cosmic_Invasion_Demo/">Tribute Games and publisher Dotemu announced and released a free, playable demo</a> for the upcoming <em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em>. The demo contains two full levels with boss fights, supports both local and online co-op, and features nine playable characters: Rocket Raccoon, Nova, Phyla-Vell, She-Hulk, Venom, Spider-Man, Wolverine, Storm, and Captain America. Here’s a new trailer for the demo:</p>

  <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-cosmic-invasion-brawler-dotemu-tmnt-co-op-switch-1851772740">Announced earlier this year</a> during a Nintendo Direct,&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/games/marvel-cosmic-invasion"><em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em></a> is a side-scrolling 2D retro-inspired beat ’em up being developed by the same studio behind the extremely tubular and awesome <em>TMNT: Shredder’s Revenge</em>, which was also a 2D co-op brawler.&nbsp;<em>Cosmic Invasion,</em> like Tribute’s past games, is a snappy and action-packed retro throwback. I played the new demo on Steam for a few minutes and immediately had a blast smashing baddies as She-Hulk and Spider-Man. <a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-cosmic-invasion-hands-on-preview-mvc-impressions-2000614681">Swapping between the two, which is this game’s big gimmick</a>, was great as it let me switch between Spider-Man’s fast and agile action during some segments and She-Hulk’s heavy hits during fights with tougher foes. I did encounter some performance dips, which wasn’t ideal, but hopefully those issues get ironed out when the game launches…eventually.</p>

 <p>While there are nine characters in the demo, that’s not the game’s full line-up. <em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em> is set to include a large roster of 15 characters. <a href="https://kotaku.com/two-new-heroes-marvel-cosmic-invasion-full-roster-black-panther-ghost-rider-2000626521">We know 12 of the 15 characters</a> that will be playable at launch. Three more have yet to be revealed.</p>

 <p>Now the bad news for console players: The new <em>Cosmic Invasion</em> demo isn’t available on Xbox, PlayStation, or Switch. This has understandably disappointed many players online, with some jumping into the comments of the trailer above to share their frustration.</p> <p>Regardless, we shouldn’t have to wait long, as <em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em> is set to arrive in 2025. Exactly when hasn’t been announced yet, but there’s not much time left in the year so if it’s not getting delayed, the game is likely weeks away from launching on PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Switch 2, Switch, and PC.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-card-tcg-vendor-scalper-reseller-stream-shows-2000630658</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Although I’ve sought out a handful of cards featuring my favorite monsters and characters, I generally only pay casual attention to the </span><i><span>Pokémon Trading Card Game</span></i><span>.&nbsp; I grew up with a giant cardboard box of old cards under my bed, but as an adult, I can’t imagine putting in half the time or money I did into it as a kid. It just seems like it would be too much hassle, and that’s not to mention everything that happens around the game. When I do hear stories about the TCG, they’re usually </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scalper-reseller-trading-card-van-gogh-pikachu-1850925900"><span>stories of controversy</span></a><span>. Images of people nearly destroying the Van Gogh Museum in order to get exclusive cards and merchandise to sell online, as well as grown-ass men fighting and camping out for cards outside of GameStops, are seared into my brain. This toxic, predatory side of </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>collecting </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-plush-scalper-reseller-world-championships-2000618087"><span>has pushed a lot of people out of the space</span></a><span>, as memories of excitement at finding your favorite card have been replaced by stories of scams and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/card-shop-pokemon-robbed-100k-hammer-rare-cards-thief-1851786241"><span>robberies</span></a><span>. That was how it was for me until fairly recently, when I saw a video from </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>vendor @beard_dad_cardz having an extremely sweet interaction with a girl named Sophia at a card show.</span></p>   <p><span>As a fan of his streams, Sophia is excited to be at beard_dad_cardz’s booth, and his viewers are so excited about her excitement that they donate so she can get a card she likes. She says she’s a fan of Umbreon and Espeon, and after she finds a card of the dark-type Eeveelution she likes, beard_dad_cardz gives it to her for free. The moment went viral on multiple social media apps and has accumulated over 17.8 million views on TikTok alone.</span></p>

 <p><span>A lot of </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>card vendors have taken up content creation as an extension of their business, and that means several of them livestream from card shows and capture moments like this regularly. You wouldn’t know it from the news, but there’s a lot of kindness, charity, and community in </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>cards that often gets drowned out by the worst bad actors. And as the stigma around the space has grown, creators and vendors like Chris Daywalt, the owner of HLD Cards and Collectibles, are trying to combat these notions by putting these moments of kindness on the internet, where people can see them.</span></p>

 <p><span>“The rise of videos where you’re seeing people scalping Costco for cards or doing things like that, that’s going to happen any time you really shine a spotlight on something, especially something as big as </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>,” Daywalt told </span><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span>. “When people start hearing money around it, those people are going to come out of the woodwork. They did the same thing to sneakers and to Supreme clothes, video cards, and PSIs, anything else that they feel like they can make a quick dollar on, but I think what makes </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>different is the 30 years of community that’s been built around it.”</span></p>

    <p><span>Daywalt started HLD as a way to connect with his son Henry, whom the shop and channel are named after. Henry returned from a summer camp trip with his first set of </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>cards, which led to the father and son bonding over their collections. Daywalt says this ignited a passion in his son to start collecting and gave them a common interest, as Daywalt has been a lifelong TCG player, and grew up playing and trading with others.</span></p>

 <p><span>“I always used to say ‘I play </span><i><span>Magic</span></i><span> for the gathering,’ and so I really knew the community part of it before I knew the reselling part of it,” Daywalt said.</span></p> <p><span>What started as an opportunity for Daywalt to pass on his values around taking care of something and finding community quickly became a family business after his brother started making content out of their card show appearances, and his wife started handling other aspects of the business. Daywalt says he’s comfortable sharing this with his son because in his experience, the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>community sticks to the messages of kindness the franchise touts. There are still some bad actors that try to take advantage of others, though, which is why Daywalt </span><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@hldcardsandcollectibles/video/7545145575449152799?lang=en"><span>doesn’t do “trade-ups,</span></a><span>” or card exchanges in which the card the event attendee receives is of greater value than the one they part with, with adults, but will do them with kids.</span></p>

   <p><span>Promoting those good moments is why a lot of vendors are branching out into content creation. Sure, it’s another extension of the business and also works as viral marketing, but the narrative of bad actors dominating the space has become so prevalent that long-time fans feel protective of </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>and the space they’ve cultivated, and want to push back. Aaron Lee, one of the co-founders of Duckbird, grew up watching the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>anime and has memories of waiting for new episodes to premiere on WBTV back in the day. As such, he’s been in the space long enough to have encountered people engaged in shady practices at card shows time and time again. However, he says a lot of these are less common at in-person events than one might think, and he especially experiences them less in his small North Carolina town.</span></p>

 <p><span>“You’ll see people who you can tell are, like, obviously there to make a quick buck,” Lee told </span><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span>. “There will be even kids and adults who are obviously there trying to make money essentially; taking advantage of vendors and whatnot, and have their kids try to do a trade-up challenge to get them a better card. That’s a big one that I’ve seen a lot, and that has come from a lot of influencers or YouTube content creators being able to do that. But if it’s, you know, someone who knows what they’re doing and[is] just trying to take advantage of people, that’s something that’s not so fun.”</span></p>   <p><span>For Lee and his partner, “Duck,” trying to make people feel welcome at card shows is important. Lee says that the pair tries to give free stuff to kids who show up, especially if they seem to be in the early days of their own collection journey.</span></p> <p><span>“We kind of do like a rock-paper-scissors game, but we use Poké Balls with different types [of Pokémon], and we give them free packs if they win,” Lee says. “Even if they lose, we still give them free packs. We’ll do coin flips with kids for free, and then even if they lose, we’ll keep flipping until they win. So it’s stuff like that to just make sure that anybody who we feel like is new to the hobby or is genuinely passionate about collecting is able to have a positive experience when they go to a show or if they stop by our stream. Anything to just let them know,&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>‘Hey, there are still people out there who really enjoy the space and just want to grow the community in the right direction.’”</span></p> <div> <p>Welcome to Exp. Share, <em>Kotaku</em> ’s <em>Pokémon</em> column in which we dive deep to explore notable characters, urban legends, communities, and just plain weird quirks from throughout the <em>Pokémon</em> franchise.</p></div> <p><span>Stories of vendors going out of their way to help kids get cards they’re looking for are pretty common at these events. Which is why, despite all the talk of big money in </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>these days, a lot of the biggest transactions are completely free.</span></p> <p><span>“I had people who were trying to find a card for a kid who’s looking for, like, a specific Pikachu card,” Lee said. “They’ll tell their buddies and their buddies will tell their buddies, and then the whole show will be searching for a card and bringing it to the kid. Half the time, they give it to the kid for free. It really just depends on where you are and who you talk with, but I would say like 80 to 90 percent of vendors that you see in real life are kind. They go out of their way to help the kid out or help somebody out when they’re looking for something specific. I see a lot of kindness with vendors when, sometimes, you might be trying to trade a card in that might not necessarily move as well. A lot of times, vendors will match the card 100 percent and just give the kid what they want, just to help the kid out. That’s where it starts, when you’re a kid and you don’t really wanna look at this in a monetary way. You just want to collect cards. You can really tell if a kid is just trying to collect cards, you know, versus trying to make some money. And that’s what I like to see.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Even with all these positive stories, piercing through all the constant reports of crimes and the viral moments showing scalpers acting a fool at major events can feel impossible. When I asked Daywalt what advice he’d give to someone trying to enter the space, he said the average collector and vendor is not going to be making thousands of dollars off these cards, and if you go into the hobby expecting that, you’re likely going to be disappointed.</span></p> <p><span>“If it’s about the money, go trade stocks or work in finance,” Daywalt says. “What I always say to people is that the reason I don’t necessarily worry if the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>market crashes tomorrow is because I’ll look at it as an opportunity to go get all the cards I wanted. They have a value to me outside of what a TCG player says the market value is. Don’t put that pressure on something, you know, buy it because you like it and it’s something that brings you joy intrinsically, not extrinsically, because it could make you some money.”</span></p>   <p><span>Lee echoed the sentiment and said that some of the best cards are ones you won’t find selling for three or more figures, and if you aren’t interested in the art or community, there are easier ways to make money.</span></p>

 <p><span>“We get tons of people coming up asking for particular Pokémon because they want to collect all of that Pokémon,” Lee says. “Then if it’s a less popular Pokémon like Dunsparce, then, you know, the cards aren’t gonna be as expensive, and it makes for a really fun time.”</span></p> <p><span>Daywalt says that even after the time he’s put into buying, selling, and collecting, HLD isn’t paying his family’s bills, and that every dollar they make at these shows is going back into the business. While he admits he does get invested in predicting the market, he encourages people who are hoping to find the golden ticket in a Target booster pack to interrogate whether they’re in it for the right reasons.</span></p> <p><span>“There’s a lot of knowledge and a lot of really sharp people that are already in the space, and you’re not going to catch up to them tomorrow,” Daywalt says. “I don’t care how many YouTube videos you watch or how many articles you read about it. If you want to get into this space, do it because it brings you joy. Do what you like, and make the money a secondary part of it if it’s important to you.”</span></p>   <p><span>After talking to vendors and seeing these kinds of wholesome interactions online, I still don’t know that </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>card collecting is for me. I have a collection of <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-raichu-evolution-x-y-paid-dlc-2000625371">Raichu</a> and Professor Turo cards on my shelf, and I think that’s probably enough. But after seeing the uptick in </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>card scams and content mills over the past few years, it was disheartening for a while to know a series that had brought me so much joy had become a symbol of predatory greed. At the very least, it’s comforting to know that some people are keeping the childlike wonder alive, and that they’re posting reminders of it online.</span></p>
