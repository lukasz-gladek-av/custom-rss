            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony and Arrowhead Game Studios have revealed Into the Unjust, the next major&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>update, and it's time for you and your squad to take the fight to the mysterious Terminid Hive Worlds.</p>

<p>As revealed in a PlayStation Blog <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/26/helldivers-2-into-the-unjust-launches-september-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>, Into the Unjust arrives on September 2nd, and its big new addition is the aforementioned Hive Worlds, where you'll find new Terminid dangers both above ground and beneath it.</p>

<p>When Into the Unjust lands, you'll be delving underground as part of its new missions, and while you're down there, you'll encounter new Terminid enemies. You'll also be unable to call in your Super Destroyer for support, so it's just you and your team against whatever horrors lurk in the tunnels.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/helldivers-2-into-the-unjust-dragonroach.jpg?itok=3qM2rmN3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/helldivers-2-into-the-unjust-dragonroach.jpg?itok=58pzFwQz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>will introduce new enemies and more in its Into the Unjust update.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Arrowhead, the update's new Terminid enemies will "burrow underground" and begin moving towards you when they detect you. Once they're close enough, they'll emerge from the ground and launch a surprise attack.</p>

<p>You'll also be able to encounter new enemies like the Dragonroach, a flying enemy that zeroes in on you and spits bile at you once it spots you. As if&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em>'s existing flying enemies weren't already annoying enough to deal with.</p>

<p>New mission types will be added as part of Into the Unjust, too; one has you escorting a mobile oil rig and defending it from Terminid attacks, for instance, while delving underground will see you tasked with destroying the Hive Lung to stop the ever-encroaching Gloom.</p>

<p>You can check out a developer deep dive on the Into the Unjust update right here. It should give you a bit more info on what you're up against.</p>




<p>Following the release of&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em>'s <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-halo-3-odst-warbond" rel="nofollow">first Legendary Warbond</a>&nbsp;(which also happens to be a <em>Halo 3: ODST </em>crossover) today, a new Dust Devils Premium Warbond has also been announced.</p>

<p>It comes complete with new weapons, including the AR-2 Coyote assault rifle, the S-11 Speargun, and the MS-11 Solo Silo stratagem, as well as new armor, new capes, and plenty more. It's launching just two days after Into the Unjust on September 4th.</p>

<p><em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/553850/HELLDIVERS_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/helldivers-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/helldivers-2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-lenovo-laptop-12gb-ram-512gb-ssd-office-365-is-85-off-amazon-clears-inventory-for-summers-end-2000620309</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-lenovo-laptop-12gb-ram-512gb-ssd-office-365-is-85-off-amazon-clears-inventory-for-summer%E2%80%99s-end.1280595/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>With Amazon’s <em>Back to School</em> discounts currently in full swing, there’s one notebook that looks almost too good to be true: the <strong>2025</strong> <strong>Lenovo IdeaPad 15.6″</strong> with a solid mid-range spec (12GB RAM, 512GB SSD, Intel Celeron N4500, Office 365 for one year, Windows 11 Home) for a record low price. Amazon is likely clearing out old inventory, likely without making a single penny in profit, and that makes you the beneficiary of a deal that’s too great to pass up.</p>
<p>This <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3723/">computer usually costs around $2,400 but today Amazon reduced its price to as low as $349</a>: That’s an 85% discount, and<strong> you’ll be saving around two thousand dollars on a brand-new computer</strong>. You’re spending less than most individuals spend on a smartphone at this price point, but you’re receiving a full Windows computer bundled with a one-year subscription of Microsoft Office 365.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3723/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Great Student Laptop</h2>
<p>Specs do matter, even in a budget-friendly machine, and this Lenovo is far from stripped down: It’s <strong>powered by an Intel Celeron N4500 processor.</strong> Although it’s not for serious gaming, it’s perfectly suited to day-to-day productivity tasks such as word processing, spreadsheets and streaming television shows. The inclusion of 12GB of DDR4 RAM is a difference-maker: multitasking is so much more responsive than the 4GB or 8GB of memory you typically find in this price category.</p>
<p>A fast <strong>512GB PCIe SSD</strong> gives you speed and space which means Windows boots in a flash, programs load in a flash and still having space for a large collection of school work, work documents, or entertainment media. In addition to the SSD, there’s also a <strong>secondary 128GB eMMC</strong> that gives you additional space to work with light files or backups.</p>



<p>The 15.6-inch HD display features anti-glare coating so your eyes don’t get as tired during extended study sessions. Paired with Dolby Audio dual speakers, you’ll enjoy more immersion when streaming or Zoom calls. You even receive a built-in HD 720p camera with a privacy shutter which is surprisingly rare on laptops in this price range.</p>
<p>Connectivity is also a plus point: <strong>USB-C, USB-A, HDMI, an SD card reader, and an audio combo jack</strong> are all present and give you all the ports you’ll need to have accessories and external storage easily attached. <strong>Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.2</strong> are integrated within so wireless speed and dependability are on tap for both online classes and easy Netflix streaming.</p>
<p>Discounts this intense rarely stick, and since Amazon is clearly liquidating excess stock, make sure you don’t miss it.</p>

Yes, after years of speculation, Silksong has finally been confirmed to launch on the Switch and Switch 2 on <strong>4th September 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>Its mere presence is causing other developers and publishers to run scared, with games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/demonschool">Demonschool</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2710920/Aeterna_Lucis/">Aeterna Lucis</a>, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3314790/CloverPit/">CloverPit</a> all shifting their release dates to avoid Team Cherry's upcoming behemoth. Demonschool itself had experienced numerous delays during its development, so to see it <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/demonschool-gets-last-minute-delay-to-avoid-silksong">pushed back yet again</a> will no doubt come as a disappointment to prospective players.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067lzsvwj&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>One developer, however, has pledged to stand firm in the face of Silksong, and that's Sword &amp; Axe. Its upcoming sequel, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/dark_deity_2">Dark Deity 2</a>, is due to launch on the exact same day as Silksong, but in a recent post on X, the developer states that while the Silksong news was "not as fun for me as I had hoped", there are no plans to delay Dark Deity 2.</p>

<p>And y'know what, fair play. It's a risky move, but fan feedback from the post indicates that many have either already pre-ordered the game or will simply purchase it alongside Silksong on the 4th.</p>
<p>The first <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/dark_deity">Dark Deity</a> wound up being a pretty solid homage to <strong>Fire Emblem</strong>, earning a respectable 7/10 in our review back in 2022. We said that "the central loop of battling, chatting and levelling up is as compelling as you could ever want it to be, with an interesting story told well and a meaty 20 hours or so of no-frills tactics".</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/the-bose-tv-soundbar-is-40-off-at-a-new-record-low-amazon-goes-nuts-for-labor-day-2000620323</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-bose-tv-soundbar-is-40-off-at-a-new-record-low-amazon-goes-nuts-for-labor-day.1280550/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Soundbars are one of those products that tend to feel too expensive. Most models easily surpass the $500 threshold and even then the sound doesn’t always quite live up to expectations. That’s why Bose has built a lot of trust in this space: the company is able to get people affordable gear with an emphasis on immersive audio.</p>
<p>Right now, their popular Bose TV Speaker is available on Amazon at a price that’s actually a record-breaking one: The current <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3727/">deal is bringing this model down from $279 to about $163 which is a 41% discount</a> and the cheapest it has ever been according to <em>CamelCamelCamel</em>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3727/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Soundbar and TV Speaker</h2>
<p>At slightly over 23 inches wide and just over 2 inches tall, this Bose soundbar is a compact addition that can sit in front of your TV without blocking the screen,or be mounted on a wall if you prefer a streamlined setup. Inside its compact body, it houses two angled full-range drivers that create a wider and more enveloping soundstage than the usual built-in TV speakers can offer.</p>
<p>If you’ve ever struggled to hear mumbling actors or drowned-out lines during action scenes, this speaker directly addresses that with specialized tuning. With the remote supplied, you can go even further and allow dialogue mode, cutting through words spoken even more sharply without boosting everything else. You also get a bass boost button thrown in for a little more low-end oomph when you need it.</p>



<p>Connectivity is simple, you’ll love it: You can pair it with your TV using an optical cable (included in the box) or an HDMI-ARC connection if your TV supports it. Set-up is just minutes without having to wrestle with complicated menus. Then there’s the Bose TV speaker having Bluetooth integrated so you can pair your phone or tablet to stream music and podcasts directly without needing to go near the TV. Three units are provided to be connected through optical, HDMI, and AUX inputs and the system auto-connects to the very first powered-on source.</p>
<p>For $163, this Bose soundbar provides anyone with an easy way to greatly improve TV. That’s why tracking Amazon sales is well worth it—because when something sets an all-time low price, it’s the perfect time to buy.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Shantae Advance: Risky Revolution Review - Screenshot 1 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158239/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>Though Shantae has become well-established today as a recognisable indie gaming icon, there was once a time when the purple-haired half-genie hero struggled to find an audience. The original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gbc/shantae">Shantae</a> released for the GBC in 2002 and suffered poor sales, which led to publishers being unwilling to pick up the tab for funding the sequel Wayforward had planned for the GBA called <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/shantae_advance_risky_revolution">Shantae Advance: Risky Revolution</a>. Though development had progressed quite a bit, this title was ultimately shelved and interestingly <em>wasn’t</em> revisited when the studio eventually got <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/dsiware/shantae_riskys_revenge">Shantae: Risky’s Revenge</a> published for the DSi as the official second game in the series.</p>
<p>Some concepts and mechanics from Risky Revolution were repurposed for later entries, but it wasn’t until 2023 that WayForward revealed it had resumed development on their mascot's lost sophomore outing. And after an initial exclusivity period earlier this year in which the game was only available on an actual GBA cart, WayForward has now brought this interesting piece of Shantae history to modern platforms. After having put it through its paces, I’m happy to report that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/shantae_advance_risky_revolution">Risky Revolution</a> offers up an enjoyable glimpse into Shantae’s past that largely still holds up after all these years.</p>
<figure><a title="Shantae Advance: Risky Revolution Review - Screenshot 2 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158238/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Risky Revolution picks up shortly after the end of the first game, with the evil pirate Risky Boots back at it again with another dastardly plan to rule Sequin Land. This time, Risky has obtained technology that allows her to manipulate the tectonic plates beneath the Earth’s surface, plunging Sequin Land into chaos as various towns and locales are suddenly switched into different locations and climates. Aided by longtime allies such as Bolo, Rottytops, and Uncle Mimic, Shantae sets out to round up some of Uncle Mimic’s old colleagues and put a stop to Risky’s antics.</p>
<p>The lighthearted and airy nature of the narrative feels right on brand for the series, showcasing all the wit and humour you’d expect. Whether you’re dealing with wolves obsessed with collecting bad video games or celibate maidens who believe Risky’s mayhem is a punishment for their horniness, there’s a thoroughly unserious theme to the writing here that keeps things moving forward at a brisk pace.</p>
<p>Beyond this, Risky Revolution also expertly dances around the lore implications of being the <em>newest</em> entry in the long-running franchise despite chronologically being the second game—there are some aspects here that feel like they don’t <em>quite</em> fit with the broader narrative, but then Shantae canon has always been a little loose.</p>
<figure><a title="Shantae Advance: Risky Revolution Review - Screenshot 3 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158227/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Gameplay follows the expected Metroidvania blueprint of (most) Shantae games, with you visiting various towns, exploring wide-linear levels packed with baddies to battle and treasures to find, and puzzling your way through Zelda-like dungeons that grant you access to new animal transformations which expand Shantae’s moveset. The main gimmick this time around is Risky’s 'Tremor Engine', which allows you to step on a switch in certain areas of levels that will cause either the background or foreground to cycle and open up new pathways.</p>
<p>This world-cycling mechanic feels like an interesting ‘missing link’ evolutionary step that bridges the gameplay of the original Shantae and Risky’s Revenge, which also played around with having Shantae jump between two different layers of the game world. And while finding exactly what changed about the level and how to access the new pathways can feel a bit confusing at times, this ultimately feels like a clever take on the ‘dark world’ mechanic that a lot of platformers and action games utilise. At the very least, it also helps to set Risky Revolution apart from the other games in the series.</p>
<figure><a title="Shantae Advance: Risky Revolution Review - Screenshot 4 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158223/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Aside from the Tremor Engine, this is nothing more or less than another enjoyable Shantae adventure that plays exactly how you’d expect it to. Exploration, particularly in the dungeons, is quite rewarding and fuels a rapidly ascending power curve that sees Shantae quickly amassing a host of mobility and offensive abilities that make both combat and navigation a delight. Meanwhile, the combat and platforming are challenging without being too punishing, though the early game can be a <em>little</em> rough given that you have more limited tools and a lot less health to cover your mistakes.</p>
<p>Risky Revolution can also claim to be the first Shantae game to feature a competitive multiplayer feature, which is a fun extra. I was reminded a bit of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/towerfall">TowerFall</a> with this mode, which pits up to four players against each other in an arena and tasks them with knocking each other into spikes. Every now and then, the square arena you’re in will rotate 90 degrees, creating new platforms and opportunities to knock your foes into traps. It’s a little thin on content and obviously is far from the main draw, but battle mode is a fun novelty and helps to round out the overall package a bit.</p>
<figure><a title="Shantae Advance: Risky Revolution Review - Screenshot 5 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158232/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>In a lot of ways, Risky Revolution is a cool time capsule from a different era in gaming, but there are some aspects that haven’t exactly aged the best.</p>
<p>The biggest misstep on the gameplay side of things is the complete lack of a map, which can make navigation and backtracking quite a headache. Though this isn’t what I’d call a <em>huge</em> game world to navigate, it is large and intricate enough that you can easily forget where exactly you saw that out-of-reach collectible, and this issue is compounded by the sections featuring the swappable world. I wouldn’t say that the missing map is a dealbreaker, but it’s certainly an annoyance that keeps this game from ranking among the series’ best.</p>
<p>Beyond this, Risky Revolution also has a tendency to be overly wordy in its character exchanges, which can make some cutscenes overstay their welcome. A personal preference, admittedly, but many of the character interactions have you pressing ‘A’ a <em>lot</em> as you comb through joke after joke without the scene moving forward. Given the already short runtime of this adventure, this doesn’t prove <em>too</em> invasive, but some of the dialogue could’ve been trimmed for an overall tighter script that wouldn’t lose the goofy charm.</p>
<figure><a title="Shantae Advance: Risky Revolution Review - Screenshot 6 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158229/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>As for its graphics, this looks most like Shantae: Risky’s Revenge and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/shantae_and_the_pirates_curse">Shantae and the Pirates Curse</a>, characterised by expressive 32-bit pixel art. You also have the option of either playing in Story Mode featuring modern UI elements and HD character portraits, or the more retro Classic Mode, which features the as-is GBA release that came out earlier this year. Both modes look great, though Classic feels a <em>bit</em> more authentic given that its visual elements are consistent with each other.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Shantae Advance: Risky Revolution is an interesting ‘new’ entry in the beloved indie franchise, a curious fusion of old and new design philosophies. Its creative world-cycling gameplay mechanic, sharp 32-bit visuals, densely packed overworld, and charming narrative all come together to make for a worthwhile experience, even if some more outdated elements like the lack of a map hold it back.</p>
<p>I’d recommend this both to series veterans and to newcomers—even if this isn’t Shantae at her greatest, Risky Revolution is a solid adventure.</p></section>

			<p>Despite being ripe for a video game adaptation, up until this year, it looked like no one would ever be able to release a game based on the popular Hellraiser franchise. While it will continue to be a mystery why so many failed to bring Pinhead and the other Cenobites to our screens, I can say for certain that, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/hellraiser-revival-survival-horror-game-saber-interactive/">Clive Barker's Hellraiser</a>, Saber Interactive is definitely on the right track to capturing what makes the franchise so great while delivering a survival horror experience that is both haunting and incredibly immersive.</p>



<p>During Gamescom 2025 last week, I had the chance to try out Clive Barker's Hellraiser, and the around 40 minutes I spent with the game have left me thoroughly impressed. The demo began right from the start of the adventure, showing how Sunny opens the Genesis configuration and gets ultimately kidnapped by Pinhead himself, voiced by Doug Bradley, returning to the role after 20 years, and other Cenobites. Following a quick jaunt into the haunting Labyrinth, Aiden gets kidnapped by a group of cultists, the original owners of the Genesis Configuration, whose ultimate aim seems to create their own Cenobites for some unspecified twisted goal. Right from these first few minutes, it's clear how some of the franchises' theme, such as the thin boundaries between pleasure and pain, are on full show, and completely coherent with the series' canon, which is not surprising considering this is a canon story within the series' universe.</p>

<p>After a very intense sequence where the player has to pick the right actions to release Aiden from captivity, at the cost of much pain, the proper game began, giving me a taste of what to expect in the full experience. In many ways, Clive Barker's Hellraiser is a rather traditional first-person survival horror, but its great atmosphere enhances the genre's typical gameplay elements such as puzzles to complete, and chase sequences where Aiden has to escape from Cenobites, sequences that are made more interesting by the unique design of the Labyrinth, which can make navigation confusion, but in a nicely haunting way that only adds to the immersion. Puzzles also seem quite varied, ranging from simply following unclear directions to navigational puzzles like some simple stealth sequences. In the first few minutes of the game, these puzzles were mildly complex without being too easy or too hard, so progression felt natural, although some backtracking was in order. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to acquire a weapon to test out combat in the time available, so it remains to be seen how the game will balance fighting enemies with every other gameplay element, and how the dark powers of the Genesis Configuration will come into play.</p>



<p>With a no-holds-barred approach to the series' most extreme elements, I feel Clive Barker's Hellraiser: Revival will be an excellent debut for the franchise in the video games space. Despite playing the demo in a fully lit room amid the familiar hum of chatter that defines events like Gamescom, it feelt unsettling and horrifying nonetheless, which speaks volumes about the excellent work Saber Interactive is doing. Hopefully, the game will be as great as it looked in this demo when it launches sometime next year on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Sony and Amazon aren’t necessarily in sync when it comes to opinion on prices, and if they’re not, Amazon can’t officially display the discounted price to you upfront. What you’ll see instead is an enigmatic <em>“hidden price”</em> tag and you only get to know the bottom line after placing the product in your shopping cart. That’s exactly what is currently happening with the <strong>Sony WH-CH520 headphones</strong>.</p>
<p>Right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3721/">they’re $38 rather than the normal $69, which is a respectable 46% discount</a>. This is one of Amazon’s <em>Labor Day</em> deals and it’s an easy win if you’re looking for a good pair of wireless headphones without shelling out top dollar. Yes, these are not the costly Sony WH-1000XM6 (that cost you ten times this amount) but for everyday listening, they have a lot of quality to make a jump at this price cut worthwhile.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3721/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Cheap and Good Headphones</h2>
<p>Why these headphones are worth considering, apart from the discount, is their balance of features for the average listener: One of the first things I noticed about it is <strong>the battery life: 50 hours on one charge</strong>. That’s long enough to get through a whole week’s worth of commutes without even thinking about where to locate a charger. And if you must refuel, a quick charge option <strong>gives up to 90 minutes of playback from a 3-minute boost</strong>.</p>
<p>The sound itself is a bonus, too: The WH-CH520 has access to the Sony Headphones Connect App where<strong> you can play around with the EQ</strong> to your preference. More bass on dance tracks? You can tweak it with ease. Sony even throws in its <em>DSEE</em> technology which is meant to enhance compressed sound files from streaming services.</p>



<p>Comfort is just as essential as sound, and <strong>Sony has used light construction with swiveling earcups</strong> that are easy to wear and quick to remove between calls or tunes. The adjustable headband is also designed to make long listening sessions comfortable without that “ear fatigue” that cheaper headphones offer. Available in six colors including black, blue, white, pink, yellow and cappuccino (all are on sale at Amazon), these earphones also give you a bit of style choice rather than one appearance.</p>
<p>It’s worth circling back to the real hook here: the price. At $38, you’re getting a well-rounded Sony audio product for a bargain that felt unthinkable just a few years ago. Even with stronger competition in the headphone market, it’s rare to see this level of reliability and battery life paired with Sony’s audio heritage at such a budget-friendly cost.&nbsp;At this price, there’s every reason to grab a pair before Amazon’s “hidden price” disappears from view.</p>

<p>I love shooting things. In video games–not real life, I mean guns can be good fun, but I’ve got this whole cross-dominant right-hand/left eye thing that’s, whatever, not what you’re here for! You’re here because you like shooting things in video games as much as I do, and, lucky for us, Steam is running its “TPS Fest,” which has a ton of third-person shooters up for sale, so it’s a perfect time to snag something you’ve been putting off for some time, or grab a recent hit.</p> <p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/category/action_tps">sale event runs from now until September 1</a>, so you have a week to figure out if any of the games strike your fancy. But there are a lot of games on sale, so what should you get? How about we break it down by price category?</p> <h2><span id="control,-max-payne,-the-division-2,-and-other-cool-shooters-under-10-bucks"></span><i>Control</i>, <i>Max Payne</i>, <i>The Division 2,</i> and other cool shooters under 10 bucks<span></span></h2> <p>You’re practically losing money if you don’t snag at least one of these. To start, Remedy’s incredible 2019 shooter <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/870780/Control_Ultimate_Edition/"><i>Control</i> is available for $3.99</a>–and that’s with <i>all</i> of the DLC. But if you’re looking for something with multiplayer, maybe snag <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2221490/Tom_Clancys_The_Division_2/"><i>The Division 2</i></a> for six bucks; the Gold Edition and Ultimate Editions, while not under 10 dollars, are also on sale too.</p>

 <p>Each of the games in the <i>Max Payne</i> trilogy is under 10 bucks individually; <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/12140/Max_Payne/">the first</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/12150/Max_Payne_2_The_Fall_of_Max_Payne/">second</a> games are expected to get remakes soon. And while <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/204100/Max_Payne_3/">the third game</a> wasn’t made by Remedy, it’s still a fantastic third-person shooter that’s a steal for a mere six bucks.</p> <p>There’s another bunch of throwbacks I want to highlight if you haven’t played them: the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/667720/Red_Faction_Guerrilla_ReMarstered/">2018 remaster of <i>Red Faction Guerilla</i></a> is also a smashing good time (literally, as there’s an incredible variety of destructible environments you can smash) and only costs four dollars. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/460810/Vanquish/"><i>Vanquish</i></a> is also available for just six bucks. It’s a speedy, high-octane shooter developed by Platinum Games during the Xbox 360 era that you owe it to yourself to check out if you haven’t played. Oh, and Shinji Mikami (<i>Resident Evil</i>, <i>Dino Crisis</i>, <i>The Evil Within</i>) directed it, in case you didn’t know. If you want another offbeat third-person shooter from the era, you can also <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/203750/Binary_Domain?snr=1_49_4_actiontps_100722">grab <i>Binary Domain</i> for three dollars.</a></p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/splinter-cell-enhanced-mod-pc-steam-deck-2000616399">This Incredible <i>Splinter Cell </i>Mod Offers The Definitive Experience Of A Stealth Classic</a></p>

 <p>If you haven’t already, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/13560/Tom_Clancys_Splinter_Cell/">snag the first <i>Splinter Cell</i></a> for just $2.50, and then <a href="https://kotaku.com/splinter-cell-enhanced-mod-pc-steam-deck-2000616399">download this awesome mod</a> I talked about a few weeks ago. It rocks.</p> <p>And if you want another retro throwback, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/11550/Second_Sight/">GameCube cult classic <i>Second Sight</i></a> is also a mere $2.50 right now.</p> <h2><span id="the-last-of-us-part-i,-uncharted,-remnant-ii,-and-other-games-under-30-bucks"></span><i>The Last of Us Part I</i>, <i>Uncharted</i>, <i>Remnant II</i>, and other games under 30 bucks<span></span></h2> <p>I may always think the story in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1888930/The_Last_of_Us_Part_I/"><i>The Last of Us</i></a> ain’t worth nearly the amount of digital ink spilled over it, but it sure as hell is an awesome stealthy, survival-themed shooter.

And if you’re really on a Sony kick, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1659420/UNCHARTED_Legacy_of_Thieves_Collection/"><i>Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection</i> is just 20 bucks</a>, which includes <i>Uncharted 4</i> and its spin-off, standalone expansion.</p>

 <p>It’s been a while since I’ve jumped into <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1282100/REMNANT_II/"><i>Remnant II</i></a>, but if you’re up for a pretty sweet cooperative, souls-like shooter, it’s just 20 bucks right now.</p> <p>And if you’re tired of doing all your shooting on the ground, might I recommend checking out <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1128920/EVERSPACE_2/"><i>Everspace 2</i> for 15 dollars</a>?</p> <p>Also, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1007040/EARTH_DEFENSE_FORCE_5/"><i>Earth Defense Force 5</i> is just $14.99</a>. Why don’t <i>you</i>, yes you, own it already?</p> <h2><span id="solid-discounts-on-some-other-recent-shooters"></span>Solid discounts on some other recent shooters<span></span></h2> <p>Earlier this year, I was pleasantly surprised by how engaging <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2169200/Sniper_Elite_Resistance/"><i>Sniper Elite: Resistance</i></a> is as both a stealth sim and a test of your accuracy. It’s just $37.49 right now.</p>

 <p>And remember how I said <i>TLOU</i> is an awesome third-person shooter (that might be a touch too dramatic for its own good)? <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2531310/The_Last_of_Us_Part_II_Remastered/"><i>TLOU2</i> is on sale for $40 right now</a> and features even <i>better</i> gameplay than the first one.</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-review-size-how-big-hours-xbox-ps5-pc-1851631123"><i>Star Wars Outlaws</i>: The <i>Kotaku</i> Review</a></p> <p>Lastly, if you haven’t yet grabbed a copy of last year’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-review-size-how-big-hours-xbox-ps5-pc-1851631123"><i>Star Wars Outlaws</i></a>, it’s on sale right now for $31.</p> <p>Anyway, that wraps up what caught my eye during this sale event, but there’s so, so much more.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/clive-barkers-hellraiser-revival-hands-on-preview/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/clive-barker%E2%80%99s-hellraiser-revival-hands-on-preview-the-most-disturbing-game-i-have-ever-played.1280505/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>As visually shocking as the Hellraiser reveal trailer was, I don’t think it could’ve prepared me for the hour-long theater of violence and sadism my poor eyes were going to be subjected to at Gamescom 2025. My Clive Barker’s Hellraiser: Revival preview is not for the faint of heart, but if you can stomach it, there could be a special horror game here.</p>



<p>Let’s start with the most important detail first: I have never consumed one second of Hellraiser media. Never watched a movie, know nothing about the lore, and my only exposure is basic horror knowledge of the Hellraiser character. I think we can label me a Hellraiser noob in this case.</p>



<p>I was very excited to be invited to an exclusive hands-on preview with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fans-think-saber-interactive-are-teasing-new-hellraiser-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Clive Barker’s Hellraiser: Revival</a> at Gamescom 2025. This preview will not hold back, folks. If you’re squeamish, get a sick bag on standby.</p>



<h2 id="h-hellraiser-will-raise-blood-pressure-and-anxiety">Hellraiser Will Raise Blood Pressure and Anxiety</h2>



<figure><figcaption>If only you’d seen the things my eyes have. Credit to Saber Interactive</figcaption></figure>



<p>The first five minutes of the <a href="https://hellraisergame.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Clive Barker’s Hellraiser: Revival</a> preview demo features graphic nudity, the male and female genitalia, BDSM, extreme mutilation, and images the human mind should only dream of—not see. It’s a continuation of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hellraiser-revival-trailer-revealed-saber-interactive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hellraiser reveal trailer</a>, which shocked audiences on July 22.</p>



<p>It’s not long before I take control of Aidan in this brand-new Hellraiser story (considered canon). Associate game directors Srđan Nedić and Aleksandra Pelivanović made it clear to me that this is the perfect starting point for newcomers. The Genesis Configuration is a legendary device mysteriously activated by Aidan and his girlfriend, Sunny. Hellraiser and his cultist cronies want to know how you activated it and want to harness its power. </p>



<p>Aidan needs to suffer until this happens. You must wrench a hook out of your body, cut away at your stitched-up torso, and pull nails out of your hands. It’s just a casual Saturday night for some. There’s an impressively broad spectrum of horror on display throughout the demo: PT-esque hallways, clever environmental puzzles requiring lateral thinking, chase sequences, jump scares, and the constant dread of psychological torture and mental anxiety.</p>



<p>Oh, I nearly forgot the visual horror—only joking, the shocking images are burned into my retinas. My journey through the Labyrinth is a supreme gut check, which is apt as I lost count of how many entrails I saw. The cultists who inhabit the area are obsessed with art and making people suffer. You venture from room to room, and it becomes a swift game of one-upsmanship.</p>



<p>Each new ‘piece’ features new layers of evisceration, dismemberment, and testing the limits of the human body. It’s even more disturbing when you encounter people who are clearly <em>still alive</em> and are suffering through this. A distinct moment of the demo features a dancing ‘doctor’ cutting up a naked woman strapped helplessly to a vertical surgery table. Her jaw is missing, causing her tongue to flail around like an angry cat’s tail. I eventually have to sneak past the scene—getting close to the massacre in the process—and watch in horror as a pair of hands suddenly fly past me—hers, and she’s still alive.</p>



<h2 id="h-if-you-love-resident-evil-you-ll-love-hellraiser">If You Love Resident Evil, You’ll Love Hellraiser</h2>



<figure><figcaption>This isn’t a Wendy’s, is it? Credit to Saber Interactive</figcaption></figure>



<p>Hellraiser turned out to be my most surprising game of Gamescom 2025. I went in with no expectations, and it’s now immediately on my perpetual wanted list. If I had to describe my time with it, I’d liken it to Resident Evil 7 and 8—a proper first-person horror game with puzzles, finding key items, and even in its combat.</p>



<p>This isn’t an Outlast-type of horror journey. You get weapons early on, and you must be cognizant of their types. Certain tools won’t be effective against armored enemies, for instance. Each tool has a degradation meter, so you could easily destroy your weapon without really inflicting any damage. I also got a gun towards the end of my playtime. </p>



<p>The enemy AI was quite smart and was quick to go into cover if I had a gun. They would utilize the surroundings to try and flank me. However, there was nothing I could do against The Chatterer. Some basic research allows me to understand it’s not a new enemy in the Hellraiser universe, but for me, it’s one of the most horrifying figures I’ve come across. Think of Nemesis, but with unnerving chattering teeth, with every coming together of those canines ringing in my ear like hypnotic torture.</p>



<p>Do not sleep on Clive Barker’s Hellraiser: Revival, there’s something horribly cool here. If this Hellraiser preview hasn’t made it clear, you probably won’t want to sleep anyway.</p>



<hr>



<p>I hope you get to see what I saw for yourself. Its palette of violence and vivid imagery is so rare in gaming. You can expect Terrifier levels of gratuitous gore in Clive Barker’s Hellraiser: Revival. If Saber’s new horror game can maintain its consistency throughout the whole runtime, this might not be our first visit to hell.</p>

                <p>It's no exaggeration to say that the opening hour of Clive Barker's Hellraiser: Revival has some of the most gruesome sights I have ever seen in a video game.</p><p dir="ltr">Games have regularly pushed the boundaries of ultra violence, including Mortal Kombat's fatalities and the grisly cycle of violence depicted in The Last of Us Part 2. But the graphic content depicted in Saber Interactive's twisted adaptation of the infamous horror series is on another level, committing itself to be as true to the British author and director's original nightmarish creation as possible, and completely unfiltered.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_4kAp6gsZE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/E_4kAp6gsZE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">This means you're not just coming across a brutally mutilated corpse without actually seeing how they met their horrible demise. A woman's mouth is pulled with a hook while more dig into her bare skin before her whole back is opened up. A nail is hammered through a man's hand and into the arm of a chair, which he's also pinned to with stitches from his stomach. Even the leftover body parts of victims are not just left as idle backdrops but something you will need to reach into and interact with.</p><p dir="ltr">Barker's approach to body horror isn't just violent but also erotic. Indeed, in his book The Hellbound Heart, from which Hellraiser originates, the sadomasochistic Cenobites--humans transformed into demonic beings who worship sensation, whether extreme pain or extreme pleasure--are described in more explicitly sexual terms than in the films that followed. So whereas games can often revel in ultra violence but hesitate at sex and nudity, Hellraiser: Revival takes no half-measures.</p><p dir="ltr">At the start of the story, we're introduced to protagonist Aidan and his affluent girlfriend Sunny, who are at home in a candlelit bedroom. The sight of BDSM gear like a mouth gag should be enough to tell you they have their kinks, but the game doesn't leave it there. We don't meet them post-coitus but instead still very much unclothed while physically exploring their extreme desires, as evidenced from the metal nails in Aidan's bare chest. But it's when Sunny pulls out a mysterious puzzle box that things begin to take a turn, as she unwittingly summons Pinhead--voiced by Doug Bradley, who played the iconic figure in the original films--and his fellow Cenobites from their hellish dimension.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4556072-screenshot4.png" data-ref-id="1300-4556072" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4556072-screenshot4.png" data-ref-id="1300-4556072"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4556072-screenshot4.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">The nudity is hardly what you'd call gratuitous, even if it's a very rare example of full-frontal nudity in a game, and it fits within the context of Hellraiser's body horror, exposing the frail vulnerability of human flesh. Aidan's story might be boiled down to a guy trying to save his girlfriend, but it hardly feels heroic when you're put in his shoes, tied up naked and awaiting torture from a sadistic figure called Bruno, whose blue-ish attire doesn't make him look too different from a cop.</p><p dir="ltr">From tThe game's first-person perspective, looking down from his chair, Aidan is quite literally exposed, until you look around more and come to the realization that you need to remove the nail pinning his hand before removing a hook in his shoulder and using it to pull out his stitches to free him. It's an ordeal that leaves him vulnerable, wandering around naked and bleeding profusely.</p><p dir="ltr">For that reason, the game's opening is more a slow-burning tutorial getting you acquainted with both crafting (used to heal Aidan) and stealth, which while fairly rudimentary is a way of voyeuristically observing this dank lair populated by Cenobite-worshipping cultists who are having fun experimenting on some other poor victims. The worst of these encounters is when you run into Bruno later, who's merrily dancing around a female victim tied to an upright gurney. As if she's not already suffered enough, as you can see from the numerous lacerations on her legs or how her tongue is hanging from where her lower jaw should be, he's still making fresh incisions with his knife as you try to sneak around him.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4556074-screenshot6.png" data-ref-id="1300-4556074" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4556074-screenshot6.png" data-ref-id="1300-4556074"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4556074-screenshot6.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Having also been treated to a quick montage presentation of the horrific things that happen to people in the films, it's clear that Saber Interactive is serious about staying true to Barker's vision. The writer-director was also consulted on the original story written for Revival.</p><p dir="ltr">"We're trying to portray all the gore and horror that is present in the films, violence, sexuality, everything," said associate game director Aleksandra Pelivanović. "It was really important for us to catch every key element of the franchise and put it in the game in the right context. And when we sent Clive the final draft for the story line, he was like, 'Yes, that's Hellraiser!'"</p><p dir="ltr">Yet while it certainly captures the vibe, I wasn't able to get far enough in the opening hour to get a sense of the other game's components. Given that I was short of one material to craft a healing item, it seems resources will be precious. The same goes for lockpicks, also in limited supply and which you need to use both thumbsticks to position carefully to avoid them snapping from too much tension. If I had any relief, it was that I at least managed to find some clothes for Aidan so that he wouldn't spend the whole game in his birthday suit.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4556075-screenshot7.png" data-ref-id="1300-4556075" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4556075-screenshot7.png" data-ref-id="1300-4556075"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4556075-screenshot7.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Unfortunately, the demo descended into a disorienting chase sequence in a constantly shifting labyrinth, which left me confused and frustrated. While this was a trick used early on when you're trying to find Sunny after the puzzle box opens up this strange hellish dimension, this time you're also being chased by a Cenobite who can just appear in front of you. It felt like a cheap way to tutorialize being able to perform a quick 180-turn by holding down on the d-pad, but it also became a frustrating case of trial-and-error to remember which path I needed to take after the labyrinth changed without going down a dead end, where you're doomed to instant death.</p><p dir="ltr">It's actually after this sequence, I'm told, that combat eventually unlocks, although it doesn't consist of much more than a melee weapon and a gun, and I've yet to get a grasp on what the Genesis Configuration--the name of the puzzle box given by Pinhead--can do once you recover it.</p><p dir="ltr">"Players will have the opportunity to choose their play style," Pelivanović assured me. "This is just the start of the game, so it's an opportunity for the players to familiarize themselves with tutorials and the atmosphere."</p><p dir="ltr">I'm also told that something players will be able to adjust is difficulty, which influences both combat and survival elements, such as resources.</p><p dir="ltr">But while it's possible to skip cinematic cutscenes, one thing that there won't be an option for is to reduce any gore, or any other NSFW material, for that matter.</p><p dir="ltr">"Visually, it's a crucial part of the franchise and we have to do it justice, so it is a part of the game," Pelivanović said.</p><p dir="ltr">Clive Barker's Hellraiser: Revival may not be for everyone--certainly not those who are squeamish--but that sounds like devotees to the franchise will be having a hell of a time.</p><p dir="ltr">Clive Barker's Hellraiser: Revival is coming soon to PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

            <p>
PlayStation CEO Hermen Hulst wants the company to mitigate expensive risks with its future games, following last year's high profile failure of live-service shooter Concord.
</p>
<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/d5859ffc-c4d7-4480-98a6-c1cff07af299">Financial Times</a> (via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-boss-says-company-now-does-much-more-rigorous-and-more-frequent-testing-after-concords-failure">IGN</a>), Hulst reflected on Concord's failure in comparison to the huge success of mascot platformer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/astro-bot">Astro Bot</a>. "I don't want teams to always play it safe, but I would like for us, when we fail, to fail early and cheaply," he said.
</p>
<p>
Playstation has now put into place more supervision of Sony's owned studios, to ensure Concord's fate isn't repeated. "We have since put in place much more rigorous and more frequent testing in very many different ways," said Hulst. "The advantage of every failure...is that people now understand how necessary that [oversight] is."

<p>
Analysts estimate Concord cost Sony around $250m, but was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-pulled-from-sale-as-sony-admits-our-initial-launch-didnt-land">infamously shut down just two weeks after launch</a>, resulting in the closure of its developer Firewalk Studio. Astro Bot, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ps5-console-sales-top-65m-as-astro-bot-sells-15m-copies-in-first-month">sold 1.5m copies in its first month</a> and, by March this year, had sold 2.3m copies.
</p><p>
As a result of Concord's failure, Hulst suggested to FT PlayStation isn't so intent on releasing live-service games as it once was. That mirrors <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-concord-and-a-string-of-delays-and-cancellations-sony-admits-playstations-live-service-strategy-is-not-entirely-going-smoothly">comments from Sony's chief financial officer Lin Tao earlier this month</a>, who admitted the company's live-service strategy is "not entirely going smoothly".
</p>
<p>
Indeed, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungies-marathon-reboot-delayed-indefinitely-in-response-to-passionate-fan-feedback">Bungie's Marathon reboot was indefinitely delayed</a> after its initial unveiling earlier this year.
</p>
<p>
Instead, Hulst's strategy is to grow Sony's IP into long-lasting franchises, just as Astro Bot has gained positive notoriety with each game released.
</p>
<p>
"We take a very intentional approach to IP creation...understanding how a new concept can turn into an iconic franchise for PlayStation, that can then again become a franchise for people beyond gaming," said Hulst.

			<p>A new The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom 4K texture pack is now available for download, further enhancing the game's visuals for those playing the game on PC via a Nintendo Switch emulator.</p>



<p>The texture pack, whose 1.0 version was released a few days back on <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/legendofzeldatearsofthekingdom/mods/161">Nexus Mods</a> after being in early access beta state for a while, upgrades all of the game's textures to 4K resolution, including terrain textures. Compared to the previous version of the texture pack, the 1.0 version also includes some texture additions and memory optimizations, as well as some fixes for glitched textures in shrines. As such, this version of the texture pack should be the most stable yet, allowing players to experience the latest entry in the series like never before. You can check out this The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom 4K texture pack before downloading in action in the video below released alongside the very first version of the modded textures last year.</p>

<p>Although PC players will continue to be able to experience The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom at its best for the foreseeable future, Nintendo Switch 2 owners can also enjoy the latest entries in the series with plenty of enhancements thanks to the upgraded versions released alongside the system earlier this year. Besides visuals and performance enhancements, the Nintendo Switch 2 versions of both games come with the Zelda Notes feature, which is a great addition to the experience, as Nathan highlighted in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-switch-2-hands-on/">piece</a>.</p>



<p>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is now available on Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 worldwide. Learn more about the game in our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/">review.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><strong>Amazon’s Labor Day sales have officially launched</strong>&nbsp;and some of the best offers are not on everyday essentials but on real tech upgrades. That’s exactly the case with the <strong>Samsung 9100 Pro 4TB SSD</strong>, which only went on sale a few months prior for $550. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3720/">Now it has dropped to as little as $372 (37% off)</a> which is an all time low for a brand new item. Samsung’s smaller 1TB and 2TB versions are seeing price drops as well right now but they come with less dramatic dives.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3720/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>4.8 Out of 5 Stars Rating</h2>
<p>This is a <strong>PCIe 5.0 drive</strong>&nbsp;which means you’re effectively stepping into the latest generation of storage technology. On paper, it can push sequential read speeds up to <strong>14,800 MB/s and write speeds of around 13,400 MB/s</strong> (double the Samsung’s legendary 990 Pro). Launching games, opening massive video projects or crunching through workloads tied to AI applications and content creation happens almost instantly.</p>
<p>What’s equally impressive are the random read and write numbers as it can reach up to 2,200K and 2,600K IOPS. Sounds like computer lingo, but what it really translates to is seamless multitasking with a whole lot less waiting. <strong>Edit 4K or 8K footage, train AI models</strong> or load intense workstation applications: this drive maintains your system responsiveness even at high load. Gamers benefit too with incredibly fast in-game loading and virtually zero stutter while streaming assets in-game.</p>



<p>There’s a<strong> fresh 5nm controller inside which cuts power consumption by nearly 50% compared to the 990 Pro</strong>&nbsp;and that’s gigantic for laptops that sit through long sessions and desktops trying to keep temperatures under control. There’s <strong>integrated advanced thermal management</strong> which prevents overheating and throttling even when you’re hammering the drive with constant workloads.</p>
<p>On the software side, Samsung continues to support its drives with its <em>Magician</em> software suite which updates firmware automatically, contains helpful drive health monitoring and offers extra layers of encryption for workstations that deal with sensitive information.</p>
<p>If you’ve been waiting for a reason to jump into PCIe 5.0 speed, this Labor Day is the perfect time.</p>

            <p>
Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot will appear in court in October in relation to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-report-on-ubisoft-reveals-more-shocking-sexual-harassment-allegations">sexual harassment allegations that emerged back in 2020</a> against a number of employees.
</p>
<p>
Back in June, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-senior-ubisoft-staff-convicted-in-french-harassment-case-receive-fines-and-suspended-sentences">three former senior Ubisoft employees received suspended prison sentences and fines</a> after being found guilty of harassment. All three employees left the company in 2020 as part of a wave of resignations and dismissals.
</p>
<p>
However, as reported by French outlet <a href="https://www.bfmtv.com/tech/gaming/affaire-de-harcelement-chez-ubisoft-le-pdg-yves-guillemot-convoque-devant-la-justice_AN-202508220570.html">BFM TV</a>, a subpoena has been issued against Guillemot in relation to this case, meaning he'll have to appear before the Bobigny court (Seine-Saint-Denis) on 1st October.
</p>
<p>
The summons for Guillemot was filed by the Solidaires Informatiques union and four individuals, "the same civil parties" as in the previous trial resolved in June.
</p>
<p>
Following an investigation by the Public Prosecutor's Office, no criminal proceedings will be held against Ubisoft or its management, which was confirmed during the closing arguments at the hearing in June.
</p>
<p>
"Our top priority is to ensure the absolute protection of the physical and moral integrity of its employees, through a policy of prevention and zero tolerance with regard to sexual or moral harassment, sexist behavior, assault, insult, or discrimination of any kind," said Cecile Russeil, executive vice president of Ubisoft.
</p><p>
A union representative from Solidaires Informatiques has confirmed the summons was sent last month, but Guillemot was absent and his family refused to take his place. HR director Marie Derain and Ubisoft as a legal entity have also been summoned.
</p>
<p>
In 2020, following reports of harassment at the studio, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-weeks-of-devastating-sexual-harassment-allegations-ubisoft-boss-yves-guillemot-is-asked-how-much-he-knew">Guillemot was asked how much he knew of the issues taking place</a>. "It has now become clear that certain individuals betrayed the trust I placed in them and did not live up to Ubisoft's shared values," he said. "I have never compromised on my core values and ethics and never will. I will continue to run and transform Ubisoft to face today's and tomorrow's challenges."

			<p>There’s been a veritable smorgasbord of roguelite games over the last few years, so many that the release of yet another entry in the cram-packed genre elicits plenty of yawns and little excitement. Well, stifle your sleepy exhalation, as The Rogue Prince of Persia – a roguelite imbued with the thrilling free-running platforming that Ubisoft’s best franchise is famous for – is worth getting excited about.</p>
<p><iframe title="Deep Dive Trailer - The Rogue Prince of Persia" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/t0jWFjABmW0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Huns have only gone and invaded Persia, which, quite frankly, is proving problematic for the Prince and his allies. As not only are the Huns formidable warriors in their own right, but they also possess potent dark magic. At the start of the game, the Prince faces off against their despicable leader, Nogai, but is quickly killed off. Thankfully, the Prince possesses a magical amulet that restores him to life and, as a Brucey bonus, partially rewinds time, to just after our hero was first killed. And so, with the death loop cycle of the roguelite established, the Prince sets off on a fateful quest to vanquish the Hun menace before they destroy all of Persia.</p>


<p>He’ll do this by wall-running, leaping, backflipping, rolling, and tumbling through a series of 2D levels, stylishly taking down henchman before defeating a series of ultra-hard bosses. Visually this is a sumptuous treat, with gorgeous evocative environments and accompanying background art. The cartoon-like characters are equally pretty, with fluid, smooth, seamless animation, which effortlessly brings to mind the iconic rotoscoping of the original Prince of Persia game. The graphics are tied up with a lovely Bande dessinée comic-style ribbon, ensuring that the Rogue Prince of Persia is one of the most beautiful 2D games released in recent memory.</p>


<p>Platforming is precise and fluid, just as it should be in a Prince of Persia game. As the Prince continues to free-run he accelerates, until he’s barrelling through the level like a particularly acrobatic freight train. Speed-runners are going to have a blast with this, but even us regular mortals can enjoy a silly grin slapped on our face as we hurtle past buzz saws, spike traps, and hordes of enemies with such agility even Sonic would be jealous. Being able to climb up the background is a genius touch, enabling developers Evil Empire to construct levels with impressive ingenuity. Indeed, I haven’t quite experienced anything like this in my 2D platformers before. What I really appreciated though, is how the Prince reacts very quickly if he hits a trap. Sure, you’ll still take damage, but you can rabidly recover and continue your wall run or flip away from danger, preventing the frustration that would occur if being struck with a trap was an insta-kill situation.</p>
<p>Combat is just as brilliant, with the Prince using his dexterity to counterattack an impressively varied array of Huns. With a backflip that apes the one seen in the classic game Prince of Persia: Sands of Time, the Prince can nimbly strike his foes from behind for increased damage, before darting away to prevent their superior numbers and strength from overwhelming him. It’s thrilling best-in-class stuff.</p>

<p>This being a roguelite, exploring each level rewards the Prince with numerous temporary buffs, from powerful new weapons to special ability granting medallions. Of course, you never know what the randomness of each run will grant you, but I always found that I had a decent chance of progressing, even with one of the naffer builds. Collecting magical gunk from defeated Huns provides permanent stat boosts, additional weapons, medallions and access to upgrades.</p>
<p>Progress initially comes thick and fast, with early runs always providing something new. Whether that’s allies to rescue – who will return to your homebase to take on the role of merchants and talking heads – or new gameplay mechanics to uncover. I also must applaud Evil Empire from attempting to vary up the repletion of the roguelite genre by providing additional side quests, providing you with motivation for the necessary task of constantly revisiting levels. This takes the from of a ‘mind palace’ in which the Prince can discover clues to various mysteries – from finding secret paths between levels to rescuing family members and discovering the Hun’s diabolic plans – and progress further through the game’s story, even whilst frequently dying.</p>

<p>Having said that, if you’ve bounced off the roguelite genre before, you won’t be won over here. Sooner or later, and with inexorable inevitability, the tedium of running through the same levels again and again sets in. Sure, you’ll complete them quicker, faster and with increasingly effortless athleticism, but you’ll still have to get through early levels like the village, aqueduct, and the Hun’s headquarters far more times than is enjoyable. &nbsp;Additional foes only do so much in alleviating the boredom. Still, if you adore the rinse and repeat elements of the roguelite genre, then The Rogue Prince of Persia is an essential purchase. For me? I’d love it if the stand-out game making skills of Evil Empire could next be applied to a more conventional platformer, one without the roguelite trappings.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-iphone-16-charger-costs-4x-less-than-at-apple-amazon-clears-out-stock-for-labor-day.1280469/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you’ve ever found yourself scratching your head wondering why you’re shelling out so much money just to have your iPhone charged, this deal will be a bargain. On Apple’s website, <strong>a simple vanilla 20W charger sells for $19</strong> – and that only comes with one block, not the cable.</p>
<p>Great news, you can currently purchase not one but <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3718/">two Anker 20W USB-C charger blocks and corresponding cables on Amazon for the low price of $11</a>. That’s under six bucks apiece, the very same low price we did last Black Friday and Prime Day but with a Labor Day flavor. No wonder this two-pack is the <strong>#1 best-seller in Amazon’s entire charger section</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3718/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Speed and Safe Charging</h2>
<p>These are <strong>20W USB-C (and USB-A) charging blocks</strong> that are meant to charge in a hurry. The virtue of rapid charging is that you’re not wasting so much time alongside a power outlet, and with these, you can <strong>recharge your iPhone 16 or 15 series battery up to 50% in roughly 30 minutes</strong>. If you’ve been stuck using those older 5W chargers, the difference is night and day. Anker has tuned its PowerIQ technology to keep speeds consistent while staying safe for your battery.</p>
<p>Since this set comes with <strong>two chargers and two matching USB-C to Lightning cables</strong>, it’s ready to cover multiple needs at once. You can have a person sleep by your bedside, the other in your bag or at the office desk so that you’ll get rid of those annoying frustrating minutes of <em>“where did I place my only charger?”</em> The braided build of the cables also renders them more resilient than what you’d otherwise receive in the package.</p>



<p>Compatibility isn’t something to fret about either. Just because the purchase is marketed for iPhone 16 and 15 devices doesn’t signify that exact <strong>20W PD (Power Delivery) output won’t perform with iPads, AirPods, and even some Android models or smaller USB-C devices</strong>.</p>
<p>You’re getting Apple Store quality at less than a third of the unit cost, with the added advantage that Anker actually includes the cables, something that Apple charges extra for. Deals such as these won’t stay on the shelves long when they hit this record-low price, make sure you don’t miss the opportunity on Amazon.</p>

            <p>The next character in Riot Games' upcoming 2v2 fighting game - 2XKO - has been leaked on <a href="https://support-2xko.riotgames.com/hc/en-us">the official Riot Games support website</a>. We're going to say who they are in following paragraphs, heads up.</p>
<p>Art for the Blitzcrank was spotted by keen-eyed fans early this morning for the 2XKO, front and centre as both the the star of the banner at the top of the dedicated 2XKO page, as well as the character used on the 2XKO widget when browsing the wider Riot Games support website.</p>
<p>As of writing the art is still live on the support website. Blitzcrank would be the ninth character to come to 2XKO, though no word on when he'll be implemented has been announced, officially or otherwise.</p>

<p>2XKO is set to launch into closed beta on 9th September, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/was-riot-games-fighting-game-2xko-revealed-too-early-interview">marking the end of a lengthy development journey</a>. In recent months, online sentiment around the game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/2xko-interview-eight-characters-enough-launch-roster">has been tinged somewhat due to a demand for a wider variety of weirder characters</a>. Blitzcrank, a big goofy robot, certainly fits the freakier category.</p><div>

<p>There's a hint of irony here, given one of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a>' most legendary support champions being revealed early via the support website. As for when we'll see Blitzcrank revealed properly? Well, one would hope that with official Riot Games websites locked and loaded with official assets, it could be around the corner, but that's entirely speculation. Who knows, maybe he'll be a surprise addition to the closed beta?</p>
<p>What do you think of Blitzcrank? Let us know.</p>

<p>"47, your target is Frame Rate"</p>

<figure><a title="Hitman 3" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d6e22fe7852fe/hitman-3.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: IO Interactive</em></figcaption></figure><p>IO Interactive has launched a new update for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hitman-world-of-assassination-signature-edition">Hitman: World of Assassination - Signature Edition</a> on the Switch 2.</p>
<p>The key improvement here is the game's frame rate, which at launch failed to maintain its 60fps target at frequent intervals. The patch adds in a 'Frame Rate' option to stabilise the performance, and this will be turned on by default, which perhaps just goes to show how terrible it was before.</p>
<p>There are a few other notable improvements regarding performance and lighting, alongside a particularly concerning issue in which the game would sometimes crash when loading auto saves.</p><div><figure data-videoid="_evSaRNgyaU" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_evSaRNgyaU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_evSaRNgyaU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_evSaRNgyaU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5c6dc3vrouyk&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_evSaRNgyaU" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>So let's check out the <a href="https://ioi.dk/hitman/patch-notes/2025/hitman-woa-nintendo-switch-2-patch-notes-august-26th-2025">full patch notes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Patch 3.230.1 – Nintendo Switch 2 (26/08/2025)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong></p>
<p><strong>Safe to Save -</strong> We fixed the issue causing title crashes when loading auto saves.</p>
<p><strong>Dimmed for Stealth -</strong> Resolved overly bright lighting in dark locations.</p>
<p><strong>Mirror, Mirror (Not So Smooth) -</strong> Fixed an issue where framerate drops could occur when Agent 47 moved while facing large mirrors in bathrooms at 4K resolution.</p>
<p><strong>Blinding Ads -</strong> Fixed an issue where every second ad on display screens in Teller Hall, New York, appeared excessively bright.</p>
<p><strong>Too Bright to Bargain -</strong> Corrected an issue where the Freelancer supplier shop screens would appear overly bright in specific well-lit mission locations.</p>
<p><strong>Trust Your Instincts -</strong> Addressed issues where Instinct would not reliably highlight items, set pieces, or guard silhouettes.</p>
<p><strong>Steady Aim -</strong>Added a “Frame Rate” option to help maintain stable performance. By default, this option is switched on.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hitman's performance woes at launch meant that it only managed to score <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/hitman-world-of-assassination-signature-edition">7/10 in our review</a>, despite showcasing the franchise's excellent open-ended gameplay and stunning level design.</p>
<p>IO Interactive is also hard at work on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/007-first-light">007 First Light</a>, a brand-new James Bond title confirmed for launch on the Switch 2 in 2026. Meanwhile, Hitman fans can also look forward to a release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hitman-absolution">Hitman: Absolution</a> on Switch later this year, with a Switch 2 release to follow in 2026.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">You’ve heard what we think of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ninja-gaiden-4">Ninja Gaiden 4</a> — <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ninja-gaiden-4-the-final-preview">from an expert point of view</a>. But what if you’ve never played a Ninja Gaiden game before? Will this latest entry in the notoriously difficult action series offer newcomers something they can get to grips with? Will the story make sense if you don’t know your Ryu Hayabusas from your Yakumos?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That was my angle of attack going into my gamescom 2025 session with Team Ninja's Masakazu Hirayama and PlatinumGames' Yuji Nakao, co-directors on this eye-catching new co-production from Xbox Game Studios. As Nakao expertly dispatched a boss on a big screen overlooking our behind closed doors presentation, I couldn’t help but marvel at the slick, fast-paced ninja action I was seeing. But I also felt intimidated. I’m no stranger to action games; I love Capcom’s Devil May Cry series, for example, but I know Ninja Gaiden operates on a whole other level.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I also know that Microsoft, which is publishing Ninja Gaiden 4, hopes that that this latest entry appeals not just to hardcore fans of the franchise, but to the wider action game fanbase. That it will, essentially, convince the likes of me to give it a shot. And so my line of questioning is probably a little different compared to what you’ve already seen from the illustrious Ninja Gaiden experts IGN has on-staff. Read on to find out how Team Ninja and PlatinumGames convinced this worrisome action game fan to give Ninja Gaiden 4 a shot.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: I'm a newcomer to the series. For people who have never played a Ninja Gaiden game before but have perhaps heard about it by reputation as a very difficult action game, will they be able to get some enjoyment out of this, or is this very much aimed at people who are veterans of the series who know how to play?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Masakazu Hirayama:</strong> So with Ninja Gaiden 4, first and foremost we wanted to stay true to the tradition of intense combat. But with that said, it has been quite a while since the last mainline Ninja Gaiden came out, and we also want to make sure that a wide audience can approach our game and enjoy it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So to that end, we've prepared not only difficulty options, but other features for those new players. In terms of difficulty settings, there is a mode called Hero Mode. So when you choose Hero Mode, it'll automatically enable a number of assists. So these assists include Auto Guard, Auto Dodge, and another assist that allow you to perform more complicated actions, moves more easily. And these individual assists, once you select Hero Mode, you're not stuck with the assist. You can actually go into the menu at any time and toggle them on and off individually.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So if you start out in Hero Mode and then you feel like, oh, I want to start dodging manually now instead of having automatic dodge, you can go to the menu and toggle it off and see how you fare. But not only that, the difficulty settings themselves in your first play through, you can freely change between hero mode, normal mode, and hard mode.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So for example, you start your game on hero mode with all the assists. After you beat the first chapter, you turn off the assists, and then after you beat the next chapter, you feel like you've developed as a player and it's getting too easy. You can go to the menu, change to normal, and then after that, if you feel like you need more of a challenge, you can go back and change it to hard, and then you can adjust it on the fly. So you can really curate your combat experience based on your progression as a player.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So for newcomers who may feel like this game might be too difficult for them, I want to assure them that the tools are available for them to train themselves and allow them to progress as a player and enjoy that core intensity of the combat while also providing that tools to allow them to progress through the game.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: And for newcomers who aren't familiar with Ninja Gaiden but are perhaps familiar with the action game genre, what sets Ninja Garden apart? What are its signature mechanics that other games in the genre perhaps don't have?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Yuji Nakao:</strong> Ninja Gaiden is a series that has been developed by Team Ninja up until now. One of the main characteristics that sets apart Ninja Gaiden from other action games is just that feeling you get when you're gripping the controller in the sense of precision and responsiveness. Ninja Garden has an intricate feeling of control, but at the same time it's elegant and precise, and that's what really sets it apart.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And since this is a collaborative effort — it's not just Team Ninja, it’s PlatinumGames that’s developing the game — PlatinumGames has injected their own flavor into Ninja Gaiden 4. And that's best represented in the Bloodraven form, which is the main new system in Ninja Gaiden 4, where Yakumo can unleash these over the top, really expressive attacks. Ninja Gaiden 4 fuses that over the top expression with that elegant precision of a Ninja Gaiden.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: On the story, this is Ninja Gaiden 4, so newcomers will be aware this will be the fourth mainline game in the series. Do you feel that newcomers will be able to understand the story without having played the previous games in the series, or would they benefit from catching up? And how does the story differ from what's gone before? What do you hope to achieve with the story this time around?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Hirayama:</strong> New players can rest assured that they can just jump into Ninja Gaiden 4 and enjoy the story from the jump. It's not directly connected to the prior games. The world and the setting is the same, but the story itself stands alone. So as long as you know that Ryu Hayabusa is the badass ninja, then you're good to go with Ninja Gaiden 4.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: You mentioned previously that it's been some time since the last mainline Ninja Gaiden game. What have you been able to achieve with this game that was impossible before that makes use of all the new technology that has been created since then? </strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Nakao:</strong> In prior Ninja Gaidens you weren't able to seamlessly switch your weapons on the fly. With the new technology and the new hardware that's available, we're actually able to realize that, which really opens up the possibilities in combat.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And then another point is how violence is depicted. So Ninja Gaiden 4, as well as other prior Ninja Gaidens, when you dismember an enemy and you cut into them and there's blood splatters, we were really able to amp that up in Ninja Gaiden 4 and provide an even more elevated sense of satisfaction and catharsis when you are devastating your enemies.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Ninja Gaiden 4: June 2025 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: You’re collaborating with Platinum this time for Ninja Gaiden 4. What made Platinum the perfect choice? What is it that they bring to the table that's unique that no other developer perhaps could?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Masakazu Hirayama:</strong> PlatinumGames, they have a lot of accomplishments in the action game genre, and they're really known for their expressive stylish action. So with Ninja Gaiden 4, because it's a collaborative effort, we really wanted to allow PlatinumGames to bring that to the table in development. And we previously touched on Bloodraven form — we think Bloodraven form is the best representation of how we were able to incorporate it. But not just incorporate it for the sake of adding new things, really incorporating it into the foundation of Ninja Gaiden, so it doesn't just exist on top of it, but it exists within it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Why was now the right time to make a new Ninja Gaiden mainline entry? How will Ninja Gaiden 4 expand the audience for Ninja Gaiden as a whole so it is more popular than it has been in the past?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Hirayama:</strong> In terms of the timing of bringing a new Ninja Gaiden into the world, it wasn't necessarily that we wanted this to happen right now. It was more the result of a series of events.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At Team Ninja we had wanted to make a new Ninja Gaiden for quite a long time. And when that opportunity started to present itself, there was a conversation that took place between the president of Koei Tecmo, Hisashi Koinuma, and the president of PlatinumGames, Atsushi Inaba. They're actually friends, and they were talking about, wouldn't it be great if we could work on something in the future? That's when the idea of creating a new Ninja Gaiden together came up. And then Phil Spencer from Xbox caught wind of this idea and just threw his support behind the project. That's what got it off the ground. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Like you said, it's been a long time since the last Ninja Gaiden game. To the end of providing a fresh entry point for new players, we introduced a new protagonist. This protagonist was a proposal from PlatinumGames, actually. And I think we were able to allow PlatinumGames to really incorporate their own take on Ninja Gaiden through Yakumo.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But of course, Ryu Hayabusa is the icon of the series, so we've also made sure that Ryu Hayabusa is playable and has a strong presence in the game as well. So I think through this collaborative effort we've been able to provide a fresh experience, but it still feels like Ninja Gaiden, and it will be a fresh entry point for new players.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Why did you accept the proposal for a new protagonist from PlatinumGames, and what exactly is it about this new character that sets him apart from Ryu Hayabusa?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Hirayama:</strong> In terms of the reason why we accepted Platinum's proposal to bring a new protagonist, it was really what I touched upon earlier: providing that fresh entry point for new players, but also because this is a collaborative effort, really allowing PlatinumGames to bring their own ideas to the table. And Yakumo was a vehicle to allow that to happen.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Nakao:</strong> So with Ryu Hayabusa, he really retains his distinct qualities from the prior games. In Ninja Gaiden 4, he's really all about that power and that sense of speed. So when you're playing as Ryu Hayabusa in Ninja Gaiden 4, you can really experience that raw, primitive Ninja Gaiden experience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Contrasting with Ryu, Yakumo has this savviness. There's a cleverness to the way he fights with his arsenal, and he also has those more expressive combat techniques through the Bloodraven<strong> </strong>form. And through that he has this stylish take of the Ninja Gaiden combat.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So even though they both share the Ninja Gaiden fundamentals, there's this very distinct difference that you will feel when you are picking up the controller and pressing the buttons and seeing how they respond to those inputs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: And what is the split in terms of play time, roughly? Is there one character we will spend more time with than the other?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Hirayama:</strong> In terms of the story, Yakumo is the protagonist, so the playtime split, Yakumo will have more playtime. So more than half of the story you'll be playing as Yakumo. With that said, there are dedicated segments in the story for Ryu. And you won't be playing as Ryu Hayabusa just for a short time and then you'll be done with it. There'll be a very robust amount of content for you to enjoy playing as Ryu.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And once you complete the story once, you'll actually unlock a chapter challenge mode. This will allow you to freely play different chapters in the game and you'll be able to play as either character. So you could, after your first playthrough, play through all the chapters as Ryu. Conversely, you could play Ryu’s story chapters as Yakumo. So there's a lot of content that you can enjoy after you do your first playthrough.</p><div id="xbox-games-series-tier-list" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Xbox Games Series Tier List</h3><h3>Xbox Games Series Tier List</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: I’d love to know your favorite new mechanic we’ve not seen in a Ninja Gaiden game before.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Hirayama:</strong> My favorite new aspect is the Bloodraven form. So Bloodraven form, it really captures the new kind of expressiveness that PlatinumGames has brought to the table in Ninja Gaiden. But not only that, there was a lot of back and forth with regards to Bloodraven form throughout the development of this game. So Team Ninja would get the build from Platinum and then play the game and provide their feedback. But a year ago Bloodraven form was just so OP, like as long as you activated Bloodraven form, you could really just defeat any enemy. And we were looking at it as like, well if Bloodraven form dominates everything, we're going to lose the Ninja Gaiden essence. And there was a lot of interesting back and forth that we went through to arrive where we're at today.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You’ll see that when we were incorporating Bloodraven form into the Ninja Guide game cycle. For example, when you use Bloodraven form and you attack an enemy, it'll increase the likelihood of doing a dismemberment. When you dismember an enemy in Ninja Gaiden, you can perform an Obliteration Technique. Obliteration Technique is basically just a finisher, like an execution style attack. And then once you execute an enemy, they'll drop a blood orb essence. Essence was in previous Ninja Gaidens, and it basically functions the same way in Ninja Gaiden 4. And then once that essence drops, you convert it into an Ultimate Technique using Ultimate Guidance. I know I’m throwing a lot of terminology at you! But we were able to bring this Bloodraven form into Ninja Gaiden and really incorporate it into that foundational Ninja Gaiden game cycle. Finding ways of exploring that was very interesting from a development perspective.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Nakao:</strong> In addition to the Bloodraven form, there's also the base form. Within the base form I feel like we've been able to evolve Ninja Gaiden in terms of the new type of techniques that are available. Ninja Gaiden 4 introduces Just Guards and Just Dodges. In Ninja Gaiden, the dodging move is called the Reverse Wind. In Ninja Gaiden 4 you can actually do a Just Dodge Reverse Wind. And this really opens up the variety and possibilities of Ninja Gaiden’s combat and serves to continue to evolve that high speed back and forth between offense and defense that really makes Ninja Gaiden distinct.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Hirayama:</strong> And building on the new possibilities that are available in Ninja Gaiden 4, sometimes you'll see enemies glow up in red when they're about to unleash a powerful attack. You can actually use Bloodraven form to counter that attack using an offensive ability. This especially becomes apparent in the boss battles, where you can not just be defensive, but you can actually use aggression to counter enemy attacks. And because of that, Ninja Gaiden 4’s boss battles especially feel very distinct and provide a new kind of intensity compared to our previous entries.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ninja Gaiden 4 launches on October 21 on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.
