              <p>Whenever my kids get stuck playing a game, they run around the house yelling for me to help them. Doesn’t matter where I am or what I’m doing. Making dinner, taking out the trash, going to the bathroom, nowhere is safe. I patiently try to explain to them that back in my day, there was no grownup to help me beat Snake Man in <em>Mega Man 3</em> or find Excalibur in <em>Final Fantasy IV</em>. I just had to bash my head against the wall until I figured it out or give up until I got older.</p> <p>They never find this paternal wisdom satisfactory, so there I am finding them Zonai devices in <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em> or turning off damage in the <em>Minecraft</em> settings menu like a personal accessibility assistant. Will they do the same for their children? They might not have to. New AI “ghosts” might be able to do everything in the game for them. The games will, on command, be able to play themselves. Perfect for grinding crypto-currency in the Roblox mines while the oceans rise. RIP my future grandchildren.</p>

 <p>A Sony patent for these AI ghosts has been making the rounds online today. As <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sony-ai-patent-will-see-playstation-games-play-themselves-when-players-are-stuck/">reported by <em>VG</em>C</a>, the September 2024 registration documents which were publicized earlier this week reveal a technology that would allow people to get AI to help them beat games. These AI “ghost players” would be trained on existing game footage and either demonstrate the solution to an obstacle (“Guide Mode”) or beat it entirely (“Complete Mode”).</p>

 <p>It’s not clear from the patent whether Sony actually plans to move forward with this new AI help tool now or in the future. People have <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ramiismail.com/post/3mbr3vakjwk2p">made jokes online</a> about how bad current AI is at hallucinating gameplay, showing you something that looks normal enough before shifting into surreal nightmare fuel just moments later. There are also concerns about how the AI “helper” would be trained, which would <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/moomanibe.bsky.social/post/3mbrpdt63tk2f">seemingly include</a> footage shared on social media and YouTube.</p> <div><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:7zpntsbraj7cbishj4haru2v/app.bsky.feed.post/3mbr7p6eg3c2k" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreigfbv6ihj3s732hiqdpwh2lfogthvvzvuz7ldy26pot2thmypli3a"> <p lang="en">the point of a movie is not to be done watching it. the point of a song is not to be done listening to it. the gamers' obsession with completion as the only motivator to play a game has directly led to the medium's worst traits. "AI gaming ghost" is a reflection of the lack of willingness to engage</p> <p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:7zpntsbraj7cbishj4haru2v?ref_src=embed">funbil (@funbil.bsky.social)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:7zpntsbraj7cbishj4haru2v/post/3mbr7p6eg3c2k?ref_src=embed">2026-01-06T14:58:57.706Z</a></p></blockquote></div>  <p>Gaming has a long history of companies trying to help players overcome the difficulty that they themselves designed into their games. In the past there were hotlines and strategy manuals. More recently, companies have tried to embed guides directly into the games. <a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-ps5-community-game-help-1851366566">Game Help on PlayStation 5</a> shows you videos of how other players have completed a particular section of a game. It’s a neat idea whose implementation is messy and incomplete. Microsoft is trying to go a step further and embed <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-ai-copilot-minecraft-overwatch-insider-microsoft-1851769746">its Copilot AI</a> into games to offer chatbot-style assistance as an overlay like a new version of <a href="https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-life-death-microsoft-clippy-paper-clip-loved-hate">Clippy</a>.</p>

 <p>Tools like this could be a boon for helping more people enjoy games or at least “unstuck” themselves before bouncing off in a fit of boredom or frustration. But there’s also a <em>Black Mirror</em> version where all of the friction of actually playing a game is offloaded to AI agents entirely. How many games would be improved by adding a skip button that lets you fast-forward your progression by 20 seconds or 20 minutes? How many games would you stop playing entirely if you could offload the drudgery entirely?</p>

 <h2>AI ghosts grinding AI optimized battle passes</h2> <p>Players love to optimize strategies and get one over on the games they’re playing. Sometimes that means doing a lot of work to grind as effectively as possible or craft the most broken build. Other times it means wrapping a rubber-band around an analog stick and going to sleep while the game does all the work for you. What would it be like to play <em>Diablo 4</em> if those builds you had to look up online were automatically recommended inside the skill tree menu?</p>

 <p>What would be the point if at any time you could put the mouse and keyboard down and let an AI agent, trained on YouTube or even your own play history, take the wheel and grind until all of that hyper-rare loot finally drops? Not everyone would go for it. Maybe some would. We already know <a href="https://kotaku.com/elon-musk-poe2-diablo-4-paid-boosting-fake-controversy-1851743670">what choice Elon Musk would make</a>.</p>

 <p>Experience-based games would probably be safe. The ones where you’re there for player choice or the story, though even fans of things like <em>Dispatch</em> might be tempted to have someone else handle all of the less engaging mini-games. Multiplayer games have faced an ongoing arms race with cheaters for years. Who wouldn’t be tempted to take credit for a duos Battle Royale win pulled off by their AI counterpart? None of this is in the Sony patent for AI help, but it’s all in the same Pandora’s box.</p> <p>In fact, some of the most popular games of the past few years play with automating the player’s role to some degree until they are irrelevant to the outcome. That’s what made people obsessed with <em>Vampire Survivors</em>. It’s what helped <em>Ball X Pit</em> sell over a million copies. It’s what made <em>Megabonk</em> so popular, it ended up being nominated for an award at the Game Awards that the developer had to recuse himself from. Some games call upon us to embrace the moment-to-moment drudgery of simulated work. Others lure us with the siren’s call of participating in a high-score chase where the big reward <a href="https://kotaku.com/ball-x-pit-vampire-survivors-balatro-roguelike-2000642155">is seeing our own participation incrementally diminished</a>.</p> <p>In 20 years, even that concept might sound as alien to my grandkids as calling something a “button masher.” By then, the computers will no doubt be able to read the inputs directly from their minds. What the AI chooses to do with those, well, that’s anybody’s guess.</p>

              <p>Good news! Amazon is doing its 3 for $33 4K UHD Blu-Ray sale <a href="https://kotaku.com/amazon-4k-uhd-bluray-sale-godzilla-joker-3-for-33-deal-1851777167">again</a>. If you’ve been wanting to build up a physical collection of your favorite movies (or grow your current collection), you should take advantage of this deal before stuff starts selling out.</p> <p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/wario64.bsky.social/post/3mbr2skj6dk2h">As spotted by deals guru Wario64,</a> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/promotion/psp/A118PVMFHMZXZ1?tag=kotaku01-20">Amazon is once again offering up 4K UHD movies for just $11 each</a>. The catch? You have to buy at least three for the deal to kick in. But, once you have three in your cart, you can just keep adding movies, and they each only cost $11. Want 7 4K UHD movies? That will be $77. That’s a heck of a deal considering a new 4K UHD movie can cost upwards of $20 or $30 normally.</p>

 <p>Before you start buying these movies, remember you’ll need a UHD player to watch any of these 4K UHD films. Your PS5 and Xbox Series X are solid UHD players, assuming they have disc slots and you are using the correct HDMI cable. You’ll also want a 4K TV, too. With that all out of the way, here are some of the newer UHD movies currently on sale on Amazon, as well as some classics.</p>

 <h2>New Movies On Sale</h2> <ul> <li><em>F1 The Movie</em></li> <li><em>Jurassic World Rebirth</em></li> <li><em>Superman</em></li> <li><em>Wicked</em></li> <li><em>1917</em></li> <li><em>Megan 2.0</em></li> <li><em>Nobody 2</em></li> <li><em>Fall Guy</em></li> <li><em>How To Train Your Dragon (2025)</em></li> <li><em>Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire</em></li> <li><em>A Minecraft Movie</em></li> <li><em>Nope</em></li> </ul> <h2>Older Movies</h2> <ul> <li><em>The Maltese Falcon</em></li> <li><em>American Pie</em></li> <li><em>Twister</em></li> <li><em>The Lost Boys</em></li> <li><em>Purple Rain</em></li> <li><em>The Blues Brothers</em></li> <li><em>Van Helsing</em></li> <li><em>Schindler’s List</em></li> <li><em>Vertigo</em></li> <li><em>Scarface</em></li> <li><em>Harvey</em></li> <li><em>The Matrix</em></li> <li><em>The Shining</em></li> <li><em>Animal House</em></li> </ul> <p>Who’s bothering with movie discs in 2026? Well, for starters, anyone who wants to actually have control over their media library and not be subject to the curatorial whims and constant price increases of streaming platforms. Also, solving the question of what to watch by walking over and staring at a shelf is so much more satisfying than scrolling an endless list of bad algorithmic recommendations.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/fallout-new-vegas-ending-cut-content-yes-man-2000657243</link>
            <guid>1398913</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>We’ve known for </span><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/chris-avellone-explains-what-happened-to-fallout-new-vegass-post-game"><span>some time now</span></a><span> that developer Obsidian Entertainment was forced to cut </span><i><span>Fallout: New Vegas’</span></i><span> post-game content during its development. But now, thanks to the data found on a recently unearthed Xbox 360 dev kit, we can finally take a look at what some of that scrapped content would have entailed. It turns out that a more sinister conclusion to Yes Man’s story once existed after the credits rolled.</span></p> <p><span>Regardless of who you side with during the Second Battle of Hoover Dam, there’s no squeaky-clean, morally sound conclusion to </span><i><span>Fallout: New Vegas</span></i><span>. Going with Caesar’s Legion is the objectively cruel choice, yes, but the NCR aren’t exactly saints either. Another option is siding with Yes Man. It’s the closest thing </span><i><span>Fallout: New Vegas</span></i><span> has to a good ending. Choosing Yes Man, the overtly amenable Securitron that has been forcibly modified by antagonist Benny, is akin to siding with no one, as the peppy robot will gladly carry out whatever orders you give it.</span></p>

 <p><span>Exactly whose side Yes Man is ultimately on has been a topic of debate for </span><i><span>New Vegas</span></i><span> fans since the game was released, and discussion surrounding his allegiances (or lack thereof) has </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/1q0vcia/new_vegas_canon_ending_theory_yes_mans/"><span>once again intensified</span></a><span> following the reappearance of Mr House’s Securitron, Victor, in the second season of the </span><i><span>Fallout </span></i><span>TV series.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Following the New Vegas tease at the end of the first season, fans have been theorizing about which of the game’s endings is now the “canon” ending. Comments made by project director Josh Sawyer and the aforementioned cut content have led some to believe that siding with Yes Man may indeed be </span><i><span>Fallout: New Vegas’</span></i><span> true ending.</span></p>

 <p><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fallout/fallout-new-vegas-lead-writer-loved-writing-yes-man-but-thinks-his-questline-may-have-been-a-mistake-it-lets-you-get-through-the-game-without-getting-your-hands-dirty/"><i><span>PC Gamer</span></i></a><span> recently interviewed </span><i><span>Fallout: New Vegas’</span></i><span> lead writer John Gonzalez, who stated that he believes offering players a “rebellious, individualistic” path with Yes Man, </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fotv/comments/1munso2/reminder_the_yes_man_ending_to_fnv_only_exists_so/"><span>one in which they don’t have to pick a faction to ally with</span></a><span>, might have actually been a misstep on Obsidian’s part. “I think that questline may have been a mistake, because it lets you get through the game without getting your hands dirty,” Gonzalez said.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>Despite Gonzalez’s comments, however, the ending to Yes Man’s path does imply that you may have still gotten your hands at least a little dirty. After you dispatch Legate Lanius, who serves as the second-in-command of Caesar’s Legion and is one of two potential boss fights during your fight to retake Hoover Dam, there are implications that the robot takes quite a heel turn. Yes Man informs the player that they’ll be “going off-line” to “reprogram” their personality, and their comment about becoming more “assertive” in the process may imply that Yes Man no longer wishes to take commands from the player; a scary thought, considering they now control an army of machine gun-wielding robots. Still, considering how jovial the exchange is, you’re left with enough wiggle room in your interpretation to read the choice as fairly neutral from a moral standpoint, and there’s ultimately no way to know the true outcome, considering the end credits roll immediately after this conversation ends.</span></p>

 <p><span>But based on recently discovered cut dialogue ripped from a Beta build of </span><i><span>Fallout: New Vegas</span></i><span>, it seems that Yes Man may have played a much darker role in the originally planned post-game.</span></p> <p><span>On November 26th of last year, </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yfp9pfxnqz4"><span>Games’ Past</span></a><span> uploaded a video detailing the discovery of two prototype builds of </span><i><span>Fallout: New Vegas</span></i><span>, found on an Xbox 360 dev kit in a store in Utah. Games’ Past also uploaded the contents of the dev kits online, and modders managed to uncover and restore a wealth of previously unseen cut content from the builds.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>As detailed in a separate video by </span><a href="https://discord.com/channels/@me/1458090158170570805/1458139450071847004"><span>Alternative Gaming Channel</span></a><span>, dozens of post-game lines of dialogue were hidden in these prototype builds. The cut Yes Man dialogue is particularly interesting, with him outright telling the player character to “fuck off” if you choose to respond negatively to an announcement he makes about his new “assertive” personality.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>Another cut Yes Man line is even more chilling, with the generally chipper robot talking about slaughtering </span><i><span>New Vegas</span></i><span>’ civilians and “using their blood and their skins” to “decorate the Securitrons.”. He does shout “Exterminate!” afterwards, though, so hopefully it was just a goofy little </span><i><span>Doctor Who</span></i><span> reference that could only be triggered with the Wild Wasteland perk. In any case, it seems that helping Yes Man might be just as morally damning as the rest of New Vegas’ endings, which may explain why the Mojave’s future isn’t looking too bright in the TV series.&nbsp;</span></p>

    <div>
                      
                      
          <p>For the first time in years, Nvidia declined to introduce new GeForce graphics card models at CES. CEO Jensen Huang’s characteristically sprawling and under-rehearsed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/0NBILspM4c4?si=XYiz9rxj0iK5LXI0&amp;t=6206">90-minute keynote</a> focused almost entirely on the company’s dominant AI business, relegating the company’s gaming-related announcements to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Foltcapx62E">a separate video posted later in the evening</a>.</p>
<p>Instead, the company focused on software improvements for its existing hardware. The biggest announcement in this vein is DLSS 4.5, which adds a handful of new features to Nvidia’s basket of upscaling and frame generation technologies.</p>
<p>DLSS upscaling is being improved by a new “second-generation transformer model” that Nvidia says has been “trained on an expanded data set” to improve its predictions when generating new pixels. According to Nvidia’s Bryan Catanzaro, this is particularly beneficial for image quality in the Performance and Ultra Performance modes, where the upscaler has to do more guessing because it’s working from a lower-resolution source image.</p>
<p>DLSS Multi-Frame Generation is also improving, increasing the number of AI-generated frames per rendered frame from three to five. This new 6x mode for DLSS MFG is being paired with something called Dynamic Multi-Frame Generation, where the number of AI-generated frames can dynamically change, increasing generated frames during “demanding scenes,” and decreasing the number of generated frames during simpler scenes “so it only computes what’s needed.”</p>
<p>The standard caveats for Multi-Frame Generation still apply: It still needs an RTX 50-series GPU (the 40-series can still only generate one frame for every rendered frame, and older cards can’t generate extra frames at all), and the game still needs to be running at a reasonably high base frame rate to minimize lag and weird rendering artifacts. It remains a useful tool for making fast-running games run faster, but it won’t help make an unplayable frame rate into a playable one.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>To Nvidia’s credit, the new DLSS 4.5 transformer model runs on GeForce 20- and 30-series GPUs, giving users of older-but-still-usable graphics cards access to the improved upscaling. But Nvidia said that owners of those GPUs would see more of a performance hit from enabling DLSS 4.5 than users of GeForce 40- and 50-series cards would, and initial testing from some outlets seems to be bearing that out. Compared to the DLSS 4.0 transformer model, Mostly Positive Reviews <a href="https://x.com/mpr_reviews/status/2008449637200367930">found</a> that the new DLSS 4.5 model reduced performance on an RTX 3080 Ti by between 14 and 24 percent depending on the game and the settings, though performance is still presumably better than it would be on the same card if you tried to run those games at native resolutions.</p>
<p>The DLSS 4.5 transformer model is available now, <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/drivers/results/">after a driver update</a>, and you can use the Nvidia App to select the new transformer model in games that already support DLSS upscaling (whether the option appears in any in-game menus remains up to the game developer). The Multi-Frame Generation updates will be available sometime in spring 2026.</p>
<p>One feature that hasn’t broken cover yet? Nvidia’s Reflex 2, an update to its input lag reduction technology <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/reflex-2-even-lower-latency-gameplay-with-frame-warp/">that the company announced at CES last year</a>. Upscaling and frame generation technologies generally, something that Reflex helps to offset, and the company claimed an up to 75 percent reduction in lag when using Reflex 2 on a 50-series card. But Nvidia didn’t mention Reflex 2 this year, and hasn’t provided any updates on when it might be released.</p>
<h2>Why no GPUs?</h2>

<p>In another era, CES 2026 would have been a good time to introduce a 50-series Super update, a mid-generation spec bump to keep the lineup fresh while Nvidia works on whatever will become the GeForce 60-series. The company used CES 2024 to launch <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/geforce-rtx-4080-4070-ti-4070-super-gpu/">the RTX 40-series Super cards</a>, helping improve the value proposition for a bunch of cards that had launched at prices many reviewers and users grumbled about.</p>

        <div>
          
          
<p>Indeed, the rumor mill <a href="https://www.tweaktown.com/news/106675/geforce-rtx-50-super-series-on-track-for-holiday-2025-release/index.html">suggested</a> that Nvidia was working on a 50-series Super refresh for the 2025 holiday season, and its biggest improvement was going to be a 50 percent bump in RAM capacity, said to be possible because of a switch from 2GB RAM chips to 3GB chips. This would have given the theoretical 5070 Super 18GB of RAM, and the 5070 Ti Super and 5080 Super were said to have 24GB of memory.</p>
<p>Assuming those rumors are correct, those plans could have been dashed by <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/12/for-just-a-couple-of-months-in-the-middle-of-2025-it-was-an-ok-time-to-build-a-pc/">the abrupt RAM shortages and price spikes</a> that started late last year. These have been caused at least in part by sky-high demand for RAM from AI data centers; given that modern-day Nvidia is mainly an AI company that sells consumer GPUs on the side, it stands to reason that the company would allocate all the RAM it can get to its more profitable AI GPUs, rather than a mid-generation GeForce refresh.</p>
<p>In fact, none of the major dedicated GPU manufacturers has introduced new products at CES this year. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/01/amd-reheats-last-years-ryzen-ai-and-x3d-cpus-for-2026s-laptops-and-desktops/">AMD</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/01/intel-launches-core-ultra-series-3-cpus-made-using-its-long-awaited-18a-process/">Intel</a> announced products with improved integrated GPUs, which use system RAM rather than requiring their own. But there wasn’t a peep about any new dedicated Radeon cards, and Intel hasn’t introduced a new dedicated Arc graphics card in almost a year, despite some signs that <a href="https://www.techpowerup.com/344664/intel-arc-battlemage-b770-spotted-in-more-software-libraries-launch-imminent">a midrange Arc B770 card</a> exists and could be nearly ready to launch.</p>

              <p>For many people, <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-metroid-prime-4-mario-120fps-perfomance-mode-2000650994">a steady level of performance</a>–no framerate dips or slowdown–is an important part of any video game. But what if it was <em>the most</em> important part of a game, such that if your performance tanked, you’d die? That’s the elevator pitch for <em>FPS Quest</em>, an upcoming first-person shooter that looks wild.</p> <p><a href="https://youtu.be/yxewel3xAOQ"><em>FPS Quest</em></a> starts off as a fantasy RPG with skeletons and knights in armor. But after getting their ass kicked one too many times, the game’s protagonist installs some mods that them decidedly non-fantasy weapons like a pistol, an assault rifle, and a shotgun. The game within the game wasn’t built to handle these mods, however, so from there, things start to break, and<em> FPS Quest</em> becomes all about playing through a game that is falling apart while also trying to avoid a crash, which will kill you.</p>

  <p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3989240/FPS_Quest/">The game’s Steam store page</a> describes what sounds like a roguelike shooter in which you go on different runs through “prebuilt but recombined levels” that get more corrupted and glitchy as you progress. To keep the game from crashing, you can do things like lower the in-game graphics, use in-game mods to remove geometry, and escape out of bounds into unfinished or leftover bits of the game world. It’s a trippy but cool idea for a game that has me very intrigued.</p> <p>One thing the game’s developers make clear on Steam is that <em>FPS Quest</em> doesn’t actually run at a lower framerate, which can cause problems and make people feel sick. Instead, it simulates playing a game at a low FPS. That’s good to know. <em>FPS Quest</em> doesn’t have a release date yet, but I’ve already added it to my wishlist and can’t wait to play.</p>

			<p>For fans of sports games and racing games, there are a few titles they can expect to see each year. EA and 2K will always give sports game fans and racing game fans something to play. But for 2026, thankfully there's a bit more to look forward to than just your regular annualized titles.</p>



<p>It's an especially good year for racing fans, who have the return of a major franchise to look forward to, and a new high-speed, sci-fi racer that could very well surprise everyone to be one of the best arcade racing games to come around in a while.</p>



<p>If the following games meet their expectations, you might see them again when we do our 'Best of 2026' picks at the end of the year. For now, these are the sports and racing games we're most anticipating in 2026.</p>



<p><em>Other Wccftech's Most Anticipated 2026 Games per category:</em> <em><strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-role-playing-games-of-2026-legends-and-legacies/">Role-Playing Games</a></strong></em>, <strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-indie-games-of-2026/">Indie Games</a></em></strong>, <strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-platformers-of-2026-new-adventures-in-familiar-worlds/">Platformers</a></em></strong>, <strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-dlc-expansion-of-2026/">DLC/Expansion</a></em></strong>, <strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-action-games-of-2026-martial-artists-spies-super-heroes-and-criminals/">Action Games</a></em></strong>,<a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-shooter-games-2026-the-year-of-xbox-studios/"> <em><strong>Shooters</strong></em></a>, <strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-horror-games-of-2026-a-new-era-of-dread/">Horror</a></em></strong></p>



<h2 id="h-forza-horizon-6-tbc-2026-pc-xbox-series-x-s">Forza Horizon 6 (TBC 2026 - PC, Xbox Series X/S)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Forza-Horizon-6.png"></a><figcaption><em>Forza Horizon 6. Image credit: Playground Games.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Forza Horizon 6 may not have been the surprise reveal <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-6-is-coming-to-pc-xbox-consoles-in-2026/">Xbox wanted it to be at Tokyo Game Show 2025</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-6-tokyo-game-show-2025-japan-setting/">due to it leaking</a> about a month ahead of the show, but it was still exciting to see nonetheless. Forza Horizon 5 is arguably one of the biggest racing games released in the past decade, and its follow-up looks set to surpass its predecessor in every way.</p>



<p>We still don't know a lot about it, nor do we know when in 2026 it'll aim to be out, but <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-6-targeting-h1-2026-launch-window-says-insider/">recent reports point to it being an early 2026 release</a>. Hopefully, those reports are correct, and we'll be able to head to Japan in Forza Horizon 6 sooner rather than later.</p>



<h2 id="h-mario-tennis-fever-february-12-2026-nintendo-switch-2">Mario Tennis Fever (February 12, 2026 - Nintendo Switch 2)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Mario-Tennis-Fever.png"></a><figcaption><em>Mario Tennis Fever. Image credit: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Mario's line of sports games can be hit and miss (pun intended). Sometimes, they're excellently crafted and amazingly replayable, particularly with a few friends huddled around one TV. Super Mario Strikers on Nintendo Wii comes to mind when I think of some Mario sports games that were way more fun than they had any right to be.</p>



<p>Mario Tennis Aces, the last game in the Mario Tennis series, does not fall in the same category as Strikers, but Mario Tennis Fever, the next game in the series <a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-tennis-fever-launch-february-2026-nintendo-switch-2/">due out on February 12, 2026, on Nintendo Switch 2</a>, just might. At least we can hope it will, since Mario is due for a fun arcade-y sports game.</p>



<h2 id="h-star-wars-galactic-racer-tbc-2026-pc-ps5-xbox-series-x-s">Star Wars: Galactic Racer (TBC 2026 - PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Star-Wars-Galactic-Racer.png"></a><figcaption><em>Star Wars Galactic Racer. Image credit: Fuse Games</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>'Now this is pod racing,' is what every Star Wars fan watching<a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-galactic-racer-the-game-awards-2025-fuse-games/"> The Game Awards 2025 said to themselves when we all collectively realized a new Star Wars racing game was coming our way</a>. At least it would have been, if there were vehicles in the trailer that actually looked like pod racers. </p>



<p>But even a bit of confusion over the lack of the death traps that Little Ani used to win himself out of slavery can't stop the excitement buzzing around the fact that Star Wars: Galactic Racer is a new racing game from Fuse Games, a studio formed by former Need for Speed and Burnout developers. It's frankly the kind of match-made-in-heaven that is equivalent to <a href="https://wccftech.com/007-first-light-release-date-delayed-two-months-may-2026/">IO Interactive making a James Bond game</a>.</p>



<p>Hopefully, Star Wars: Galactic Racer is able to make a case for itself this year, and that when we talk about the best racing games of 2026 at the end of the year, Forza Horizon 6 has some company in the conversation.</p>



<h2 id="h-exo-rally-championship-tbc-2026-pc">Exo Rally Championship (TBC 2026 - PC)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Exo-Rally-Fest.png"></a><figcaption><em>Exo Rally Championship. Image credit: Exbleative</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Exo Rally Championship was one of our <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-sports-and-racing-games-of-2025-in-the-fast-lane/">honourable mentions for our most anticipated sports and racing games of 2025</a>, and a year later, not only are we still looking forward to it, but we've moved it up to one of our main five picks for the year. It might not have the brand recognition of the other sci-fi racers on this list, but this off-road arcade racer from developer Exbleative and publisher Future Friends Games is absolutely worth keeping on your radar.</p>



<p>There's no definitive sign as to when it'll arrive, but hopefully last year's Steam Next Fest demo was an indication that the team is making enough progress that it'll be out before the end of 2026.</p>



<h2 id="h-golf-with-your-friends-2-tbc-2026-pc">Golf With Your Friends 2 (TBC 2026 - PC)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Golf-With-Your-Friends-2.png"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: Radical Forge</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Ending our main picks with something fairly different from the rest, Golf With Your Friends 2 is the long-awaited sequel to Golf With Your Friends, a chaotic multiplayer golf game that arrived all the way back in 2016. </p>



<p>In the last decade, Golf With Your Friends has steadily maintained its popularity in such a way that it's sequel could become one of the year's flash-in-the-pan multiplayer games that breaks through and rides the waves of content creators playing it with their friends on livestreams. It might not reach the heights of games like <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3527290/PEAK/">Peak</a>, but it certainly feels like it has that kind of potential. </p>

And yet, it seems like the vast majority of players (at least in the US) spent most of their time playing the old hits on repeat, because the five most popular games on PlayStation last year were exactly the same as the year before.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This comes from Circana analyst Mat Piscatella, who <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3mbraw2dcfc2s" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shared on Bluesky today</a> the top five most-played games in the US on PlayStation for 2025:</p><ol data-cy="list"><li>Fortnite</li><li>Call of Duty</li><li>GTA V</li><li>Roblox</li><li>Minecraft</li></ol><p data-cy="paragraph">And for 2024:</p><ol data-cy="list"><li>Fortnite</li><li>Call of Duty</li><li>GTA V</li><li>Roblox</li><li>Minecraft</li></ol><p data-cy="paragraph">(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPpjLV77yTs" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">They're the same picture</a>.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The layout is different (I guess) on Xbox, with Minecraft and Roblox flipped for 2025, and a slightly more complicated order for 2024: Call of Duty at No. 1, then Fortnite, Minecraft, GTA V, Roblox. But uh, <em>same five games</em>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's a pretty damning indictment of the current state of the industry. As Piscatella said himself almost a year ago on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/lrPeLqcty4I" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kinda Funny Gamescast</a>, this is a fairly recent trend. As he explains, the COVID-19 pandemic prompted a surge in the video game audience, with huge numbers of people playing games who never had before. As a result, many of the major gaming markets effectively reached a cap on how many new players they can obtain in future years, because everyone was already there.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On top of that, that capped audience is now playing a smaller number of games overall. Some of that is just because games are getting more expensive. More people are gravitating toward live service games they're already familiar with where they can spend smaller amounts of money for a fun experience on a platform they already own, rather than spend larger amounts of money to try new things on new platforms.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But some of that is simply a natural consequence of the rise of live service. As Piscatella continues to explain, the way the market used to work is that players would buy one big new game, spend all their time on that, then move onto the next one. But people just aren't buying new games anymore.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"If you take the top ten service games every month...on PlayStation and Xbox, seven out of every ten people that turn on their console will play at least one of those games every month, and in terms of total time they're taking, those ten games alone every month take up 40% of total playtime on the consoles." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Piscatella also shares that at the time, Circana expected 30% of people that play video games would not buy a video game in 2025 (the actual numbers for the full year haven't been released just yet). A further 18% would purchase a new game every six months or less frequently.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Don't "Fly Away" from this interview.</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Last year, IO Interactive revealed that musician and singer Lenny Kravitz would be making his video game debut in 007: First Light – not as the singer of a film-like Bond Theme, but as an actual character in the game. Cast as Bawma, a charismatic pirate king with a mysterious edge, Kravitz's video game debut promises action, intrigue, and a dash of rockstar theatrics. I had the opportunity to speak with him about his role in the game, his decades-long love for the Bond films, and to try to glean a little bit more about his character’s role in this twist on a traditional Bond story.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Originally announced as “Project 007” in 2020, IO Interactive has started to loosen the valve on information about its upcoming game starring the international man of mystery. While we still haven’t had a chance to go hands-on with the project, it looks promising. Blending Hitman-style stealth-action with the globetrotting cinematic shine and sense of humor you’d expect from any silver screen adventure starring your pick of the actors who’ve held a license to kill, it feels appropriate that its villains would be larger than life, just like in the novels and films. That all starts with a bit of blockbuster stunt casting.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/06/knt-bawma-screenshot-3840x2160-1767730028977.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Lenny Kravitz as Bawma in 007: First Light.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Though he’s new to the series as an actor, Kravitz’s love for the James Bond movies as a fan goes back to his time lining up to see Roger Moore’s films in junior high and high school. “I used to line up on the first night it would be in the theater with a friend of mine,” the musician told me, making sure to pay lip service to his favorite leading men, Roger Moore and Sean Connery. “The theme songs were always amazing, too, always epic,” he told me, reminiscing on Carly Simon’s Nobody Does It Better from The Spy Who Loved Me before shouting out his favorites: Shirley Bassey’s iconic Goldfinger, Wings’ Live and Let Die, and Duran Duran’s A View To Kill.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Kravitz’s cool charisma and rockstar persona feel well-tuned for the role of a pirate king.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Kravitz’s cool charisma and rockstar persona feel well-tuned for the role of a pirate king. But he insists that he’s not just playing himself or sending up his favorite campy villains of bygone Bond films. Instead, he looked inward, drawing on his own experiences for inspiration. “I’ve met some folks that are… similar to his character. I grew up in the Bahamas as well as New York City and there were guys who had [Bawma’s] vibe and were doing similar things in the islands.” The musician told me the hardest part of playing Bawma was finding that voice and personality. “It’s really all in the voice,” he assured me. “It took a moment, but eventually we found the sweet spot.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But Kravitz isn’t just a prolific performer. He also brought some of his expertise as an icon in the fashion world to the character, even getting involved in giving notes to the art and design team, weighing in on Bawma’s costume as seen in his reveal trailer. From the cut of his jacket to the placement of tattoos and scars, the final design in the trailer was the result of deep collaboration between Kravitz and the IO Interactive team.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">During our conversation, Kravitz dropped a few hints that Bawma might not be an outright bad guy, though, painting him as more of a morally ambiguous antihero, rather than a straightforward villain. “He’s an interesting guy. We’re not quite sure how he’s going to turn.” IO Interactive CEO and 007 First Light Director Hakan Abrak told me, “We wanted more than just a one-sided villain, like we wanted to have some kind of charisma.” Abrak added that he’s not all-out evil, teasing, “He has more sides to him that could maybe turn out surprising in the story. You’ll need to wait to see that until the game comes out.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That depth played into IO’s casting for Bawma, Abrak told me. During early meetings, IOI realized they needed a performer who could captivate a crowd to fit the character they’d written. He told me, “The way Lenny moves, the way he draws sympathy and empathy kind of drags you in as a person” played a big role in pushing IO to choose the rockstar for this role.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Since these interviews, IO Interactive has announced that 007 First Light has been delayed from March 27, 2026, to May 27, 2026.

                <p>Balatro and Hollow Knight: Silksong "shouldn't exist," according to industry analyst Joost van Dreunen. He elaborated that, "They don't make rational sense financially, and yet somehow they are deeply loved." Their commercial viability is an undeniable fact. However, the scale of their success baffles industry conventional wisdom.</p><p dir="ltr">Van Drunen is professor at the NYU Stern School of Business and a strategic advisor for the community development agency ELO. In an interview with <a dir="ltr" href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/nobody-wants-ai-slop-joost-van-dreunen-on-the-future-of-ai-and-the-shifting-economics-of-the-games-industry" rel="noreferrer nofollow ">GameIndustry.biz</a>, van Dreunen discussed how the shifting macroeconomics of video games is creating space for smaller projects to become massive successes. He compares the shift to the way television challenged the Hollywood business model. Free-to-play games like Candy Crush compete with, and even undermine, big-budget blockbusters like GTA or Call of Duty. Yet, there are an increasing number of games that skirt outside either model, such as Silksong.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Hollow Knight: Silksong Review</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The lower-tech production values of some indie games may also be a big asset. Van Dreunen said, "I'm a big fan of the idea that low tech is a much more interesting design factor than high tech. I think, demonstrably, whenever new technology comes out, what studios tend to do is just increase the final product. They make it more complex, and therefore they negate the productivity gains." Perhaps Balatro and Silksong can be impressive with smaller budgets and development teams because they leverage the productivity shifts bigger studios would use to expand their efforts.</p><p dir="ltr">Furthermore, whatever the exact reasons, van Dreunen claimed that it's obvious people want smaller, engaging games at the same price point as Balatro or Silksong. Van Dreunen said, "I think increasingly it's clear that what people want is a $20 Silksong game that's challenging, but it doesn't have to make my eyes bleed in order for me to want it."</p><p dir="ltr"><a dir="ltr" href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-most-downloaded-app-store-games-of-2025-include-fortnite-minecraft-and-balatro/1100-6536838/">Balatro was one of the most downloaded App Store games in 2025</a>.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 - Nuketown 2025 Gameplay Trailer</p>
      </div>
<h2 dir="ltr">Season 1 Reloaded's Fallout collab</h2><p dir="ltr">Call of Duty has teased a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-is-crossing-over-with-fallout-tv-show-in-season-1-reloaded/1100-6537059/">crossover with Amazon Prime Video's Fallout TV show</a>, which seemingly includes operator skins for Lucy, The Ghoul, and Maximus. Call of Duty's big IP collaborations are also usually paired with in-game events for players to participate in. However, it's uncertain if these Fallout skins will be included in an event pass or as shop bundles for purchase. Notably, both Fallout and Call of Duty are owned by Microsoft. </p><h2 dir="ltr">Two new weapons</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4630786-sturmwolf452.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4630786" data-ratio="0.56234567901235" data-width="1620" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4630786-sturmwolf452.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4630786"></a><figcaption>Sturmwolf 45</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4630786-sturmwolf452.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The update adds the Hawker HX sniper rifle and the Sturmwolf 45 submachine gun as two new weapons players can unlock for free.</p><p dir="ltr">The Hawker HX is a renamed version of the popular Ballista sniper rifle from Black Ops 2.

It all comes from a familiar source that has been right in front of you this whole time: games!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Competitive games where speed and accuracy are important – like real-time strategy and fighting – can help us understand many different user experience concepts that can be applied to tools. Let’s go through a few of these concepts, and you might be surprised to find that you know more than you think!</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Real-time Strategy Games &amp; Chunking">Real-time Strategy Games &amp; Chunking</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">First, let’s look at how knowing real-time strategy games could mean that you might already understand the concept of chunking</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/book-excerpt-designing-the-user-experience-of-game-development-tools#_ftn1" data-discover="true">[1]</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="BoxeR the Brood War Champion">BoxeR the Brood War Champion</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One of the all-time greatest players of Starcraft: Brood War is BoxeR. Amongst the many skills of a professional Starcraft player is the ability to build exactly the right type and number of units to defend against an attack.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/danielle-riendeau-s-top-three-games-of-the-year-2025-wrap-up" target="_self" data-discover="true">Danielle Riendeau's top 3 games of the year - 2025 Wrap-Up</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Starcraft – like many great RTS games – has a “rock paper scissors” design where each unit is strong against certain units and weak against others. What this means is that if BoxeR’s opponents attack using units that are the equivalent of scissors, BoxeR quickly defends with units that are the equivalent of rock, not paper.</span></p><p>Figure B.1: StarCraft © Blizzard Entertainment</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For example, imagine that BoxeR’s opponent is playing Zerg and they attack with a combination of Mutalisks and Zerglings. This composition is so common that it has a nickname: “Mutaling”. When BoxeR sees this, they immediately start building Siege Tanks and Marines, since they are very effective units against that composition.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So, how is BoxeR able to do this so quickly? In large part, it is because of their ability to effectively use chunking.</span></p><p>Figure B.2: Photo by Nick Fewings on Unsplash</p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Chess and chunking">Chess and chunking</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One of the best demonstrations of chunking and games comes from a replication study</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/book-excerpt-designing-the-user-experience-of-game-development-tools#_ftn2" data-discover="true">[2]</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> done by the psychologists Christopher Chabris and Daniel Simons</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/book-excerpt-designing-the-user-experience-of-game-development-tools#_ftn3" data-discover="true">[3]</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In their study, they showed participants a series of cards, one at a time, each with a picture of a chess board with pieces in different positions. They would give the participants 30 seconds to study the card, and then take it away and ask them to place chess pieces on a real board from memory in the same positions as on the card they had just seen.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/game-developer-s-2025-wrap-up-bryant-francis-top-10-games" target="_self" data-discover="true">Bryant Francis' top 10 games of the year - 2025 Wrap-Up</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The skill level of the participants in the study ranged from novice players to grandmasters. For this reason, it might not surprise you to learn that, for certain cards, the grandmasters were much better than the novice players. However, you might not expect that for some other cards, the novices were equal to the grandmasters. How could that be possible?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The reason is that the cards where the grandmasters did better than the novices were cards of real games with plausible chess positions (left side of Figure B.3), and the cards where they were equal to the novices were cards where the chess pieces were randomly placed (right side of Figure B.3).&nbsp;</span></p><p>Figure B.3: Representations of the cards used in the chess study.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">From the perspective of the grandmasters, the boards on the cards are not made up of individual pieces but “clusters” of pieces in positions that they have seen in countless games of chess (left side of Figure B.4). Over time, these are internalized as chunks.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The cards with randomly placed pieces, however, could have impossible scenarios, like two Kings side by side, or two white Bishops on the same color squares (right side of Figure B.4). These are things that a chess player would never see, and therefore could not have internalized as chunks.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/diego-arguello-s-top-10-games-of-the-year-2025-wrap-up" target="_self" data-discover="true">Diego Arguello's top 10 games of the year - 2025 Wrap-Up</a></p><p>Figure B.4: Common two-by-two "chunk" of pieces (left) and impossible or improbable chess positions (right).</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So, instead of memorizing the positions of each piece individually, the grandmasters memorized a few chunks that they had already internalized by seeing them over and over. Meanwhile, the novice players who had not developed the same number and variety of chunks as the grandmasters had to remember the positions of most of the pieces individually.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">However, when the cards were made up of random chess positions, the grandmasters couldn’t use their chunks to help them memorize the cards. For this reason, they were just as good as the novices.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">By now you can see how this applies to BoxeR: When they see the combination of Mutalisks and Zerglings, they don’t see the individual units but a chunk, and that allows them to react much more quickly and build exactly what they need to defend against it.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Chunking the TRS">Chunking the TRS</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So how can all these ideas be applied to tools design?</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/book-excerpt-designing-the-user-experience-of-game-development-tools#_ftn4" data-discover="true">[4]</a></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One of the most common user interface patterns in level editors and 3d animation software is the Translate Rotate Scale control or TRS for short. It’s a three-by-three grid of numeric inputs that represent the X, Y, and Z values for translation (sometimes called position), rotation, and scale.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It is almost always seen in the same order: The first horizontal row of three numeric inputs represents the translate XYZ (the position of the object), the second row is for the three axes of rotation, and the third row is for scale (the size of the object).&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As people use this kind of TRS control, they start to develop chunks to quickly interpret the numbers. For example, if the first row is three zeros, the second row is three zeros, and the third row is three ones, they know that the object is at the center of the world with no rotation and no scaling (see Figure B.5).</span></p><p>Figure B.5: Default values in the TRS controls for Unity and Maya, © Unity, © Autodesk</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">However, what happens if the TRS control is not in the same order or orientation? In Figure B.6, you can see that the editor in the game engine Stingray flips the orientation of the numeric inputs to be vertical instead of horizontal, and 3D DCC Softimage|XSI puts Scale first, then Rotation, then Position (Translation).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One of the disadvantages of doing this is that people cannot use the same chunks that they have learned from using another software. So, seeing a first row of three zeros, a second row of three zeros, and a third row of three ones would mean something completely different.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Also, if someone is working back and forth with two different tools (one to create assets and another to place the assets in a level) and the TRS controls in each are different, it could lead to confusion as they switch back and forth.</span></p><p>Figure B.6: The TRS controls for Stingray and Softimage XSI © Autodesk</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The lesson here is that it’s important to present data in a consistent order in all parts of a tool so people can chunk it from one part of the tool to the next. If the same data is presented differently in various parts of the tool, it will be harder for users to internalize chunks of information and use them to be more efficient.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Furthermore, if you’re creating a tool that uses the same pattern as another software that the users are already familiar with (like the TRS control), use the same order and configuration so that they can take advantage of the chunks that they have already internalized.</span></p><p>Figure B.7: Photo by Jack Pierce on Unsplash</p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Fighting Games &amp; Human Vision">Fighting Games &amp; Human Vision</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Next, let’s look at how knowing fighting games could mean that you already know a bit about how the eyes and the brain work together.</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/book-excerpt-designing-the-user-experience-of-game-development-tools#_ftn5" data-discover="true">[5]</a></span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Saccadic Masking">Saccadic Masking</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To understand saccadic masking, we first need to understand saccades and fixations. A fixation is the spot where your eye is focusing, and a saccade is when your focus moves from one point to another (see Figure B.8).</span></p><p>Figure B.8: Saccades and fixations</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When our eye saccades, our brain temporarily blocks visual processing to perceive the world as stable and reduce motion blur. What this means is that we are blind for a fraction of a second, without even realizing it!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One of the best studies to show the effects of saccadic masking was done by Tim Smith</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/book-excerpt-designing-the-user-experience-of-game-development-tools#_ftn6" data-discover="true">[6]</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. In the study, he showed participants an image while tracking their eyes using an eye-tracking device. When the device detected a saccade, elements of the image would change or disappear. The participants didn’t notice most of the changes, because they were effectively blind during those moments.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Foveal Versus Peripheral Vision">Foveal Versus Peripheral Vision</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Foveal vision is sometimes called “central vision”, the part of our vision in the middle that is the sharpest. Peripheral vision is everything else around the center. It is not as sharp as our foveal vision.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Some measurements suggest that the resolution at the extreme edge of our peripheral vision is as low as three pixels per foot (it’s better at detecting color and movement, though). Our brain compensates by “filling in” some of the resolution, especially if it’s something we have seen before. This means that unless we’re staring straight at something, we don’t see it as clearly as we may think we do.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So how does all this relate to fighting games?</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Sako and the Sentry">Sako and the Sentry</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Sako is one of the best fighting game players who is mostly known for their skill in Street Fighter. They are so well known for their Evil Ryu that they even have a combo named after them.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the early 2010s, the company Steelseries released a device called the Sentry Eye Tracker (Figure B.9) to bring eye-tracking to the gaming community. Its purpose was to help gamers see their eye movements so they could improve their performance. They teamed up with Sako to release a video of him playing Street Fighter while using the Sentry Eye Tracker.</span></p><p>Figure B.9: Sentry Eye Tracker by Steelseries. SteelSeries® is a registered trademark of SteelSeries ApS.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If you watch the video</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/book-excerpt-designing-the-user-experience-of-game-development-tools#_ftn7" data-discover="true">[7]</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, you’ll notice that he fixates right in between both characters (left side of Figure B.10). This is one of the things that separates him from novice players, who tend to saccade and fixate back and forth between both characters (right side of Figure B.10).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">By doing this, he uses his sharp foveal vision to keep both characters in focus at the same time which minimizes the number of saccades that he does. This means that when his opponent triggers a move, he’s less likely to miss the first few frames... and when it comes to fighting games, missing a few frames can mean the difference between winning and losing.</span></p><p>Figure B.10: Sako’s eye movement compared to a novice player © Capcom</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Additionally, Sako has probably internalized chunks of different poses that both he and his opponent are in, allowing him to read the situation and react ever more quickly (see Figure B.11). Another good example of chunking!</span></p><p>Figure B.11: Chunking poses from Street Fighter © Capcom</p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Label Placement Eye-tracking">Label Placement Eye-tracking</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The blog UX Matters has done a series of studies in which eye trackers were used to understand what people look at in various user interfaces. One interesting study</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/book-excerpt-designing-the-user-experience-of-game-development-tools#_ftn8" data-discover="true">[8]</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> compared three different options for placing a label in a form: left-aligned, right-aligned, and top-aligned. Here is what they found.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Labels that were top-aligned and right-aligned resulted in the lowest number of saccades (left side and middle of Figure B.12), meaning that the users were much more efficient at interpreting the data in the user interface. However, left-aligned labels had almost double the number of saccades, meaning that users were moving their eyes around the interface much more than they needed to (right side of Figure B.12).</span></p><p>Figure B.12: Eye-tracking for right-aligned, top-aligned, and left-aligned labels</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So how can we apply all of this to tool design?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Forms are very similar to a user interface element found in many of our tools: property editors. They are usually made of a label associated with an input (often a text input, but it can be other types as well).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For example, labels in the Maya Attribute Editor are right-aligned, allowing the user to fixate in the center and read both the label and the value without having to saccade back and forth (left side of Figure B.13). Compare this to Stingray, where the left-aligned labels require the user to saccade back and forth to read the label and the value (right side of Figure B.13).</span></p><p>Figure B.13: Right-aligned labels in Maya versus left-aligned labels in Stingray, © Autodesk</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This problem gets even worse when you resize the property editor horizontally, meaning that the labels move even further away from the inputs.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Finally, although top-aligned labels performed as well as right-aligned labels, using them for property editors can be problematic because they usually require the user to scroll due to the increased use of vertical space. They should only be used in situations where there are a small number of inputs. Property editors usually have a very large number of inputs, and so for this reason, right-aligned labels are a better choice.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Wrapping Up">Wrapping Up</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">By now, you can see how certain types of games can not only help us learn tools design concepts, but they can also be to explain those concepts to others as well!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Keep in mind, however, that some games purposefully increase friction (see excise in the Design chapter) as a part of the gameplay. While this may be fun in a game, it is not fun when you’re trying to get your work done, so it’s best to look for examples from competitive games where speed and accuracy are important.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So now you know about another great resource that you can use to learn tools design concepts, one that has been hiding in plain sight all this time: games!</span></p><p>Figure B.14: Photo by Hadyn Cutler on Unsplash</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/book-excerpt-designing-the-user-experience-of-game-development-tools#_ftnref1" data-discover="true">[1]</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> We will learn more about chunking in Chapter 5!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/book-excerpt-designing-the-user-experience-of-game-development-tools#_ftnref2" data-discover="true">[2]</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> The original chess study came from Adriaan de Groot.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/book-excerpt-designing-the-user-experience-of-game-development-tools#_ftnref3" data-discover="true">[3]</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> You might know them from their study on selective attention, also known as the invisible gorilla video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJG698U2Mvo</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/book-excerpt-designing-the-user-experience-of-game-development-tools#_ftnref4" data-discover="true">[4]</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> In Chapter 5, we’ll see an example of how chunking can be used to interpret hexadecimal color values.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/book-excerpt-designing-the-user-experience-of-game-development-tools#_ftnref5" data-discover="true">[5]</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> We will learn more about human vision at the start of Chatper 5.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/book-excerpt-designing-the-user-experience-of-game-development-tools#_ftnref6" data-discover="true">[6]</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Here is a video of the study: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIF3FRwbG6Y&amp;ab_channel=edz44</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/book-excerpt-designing-the-user-experience-of-game-development-tools#_ftnref7" data-discover="true">[7]</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> See the video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RmAwAefKZ8o</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/book-excerpt-designing-the-user-experience-of-game-development-tools#_ftnref8" data-discover="true">[8]</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> Here’s a link to the blog post for the study: https://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2006/07/label-placement-in-forms.php</span></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/book-excerpt-designing-the-user-experience-of-game-development-tools]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Splitgate developer 1047 Games has reacted to the online commentary regarding the recent re-launch of the shooter Splitgate: Arena Reloaded. The game arrived in mid-December 2025 and hasn't gotten close to the Steam numbers that Splitgate 2 or Splitgate 1 reached, prompting online commenters to wonder if the game will be able to stay online.</p><p>The developer <a href="https://x.com/Splitgate/status/2008619575978479982" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said in a statement</a>, "Steam charts don't measure fun," adding that Steam player numbers only show "one number, on one platform, at one given moment." Steam numbers do no show the "full picture or what it feels like to actually play, and they definitely don't capture the community that's actively helping shape what Arena Reloaded is becoming."</p><p>1047 Games re-launched Splitgate 2 under the name Splitgate: Arena Reloaded on December 17, and Steam numbers <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2918300/charts/#3m" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">spiked to about 2,300 concurrents at launch.</a> In the past 24 hours, the game reached a peak of 952 players on Steam.</p><p>For comparison, Splitgate 2 had its most-ever players (25,785 concurrents) in early June <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/splitgate-battle-royale-mode-out-now-alongside-splitgate-2-official-release/1100-6532195/" data-ref-id="1100-6532195">when the game's battle royale mode arrived.</a> The original Splitgate, meanwhile, achieved a <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/677620/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">record of 67,724 peak concurrent players</a> back in August 2021.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_kqmh6hXiM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/x_kqmh6hXiM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>1047 Games is encouraging people to give Spligate: Arena Reloaded a shot. "The gameplay's the best it's ever been, and we'd love for you to jump in and form your own opinion," the studio said.</p><p>The game will get a big new mode in the future in the form of Arena Royale, which is a battle royale mode.</p><p>Steam's player data is public, but the same cannot be said for PlayStation and Xbox, so we do not know how Arena Reloaded is performing on consoles. The game was always likely to face an uphill battle for marketshare, as data shows people may try new games but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/2025s-top-5-most-played-games-on-playstation-and-xbox-are-the-same-as-2024s/1100-6537207/" data-ref-id="1100-6537207">end up sticking with their established favorites. </a></p><p>It's been a bumpy road for Splitgate in the past year. One of the bosses at 1047 Games wore a <a href="https://x.com/Splitgate/status/1932502832281694366" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"Make FPS Great Again" hat</a> at Summer Game Fest in 2025, which led to some controversy. Additionally, there were complaints about microtransaction prices. The studio would later <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/splitgate-dev-lays-off-staff-co-founders-forgoing-salaries/1100-6532622/" data-ref-id="1100-6532622">lay off staff, while its founders stopped drawing a salary</a>. Splitgate 2 took the unusual move of reverting back to beta in July 2025 before the re-launch in December.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> The Baldur's Gate 3 Cast Answers Our Burning Questions</p>
      </div>
<p>Stranger Things co-creator Matt Duffer mentioned to <a href="https://variety.com/2026/tv/news/stranger-things-finale-is-eleven-alive-vecna-killed-rock-spinoff-1236621528/" data-target="true" data-mce-href="https://variety.com/2026/tv/news/stranger-things-finale-is-eleven-alive-vecna-killed-rock-spinoff-1236621528/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Variety</a> that he was playing the Larian Studios-developed title while working on the final season. Duffer implied that the climactic showdown with Vecna and the Mind Flayer shared themes and elements with both D&amp;D and Baldur's Gate 3.</p><p>According to Duffer, the show's entire cast of characters found "self-acceptance" through the story and ended up "absolutely primed" going into the final battle.</p><p>"They’re the ultimate team, and it’s the party working all together to defeat this thing. And they each have their own individual skills, right?" Duffer said. "And that’s where I go back to Dungeons &amp; Dragons, and something like Baldur’s Gate. Because that’s how you take down these monsters that seem otherwise unstoppable."</p><p>One of the biggest strengths of Baldur's Gate 3 was its memorable party members, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-fan-discovers-astarion-has-almost-as-much-spoken-dialogue-as-the-narrator/1100-6536824/" data-ref-id="1100-6536824" data-mce-href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-fan-discovers-astarion-has-almost-as-much-spoken-dialogue-as-the-narrator/1100-6536824/">such as Astarion</a> and Shadowheart, all of whom go through their own compelling story arcs. Similarly, the characters of Stranger Things overcame obstacles and developed significantly through the show's five seasons.</p><p>The fateful battle against the show's two main villains is set in an environment referred to as The Abyss, a desert wasteland in an alternate dimension. The "party" of characters travels there through the Upside Down to confront Vecna and the Mind Flayer, taking the latter down through a coordinated attack involving firearms, Molotov cocktails, a flare gun, and other means of brute force.</p><p>Of course, Stranger Things and Baldur's Gate 3 have some more explicit overlaps. As some of the characters in the show are avid D&amp;D players, they often name the creatures and villains they encounter after D&amp;D characters, such as Demogorgons, and of course, Vecna and the Mind Flayer. Baldur's Gate 3 heavily <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/larian-explains-mind-flayer-hidden-skill-tree-in-baldurs-gate-3/1100-6516428/" data-ref-id="1100-6516428" data-mce-href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/larian-explains-mind-flayer-hidden-skill-tree-in-baldurs-gate-3/1100-6516428/">features mind flayers in its story</a>.</p><p>Interestingly, Duffer mentioned that "lots of video game references were applied to that final battle," though he doesn't elaborate on these references. One explicit reference early in the season was a somewhat inaccurate <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stranger-things-made-a-mistake-with-an-old-school-game-or-did-it/1100-6536658/" data-ref-id="1100-6536658" data-mce-href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stranger-things-made-a-mistake-with-an-old-school-game-or-did-it/1100-6536658/">scene featuring Ghost 'n Goblins</a>.</p>

            <guid>1398829</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>Having forgotten all about it (it was first announced years ago!), some news coming out of CES this week reminded me that Sony and Honda have teamed up on a new electric vehicle that, for the purposes of this blog, has some PlayStation stuff in it. And the news very quickly reminded me of why I'd forgotten all about the car in the first place.</p><p>The electric vehicle market is a cut-throat space; the emergence of a bunch of Chinese brands in recent years, the difficulties many established manufacturers have had switching their cars from combustion engines to electric motors and a hostile political climate have all worked together to create the most tumultuous auto market in decades.</p><p>In 2026 you can't just put out an electric car and expect people to buy it; you need to give them very good reasons to consider your offering ahead of the multitude of fantastic options already out there, particularly from Chinese and European labels. Which is why Sony and Honda's big CES <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9jRMrRoCmM&amp;themeRefresh=1&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>press conference</u></a>, showing off the production model of their Afeela joint venture (now called the Afeela 1), was so disappointing.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ykl_GmJDB1Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="AFEELA | CES2026 Sony Honda Mobility Press Conference"></iframe></figure><p>Actually, disappointing might be the wrong word, because that would imply I had any kind of expectations for this vehicle in the first place. But it looked blergh when I first saw it in <a href="https://www.shm-afeela.com/en/news/2023-01-04/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>2023</u></a>, and it still looks blergh now in 2026, only now it has a ton of better and cheaper cars to compete with.</p><p>What makes it blergh? Let's start with the styling! Which is subjective, I know, but I don't think it's a huge stretch to say the Afeela looks bland, or to point out it looks like<a href="https://lucidmotors.com/air?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>Lucid made a cheap, taxi version of the Air</u></a>. Because EVs don't have huge engines at the front, and because they're supposed to be from the future, many companies have got <em>wild</em> with their styling (look at Kia and Hyundai), whereas the Afeela just looks like a...car.</p><p>Moving on to more objective faults, let's look at the Afeela's numbers. Now I know, numbers with a car aren't <em>everything</em>, but with an EV they kinda <em>are</em>, because an electric vehicle's range and charge speed are much more important figures for your daily experience than, say, a combustion engine's economy. To check out the specs for the Afeela 1, you can visit the car's <a href="https://www.shm-afeela.com/en/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>website</u></a>, select to build your own order and be met with, uh:</p><blockquote>Sensors: 40 UNITS</blockquote><blockquote>Computing Power: 800 TOPS</blockquote><blockquote>Tesla Supercharging Network​: 25,000+</blockquote><blockquote>AFEELA Intelligent Drive (Level 2+ ADAS)</blockquote><blockquote>AFEELA Personal Agent</blockquote><blockquote>Media Bar (External Information Display)</blockquote><blockquote>Immersive 3D Map</blockquote><blockquote>Immersive Entertainment Selection</blockquote><blockquote>Customizable Theme</blockquote><blockquote>Spatial Sound System</blockquote><blockquote>5G Connectivity</blockquote><p>That's nearly all stuff that every EV (actually, nearly every car) on the market just <em>has</em>, and is so basic and taken-for-granted that nobody even bothers looking up the specifics. Teslas have had self-driving for years, most EVs let you change their "theme" to some extent and almost every modern car rolling off a factory floor has some kind of voice assistant. A car's specs page should be where the important stuff goes, and with an EV that's its range, its battery size, its speed, its <em>charging </em>speed (as in, how long it would take you to charge from 10-80% on the road), its trunk size and maybe some other stuff like whether it has any V2L or V2G capability (meaning your car's battery can power appliances with the former and your whole house with the latter).</p><p>With the Afeela 1 you've gotta go digging to find most of that, which is never a good sign. And yup, you've gotta dig for a reason: most of the Afeela's specs are very, very bad by 2026 standards when you consider that this car is going to cost over <em>$90,000</em>. Some examples: it'll do "up to" 300 miles on a charge, which means it will actually do less in the real world, in a market where Teslas and Polestars are now routinely doing over 400 miles (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOjPP4LZvWE&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>or over <em>500 </em>in a Polestar 3 if you drive as carefully as possible</u></a>). Its maximum charge rate at a public fast-charger is 150kw; the Kia EV6 could do almost double that back in 2021. And its acceleration speed--again, not a huge deal, but something buyers do absolutely consider--hasn't even been announced yet, implying that either the pre-production model on stage at CES was <em>very </em>pre-production, or that it's going to be <em>slow</em>.</p><figure><figcaption><p><span>The two rear screens in the Afeela 1 are the most logical place to be using the PlayStation connectivity (L), while the car's yoke steering wheel (R) won't be to many people's liking</span></p></figcaption></figure><p>So does it have <em>anything</em> going for it? I dunno, it depends on how much you like the idea of <a href="https://wapo.st/4ssr7Ff?ref=aftermath.site"><u>playing PlayStation games in your car</u></a>, something the Afeela 1 will do via a Remote Play app for the car's infotainment system and rear screens. It also depends on how much you like the idea of a yoke steering wheel. Oh, and if you live in California or not, because that's the <em>only </em>state in the US from which you can order one of these cars at the moment.</p><p>But man, I look at this car and I see almost nothing that sets it out from the pack. The Afeela afeelas boring, in the same way so many other electric vehicles from established manufacturers--<a href="https://insideevs.com/news/709240/japan-evs-critical-materials/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Japanese ones especially</u></a>--do, where companies lacking either the commitment or the experience to really lean into the segment end up making cars that provide no reason to hate them, but none to love or buy them either.</p><p>I just don't see who this car is for. For under $90k in the US you can get a <em>premium</em> EV like a Porsche Macan, Audi S6 Sportback e-tron, Polestar 4, Lucid Air or BMW i4 (or i5), all of which crush the Afeela in terms of specs and inclusions (not to mention prestige). Even if it were $30k cheaper it would <em>still</em> struggle against cars like the Tesla Model Y and Kia EV5.</p><p>It's such a dated, forgettable vehicle that about the only time I ever see anyone talking about the Afeela is when, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sonys-upcoming-afeela-1-car-will-let-you-drive-with-astro-bot-or-god-of-war/?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">like this week</a>, the PlayStation stuff is mentioned. To which my counter would be: if you're looking to throw $90k at an electric car, you can get a much better one than this for that money, and have enough left over to toss a Steam Deck or PlayStation Portal in the back seat while you're at it.</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/random-speedrunner-becomes-first-person-to-complete-super-meat-boy-deathless</link>
            <guid>1398811</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/super_meat_boy">Super Meat Boy</a>'s reputation precedes it. The notoriously-difficult precision platformer is designed to be extremely challenging, and death on every single screen is basically inevitable. Amazingly, it's taken over 15 years for anyone to fully complete the game — that's get 106% completion — without dying, but it <em>finally</em> happened at the end of last year (thanks <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/its-taken-15-years-but-someones-finally-completed-super-meat-boy-without-dying-once">IGN</a>).</p>
<p>Back in December, Nintendo speedrunner <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7bnhmqT3s">shredberg</a> became the first person ever to fully complete Super Meat Boy deathless. Yes, seriously, no one has been able to do this since the game was first released on the Xbox 360 in 2010. The platformer came to Switch in 2018.</p>
<p>"I've been doing this way too long" shredberg says laughing after his record-breaking win. "I'm not saying that I wasn't nervous, because I was very nervous at the end there, but I was way more nervous just in Dark Cotton... Once I got past Dark Hell 2, I was relatively fine."</p>
<p>"I'm gonna be emailing everyone — Kotaku, IGN, CNN, Chef's Illustrated. They're all going to hear about it."</p>
<p>You can watch the full two hour stream up-top, but if you've even played a few minutes of Super Meat Boy, you know how tough this game can be. shredberg, somehow, makes this look effortless.</p>
<p>Even one of the game's co-creators, Edmund McMillen, congratulated shredberg on social media with a simple "Congrats!"</p>

<p>Sharing his achievement on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Supermeatboy/comments/1pnjrqr/i_got_106_without_dying/">Supermeatboy subreddit</a>, shredberg thinks it took him "like 700-800 hours of grinding" to reach this goal, which is staggering.</p>
<p>He's been streaming much of his progress over on Twitch over the years, in-between other speedruns for games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_kart_8_deluxe">Mario Kart 8</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/celeste">Celeste</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/captain_toad_treasure_tracker">Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker</a>.</p>
<p>So, what's next? Some followers on the archived stream have made some suggestions for shredberg, such as playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Silksong</a> or other games. Whatever it is, we hope shredberg has fun. Congrats on the record!</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-helped-push-steam-to-have-highest-grossing-december-yet/</link>
            <guid>1398808</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Steam's Winter Sale is now over, and according to <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/the-steam-games-that-sold-the-most">the latest report from Alinea Analytics,</a> PC players are going to be spending their time playing ARC Raiders while they wait for the next store-wide sale for the platform this Spring.</p>



<p>December 2025 was the best December for Steam yet, with the platform generating<strong> over $1.6 billion</strong> last month. It was a <strong>22.7% increase</strong> compared to December 2024, and it handily beat December 2020's COVID-era numbers when Steam brought in a gross revenue of $1.4 billion.</p>



<p>As for what drove that record-breaking gross revenue? ARC Raiders, the third-person extraction shooter from Embark Studios that continues to be the 'game of the hour' after its massive launch in October 2025, was a big part of that success. Since it hit the market, it has barely slowed down, just recently having reached over <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-estimated-to-have-sold-12-million-copies/">12 million copies sold</a></strong> overall. On Steam alone, Alinea estimates it has sold over <strong>7 million copies</strong>.</p>



<p>Over the holidays, ARC Raiders was the second-best-selling game on Steam by revenue. It sold over 250K copies on Boxing Day, and its concurrent player counts show no sign of the game leaving the top-played games on Steam anytime soon. At the time of this writing, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1808500/charts/#max">it has yet to fall below 250K concurrent players on Steam since it launched</a>. </p>



<p>As for which game took the number one spot in terms of revenue, that went to Counter-Strike, which is what you'd expect from the game that constantly remains the most played game on the platform.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Steam-Top-Games-by-Copies-Sold-December-2025.png"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: Alinea Analytics</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The charts for Steam's December 2025 get more interesting when you look at copies sold, as they directly point out the value of a good deal. Detroit: Become Human was 90% off during the Winter Sale, making it less than the price of a latte at Starbucks. At that price, approximately <strong>993K</strong> players who hadn't bought it before took their chance, and it was the second-best-selling game, behind ARC Raiders, for December 2025.</p>



<p>Other notable entries on the chart include Battlefield 6, which was 30% off during the Winter Sale, and Slay the Spire, which was also at an all-time low at 90% off during the Winter Sale. Good timing for developer Mega Crit, which is <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-indie-games-of-2026/">getting prepared to launch Slay the Spire II later this year, in March 2026</a>. </p>



<p>When ARC Raiders arrived in October 2025, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/arc-raiders-review-speak-softly-and-carry-a-wolfpack/">Wccftech's Kai Tatsumoto gave it a 9/10 in his review,</a> writing, "<em>All in all, ARC Raiders is a phenomenal entry in the growing loot-and-scoot genre, or extraction shooter if you want to be more technical about it. While the gunplay suffers in the early stages with inferior tier one weaponry, it shines through once you start developing squad tactics and learn the ins and outs of besting the array of lethal ARC threats throughout Toledo. I wanted to wait until the first major content push from Embark Studios before finalizing my thoughts, and the inclusion of Stella Montis has brought a new flavor of psychological warfare to escalate this extraction shooter to greater heights.</em>"</p>

The release of Lorwyn Eclipsed will contain new cards for fans to enjoy, new prebuilt decks, and some sly marketing courtesy of the Jim Henson Workshop.</p><h2>The <em>Magic: The Gathering Lorwyn Eclipsed</em> Announcements</h2><p>In an official <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/feature/collecting-lorwyn-eclipsed" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">blog post</a>, Wizards of the Coast showcased the card and products included in the <em>Lorwyn Eclipsed</em> set. Like most major set releases, it will contain Play Boosters, Collector Boosters, Draft boxes, and Prerelease boxes. The set will also include several prebuilt decks. These include two 60-card theme decks designed for Standard format, and two 100-card Commander decks.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>The post showcases the artwork on the new cards. As the name suggests, this new set returns to the land of Lorwyn, a place separated by day and night by the twilight god Isilu. As such, shock land cards like Blood Crypts and Steam Vents will be reversible with Day and Night versions. In addition, certain Legendary Creatures and Planeswalker cards transform, such as Oko and Eridu. further representing the dichotomy.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>This comparison to fairytale worlds is made more overt by some coy marketing on Wizard's part. In addition to a debut trailer, the studio released a three-minute promo video, titled <em>The Ballad of Squen and Cragg</em>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCQ5EF69rSQ" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">on YouTube</a>. The video is a musical number centered on two characters, Squen from the sunny Lorwyn, and Cragg from the dark Shadowmoor, all brought to life through Jim Henson Muppets.</p><p>Additional posts confirm that Lorwyn Eclipsed will include borderless and art variants of certain cards. The big draw is a serialized, double rainbow foil, borderless version of Bitterbloom Bearer, brought to life by artist Rebecca Guay. Only 500 copies will be printed, so happy hunting.&nbsp;</p><picture>

Among these returning cards is one with a nasty history in Legacy format: <em>Painter's Servant</em>.</p><p>Prerelease events for Lorwyn Eclipsed will begin January 16-22. The set will then debut in <em>Magic: The Gathering Arena</em> on January 20. The set officially releases on January 23.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>From cackling goblins to crackling spells, the world of <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> and other trading card games has no shortage of iconic imagery and artwork shot throughout its history. For the off-the-wall art collective known as Puke (yes, Puke... for real!), the magical worlds of TCG's have served as their inspiration, as they bring their wild creations to life via playmats, stickers, and other TCG accessories. I got the chance to sit down with the Puke gang to talk gross out humor, design aesthetic, and the importance of hand-made art in the world of <em>MTG</em>.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/puke-a-duel.jpeg?itok=HbET0Gbo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1374" height="800">

  </picture><p>To start, I wanted to know... just what in the world is Puke? "Puke is two dudes," says Stefhan Alvarado, one half of the two dudes. "I’m Stefhan and, like my partner in crime Josh, I'm an Illustrator. Puke is everything the both of us creatively agree on rolled up into one neat little brand." To which Josh Lees, the other half of Puke, adds, "Yeah to piggyback on this nerd's back, we're trying to bring something new and fresh to the community that isn’t defined by boundaries, and speaks to every purveyor of the wacky, weird, and outsider swag."</p><p>They're bringing the new and fresh something via <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/vomitspit/puke-presents-a-barf-bonanza?ref=user_menu" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">a Kickstarter called Puke! Presents: A Barf Bonanza</a>. "Aside from just making cool merchandise and getting it out to the public," says Alvarado, "the Kickstarter’s main goal is to kick off Puke as a brand. Get the word out on the streets." With vibrant, colorful illustrations, the group seems to me to be kicking down the doors of what's established and expected in the tabletop art world, letting their unhinged creative juices flow.</p><blockquote><p>You can both have the same idea but how the artist chooses to channel their talent always leads to a different ending.</p></blockquote><p>Friends and collaborators since their art school days, both Alvarado and Lees have extremely distinct and unique visual styles. I wanted to know how they go about infusing those styles into one cohesive brand. "Our styles are very interesting to me," Alvarado explains.&nbsp;</p><p>"We have almost the same exact influences when it comes to our art but somehow what we each produce almost feels like polar opposites. Art is funny in that way. You can both have the same idea but how the artist chooses to channel their talent always leads to a different ending."</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/puke-brains.jpeg?itok=bWpLDFPz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1374" height="800">

  </picture><p>"I think Stefhan nailed this on the head," says Lees, "It’s kind of dope to see how our styles meld together and how we work as a team. I think art style-wise, we both have a great respect for the other's craft, not to be too sappy. But we also aren’t afraid to tell each other if we have a different opinion."</p><p>"If I were to describe both of us in a different light," Alvarado continues, "I’d say that I lean more towards a traditional illustrator and Josh leans more into the fine artist territory. Those roles are all very shallow though, you learn pretty quickly as a working artist that you are a sum of your parts, and most of the time for illustrators that means that you have to be good at a lot of different things. In the end you end up being a Designer, Animator, draftsmen, illustrator, visual story teller, sequential artist, painter, etc."</p><p>For Alvarado, the coolest part of their collaboration is "that we’re both each other’s number one fans. We’re both competitive, but in a very healthy way. We push each other to keep upping the ante with our art. The product in the end speaks for itself it’s always the coolest it can be at that moment."</p><picture>

  </picture><p>Since I'm here sitting down with two real-deal artists, I wanted to get their thoughts on the future of art and the increasing presence of AI. "With AI being forced down everybody’s throat," says Lees, "I think people want something that’s more human. As companies go full tilt into that landscape, they fail to understand that, for the viewer, AI art does nothing! Maybe it makes you mad or makes you laugh for a second, and then what? It's just slop."</p><blockquote><p>I think that’s why board games and TCGs are so fascinating right now. They feel very human.</p></blockquote><p>Alvarado agrees, "I think there's no better time than now to take creative risks with your art. I think it needs to feel tactile, gritty and imperfect, “punk” in a way. I think that’s why board games and TCGs are so fascinating right now. They feel very human. You’re basically collecting art and playing with it. You’re showing your individuality through the games by showing off your interests."</p><p>Lees continues, "While this is a terrible thing being implemented into our society, I do think that there will be a sort of Dada era of the arts where people make creative that rebells against the slop-apocalypse. That being said I do think that there is some really great music and art coming out these days; most likely being fueled by the times that we live in. Artists thrive in chaos and hard times."</p><picture>

  </picture><p>Puke channels all of this frustration and inspiration into a concept they call "Art First." I asked them to explain this concept a bit more. "We keep hammering this Art First mantra down each other’s ear-holes because it makes everything simple. It keeps the brand from getting muddy. We keep pushing each other to make the dopest art we can make."</p><p>Lees adds to this sentiment, "It’s always been art, it’s always gonna be art, and it’s never <em>not</em> art. We want to strive to put out work that has an undeniable quality to it - and that goes from the quality of the playmats, stickers, and sleeves we're producing, to the image itself. We aren’t afraid to tell each other, 'hey that looks baddddd,' which keeps us honest and always makes us push it as far as we can go. Easy way to think of it is: Indiana Jones. We are Indiana Jones, and art Is our holy grail."</p><picture>

  </picture><p>As we wind down our conversation, I wanted to hear about their favorite <em>Magic</em> cards. "I think that aesthetically and mechanically," Alvarado says, "<a href="https://scryfall.com/card/a25/82/dark-ritual" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Dark Ritual</a> is my favorite card. It represents its color so well and in the simplest way possible. Pay a little to get more. It feels like the spell a dark necromancer or warlock would use to summon a demon. Real Metal."</p><p>For Lees, his love of the game, and his favorite color and card, all started when he was a kid. "I started playing magic in the Time Spiral block," Lees explains, "when my childhood best friend gave me the gift of <em>Magic</em>." He and his buddy each bought a horrible pre-constructed deck during that block, "You people don’t know how nice you have it these days" Lees laughs.</p><p>"But from that, I was sorted into the house of Blue: the best color ever. Funny enough this leads into my fav magic card every which would be Mark Poole's <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/4ed/65/counterspell" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Counterspell</a>." The artwork, which depicts a mage with his spell fizzling as it leaves his fingertips, is described by Lees as, "just goated with the sauce, dripping with swag, sick, beautiful and wonderful all at the same time. Plus the best magic card mechanically ever created."</p><p>With that, our conversation comes to a close. Full of art, ambition, and clear-eyed intentions on what they want to create, there's a lot to love about Puke!</p><hr><p><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/vomitspit/puke-presents-a-barf-bonanza?ref=user_menu" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">To learn more about Puke and their outrageous Kickstarter, head over to the crowdfunding page!</a></p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Today, MTV is a zombie network that primarily <a href="https://x.com/MTVSchedule/status/1465685976509030404/photo/1">airs episodes of </a><em><a href="https://x.com/MTVSchedule/status/1465685976509030404/photo/1">Ridiculousness</a>&nbsp;</em>and random Paramount-owned comedy films. It’s depressing. But before all that, before <em>The Real World</em> and <em>Road Rules</em>, MTV was a channel that mostly played music videos, and it was cool. So I was happy to hear that someone has created a free MTV simulator website, complete with retro ads.</p> <p>MTV Rewind is a website that tries to recreate the experience of watching the original music channel back in the day. When you first visit the site, it starts playing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_first_music_videos_aired_on_MTV">original MTV broadcast</a>, complete with VJ introductions and the original music videos that were aired on that faithful day back in August 1981. I wasn’t alive back then, but it’s still fun to relive that launch from the comfort of my PC in 2025.</p>

  <p>Beyond recreating the first day, MTV Rewind features different decades you can swap between, built up of playlists featuring thousands of videos, as well as random, old TV ads from back in the day. And I have to admit, there is something special and comforting about returning to an era in which music was delivered to me without me having to create playlists, seek out artists, or hear the stuff that some algorithm decides I want to listen to next. Just a hose of old music videos streamed directly into my ears. Cool shit.</p>

 <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OldSchoolCool/comments/1q5e7n1/comment/nxzbdgn/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">The creator of MTV Rewind says</a> they built this project, which uses YouTube for all the videos, over the course of a week as a “passion project.” They shared on Reddit that they have “a deep nostalgia” for MTV and miss the 24/7 music videos. I’m happy they took the time to make this site. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have a lot of 1990s music to jam out to while I work.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/splitgate-developers-hit-back-criticism-steam-charts/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Splitgate 2, which was recently rebranded as Splitgate: Arena Reloaded, has been having a fairly tough time of late. The game was relaunched after being pulled back to beta following a hampered and relatively disastrous summer release, but the second wind has failed to generate much traction.</p>



<p>In a recent post on social media, the Splitgate developers at 1047 Games addressed the ongoing discourse around the game’s lack of success, which typically relies on Steam player numbers to frame a picture of the game’s struggles.</p>



<p>The developers are saying, as many have before, that Steam’s player numbers aren’t indicative of the bigger picture.</p>







<h2 id="h-don-t-rely-on-steam-to-get-your-consensus">Don’t Rely on Steam to Get Your Consensus</h2>



<p>In a recent post on social media damning the discourse around Splitgate: Arena Reloaded’s inability to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/splitgate-failed-secure-traction-fumbled-again/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">generate any hype</a> the second time around, <a href="https://x.com/Splitgate/status/2008619575978479982" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the team said</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Steam Charts don’t measure fun.</p>



<p>They show one number, one one platform, at one given moment. They don’t show the full picture or what it feels like to actually play, and they definitely don’t capture the community that’s actively helping shape what Arena Reloaded is becoming (including upcoming content like Arena Royale).</p>



<p>Over the past six months, we rebuilt Splitgate from the ground up because we believe in the game, our team, and our community. The 1047 team remains committed to delivering the best version of Splitgate possible.</p>



<p>To our amazing community: thank you. Your feedback and passion have helped make Arena Reloaded better every day.</p>



<p>And to everyone who hasn’t played yet: Arena Reloaded is free, the gameplay’s the best it’s ever been, and we’d love for you to jump in and form your own opinion. A lot of passionate people worked very hard on it.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>For reference, here’s what the Steam Charts look like for Splitgate: Arena Reloaded at the time of writing:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>This statement comes months after Splitgate 2’s sentiments plummeted around a miserable launch and a marketing campaign that fell flat in a pretty spectacular way. There were concerns about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/splitgate-2-battle-royale-drops-fans-concerned-microtransactions/">microtransactions</a> and bold statements made by the 1047 leadership team, and on two occasions, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/splitgate-2-developer-holds-another-round-of-layoffs/">layoffs were made</a> that further damaged the company’s PR image.</p>



<p>Even the game’s paid influencer campaign came under fire, with one analyst labelling the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/splitgate-2-analysis-condemns-tone-deaf-influencer-campaign/">effort ‘tone deaf’</a> and stressing that it ‘alienated its core audience in pursuit of mainstream appeal.’</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If you’re looking for a potential hit, zombie indie game, then you might want to start preparing yourself for the Quarantine Zone: The Last Check release date. By preparing yourself, this means ensuring you’re free of zombie bites.</p>



<p>Quarantine Zone: The Last Check infuses the infectious (no pun intended) eye for detail of Papers, Please, and the typical survivalist qualities of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/8-biggest-indie-games-coming-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">indie</a> survival horror rolled into one. One second, you’re scanning survivors for the slightest sign of a bite, the next, you’re desperately defending yourself from a horde of undead.</p>



<p>If you’re currently free of quarantine right now (even if you’re not, no one will tell), check out the game’s launch day.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-is-quarantine-zone-the-last-check-coming-out">When Is Quarantine Zone: The Last Check Coming Out?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>We see through you, literally. Credit to Brigada Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Quarantine Zone: The Last Check has an official January 12 release date exclusively on PC systems.</strong></p>



<p>Closed playtests have come and gone, which means it’s time for the full launch. Quarantine Zone: The Last Check is one of the most-hyped Steam games in January, and with the month not bubbling in terms of AAA releases, it could be time for an indie game to get the huge boost it deserves.</p>



<p>Its game mechanics and fundamentals seem safe and secure, so unless there are any late breaches, you can look forward to a post-Christmas plague party to pile hours into.</p>







<h2 id="h-does-quarantine-zone-the-last-check-have-a-demo">Does Quarantine Zone: The Last Check Have A Demo?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A caged animal. Credit to Brigada Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There is a free-to-play Quarantine Zone: The Last Check demo that you can download and play right now on Steam.</strong></p>



<p>It’s always safer to try before you buy. Thankfully, Brigada Games and Devolver Digital are more than happy to oblige, courtesy of The Last Check’s free Steam demo.</p>



<p>Here’s a quick explainer on how to acquire it:</p>



<ol>
<li>Go to the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3419520/Quarantine_Zone_The_Last_Check/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Quarantine Zone: The Last Check Steam</a> page.</li>



<li>Scroll down until you see a big, green box saying <strong>Download Quarantine Zone: The Last Check Demo</strong>.</li>



<li>Click <strong>Download</strong>.</li>



<li>Choose <strong>Install</strong>.</li>



<li>As long as you have the 21 GB required, it should download and install itself on the system.</li>



<li>Once ready, you can try out the free Download Quarantine Zone: The Last Check demo!</li>
</ol>



<p>Again, there’s a lot of interest in The Last Check, but it doesn’t hurt to have one ‘last check’ to see if it’s for you or not.</p>



<p>You’ve still got time to read about Quarantine Zone: The Last Check or play the demo.

                <p>Mistborn fans may be able to take to the virtual streets of Luthadel eventually, but not for a while. As part of the yearly "State of the Sanderson" <a href="https://www.brandonsanderson.com/blogs/blog/state-of-the-sanderson-2025#video-games" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>, author Brandon Sanderson shared that he has been in conversations with multiple AAA developers about a potential Mistborn project. If the project does come to fruition, it will be years away.</p><p dir="ltr">Sanderson seems to be optimistic about the project's chances. He wrote, "I feel I’m finally getting established enough that we can make a Mistborn game happen. ... This is at Step One only, but it’s an encouraging One." Though he doesn't name any names, he does claim that he has been chatting with big players in the industry, including ones he is a fan of himself. Sanderson is also seeking maintain his rights to video game adaptations of Mistborn.</p><p dir="ltr">It appears that these discussions are in the earliest possible stage. "These rights were tied up with the film rights for the last... oh, six-seven years," Sanderson wrote, "so I didn’t get to test the market on them until recently." Sanderson concluded that any studio or publisher interested in developing a Mistborn or Stormlight project should get in touch with his representatives.</p><p dir="ltr">Mistborn is one part of Brandon Sanderson's sprawling Cosmere setting, which also encompasses the Stormlight Archive series. Multiple tabletop games based on Sanderson's work have emerged in recent years, including <a dir="ltr" href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tabletop-rpgs-based-on-brandon-sandersons-novels-are-cheap-right-now/1100-6523355/">Cosmere tabletop RPGs</a> and <a dir="ltr" href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mistborn-saga-deckbuilding-game-brandon-sanderson/1100-6532518/">a Mistborn deckbuilder.</a></p><p dir="ltr">Sanderson himself has some professional experience related to video games. He designed the world and created characters for <a dir="ltr" href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/moonbreaker-is-a-brandon-sanderson-video-game-universe-designed-to-last/1100-6508189/">the tactics game Moonbreaker</a>. Should this project release, it would not be Mistborn's first foray into video games. A project called "Mistborn: Birthright" was in development for a few years before being canceled. Protagonist Kelsier was a guest character in Fortnite, owing to Sanderson's long-standing relationship with Epic.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[“Things Are a Bit Established at the Top” – The Top-5 Played Games in the US in 2025 on PS and Xbox Were the Same as 2024’s]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/top-five-played-games-in-us-2025-playstation-xbox-the-same-as-2024/</link>
            <guid>1398742</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>If you think the problem with video games these days is that everyone plays the same five games all the time, which makes publishers more wary of taking risks, and instead of getting new, creative and innovative games, we get more of the same, then <strong>Circana</strong> analyst and executive director <strong>Mat Piscatella</strong> just gave you some fuel for that argument, as the numbers for the top-five played games in 2025 on PlayStation and on Xbox were the same as the top-five games played on both platforms in 2024.</p>



<p>They're even almost in the exact same order, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3mbraw2dcfc2s">Piscatella reports on Bluesky</a>, with the top five played games in the US on PlayStation, as ranked by percentage of active players, are:</p>



<ol>
<li>Fortnite</li>



<li>Call of Duty</li>



<li>Grand Theft Auto V</li>



<li>Roblox</li>



<li>Minecraft</li>
</ol>



<p>On Xbox, the list is:</p>



<ol>
<li>Fortnite</li>



<li>Call of Duty</li>



<li>Grand Theft Auto V</li>



<li>Minecraft</li>



<li>Roblox</li>
</ol>



<p>All five games are on the list for the most-played games on either platform in 2024, with the PlayStation 2024 list not changing at all, and the only difference on the Xbox 2024 list being that Call of Duty and Fortnite swap places, as do Minecraft and Grand Theft Auto V. But it's still the same five games, seemingly consuming everyone's time on consoles in the United States.</p>







<p>Piscatella followed the news up by saying, "<em>Things are a bit...established...at the top</em>." He also claimed that a more detailed report, including the top-selling games in 2025 in the US, overall and by platform, will arrive on January 22, 2026.</p>



<p>Any new game's biggest competitor is Fortnite, Call of Duty, Minecraft, Grand Theft Auto V, and Roblox. Those are <a href="https://wccftech.com/fortnite-biggest-competitor-threat-video-games-industry/">the five games that are dominating the industry,</a> and the reason why new games have a tough time gaining any traction.</p>



<p>Those are also five free-to-play games (Call of Duty: Warzone), and <a href="https://wccftech.com/tariffs-rising-costs-us-consumers-spending-less-video-games/">as Piscatella has reported before,</a> US consumers are likely to spend less on video games as tariffs and the rising cost of living continue to impact their discretionary spending. </p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-games-of-2025-year-of-the-indie-ish/">2025 might've been the year of indies</a> controlling the conversation and the awards, with Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, Hollow Knight Silksong, Blue Prince, etc, but those are not the games that keep the industry moving. </p>



<p>So if you're the person complaining that we keep getting the same kinds of games over and over again, or that publishers aren't greenlighting new titles for fear that they'll get swallowed up by 'the big five,' then vote with your wallet where you can, and maybe spend a little more time <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-schedule-i-hollow-knight-silksong-battlefield-6-steam-best-selling-new-games-2025/">in the 'indies' section of Steam</a> instead of on Fortnite. It won't be much, but at an individual level, it's one of the best things you can do.</p>
