<p>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is finally in the hands of players worldwide after years of waiting, but players have uncovered that a basic feature is locked behind an Amiibo figure.</p>



<p>18 years after Metroid Prime 3: Corruption was first released, the fourth instalment in the series launched on Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 on December 4, but early impressions are mixed, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-is-the-lowest-reviewed-game-in-the-series/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">critic scores being the lowest in the series</a>.</p>



<p>There’s still time for that to change, however, and user scores may be more positive, but the locking of a basic feature behind a paywall has left one area of the game feeling barren.</p>







<h2 id="h-metroid-prime-4-beyond-desert-music-locked-behind-amiibo-purchase">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond Desert Music Locked Behind Amiibo Purchase</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Locked. Image via Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p>As pointed out by <a href="https://x.com/lukestephens/status/1996340617497227440" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Luke Stephens</a> on Twitter, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond’s music in the desert, an area explored while driving the Vi-O-La bike, is absent unless you purchased the $29.99 Samus Amiibo.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/hardware/amiibo/game/bgw5a_2/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nintendo’s product description</a> lists background music as a perk from owning the Samus Amiibo, along with the ability to activate a shield that will block up to 99 damage and fully restore Samus’ life once per day.</p>



<p>The description doesn’t inform you, however, that without the Amiibo figure, the desert landscape in Metroid Prime 4: Beyond will be eerily silent, and offers nothing if you haven’t splashed out on the figure.</p>



<p>There are also two other Amiibo figures to purchase to get additional bonuses in the game, with the Samus &amp; Vi-O-La figure providing customizable colors, the ability to check total distance travels, and a once-per-day increase to the rate of regeneration for Viola’s Boost Energy.</p>



<p>The final figure, Cyrax, allows you to see the full version of the movies that are shown in fragments throughout the game, once you have completed it, a feature that is otherwise locked behind achieving a 100% scan rate and item collection rate.</p>

                <p>Those waiting for the return of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/" data-ref-id="5000-504255">Diablo 4</a> leaderboards will have to wait a little longer, as the feature has been delayed into 2026.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard announced the delay during its most recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVHjgCsanBE" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Diablo 4 developer update livestream</a>. The new leaderboard system revolves around a new dungeon called The Tower, where players will be able to test their builds and compete for clear times and rewards.</p><p dir="ltr">"This is to make sure we have some stability with the season launch, and then when The Tower shows up, it's online and people are ready to tackle it," associate game director Zaven Haroutunian said regarding the reason for the delay.</p><p dir="ltr">Leaderboards and The Tower were originally set to debut as part of Season 11 on December 11. Instead, Blizzard said the feature will arrive with patch 2.5.2 sometime in the new year. Even when The Tower and leaderboards do arrive, they will technically be in "beta" form, an approach Blizzard hasn't taken before when it comes to developing new features for Diablo 4.</p><p dir="ltr">Delaying The Tower wasn't just in the name of season-launch stability. Haroutunian said it was also to incorporate learnings and feedback from the recent Season 11 public-test-realm, which featured a version of The Tower Haroutunian said was intentionally "rough." Blizzard wanted to test it and make sure it was going in the right direction for the feature before committing to it, he said.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVHjgCsanBE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/CVHjgCsanBE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Now, Blizzard is aiming to refine The Tower based on feedback. One problem Blizzard is looking to fix is to make it so progress orbs dropped by slain enemies will spawn closer to players to require less backtracking. Another problem area is the feeling that players need to "fish" for optimal dungeon layouts before committing to a run, something that was also a problem in Diablo 3.</p><p dir="ltr">Haroutunian said Blizzard is looking to address or remove outliers like certain bosses and or environments that aren't as conducive to a competitive game mode.</p><p dir="ltr">"We want to aim at consistency and make sure the mode is fun, exciting, and competitive over just cramming in visual variety in it just for its own sake," Haroutunian said.</p><p dir="ltr">Haroutunian also addressed feedback that The Tower currently feels too similar to The Pit, another part of Diablo 4's endgame. He said the comparison is completely valid, as The Tower currently is very similar to The Pit, with both modes taking inspiration from Greater Rifts in Diablo 3. Over time, however, the goal is for both The Pit and The Tower to diverge and offer different experiences.</p><p dir="ltr">"The Tower is going to start very similar, because it's starting at the same foundation," Haroutunian said. "Over time, it will change, it will morph, it will be its own thing. And The Pit will suddenly have all this space it's freed up to occupy. It doesn't have to be this pseudo-competitive mode anymore, it can just be whatever it needs to be. It can be as crazy as we want."</p><p dir="ltr">When The Tower does officially arrive, it won't be the first time Diablo 4 has had leaderboards. A similar feature launched with one of Diablo 4's earlier seasons, only to be removed a few months later with the launch of its first expansion, Vessel of Hatred.</p><p dir="ltr">Diablo 4 Season of Divine Intervention begins December 11 and just might be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-season-11-might-be-its-biggest-rework-yet/1100-6535476/" data-ref-id="1100-6535476">the game's biggest rework yet</a>.

            <guid>1372570</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>You’re almost through the first week of December, and you’re a few steps closer to the festive window that we all love. Before you get there, you’ve got a few more NYT Connections puzzles to complete, and naturally, that includes today’s puzzle. Below, I’ve sketched out the best NYT Connections hints and solutions you’ll find anywhere.</p>



<p>If you’re being hampered by today’s puzzle, be sure to read on for the NYT Connections hints you need to get through it and keep your streak running.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-december-4">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (December 4)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #907:</p>



<ul>
<li>DRAW CLOSE</li>



<li>PUZZLE</li>



<li>ROSTRUM</li>



<li>NUZZLE</li>



<li>GUZZLE</li>



<li>IKEA FURNITURE</li>



<li>MUZZLE</li>



<li>LEGO SET</li>



<li>HOLD TIGHT</li>



<li>KNOCK BACK</li>



<li>MODEL</li>



<li>SPOON</li>



<li>SWILL</li>



<li>BEAK</li>



<li>POUND DOWN</li>



<li>PROBOSCIS</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>These are all different ways people might physically draw close to one another for comfort or affection.</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em><em>These words all describe drinking something quickly, often in large amounts or without pause.</em></em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>These are all items that don’t come ready-made — you have to put the pieces together yourself.</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>These words are all different names for the protruding facial structure of animals.</em> </li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, December 4:</p>

            <title><![CDATA[A Console Nobody Has Heard of Just Topped PS5 in Sales in the US]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/console-nex-playground-topped-ps5-sales-us/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Circana’s most recent release of hardware sales in the United States just revealed a tantalizing tidbit about an unknown piece of hardware that’s making waves this holiday season. In a post on social media by Circana’s Mat Piscatella, it was revealed that the <strong>NEX Playground Interactive Gaming System </strong>outsold the PlayStation 5 during the week ending November 22, 2025.</p>



<p>The NEX Playground came in just behind pole position, held by the Nintendo Switch 2 Mario Kart World Bundle, this year’s hottest Christmas gift.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-the-nex-playground">What is the NEX Playground?</h2>



<p>Mat Piscatella’s telling post on social media revealed that the <strong>NEX Playground Interactive Gaming System </strong>beat the PS5 Slim Digital in sales in the United States midway through November, prompting many to ask what the device even is.</p>











<p>The NEX Playground has been around since 2023, but it’s gathering steam now ahead of this year’s holiday season. It’s part of a new line-up of interactive games consoles designed for families and young gamers, allowing them to turn their televisions into engaging experiences without the need for controllers.</p>



<p>It’s like the Kinect, Eye Toy, or PlayStation Camera, but you don’t need a console to make it work, as it <strong>is </strong>the console.</p>



<p>It’s an AI-powered device that sits next to your television, offering a range of games like Fruit Ninja, Bluey Bust-a-Move, NHL Puck Rush, and Barbie Dance Party, all of which encourage young players to get up, get moving, and enjoy video games more interactively. It also has a bolt-on subscription that users can opt into to secure more games.</p>



<p>The NEX Playground costs just $249, which makes it a considerably cheaper option compared to the Nintendo Switch 2 ($500) or the PS5 Slim Digital ($449).</p>



<p>Circana’s Mat Piscatella followed up his simple sales report with a comment that read, ‘MOTION CONTROL IS BACK.’</p>







<p>Are you investing in a NEX Playground Interactive Gaming System for your family this Christmas? If you’re in the market, don’t forget to hang out at the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/holiday-2025/">Insider Gaming Holiday 2025 deals hub</a>, and be sure to hit up the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> to discuss what gaming gifts you’re buying this year.</p>

<p>The collab some fans have been waiting for</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure data-uuid="f2098453b26d0"><a title="Metroid Prime 4: Beyond" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f2098453b26d0/metroid-prime-4-beyond.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>By now, some <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_4_beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> players are <a href="https://youtu.be/SimbP2LpnXg">already rolling the credits</a> and it seems there's been an amusing discovery in the cast section.</p>
<p>It's confirmed Ezra Duke (Sergeant Duke) is voiced by the accomplished actor Jason Kelley...aka Doom Slayer! Yes, Kelley actually was the voice actor behind id Software's legendary character in <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/doom_the_dark_ages">DOOM: The Dark Ages</a>, which was released earlier this year, and he's now voicing a soldier in Samus' latest outing.</p>

<p>The man himself has <a href="https://x.com/Jasonkelley_JK/status/1996311621136973858">even replied to a fan</a>, who requested a "Samus and DOOM" game, while acknowledging the history of the mostly silent protagonists and how they don't actually "say much". Admittedly, this might be as close as fans ever get to seeing Samus and DOOM Slayer in the same game.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"I wouldn't be mad at that pairing. Neither one of us say much.😂"</em></p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="6TAq6m9hxyY" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt6TAq6m9hxyY" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed76f4cewosviy&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>840k</span></a></p>

</blockquote>
<p>In case you missed it, Duke is described on Nintendo's Japanese website as being a "veteran who has survived countless battles with the Space Pirate army". And "his stubborn personality often leads to conflicts with his superiors, but his sincere and compassionate nature make him a reliable presence on the battlefield".</p>
<p>Samus will encounter Duke on her new adventure along with various other Galactic Federation soldiers. You can find out more about each character in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/metroid-prime-4-beyond-meet-the-team">our previous post</a>.</p>
<p>If this has got you wondering about the possibility of DOOM: The Dark Ages coming to the Switch 2 in the future, there's no official word just yet, but the previous Switch generation saw multiple <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/doom_plus_doom_ii">DOOM</a> titles released, including the latest entries. So, hopefully, we see something in the future.</p>
<p>Samus <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/metroid-prime-4-beyond-credits-reveal-a-plethora-of-assist-devs-including-next-level-games">has also got a new voice actor</a> in Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, with Erin Yvette replacing Jennifer Hale.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-good-ending-almost-suggests-sequel/</link>
            <guid>1372555</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Escape from Tarkov has been dominating the extraction shooter space for many years, and midway through November, it hit the long-awaited 1.0 release window that pushed it out as a ‘finished’ game. In the weeks that followed, the game’s best players have busied themselves with completing the game’s all-new story-driven campaign, seen as the ultimate challenge for Tarkov fans.</p>



<p>The first completion came earlier this week, with streamer ‘Tigz’ being dubbed the first in the world to see Tarkov through to the end. Other streamers and players followed, but recently, a Chinese streamer proved to be the first to capture unlocking the game’s best, and reportedly <strong>hardest</strong>, ending – <strong>Savior</strong>.</p>



<p>This was the first <strong>PvP </strong>unlock, while the first PvE unlock, recognized as the world’s first <a href="https://x.com/nikgeneburn/status/1996179962685178266" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">by Battlestate Games</a>, was by a player named Tsukinogi.</p>







<h2 id="h-escape-from-tarkov-s-best-ending-has-been-secured">Escape from Tarkov’s Best Ending Has Been Secured</h2>



<p>On BiliBili, <a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1nE2YBGEWr">an hour-long VOD</a> was posted from the perspective of a Chinese streamer, Youmoxiangche, who goes by the in-game username ‘NeverPlayScav’.</p>



<p>In this video, we saw a tense battle through Terminal rage as the player pushed towards what’s widely believed to be the <strong>best </strong>of Escape from Tarkov’s four endings: Survivor, Fallen, Debtor, and Savior.</p>



<p>The worst endings are <strong>Debtor </strong>and <strong>Fallen</strong>, while <strong>Survivor </strong>is seen as being a middle-of-the-road victory, and <strong>Savior </strong>sits atop the pile as the best outcome. In the Savior ending, the player character is welcomed onto the ZUBR Boat after extracting through Terminal, fighting through Scavs, RUAF, and Black Faction enemies in a PvE environment.</p>



<p>As they’re ushered onto the boat, the vessel’s captain tries to assassinate them, but is caught and killed by a friendly RUAF soldier who assures the player that nobody is left on the boat but allies. As they head topside for a smoke, more bodies are seen being dumped into the river through Tarkov.</p>



<p>At that moment, jets fly overhead and drop what appears to be a <strong>nuclear warhead </strong>on the city of Tarkov, and the soldier quips that they managed to escape just in time. As the image fades to black, the player character receives a unique ring, and the RUAF soldier utters the words that it’s up to them to decide their own fate now.</p>



<p>It almost suggests a sequel of sorts could be coming. The RUAF squad, along with the PMC protagonist, zip off into the sunset, and the soldier says:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>What matters is we’re alive, and now we’ll take down those bastards from TerraGroup. The whole world will know the truth.</p>



<p>From here on, we decide our own fate.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We know that Battlestate Games is working on ‘other games’ in the Escape from Tarkov universe, and that DLC will be delivered now that the 1.0 version of the game is out, but is this our first indicator as to what that might look like?</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Starladder Budapest Major Stage 3 Predictions Are Running Wild]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/starladder-budapest-stage-3-predictions/</link>
            <guid>1372510</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Starladder Budapest Major is unravelling as we speak, and the third stage is set to kick off <strong>today</strong>. The predictions for the third stage of this $1.25 million Counter-Strike 2 tournament are getting too close to call, but there are some frontrunners. It’s shaping up to be a brutal proving ground for the game’s heaviest hitters, but how might the tournament’s underdogs fare?</p>



<p>This final Swiss Stage will decide the eight playoff contenders, and the earliest signs we have point to the likes of NAVI, FaZe, and Vitality as frontrunners, which many might have predicted, but the likes of Passion UA and 3DMAX still have the potential for an underdog upset.</p>







<h2 id="h-who-will-make-it-to-the-playoffs-in-budapest">Who Will Make It To The Playoffs in Budapest?</h2>



<p>Stage two of the Budapest Major was a pretty dramatic affair. The squads lined up needing three wins to proceed to the third stage, and the likes of NAVI and FaZe Clan both produced perfect records, effortlessly walking into the next phase.</p>



<p>The three ‘underdog’ sides in this event, Team Liquid, Passion UA, and 3DMAX, all produced decisive last-minute wins, eliminating Astralis, M80, and NiP in a sweep that few saw coming.</p>



<p>As we go into the third stage, these are the teams lined up to compete:</p>



<p><strong>Invited</strong>:</p>



<ul>
<li>Vitality</li>



<li>G2</li>



<li>Spirit</li>



<li>MOUZ</li>



<li>FURIA</li>



<li>Falcons</li>



<li>PaiN</li>



<li>MongolZ</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Stage Two:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>NAVI</li>



<li>FaZe</li>



<li>Liquid</li>



<li>Passion UA</li>



<li>3DMAX</li>



<li>Imperial</li>



<li>B8</li>



<li>Parivision</li>
</ul>



<p>The matches lined up for stage three are already looking tasty, but all eyes will be on Vitality vs FaZe as the pick of the bunch. This is FaZe’s resurgence versus Vitality’s consistency, following a year of incredible results with ZywOo at the helm.</p>



<p>In terms of predictions, it’s easy to see NAVI, FaZe Clan, Vitality, and G2 Esports in the playoffs, with Liquid, UA, and 3DMAX coming in as dark horses.</p>



<p>The predictions don’t end with this article, though. Insider Gaming, together with the international betting brand GG.BET, brings you to the heart of unforgettable moments of the Starladder Major Budapest 2025.

<h2 id="h-pick-warrior-as-your-first-job">Pick Warrior as Your First Job</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Octopath-Traveler-0-Warrior.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>The Warrior Job is the best early-game choice for beginners</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>While each Job has its own uses, the Warrior stands out as the best starting Job, especially if Octopath Traveler 0 is your first entry in the series. Besides offering solid power and defense and a great selection of offense-oriented skills, the Warrior can wield Swords and Spears, two weapon options that won't be available for your party for some time due to the characters that can be recruited in the first few hours of the adventure.</p>



<p>Additionally, many of the enemies you will encounter in the first chapters of the Master of Power, Master of Wealth and Master of Fame quests are weak against Swords, so having a Warrior capable of taking advantage of this weakness will prove to be invaluable as you get acquainted with the game's mechanics.</p>



<h2 id="h-pick-scholar-as-your-second-job">Pick Scholar as Your Second Job</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Octopath-Traveler-0-Scholar.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>The Scholar works great as a secondary Job for your protagonist in the early game</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Compared to the Warrior, the Scholar Job is not a great starter Job, but it's a great secondary Job. While the Boost system cannot be used to increase the number of times an elemental spell can hit enemies, these properties are just as important to Break enemies.</p>



<p>As Octopath Traveler 0 allows you to switch the main character's Jobs right from the main menu (Skills - Protagonist's Job ), you can easily adapt to the enemies you are facing in a specific area by switching between Warrior and Scholar as required, letting the other starting characters cover the other weapon-based weaknesses and the Ice and Dark elements the Scholar cannot hit.</p>



<p>Unlocking a second Job is also very easy. All you need to do is learn three skills with the Job you have unlocked last. So, to have the Scholar as your second job, all you have to do is learn three skills for the Warrior for a total of 430 JP (30 JP for the first skill, 100 for the second, 300 for the third), regardless of which skill is unlocked.</p>



<p>As a side bonus, the Scholar's first Support Skill, Study Foe, also reveals one undiscovered weakness for any enemy at the start of battle, making this Job a great one to run with certain party configurations.</p>







<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Octopath-Traveler-0-Quests-Menu-1.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>The Quests menu comes with some really useful features</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The Quests section in the main menu is really useful for a couple of reasons. Its primary purpose is to list all of the available quests, but it has some additional functions that make it even more useful.</p>



<ul>
<li>By pressing the Cross (PlayStation), A (Xbox) / B (Nintendo Switch) button while a quest is highlighted, you can not only track any quest but also fast travel to its location, cutting down the time needed to start it.</li>



<li>Besides listing all the known available quests, the Quests menu also lists available quests that you haven't discovered yet. Its icon also indicates if it is a regular side quest or a Traveler focused quest that will allow you to recruit a new party member.</li>
</ul>



<p>For these reasons, always check the Quests menu whenever you have completed a main story quest. This allows you to engage with side content and help you achieve completion quickly.</p>



<h2 id="h-always-use-path-actions-whenever-possible">Always use Path Actions Whenever Possible</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Octopath-Traveler-0-Path-Actions-1.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Path Actions should be used every time you reach a new town</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Path Actions return in Octopath Traveler 0, and they are more useful than ever before. By pressing the Square (PlayStation)/X (Xbox)/Y (Nintendo Switch) button near any applicable NPC, it is possible to Inquire to learn more about them, Entice them to purchase or obtain items after a fight, Hire them as Combat Helpers or Invite them to live in Wishvale. </p>



<p>As these NPCs sometimes offer some rather useful items such as Masteries that can be used to equip skills to characters and powerful gear, you will want to use Path Action interactions on every possible character. Depending on your current level of Power, Wealth and Fame, your interactions may fail and may force you to restore your reputation at a nearby Tavern, but if you handle this properly and don't attempt interactions that have a high failure chance, you can take great advantage of these mechanics at all times during the adventure</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Octopath-Traveler-0-Battle-Rewards.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Performing well in battle is rewarded with some great bonuses</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Octopath Traveler 0 rewards your combat performance by providing EXP, JP and Leaf (money) bonuses depending on how well you do.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><td><strong>Condition</strong></td><td><strong>Reward</strong></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Overkill/Break</strong></td><td>EXP Bonus</td></tr><tr><td><strong>1-Turn Kill</strong></td><td>JP Bonus</td></tr><tr><td><strong>No Damage Win</strong></td><td>Leaf Bonus</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>As such, you should always look into completing battles after breaking enemies in a single turn. This is difficult to achieve against elite enemies and bosses, but if you do so every random encounter against mobs, the rewards will pile up, make your characters stronger, and allow you to engage more with the game's Job and Mastery systems.</p>



<h2 id="h-don-t-sleep-on-food">Don't Sleep on Food </h2>

<p>Although items are as important as ever to restore HP and SP and heal status ailments quickly, you really shouldn't discount how important Food is. These items, which can be cooked from the Tavern in Wishvale, provide a variety of bonuses for a set number of turns, ranging from stat increases to automatic HP and SP restoration. As the selection of available Food increases as you play the game, make sure to check out at the Tavern what can be cooked to gain a sound advantage against all sorts of enemies.</p>

			<p>Octopath Traveler 0 is the third main entry in the series that launched the popular HD-2D visual style, combining high-quality sprites with 3D environments. However, the game based on the mobile game Champions of the Continent is more than a great-looking game, as its web of interconnected mechanics, in conjunction with its great story, makes for a very engaging experience.</p>

<h2 id="h-gameplay-overview">Gameplay Overview</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Octopath-Traveler-0-field.jpg"></a><figcaption><em data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">Octopath Traveler</em><em> </em><em data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">0 twists the series' formula in some interesting ways </em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Octopath Traveler 0 is a traditional Japanese role-playing game where the player takes control of a custom character embarking in a journey all over Orsterra (the world of the original Octopath Traveler) to defeat three powerful villains - The Master of Power Tytos, The Master of Wealth Herminia and The Master of Fame Auguste - and save the world.</p>



<p>Compounding the game's traditional traversal mechanics is a turn-based combat system that pits up to eight party members against all sorts of enemies. Breaking the enemy using attacks with specific properties and boosting the efficacy of regular attacks and skills are the core mechanics upon which combat is based.</p>



<p>Octopath Traveler 0 also introduces town-building mechanics that let players influence the restoration of Wishvale, and unlock important upgrades via new facilities, including a monster arena.</p>



<h2 id="h-getting-started">Getting Started</h2>

<p>Octopath Traveler 0 is the first entry in the series to feature a single main character as opposed to the eight characters of past games. This character can be fully customized at the beginning of the game.</p>



<p>During character creation, you can determine the character's appearance, Learned Skill, Favorite Dish, and three belongings. </p>

<p>The Octopath series' signature Job System returns in Octopath Traveler 0, but with some twists. Only the main character can switch between the usual eight jobs - <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Warrior, Merchant, Thief, Apothecary, Hunter, Cleric, Scholar, Dancer.</strong></p>



<p>Every other character, or traveler, comes with a set Job that cannot be changed. However, the Mastery system allows you to equip a set number of Action and Passive skills for superior customization.</p>

<p>Octopath Traveler 0 employs a classic turn-based combat system where the player and the enemy take turns to attack, use skills and items, cast spells, or defend. Besides featuring the Break and Boost mechanics of the previous two games, the new entry in the series expands the combat party to eight total members, opening up a lot of interesting options.</p>

<p>Octopath Traveler 0 features over 30 characters, or travelers, each one coming with a set Job, which is a unique variation of one of the eight Jobs the protagonist can use. Many of these travelers are entirely optional, requiring you to complete dedicated quests to recruit.</p>

<p>Octopath Traveler 0 is the first entry in the series to feature town-building mechanics that allow you to have an actual hand in the restoration of Wishvale and the management of its residents. You will unlock more facilities and customization options over the course of the game to make the village truly your own while enjoying some great benefits.</p>

<p>Featuring a single protagonist as opposed to the usual eight, Octopath Traveler 0 does away with the eight individual storylines to offer a more focused experience. Following the prologue, you will be able to take on the Master of Power, Master of Wealth, and Master of Fame quests as well as the Rekindling the Flame quest focused on the restoration of Wishvale.</p>



<p>After completing the Master of quests, you will be able to begin the Finale arc, which brings the story to its conclusion.</p>

<p>While mildly complex, all of these mechanics come together really well in the game. You can learn more about this by checking out our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/octopath-traveler-0-review-in-progress-a-masterclass-in-villany/"><strong>Octopath Traveler 0 review.</strong></a></p>

<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/sonic/related-articles:194766 @ 1764840851 -->

<li>CR JASPER</li>
<li>CR x SONIC</li>
</ul>
<h3>Gadget Additions and Adjustments in Ver. 1.2.0</h3>
<p>Since launch, we’ve observed two common strategies emerge in online matches:</p>
<ol>
<li>Using drift-type gadgets to maintain top positions.</li>
<li>Staying in 9<sup>th</sup> – 12<sup>th</sup> place and using item control gadgets to get powerful items late in the race and quickly jump to top positions.</li>
</ol>
<p>Both strategies made it very difficult for those in 4<sup>th</sup> – 8<sup>th</sup> place to make a comeback.</p>
<p>Therefore, in Ver.1.2.0, we’ve added and strengthened support-type and item-type gadgets to make it easier to make comebacks from 4<sup>th</sup> – 8<sup>th</sup> place.</p>
<p>We will continue monitoring online gadget usage and win rates to adjust balance going forward.</p>
<h3>New Gadgets</h3>
<p>We’ve added 6 gadgets!*</p>
<ul>
<li>Item Control Type
<ul>
<li>Lucky Pair</li>
<li>Double Down</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Support Type
<ul>
<li>Ring Mercy</li>
<li>Damage Mercy</li>
<li>Item Mercy</li>
<li>Strong Finish</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>*Gadgets can be obtained once your Gadget Plate reaches "Silver Plate" or higher.</p>
<figure data-uuid="8b9db360f5900"><a title="Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8b9db360f5900/sonic-racing-crossworlds.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: SEGA</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The following gadgets which were previously distributed as Festival rewards can now be purchased with Donpa Tickets from the gadget customization screen**:</p>
<ul>
<li>Boost Character Kit</li>
<li>Power Character Kit</li>
<li>Handling Character Kit</li>
<li>Comeback Kit</li>
<li>Sea Dog Kit</li>
</ul>
<p>**These can be purchased if your gadget plate is “Master Plate” or higher</p>
<h3>Gadget Adjustments</h3>
<ul>
<li>Quick Recovery
<ul>
<li>Further reduced downtime after taking a hit.</li>
<li>Previously, Quick Recovery provided a large benefit when hit, but losing rings often led to lower final positions. The gadget has been adjusted to allow more mid-position endurance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Acceleration Machine Kit
<ul>
<li>Recovery timing further reduced to align with Quick Recovery’s adjustments.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Wisp Chance UP
<ul>
<li>Reduced the influence on item probability.</li>
<li>Previously, Wisp Chance UP made it too easy to collect powerful items before the race’s end and aim for top positions. We’ve dialed this back a bit.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Invincible Start
<ul>
<li>Vehicles now flash just before the effect ends to make timing clearer.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Other Adjustments</h3>
<ul>
<li>Adjusted the appearance of Silver and Blaze’s AI skins and the color of Race Park rivals “Team Dimension,” as they could be mistaken for Invincible state.
<ul>
<li>For the eagle-eyed, the new color scheme is based on the “Turquoise Blue” aura Silver the Hedgehog emits when activating his abilities!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Improved machine handling after collisions with other machines in water areas.</li>
<li>Improved directional input detection to make it easier to use items in the intended direction while drifting.</li>
<li>Adjusted race communication to prioritize syncing information that affects race progression, improving correct reflection of Invincibility such as Ultimate Charge activation.</li>
<li>Strengthened anti-cheat measures for races and race results in online play such as Global Match on PC.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Concerning Anti-Cheat Measures</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>With Patch Ver.1.2.0, we have strengthened our anti-cheat measures to ensure a fair and secure online environment. These improvements focus primarily on countering cheating behaviors that give players an unfair advantage in <strong>World Match</strong> and <strong>Time Trial</strong>.</p>
<p>If cheating activity continues to increase, we may be required to consider additional anti-cheat measures across a broader range of systems, depending on the situation. To ensure that all players can enjoy the game safely and fairly, we kindly ask for your continued cooperation in maintaining <strong>a</strong> <strong>fair and secure gameplay environment.</strong></p>
<p>We will continue to listen to the community and make ongoing improvements to protect the player experience and ensure that the game remains a healthy and enjoyable environment for everyone.</p>
<p>Thank you once again for your continued support of <strong>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed Festival announcements showing old information before events began.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where auto-acceleration failed to activate for several seconds after manual input.</li>
<li>Improved smoothness and visibility of left/right movement in item warning display.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where Charge Dash would not activate when passing through Transform Rings in mid-air drift state using Dash type.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where attacks from the “King Bomb Boo” item could be avoided using Charge Jump or Handle Assist.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where “King Bomb Boo” item attacks in mid-air could cause fire pillar direction to be incorrect.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where using the “Laser” item caused Dash type machine appearance to break at certain times.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where using the “Boost” item obtained during Boost Frenzy at the exact end of Frenzy could make the item unusable.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where using the “Tornado” item during Boost Frenzy could make items unusable until Frenzy ended.</li>
<li>Adjusted Dash Gate placement in Dash Gate Frenzy on certain courses where more gates than intended were placed.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in course “Wonder Museum” where machines could get stuck in the Tornado.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in course “Sky Road” or “Minecraft World” where using “Slicer” or “Homing Punch” when crossing Travel Rings or End Portals could cause incorrect tracking.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in course “Steampunk City” where colliding from the side with ground where trains run could cause machines to sink into the ground.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in course “White Cave” where using “Drill” in cave areas could cause machines to sink into the ground.</li>
<li>Fixed several other gameplay-related bugs.</li>
</ul>

This area still includes enemies, hazards, and items just like usual, but you won’t run into other players. You can replay this area as much as you want, but please note: your Body Rank won’t increase while you’re inside. Keep that in mind before you dive in!</li><li><strong>Radar Update</strong> – It will soon be much easier to tell when another player is nearby. Previously, enemies and players appeared the same on the radar, which made it hard to know what you were walking into. With the upcoming update, players will be clearly marked as players, so you’ll always know exactly who you’re dealing with. This feature won’t be available at launch, but it’s actively in development.</li><li><strong>Escape Pods</strong> – We’ve increased the number of Escape Pods and adjusted their placement so players can return once the right conditions are met. The tutorial also wasn’t doing a great job of explaining how the Escape Pod works, so we improved that section to make everything easier to understand.</li><li><strong>Motion Blur</strong> – We also heard a lot of feedback about motion blur. Many players mentioned that it made things hard to see, so we took that seriously. We’ve improved the overall visual clarity, not just the motion blur, to make everything easier on the eyes and reduce strain. These updates will be ready for release.</li><li><strong>Enemy Behavior</strong> – On the combat side, a number of improvements have been made. Enemy behavior, animations, and spawn patterns were adjusted, and weapon balance, combo flow, and attack range were tuned to match. The goal is to make battles feel more satisfying and to reward players who master the game’s mechanics. Overall, the combat experience should feel smoother, fairer, and a lot more fun.</li></ul><p><strong>Roadmap Overview</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Season Structure</strong> – <em>LET IT DIE: INFERNO</em> will follow a seasonal format, with each season lasting roughly three months. Season 1 will run through February, and Season 2 will begin around March.</li><li><strong>Season Reset</strong> – At the start of each new season, we’ll be implementing a reset. Certain progress will stay intact, such as expanded character slots, storage, and inventory capacity. However, things like collected items, SPLithium-based mastery progress, and other in-run progression will be reset and cleared out once per season.</li><li><strong><a title="Genres > Crafting [47 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/crafting">Crafting</a> <a title="Companies > Enhance [34 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/enhance">Enhance</a>ments</strong> – The game includes a blueprint-based crafting system, and while we can’t share all the details yet, we are planning a significant upgrade to crafting in Season 2.</li></ul><!-- AD: content -->

In this open-world <a title="Genres > RPG [17,832 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg">RPG</a>, you are an Elemancer who refuses to bow. Infused with elemental powers and a heart of vengeance, you will dethrone them all. You will rise to be the God Slayer.</p><p><strong>The God Fall</strong></p><p>A long time ago, the Celestials created the world and all its inhabitants. They designed the creatures to cultivate an energy known as qi throughout their lifetimes. Upon death, this enriched qi would be passed to the Celestial realm, empowering them and granting them eternal life.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>However, some curious humans discovered how to harness qi for themselves, transforming it into elemental powers—fire, water, earth, metal, and wood. These practitioners became known as Elemancers. The Celestials were outraged, viewing this as a misuse of what was rightfully theirs. To send a message, they launched a swift and brutal assault on the Zhou Kingdom, the mightiest in the land. In one night, the king and many Elemancers were hunted down and slaughtered. This day became infamously known as the God Fall.</p><p><strong>The Elemeancer</strong></p><p>You play as Cheng, whose family was brutally slain by the Celestials during the God Fall. Now, you must embark on a quest to save your people and avenge your loved ones.</p><p>To achieve this, you will learn to harness and enhance your elemental powers, acquire new skills from ancient scrolls and elemental masters, and refine the flow of qi within you. With dedication, you will gain the power to challenge even the mightiest Celestials.</p><p>In this world, elemental powers interact dynamically: fire consumes wood, water extinguishes fire, steam rises from boiling water, and earth can obstruct. Your approach to utilizing these elemental interactions in battle is entirely up to you!</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_1011128"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>The Star Fall Society</strong></p><p>Although the Celestials have long been revered as creation gods by the people, their <a title="Genres > Action [3,249 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>s during the God Fall left profound scars on society. Like Cheng, many individuals suffered at the hands of these deities, yet fear keeps the majority in submission.</p><p>However, some brave souls have risen to oppose the conquerors. One such group is the Star Fall Society, led by the wise and enigmatic “<a title="Companies > Mas [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mas">Mas</a>ter,” supported by a cadre of skilled Elemancers. Their objective is to overthrow the Celestials and reclaim the fate of humanity. In Cheng, they find a willing ally in their cause.</p><p>The Star Fall Society will do whatever it takes to kick the Celestials out of this world.</p><p><strong>The Capital of Zhou</strong></p><p>The game takes place mostly in the capital city of the Zhou Kingdom. It is located at the mouth of two mighty rivers empyting into the Eastern Sea. The city is at its height in steam technology, with an assortment of airships, steamboats, monorails, and steam vehicles. A fortunate few in the upper class now savor the miracle of air-conditioned homes and mechanical washing drums, while in the poor neighborhoods the vast majority still toil in soot-blackened factories or bow beneath the weight of noble privilege.</p><p>In this city with multiple factions each with their own interests at heart. You must cultivate allies, trade in favors, and bribe the right officials to even get the tiniest advantage against the Celestial army and their collaborators. But beware, eyes are everywhere, a single mistake could mean the end of everything you hold dear.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the trailers below.

			<p>Pathea Games, the studio behind the 'My Time At' titles, just unveiled their most ambitious game yet, an open world steampunk fantasy action RPG titled The God Slayer. It's only the latest Chinese developer to go full triple-A action RPG after Game Science (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/black-myth-wukong-a-compelling-journey-into-chinese-tradition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Myth: Wukong</a>), Leenzee Games (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/wuchang-fallen-feathers-unleash-the-madness/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</a>), Ultizero Games (Lost Soul Aside, although that one didn't turn out so well), and S-GAME for the upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/phantom-blade-zero-qa-dev-says-bosses-are-the-games-highlights-confirms-hardware-ray-tracing-ps5-specs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Phantom Blade Zero</a>.</p>



<p>You can read an overview of The God Slayer <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-god-slayer-is-an-open-world-steampunk-action-rpg-from-the-makers-of-my-time-series" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in our dedicated article</a>. Here, we're publishing an exclusive interview with Pathea's Business Development Director, Yongjin (Aaron) Deng, who kindly answered our questions immediately after the remote presentation.</p>



<p>The God Slayer is targeting a launch sometime around 2027 on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X, though Deng also admitted that the game could land around the debut of the new PlayStation and Xbox consoles. If that happens, the studio aims to be there as well. </p>

<p><strong>What were the challenges you encountered while transitioning from My Time at Portia/Sandrock to The God Slayer?</strong></p>



<p>I think from our point of view, making the My Time games and even the games before My Time, we have always been making open world RPGs. We had a lot of experience while making the My Time series, which were smaller maps of 2x2 kilometers with a small town in the center, but it was still an open world RPG. All the rules, all the difficulties of making an open world RPG were still there. I think our experience making those games really helped us in planning and executing for The God Slayer. Now, this game is<br>using the Unreal Engine, so we did switch engines, but still, the hardest part of making open world game is the planning, the art pipeline, and stuff like that, and I think making the My Time series really helped us. Still, we have a way bigger team making this game, so we are learning how to do management of a bigger team on the go. But the core developers all came from our past games. The cohesiveness of the team itself is really helping us overcome some of the difficulties.</p>



<p><strong>Why did you go with a set character instead of allowing players to create their own?</strong></p>



<p>I think it's easier to tell a story when the character is fixed. So, in this sense, we're focusing more of our<br>energy on just making everything right, making everything tight. So, this time, we are going with a set character. By focusing on just making this character believable and making the character's relationships with other characters believable, it will be easier for us to finish and polish this game, you know, in a sense that probably we wouldn't be able to do if we spread out too many systems for ourselves.</p>



<p><strong>You mentioned that The God Slayer is an action RPG. What are your game's key RPG elements, as far as you're concerned?</strong></p>



<p>For us, it's about getting two things right. One is the character growth. That's pretty much what an RPG is, right? You have to have character growth, either in the skill sets, leveling up, or in the story, where the character grows. Those two, we're trying to get right by combining them. What I mean is that the protagonist is going to start out in the story as pretty much a nobody, someone who's never been<br>challenged before, and then this event, the God Fall, happens, right? And his family dies in front of him. At this point, as a character, you can go two ways. You can give up, or you can face that challenge and take it on. And so by taking on this challenge, we are setting the character off on a journey, but a lot of the decisions and the emotions have to be felt by the player. It's not just about, oh, the character is feeling that. It's about, okay, how do we make sure that there are characters around the player that they actually like and then we go off and kill them, or we go off and I don't know, like, they face some challenge. At that point, you would want to help that character. As a player, you would think, 'I want to help that character.' Or as a player, if the enemy does something really bad and is really evil and we show that, not tell, show, or the player plays through that. </p>



<p>Then they will understand. This is the reason I'm going up against this enemy and want to beat this enemy. The player has to feel that emotion. On top of that, we have the skill sets. As you go through the game, you learn better martial arts skills that can help you use those elements. You can focus on one element at a time, or you can focus on all of them. If you just use your skill points on the water element, then your water becomes more powerful much faster than if you spread the points out to all the elements. We have five elements, right? But the wood element is actually a passive element. That means it's used for upgrading your HP, your speed, your strength, stuff like that. It's not an attack element.</p>



<p>There's only going to be four attack elements because there's only four face buttons on a controller. So you press the left shoulder button to switch between different elements. We want you to be able to switch elements while you're fighting. You can upgrade that as you find scrolls or meet a master throughout the game. So you can upgrade your skill set. Those two are the main RPG gameplay elements that we want the players to be able to figure out and engage with.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/4e-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>'We're going to have two different modes for this game. One is the story mode, which is like the casual mode. For the casual mode, we're going to keep it simple. You can overlevel. The main bottlenecks in The God Slayer are the bosses, right? So, you can overlevel and you beat the bosses more easily. I think that's fine for story mode. But for the challenge mode, it becomes more like an action game.'</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Some RPGs level up the enemies alongside the player character, while others don't. Where do you stand with your game on this key design choice?</strong></p>



<p>We're going to have two different modes for this game. One is the story mode, which is like the casual mode. For the casual mode, we're going to keep it simple. You can overlevel. The main bottlenecks in The God Slayer are the bosses, right? So, you can overlevel and you beat the bosses more easily. I think that's fine for story mode. But for the challenge mode, it becomes more like an action game. So, in that mode, we're probably going to tie the player's level to the difficulty of the enemies so that everything's a challenge. But we haven't completely designed or decided on the challenge mode, although that is what we want to do for the challenge mode. For sure, though, there's going to be two modes for that.</p>



<p><strong>You mentioned that there would be choices and side content in The God Slayer. Is there a lot of it, and what's the extent of the consequences?</strong></p>



<p>We're going to try to go as far as our budget takes us, but I think the point is, design-wise, the main plot is somewhat linear. There's not going to be multiple endings because, as I said, our budget is only that big. So, we want to finish it and make it good. That's our priority. But I think for a lot of the side quests, even important side quests, there are going to be multiple ways to do stuff. And they actually do influence our main quest. Like, they can make it easier or harder, depending on whether the character is on your side or not. Let me give you an example. In the story, there's a point where you want to get into a building and if you're able to influence whoever's controlling that building and make them your friend or at least someone who's friendly to you, then you can ask that person at a certain point to just take his guards away from that building, and then for that night you can just go and there's no guards. That's how relations can influence quests.</p>



<p>That's a very simplistic example. There's going to be more complicated examples, but they do influence how you play the game and, later on, how you set up missions and stuff like that. They do influence that. This is one of our ways of making sure that the players will want to play the side quests. A lot of players just want to run through the main quest, but playing the side quests will give you different feels and different results regarding the main mission. As for NPCs, there are also quests that you can do for them that increase your relationship points with them.</p>



<p><strong>Is there a romance system in the game?</strong></p>



<p>Well, there are going to be characters in this game story-wise that might be a romance target, but I don't<br>think we're going to allow... Well, I'm not going to say no to that, but at least right now, that's not a major part of our planning.</p>

So, we want to finish it and make it good. That's our priority. But I think for a lot of the side quests, even important side quests, there are going to be multiple ways to do stuff. And they actually do influence our main quest.'</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>You described The God Slayer as a steampunk fantasy game. Will there be any mech or vehicle that players can command at some point?</strong></p>



<p>That's going to be a no. The reason for that is very simple. It's because the player's ability to traverse the world is already very overpowered, because you pretty much get the fire element at the start of the game. With the fire element, as you saw in the gameplay, you can jump anywhere pretty much and go fast anywhere. On top of that, you have fast travel. You can ride the subway, you can take buses, you can do that. So at a certain point, we thought adding vehicles to this game would be pretty much overkill. And because we already want the player to enjoy the current fire-based traversal system and we don't want to add more to it just to complicate things.</p>



<p><strong>You hinted at some simulation elements. Does that mean the time of day impacts gameplay?</strong></p>



<p>Yes, some of the missions are dependent on the time cycle. Maybe someone gets off work at 7 PM, then you can sleep through it or you can do something else and come back at 7 PM. Not only that, but you actually have two identities. You wear the mask to hide your identity, or else they're going to find out who you are right away. In the city, you do have an unmasked, well, not occupation, but identity that's unmasked, like Batman. So when you do missions, you do want to wear your mask.</p>



<p><strong>I'm guessing there will be a skill tree in The God Slayer, correct?</strong></p>



<p>Yep. For upgrading your powers and skills, you get points as you fight the enemies, right? Then you can spread the points to different elements to upgrade the skill tree. But some skills come from finding scrolls in this world or finding a master who can train you for a certain skill set. Some of them are given through the main story, some through side quests, and for others, you just have to explore the world. If the player wants to upgrade all the skills, it's going to take a long time. But if you just want to focus on one element, it might be faster. But it really depends on what the player wants because we do want it so that the player is able to select what elements they want to use. If you just want to do fire and water mostly, then you can just upgrade those, and it's fine. You can beat the game. If you only use water, you can still beat the game, but it will be more effective and easier for the player if they utilize all the elements, depending on the different situations. But it's really up to the player.</p>



<p><strong>Are there going to be companions to help the main character on specific missions?</strong></p>



<p>Yes, you do have companions on some of the missions, and also, you actually join an organization that's like the Resistance against the Celestials. At first, someone else will give the commands, but eventually the<br>player will be able to give some commands in the organization for what they want to do next.</p>



<p><strong>What's the current state of the game?</strong></p>



<p>I think we're probably in a Pre-Alpha state where we're filling out everything. We're adding all the assets,<br>adding everything to the world, making sure all the mechanics are working completely. Yeah, we're pretty much at that stage. So, we have a lot of the mechanics done. We have the overworld mechanics mostly done. Now we're just adding assets to the overworld, and we're adding all the story segments. So we're at that stage. I think we will know for sure the exact release date by the end of next year.</p>



<p><strong>So, maybe The God Slayer will be ready by late 2027, just in time for the rumored release window of the next consoles from Sony and Microsoft.</strong></p>



<p>Yeah, we don't have the dev kits for those yet. But that's what we heard and I think that's in our plans, because we want to be on as many platforms as possible..</p>



<p><strong>I must finish with an inquiry on your stance on AI. Are you using it to help make the game?</strong></p>



<p>I think the only AI we use is when we're iterating. Like, for example, we say okay, we want this character to be a female salesperson, and then we'll try to use AI to go online to search for different models and stuff like that, and then after that, we just do it ourselves. I think overall, our developers don't want to use AI too much. First of all, you don't see a lot of Asian steampunk examples out there, so the examples that AI<br>gives us are weird if I can put it that way. So, a lot of the stuff we actually have to think about ourselves and start from scratch. Overall, that's helped us keep the world setting as well as the characters grounded. Um, so I think as far as like for us, I think we're not using too much AI. It's at least for now is the correct way to go.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Today, Chinese developer Pathea Games, known mainly for the 'My Time' series (though they also recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/rocket-league-minus-cars-f2p-superball-pathea-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launched the 3v3 sports game Superball</a>), announces The God Slayer, an intriguing open world steampunk action roleplaying game.</p>



<p>Wccftech had the opportunity to watch a one-on-one media presentation where Business Development Director Yongjin (Aaron) Deng introduced the game and answered our questions. Deng told us that this project has been in full production for about a year and a half, and now the studio feels the time is right to unveil it to the world.</p>



<p>The setting is a fictional, Ming-inspired Asian metropolis named Zhou, which blends Chinese cultural aesthetics with steampunk technology and a Qi-based elemental magic system (earth, metal, fire, water, wood). The world of The God Slayer was created long ago by powerful beings known only as Celestials. They didn't do it out of the goodness of their hearts, though: they simply needed living beings to cultivate Qi that they would then harvest to keep themselves eternal.</p>



<p>After the humans learn to channel Qi for their own gains, and right in the middle of a technological revolution (imagine airships, steamboats, and poor people toiling in factories for the good of the noble and wealthy), the Celestials quickly retaliate, destroying the strongest kingdom and its best Elemancers in a single night. This cataclysmic event would later be known as the God Fall, and it also kickstarts the story of the protagonist, Cheng, whose family is slaughtered during this fated night.</p>



<p>His ultimate goal is to slay the Supreme Celestial, but before that happens, he'll have to defeat his minions. The game, estimated to last around 40 hours of gameplay in an average playthrough and probably a lot more for completionists, will consist of seven Chapters, each featuring a pivotal boss fight at its conclusion. During a Chapter, the world is freely explorable, and the world simulation keeps going, but the main storyline won't advance until you've defeated the end boss.</p>



<p>The game is also deeply systemic, a bit like Pathea's previous titles. For example, you could distract a dog by throwing them some meat, or if you kill a secondary character, they won't show up later. Missions in The God Slayer will allow players to approach them in multiple ways. For instance, players are free to attack all enemies head-on; they can bribe guards to look the other way, activate elemental powers to create diversions / distract enemies, pathfind usually hidden side routes, and utilize alternative means to achieve their objective.</p>

<p>As an example, a player could go directly to fight a boss, but the boss would have an army around him and it would turn into a hard fight. The player can level up the character's skills to fight him more effectively, but it will still be challenging. Or, the player could create a diversion by setting up a bomb somewhere, attracting a lot of the boss's army so that the enemies protecting him are gone or lessened. Or, the player could spend some money, buy some poison, sneak into this location and somehow feed this poison to the enemies and the boss and then still explode the bomb somewhere as a diversion. Now, when the player faces the boss, he is going to have a poison-based debuff and the enemies are going to be missing because they've been distracted.</p>



<p>The developers of The God Slayer also promise a thrilling story-driven campaign filled with interesting characters and intriguing twists and turns, where players choose their allies, inspire people across the city, and overthrow scheming gods to bring justice to the world. The combat is melee-focused and based on the marriage of classic Chinese martial arts and elements. Cheng can combine water, earth, metal, and fire to create powerful attacks and weaponry, to be used both in direct combat and to exploit the environment. The elemental powers also logically interact with each other; for example, using fire on a water puddle creates steam and dries up the water. </p>



<p>The game, which is powered by Unreal Engine 5, doesn't have a release date yet, but <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-god-slayer-qa-from-our-point-of-view-weve-always-been-making-open-world-rpgs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">based on what we learned in our exclusive interview with Yongjin (Aaron) Deng</a>, 2027 seems a likely bet, probably toward the latter half. PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S and X have been confirmed, but by then, there could be new consoles, too, and Pathea has suggested they'd make the game available on those as well.</p>
