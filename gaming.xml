            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/valorant-escalation-mode-disabled<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Riot Games has announced that it has indefinitely disabled the&nbsp;<em>Valorant&nbsp;</em>Escalation gameplay mode while it investigates "an issue".&nbsp;</p>
<p>Speaking <a href="https://x.com/VALORANT/status/1812940198076162373" rel="noopener" target="_blank">via X</a> (formerly known as Twitter), Riot says Escalation won't be available across any of the platforms on which&nbsp;<em>Valorant&nbsp;</em>is playable while the studio investigates this "issue". It doesn't provide any further information regarding what the issue might be.</p>
<p>Riot also says that Escalation will be back in Patch 9.03, but we're not sure when that will be landing either. Judging by the timing of previous&nbsp;<em>Valorant&nbsp;</em>updates, you can expect to wait around a month for it, so it looks like Escalation won't be back until at least mid-August.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/valorant-escalation-disabled-lotus-console.jpg?itok=eTN65j5m 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/valorant-escalation-disabled-lotus-console.jpg?itok=eKD8VrdE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Valorant&nbsp;</em>players on console are getting the Lotus map with the game's latest update.</figcaption></figure><p>Given that Riot hasn't provided any further details, it looks like we'll just have to wait and see what the issue was that caused Escalation to be disabled.</p>
<p>In the meantime, you can pore over the <a href="https://playvalorant.com/en-us/news/game-updates/valorant-patch-notes-901/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">patch notes for Patch 9.01</a>, which was released earlier today. This being a relatively incremental patch, there aren't many earth-shattering changes, but there are plenty of bug fixes and balance adjustments.</p>
<p>Console players, for instance, can now play on <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/valorant">the Lotus map</a> across the game's Unrated, Competitive, Swift Play, and Deathmatch modes (although Deathmatch has also been temporarily disabled on consoles, owing once again to "an issue").</p>
<p>Other minor changes include an updated Outlaw animation that makes it "more apparent when the weapon is ready to be fired", as well as tons of bug fixes and small Agent changes.</p>

<p>The game features a number of Agents, each of which has different abilities to help them triumph over their opponents. Gameplay takes place across a number of labyrinthine maps with lots of winding corridors and opportunities to ambush your enemies.</p>
<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Valorant&nbsp;</em>for free right now on <a href="https://playvalorant.com/en-gb/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S</a>.

            <p>
Xbox has revealed a whole flock of games arriving on Game Pass this month on day one of release.
</p>
<p>
That includes Capcom's Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess, Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn, and Dungeons of Hinterberg, as well as todays' release of Flock.
</p>
<p>
These join the likes of Journey to the Savage Planet, The Case of the Golden Idol, and Neon White that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-game-pass-lineup-for-july-2024-announced">arrived earlier this month</a>.
</p>
<p>
The full list of Xbox Game Pass additions still to come in July are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Magical Delicacy (Cloud, Console, and PC) - out today</li>

Flock is the latest from Hohokum creator Richard Hogg. "It's a game about wildlife and it's a game about collecting stuff," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/flock-review-the-art-of-noticing">Flock review</a>. "But it's also, serving as bedrock for all of that other stuff, a game about noticing. Its world is there to reveal itself to you, but only when you're ready. Only when you're in sync, only when you're properly attuned."
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dungeons-of-hinterberg-is-about-a-holiday-which-is-why-everything-feels-so-important">Dungeons of Hinterberg</a> is a hotly-anticipated indie about dungeon crawling in the Austrian alps, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/capcoms-kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-gets-release-date">Kunitsu-Gami</a> is an action tower defence game steeped in Japanese folklore. Both look absolutely worthy of your time.
</p>
<p>
The following games will also be leaving Game Pass on 31st July:
</p>
<ul>
<li>A Short Hike (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Train Sim World 4 (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Venba (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
</ul>

<p>
Xbox Game Pass is soon to undergo a big change, which will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-confirms-big-changes-for-xbox-game-pass-ditching-day-one-releases-for-basic-tier">ditch day one releases for its basic tier</a> and instead save them for Game Pass Ultimate.

Then, Criston Cole arrives back in King’s Landing parading the corpse of Meleys. This display disgusts the smallfolk who see the dead dragon as a dark omen. They realize the Gods of the sky are “just meat,” a thing they are grossly lacking due to the blockade.<br></p><p>King Aegon’s injured body is tended by the maesters, and the worst two minutes of medieval medicine ASMR ever ensues. Aemond looks on from the foot of Aegon’s bed, satisfied with himself. The Kinslayer may be upgraded to Kingslayer, to Alicent’s absolute horror.<br></p><p>The Team Black Council is up to their usual bickering. Yet, this episode focuses on how Ser Alfred dismisses Rhaenyra’s ideas and viewpoints due to her being a member of “the gentler sex.” The Team Black Council may bend the knee to the Queen, but they will not let go of the patriarchy.</p><p>Daemond’s drug-fueled gap year in Harrenhal continues. He mediates between the Blackwoods and the Brackens through sinister plots. The Brackens won’t bend the knee alongside the Blackwoods so Daemon suggests that Ser Ben Blackwood take other “persuasive” measures to get them to heel.</p><p>Rhaena arrives in the Eyrie and becomes Lady Jeyn Arryn’s ward. However, Lady Jeyn does not feel protected by the mere dragon eggs sent. While Rhaenyra lacks allies in her male council, Mysaria reminds Rhaenyra of the biggest asset in the war: the smallfolk. Since Otto Hightower lost his position on Team Green, there has not been any challenger to stoke the propaganda war. “To the discontented, rumors are feed,” Mysaria advises. Rhaenyra’s maid, Elinda, is sent to King’s Landing to start the gossip.</p><p>Alys Rivers has been augmenting Daemon’s reality in Harrenhal. She also has been reading Freud because, in this episode’s most WTF scene, Daemon dreams of bedding a silver-haired woman revealed to be his dead mother. Later on, he hears distant cries and screams of the innocent. Despite Daemon’s insecurities and anxieties being exploited by Rivers, he becomes more reckless and publicly vies for the throne.</p><p>The Green Council reports that Aegon is alive but cannot rule in a coma. Alicent offers to return to her role as regent to the King, but the men in the room reject it. Alicent’s only allies, Larys and Cole, agree that a woman should not rule and Aemond fits better. The camera zooms in slowly on Alicent as she sits, fuming at being dismissed and fearing her violent son at the head of the table. This shot is begging for a <em>Kill Bill</em> fan edit.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="fa32e2222f44cb34c4ffe3efb4e25c00" data-recommend-id="image://fa32e2222f44cb34c4ffe3efb4e25c00" data-format="jpg" data-width="1583" data-height="886" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A crowd jostles in a scene from House of the Dragon S2 Episode 5" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A crowd jostles in a scene from House of the Dragon S2 Episode 5" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ollie Upton / HBO</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fa32e2222f44cb34c4ffe3efb4e25c00" data-recommend-id="image://fa32e2222f44cb34c4ffe3efb4e25c00" data-format="jpg" data-width="1583" data-height="886" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A crowd jostles in a scene from House of the Dragon S2 Episode 5" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>We get a continuation of the blacksmith family storyline from Episode 2. The daughter is sick and the wife wants to flee King’s Landing. There is no food and the blacksmith is still waiting for King Aegon to fulfill his union demands. However, when they try to escape, King’s Landing is barricaded. The restless crowd cries and chants “meat.”<br></p><p>Cole’s strategy may have lost him the smallfolk but his strategies have all changed since seeing dragons battle. There is no choice but to succumb to the mighty beasts, and Aemond will keep the battles coming.<br></p><p>Jace meets with the Freys and strikes a deal; The Freys will inherit Harrenhal if they bend the knee for Rhaenyra. This is the worst real estate deal ever because Harrenhal barely functions.</p><p>Rhaena tells Lord Corlys that Rhaenyra wants him to be the Queen’s Hand and gives a beautiful speech about supporting Rhaenyra’s ascent to the throne. Rhaena knows her role enough to reject being the Driftmark heir. She is of blood and fire.</p><p>Rhaenyra gets the annoying Ser Alfred off her back and sends him to bring her husband back from his nightmare vacation. Daemon’s crimes against humanity strategy fails as the Brackens and Blackwoods get him out of bed to bicker with each other in his presence. Finally, the Brackens and the Blackwoods agree on one thing: they will not fight one another under the same Team Black banner. </p><p>Aemond contently sits on the Iron Throne for the first time. Our prophetic Queen Halaena chillingly asks him if the seat was “worth the price.” We’ll have to see what her comment will yield in Aemond’s future.<br></p><p>The episode ends with Jace and Rhaenyra devising a strategy to strengthen their army. Team Black is blessed with dragons but short on Dragonriders. Jace suggests going down the Targaryen bloodline in other houses to find riders.</p><p>This week Alicent has lost power while Rhaenrya took her power. But how will that play when Daemon comes back? It begs the question: Has Daemon’s time in Harrenhal been a boring waste (as some fans feel) or is it subduing Team Black’s biggest liability thanks to the witch? Or are we just building to the Daemon v Aemond fight that those characters want so badly?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>According to a variety of reports, renowned animation and VFX team Axis Studios is officially going into administration, affecting 162 employees.</p>



<p>Axis Studios contributed animation and VFX work for a range of media such as gaming, film, television, and more. The large team offered many jobs in Scotland. </p>



<p>Gaming fans will recognize Axis Studios for its iconic work on various trailers and cinematics. Some of the IP that Axis Studios worked on included Dead Island, Destiny, Halo, League of Legends, and more. Recent work includes the outstanding footage for Destiny 2 Lightfall.</p>



<p>Axis Studios’ cinematic trailer for Dead Island 2 impressed many fans and built a lot of hype in 2019.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Dead Island 2" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WKsSnEawsNo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>In a new report <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cv2gvqlezn1o" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by the BBC</a>, administrators Interpath Advisory “confirmed 162 members of staff have lost their jobs immediately, with four people being retained to help wind up the business.” </p>



<p>Alistair McAlinden of Interpath Advisory reportedly explained that “Axis has more recently been impacted by a decline in customer projects.” They also cited “increases in labour costs which have resulted in severe cash flow problems.”</p>



<p>Joint administrator Geoff Jacobs also mentioned plans to “give employees support.” They also invited parties interested in the studio’s live projects to reach out.</p>



<p>At this time, the Axis Studios website is no longer operating as it goes into administration. The studio was founded over two decades ago, in 2000.</p>

<p>Last year, with the launch of the iPhone 15, Apple announced that a slew of AAA games would be heading to the top-tier models of the next-generation phone – and the top model of the latest iPad. To that end, games like Assassin’s Creed Mirage, Death Stranding, and Resident Evil Village were all lined up to be delivered to Apple fans worldwide, but almost every game to be released on the platform has fallen flat on its face.</p>



<p>The latest estimates suggest that Resident Evil 7, the latest release on iOS, has secured fewer than 2,000 sales, netting Capcom a measly $28,140.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-small-fry">Small Fry</h2>



<p>It’s to be expected, right?</p>



<p>While mobile gaming is the most lucrative market in the wider industry, AAA games coming to the iPhone 15 Pro (and similar models) will attract few sales based on how niche that audience is. Even so, Resident Evil 7 securing just 2,000 sales (which is a generous estimate <a href="https://mobilegamer.biz/under-2000-people-have-paid-to-play-resident-evil-7-on-ios-estimates-say/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">according to MobileGamer.biz</a>) is pretty miserable. </p>



<p>It was further estimated that around 83,000 downloads of Resident Evil 7 have taken place on iOS, but the vast majority of those downloads – which give access to a demo of the game – aren’t converting into full sales.</p>



<p>Last month, figures emerged suggesting that every other game released on the super-powered iOS-backed devices has floundered. Assassin’s Creed Mirage had racked up fewer than 3,000 sales after several weeks on the market, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ios-games-sales-bombing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">despite being downloaded around 123,000 times</a>. It was a worse story with Resident Evil 4 – that zombie-slaying title was downloaded 350,000 times but fewer than 7,000 full sales were estimated.</p>



<p>Ultimately, they’re ports, they’re not perfect, and they still boast premium price tags. You’ll be hard-pressed to find people willing to pay $49.99 to play a seven-year-old Resident Evil game on a phone.</p>

                <p>When you envision the cover of EA Sports FC 25, you probably imagine a star player like Manchester City's Erling Haaland scoring an impressive goal, or perhaps posing in full kit on the field. However, EA has decided to go a different route for FC 25's Ultimate Edition's cover, which <a href="https://x.com/EASPORTSFC/status/1812864869302960143" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">features</a> several former and current top soccer stars posing with trophies in a wood-paneled room.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1596/15969599/4335344-easportsfcimage.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4335344" data-ratio="1" data-width="2160" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1596/15969599/4335344-easportsfcimage.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4335344"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1596/15969599/4335344-easportsfcimage.jpg"></figure><p>The figures featured include current Real Madrid midfielder Jude Bellingham right in the center, flanked by legend David Beckham, Spain star Aitana Bonmati, former Italian goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon, and the infamous Zinedine Zidane. True football fans will likely be able to identify all of the trophies featured in the cover, but for us Americans, it certainly looks like an impressive spread indeed.</p><p>This cover is our first official look at FC 25, but details are thin on the ground for the game as a whole. Publisher EA indicated in the above social media post that there will be a full reveal on July 17. A leak from <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dealabs.com%2Fmagazine%2Fon-vous-devoile-la-date-de-sortie-de-ea-sports-fc-25-54912&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Ffc-25-tries-something-different-with-its-ultimate-edition-cover%2F1100-6525005%2F&amp;event_type=click" rel="nofollow ">earlier this month</a> suggested that the release date for EA Sports FC 25 will be September 27, 2024, which is in line with the best-selling franchise's typical drop dates. However, as usual, it remains unconfirmed. Ahead of FC 25's release, EA will launch both <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ea-sports-college-football-25/" data-ref-id="5000-618409">College Football 25</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/madden-nfl-25/" data-ref-id="5000-629476">Madden NFL 25</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/all-games-should-have-a-kick-button.928548/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/anger-foot-dark-messiah-kick-button<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>These days, there are as many video games as there are grains of sand on a beach. The sheer breadth of experiences on offer boggles the mind. Depending on the game, I can run, jump, and shoot, or I can eschew violence entirely to chat up random passersby. I can play music. I can build worlds. I can lose myself in abstract imagery. I can solve problems as I please or be taken by the hand and guided through an experience. All of these approaches to game design are valid, but also, every video game should have a kick button.</p><p>I’ve been playing <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1978590/Anger_Foot/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Anger Foot</em></a>, a new first-person action game in which your main means of interacting with the world is a swift boot to the face, and it has reinforced one of my longest-held beliefs: a dedicated kick button elevates any game that it’s in. In <em>Anger Foot</em>, perhaps the apex of this trend, kicks send dudes, garbage, and everything in between flying. The game’s pace is reminiscent of <em>Hotline Miami</em>, albeit in first-person; you blaze through dingy apartments and across trash-strewn rooftops clapping enemies before they clap you, with split-second miscalculations meaning certain death.&nbsp;</p><p>Each level is made up of numerous mini encounters – various combinations of bat-swinging alligators, gun-toting goons, shield-obscured SWAT cops, and multiple enemy types that are liable to explode – but almost every single one begins with a kick. Levels are chock full of doors. If you kick one down, odds are, shit’s about to get wacky. Hordes of enemies throw themselves at you, and the soundtrack morphs from a pulsing beat into a full-on cacophony. Then, several additional kicks (and maybe a few gunshots) later, everything calms down, and you can exhale.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Anger Foot Launch Trailer | Out Now on PC" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7kJo0miz08g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>This simple rhythm makes for an experience that’s compulsively propulsive. Behind each door, a new thunderclap of violence awaits. Even the simple action of kicking doors feels good. They splinter – practically shatter – when brought into contact with your wriggly green toes. Enemies, tables, toilets, trash cans, shopping carts, and pretty much anything else you can imagine similarly ricochets away as though it’s been hit by an eighteen-wheeler, each with its own crunchy, punchy sound effects. Sometimes things you’ve kicked hit walls. Other times they go sailing down stairs or off buildings. This is a game that wants you to survey its world, take in all the clever little details, and think “What would happen if I kicked that?”&nbsp;</p><p><em>Anger Foot</em> has caused me to hark back to one of my happiest early gaming memories: playing <em>Dark Messiah of Might and Magic</em> on the PC at my mom’s house as a teenager. That game wasn’t quite so narrowly focused on kicking, but it nonetheless allowed you to do so whenever you pleased. This, combined with sophisticated physics (for the time), meant I would regularly toy with my orc foes by letting them chase me up flights of stairs and then, just as they were about to catch me, kicking them back down. They’d proceed to dust themselves off and drag their measurably more mangled bodies in my direction again, only to receive another kick for their troubles. I’d repeat this as many times as necessary, cackling the entire time, because teenagers are evil.&nbsp;</p><p>I’m going to take this a step further: As far as I’m concerned, the shove from <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> is a kick. This is because the best kicks are a means to the end of creating one or more additional funny collisions. In <em>Anger Foot</em>, kicks send doors crashing into enemies, who in turn wilt against whichever wall they’ve been pinned to. In <em>Dark Messiah</em>, kicks caused big, burly dudes to take laughably ungraceful tumbles down stairs or into spike traps. In<em> Baldur’s Gate 3</em>, shoves, which are kicks, send enemies – even bosses, in some cases – off ledges onto the cold, hard ground or into endless abysses, never to be seen again. Every time you do it, you come away feeling devious, like you’ve gotten away with an affront to God and game designers alike. And yet, the game was designed with this exact thing in mind! It is ingenious.&nbsp;</p><p>Maybe that’s why video game kicks rule so hard: They feel unfair – like a dirty trick that only the player can take full advantage of. Parrying a blade is elegant, an act of beautiful precision. Kicking somebody who just parried a blade in the stomach is classless. But I don’t want to be classy; I want to win. And laugh at somebody falling down the stairs.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Here is when you can jump into each beta:&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Weekend 1: Early Access (for preorder customers/Xbox Game Pass subscribers)</strong> - August 30 at 10 a.m. PT to September 4 at 10 a.m. PT</p>

<p><strong>Weekend 2: Open Beta (for everyone)</strong> - September 6 at 10 a.m. PT to September 9 at 10 a.m. PT</p>

<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 launches on October 25 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. Set in 1991 during the Gulf War, the espionage-themed campaign centers on a mysterious organization's infiltration of the U.S. government.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/free-codes-for-zenless-zone-zero-polychromes-dennies-and-more/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>If you've been stuck in <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/five-things-to-know-before-playing-zenless-zone-zero/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zenless Zone Zero</a> but lack resources, do not panic. Luckily, miHoYo has been kind enough to put out free codes that you can redeem in-game, which can help you get various rewards.</p>
<p>These rewards can help you get hands-on resources such as Polychrome, Dennies, and Investigator Logs, which are helpful if you want to progress in your game. Be warned, though. They have a limited amount of time for you to use them before they expire and will no longer give you rewards if you try to redeem them in Zenless Zone Zero.</p>
<h2>All Free Codes for Zenless Zone Zero</h2>
<ul>
<li>KANURBT5MQ8D - 40 Polychromes</li>
<li>USNC9SB4499R - 6 W-Engine Power Supply</li>
<li>NB6D9SB4MPSZ - 6 Crystallized Plating Agents</li>
<li>4BPDRBT459RH - 6000 Dennies</li>
<li>NS6U9TTLM6AV - 2 Bangboo Algorithm Module</li>
<li>XTNDQAS44985 - 4 Official Investigator Logs</li>
<li>CATCHABOO - 30 Polychromes</li>
<li>ZENLESSGIFT - 50 Polychromes, 2 Official Investigator Logs, 3 W-Engine Power Supply, 1 Bangboo Algorithm Module</li>
<li>ZENLESSLAUNCH - 60 Polychromes and 6666 Dennies</li>
</ul>
<p>These codes can only be redeemed once per account, so you won't be able to get these rewards more than once if you try to redeem them multiple times.</p>
<h2>How to Redeem Codes in Zenless Zone Zero</h2>

<figure></figure>

<p>Due to the layout of the menus in the game, it may seem a little bit daunting trying to figure out how you are meant to redeem codes in Zenless Zone Zero. Don't panic; these steps will walk you through how to get your hands on those free resources.</p>
<p>First and most importantly, you need to reach Inter-Knot level 5. This is quickly done and can be done within the first couple of hours of the game or less.</p>
<ul>
<li>Open the in-game menu in the left-hand corner by pressing ESC on PC, options on PlayStation 5, or tapping the button on mobile.</li>
<li>Select 'More.'</li>
<li>Select 'Redemption Code.'</li>
<li>Copy and paste the code into the available text box.</li>
<li>Select 'Redeem'.</li>
</ul>
<p>Compared to other<a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/how-to-link-psn-to-hoyoverse-id/"> HoYoverse games</a>, you won't need to unlock the mailbox function, as it will already be available as soon as you start playing Zenless Zone Zero. This is where your rewards will go once you have redeemed them.</p>
<p>You can also redeem the codes via the <a href="https://zenless.hoyoverse.com/redemption" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zenless Zone Zero website</a>. To do this, you must log in to your HoYoverse account.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sign in to the Zenless Zone Zero redemption website.</li>
<li>Select your server and character nickname.</li>
<li>Enter the redemption code into the text box.</li>
<li>Press 'Redeem.'</li>
<li>Check your in-game mailbox to get your freebies.</li>
</ul>
<p>As with most games that have access to redemption codes, they are due to expire. Some codes that were available for Zenless Zone Zero have already expired. They will be listed below.</p>
<ul>
<li>NIJIZZZ</li>
<li>ZZZFREE100</li>
<li>ZZZTVCM</li>
<li>ZZZ2024</li>
</ul>
<p>This guide will be updated as soon as new codes are released or as current codes expire so that you don't waste your time trying to get resources from an invalid code.</p>

This includes adding new dialogue in some scenes, adjusting animations, and even adding a few more smooches for some characters. Here’s the full rundown:</p><h2 id="h84777"><a id=""></a><strong>Wyll Highlights</strong></h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><em>Patch 7 includes a heap of fixes for Wyll, ranging from improvements to his dialogue reactivity to fixes for romance scenes.</em></li><li><em>If you’ve experienced issues triggering the romance scene with Wyll, this update will fix that. Should your relationship be headed in that direction, the cutscene in question will now trigger when you speak to Wyll at camp before your Long Rest.</em></li><li><em>A bug that had been preventing his romance greeting from triggering has also been fixed, so players in Act III who have a stable, loving, and committed relationship with Wyll will now see his romance greeting triggering correctly.</em></li><li><em>We’ve fixed Wyll’s dialogue reactivity during the epilogue for partnered players who have either joined Karlach in the Hells or Lae’zel in the rebellion, and we also determined there simply weren’t enough opportunities to kiss Wyll during the epilogue. This update rectifies that with the option to ask for a kiss in more paths of Wyll’s epilogue dialogue.</em></li><li><em>And if you’re in holographic form during the epilogue, he’ll no longer automatically assume he’s talking to Lae’zel, which was weird.</em></li></ul><h2 id="h84778"><a id=""></a><strong>Astarion Highlights</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="ad141093b5035689cddb049dd13a1608" data-recommend-id="image://ad141093b5035689cddb049dd13a1608" data-format="gif" data-width="700" data-height="389" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Astarion kisses Tav." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Astarion kisses Tav." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->Larian Studios</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ad141093b5035689cddb049dd13a1608" data-recommend-id="image://ad141093b5035689cddb049dd13a1608" data-format="gif" data-width="700" data-height="389" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Astarion kisses Tav." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><em>In Patch 7, we’ve made improvements to the facial animations of your character during some kissing cinematics, including with the ascended Astarion.</em></li><li><em>We’ve also made tweaks to how Origin characters react within certain cutscenes, to enhance their emotional impact. For example, companions will show Astarion more empathy when he loses his ability to withstand sunlight.</em></li></ul><h2 id="h84779"><a id=""></a><strong>Lae’zel Highlights</strong></h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><em>Lae’zel will now wait a little longer at her recruitment site if you tell her you’ll be returning. And once she’s set up at camp, she will also cycle through more varied idle animations.</em></li><li><em>This update will also put an end to an annoying issue where resurrecting Lae’zel on the beach in Act I would cause her to appear in the Party Line but not in the world, blocking you from leaving Act I.</em></li></ul><h2 id="h84780"><a id=""></a><strong>Karlach Highlights</strong></h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><em>Along with some more general fixes for Karlach, she will now react to Dammon if she finds him dead after he has told her that he can help her.</em></li><li><em>That sketchy fade-to-black that follows her final scene in Avernus, which also unintentionally gave you a very brief glimpse of the region in gameplay mode, was a visual bug that has also been fixed.</em></li><li><em>The dialogue block caused by choosing to stay with a different companion the morning after your second romance scene with Karlach is no more.</em></li><li><em>Also, she’ll no longer brush the shaved side of her head during her camp idle animation. Wrong side, Karlach.</em></li></ul><h2 id="h84781"><a id=""></a><strong>Gale Highlights</strong></h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><em>With a few tweaks to camera angles and fixes to animation pops, repeated dialogue, and missing VFX, we’ve polished up Gale and his scenes and further refined his donation UI.</em></li><li><em>That panel that opens when donating magical items to Gale? This will now show all items eligible for donation - including those on your person, your party’s inventories, and your Traveller’s Chest.</em></li><li><em>This is part of the work that began with Hotfix #16 to improve the donation UI and update a player’s ability to access certain quest-related items, which has now been completed. We’re reinstating the intended behaviour that was removed in Hotfix #17 as a temporary bug fix to missing UI functionality. So if you now deny Gale a magic item three times in a row with magical items either on your person, your party’s inventories, or now from your Traveller’s Chest, he will leave your party.</em></li><li><em>Alternatively, selecting “I’m not giving you anything. Not now, not ever” will still cause Gale to leave your party forever.</em></li><li><em>We’ve also patched up a bug that was preventing the final dialogue between Gale and Mystra from triggering, as well as a scene in the endgame that would cut off before you could kiss.</em></li></ul><h2 id="h84782"><a id=""></a><strong>Shadowheart Highlights</strong></h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><em>In addition to fixing a few of her animation bugs, this update fixes a number of quest issues for Shadowheart.</em></li><li><em>A bug that saw the Spear of Night either not being received, or being spoken about as if it hadn’t already been acquired, is no more. Another bout of amnesia has also been fixed, in which Shadowheart occasionally thought Viconia was still alive after killing her. The ‘Daughter of Darkness’ quest should also now close properly if you choose to surrender Shadowheart to Viconia.</em></li><li><em>And yes, we’ve tweaked a few kissing scenes for her too, fixing a broken romance cutscene that should have triggered after giving Shadowheart the Idol of Shar, and a kissing animation that will no longer kick in before the dialogue option is chosen. We’ve also polished up the appearance of neck kissing. In the words of Michelangelo, no great work of art is ever finished, and so too is our approach to the art of snogging.</em></li></ul><p>Patch 7 is still two months away, but Larian says it’s not <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>'s final update, as the studio is looking to add crossplay multiplayer and a photo mode, which will all come as part of a later patch. All of these new changes sound great, but I will probably wait until the photo mode is added to go back because I’m a screenshot sicko.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

When I checked the Tiltify page this morning the high bids had all been wiped, but then came back a few minutes later. At the time of writing, the top bids were dominated by user “@haryvibes on X” and user “pls sex me poki.” </p><p>At least it’s all for a good cause. The auction ends on July 19. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>When Gears of War: E-Day was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gears-of-war-e-day-official-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced back in June</a>, many fans wondered if it would be a console exclusive to Xbox or if a PlayStation release would also happen. Fast-forward a month later and a job posting is hinting at a possible release on Sony’s platform.</p>



<p>The Coalition is looking <a href="https://jobs.careers.microsoft.com/global/en/job/1729899/Senior-Online-Client-Engineer---Gears-of-War-%E2%80%93-The-Coalition">for a senior online client engineer</a> to work on Gears of War: E-Day. This position, according to the post, will “help build the multiplayer and online experience” of the game, including “in-game economies and commerce, session management, player statistics, user generated content, and matchmaking”. </p>



<p>As part of the preferred qualifications for the job, the listing mentions prior experience working with online platforms such as Xbox Live, Steam, and, yes, the PlayStation Network (PSN). </p>



<p>While having experience with PSN doesn’t necessarily confirm that a PlayStation launch of the game is guaranteed, it’s interesting enough that it was specifically mentioned. We know the game is certain for Xbox and Steam, which is why it makes sense to see it in the listing.</p>

Both the <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fshop-links.co%2F1838999239400000010%3Fu1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Frazer-blackshark-v2-pro-headset-gets-big-discount-for-first-time-on-prime-day%2F1100-6524981%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox Series X|S BlackShark</a> and <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fshop-links.co%2F1847980274346195567%3Fu1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Frazer-blackshark-v2-pro-headset-gets-big-discount-for-first-time-on-prime-day%2F1100-6524981%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PlayStation 5 BlackShark</a> headsets are newer to the market and haven't seen any discounts previously, but both have had their prices slashed by $50 as part of Best Buy's sale to compete with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/amazon-prime-day-deals/">Prime Day</a>.</p><p>The BlackShark V2 Pro headset has been around for a bit, but the console variants are fairly new and include a few additional features. Both support 2.4GHz wireless connections using a USB-C dongle that's included with the headsets, or with Bluetooth 5.2, and Razer says both can provide up to 70 hours of battery life. They also offer a detachable unidirectional microphone and use 50mm audio drivers. You can get them in either white or black.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4334827-razer.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4334827" data-ratio="0.82802547770701" data-width="1099" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4334827-razer.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4334827"></a><figcaption>Razer BlackShark V2 Pro for Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4334827-razer.jpg"></figure><p>There are some key differences between the headsets, though. The Xbox version works with Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PS5, PS4, PC, Mac, and mobile--but only supports Windows spatial audio on the Xbox systems, PC, Mac, and mobile, not the PlayStation consoles. Meanwhile, the PlayStation version works with PS5, PS4, PC, Mac, and mobile, but not the Xbox consoles. That headset also is compatible with the Sony's 3D spatial audio.</p><p>Whichever headset you're going for, though, the discount here is pretty significant. Best Buy is knocking $50 off the usual $200 price tag, bringing the cost of each headset down to $150.

                <p>For virtual reality fans, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/amazon-prime-day-deals/">Prime Day</a> is one of the best days of the year when it comes to upgrading your VR experience. You can't go wrong with the Meta Quest 3, and a solid set of earbuds helps to make that technology more immersive. Normally $80, the surprisingly versatile <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B87MQG2N?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" rel="nofollow ">Soundcore VR P10 earbuds</a> are now on sale for <strong>$50</strong>.</p><p>These are officially licensed to work with Meta Quest 2 and Quest 3 headsets, but they're also compatible with PC, PlayStation, Switch, and other consoles capable of receiving a Bluetooth signal. This sadly rules out Xbox due to its proprietary tech for wireless headsets, but it still makes for a flexible set of earbuds overall.</p><p>For the tech specs, these wireless gaming earbuds use a 2.4GHz high-speed wireless connection, custom chipset, LC3 codec for fast audio transfer, and 11mm drivers to deliver some deep bass to your ears. It's worth mentioning that the 128GB Meta Quest 3 is currently $430 (normally $500) for Prime Day, and a few other accessories have been discounted as well. The default headstrap on the Quest 3 is not <em>great</em>, but the optional <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Meta-Quest-3-Elite-Strap/dp/B0CD15C641?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Elite Strap is much better</a> and has been slightly discounted to $60.</p><h2>Prime Day VR Deals</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C8VKH1ZH?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Meta Quest 3 (128GB)</a> -- $430 ($<strike>500</strike>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Meta-Quest-3-Elite-Strap/dp/B0CD15C641?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Meta Quest 3 Elite Strap</a> -- $60 ($<strike>70</strike>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06Y2GDXMC?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Meta Quest 3 Blood Orange strap</a> -- $24 ($<strike>50</strike>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B092LBLT7P?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">HTC Vive Pro 2 VR headset</a> -- $550 ($<strike>800</strike>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09FPCT3H8?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">HTC Vive Pro 2 VR system</a> -- $1,000 ($<strike>1,400</strike>)</li></ul><p>This is far more comfortable, much easier to adjust to your head size, and it comes with an extra battery for when you're looking to enjoy a longer VR session.

There's also an alternative VR headset on sale for Prime Day, and if you're looking to experience virtual reality in <em>5</em>K, you'll want to check out the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B092LBLT7P?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">HTC Vive Pro 2</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/manor-lords-publisher-announces-literal-cat-and-mouse-city-builder-whiskerwood.928485/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/manor-lords-publisher-whiskerwood-city-builder<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Manor Lords&nbsp;</em>publisher Hooded Horse has announced brand new city builder&nbsp;<em>Whiskerwood</em>, which apparently didn't get the memo that "a game of cat and mouse" is supposed to be metaphorical.</p>
<p>Developed by Minakata Dynamics, whose work you'll know if you've played train strategy sim&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1355090/RAILGRADE/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Railgrade</em></a>,&nbsp;<em>Whiskerwood</em>&nbsp;sees you constructing a home for a colony of industrious mice who are laboring under the "oppressive paw of their cat overlords".</p>
<p>Minakata Dynamics promises the ability to eventually decide whether you want to keep working under the cats' yoke or to "raise whiskers in defiance", so it sounds like you'll be able to lead some sort of rebellion against your feline masters.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/whiskerwood-hooded-horse-city.jpg?itok=ZFMhpdpP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/whiskerwood-hooded-horse-city.jpg?itok=bu345fhE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Whiskerwood&nbsp;</em>is an actual cat-and-mouse city builder.</figcaption></figure><p>In gameplay terms, if you've played games like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/timberborn"><em>Timberborn</em></a>, then you'll know roughly what to expect from&nbsp;<em>Whiskerwood</em>.</p>
<p>The devs promise "complex simulations" and "supply chain management dealing with over 40 commodities", so if building the perfect logistical operation is something that presses your gaming buttons, this one's definitely for you.</p>
<p>Intriguingly, you'll also be able to build both upwards and downwards in order to "maximize space", leading to cities that ask you to build "up into the sky" and to burrow "deep underground". I suppose the latter, at least, is sort of in keeping with the rodent theme.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/whiskerwood-hooded-horse-gameplay.jpg?itok=6GA0M_j6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/whiskerwood-hooded-horse-gameplay.jpg?itok=QN9294NU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>If you love logistics-based city builders, this one's for you.</figcaption></figure><p>As you play, you'll also come across other factions of mice, and it's up to you whether you want to try and befriend them or move straight to hostility to defend your settlement.</p>
<p>Of course, there'll be a tech tree to work your way through, as well as a "strategic layer to expand influence beyond the colony". In short, this sounds like another Hooded Horse hit, especially if you're into&nbsp;<em>Ghost of a Tale&nbsp;</em>or the&nbsp;<em>Redwall&nbsp;</em>novels.</p>
<p><em>Whiskerwood&nbsp;</em>is coming to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2489330/Whiskerwood/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a> "soon", although no release date has been announced yet. Stay tuned for more.</p>

For a big-name, highly anticipated, fully playable game to hit piracy sites <em>two months</em> before it’s due out, however, is astoundingly unusual. That’s what’s happened to <em>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</em>, the Saber-made sequel to Relic’s 2011 hack-n-slash hit, apparently including all 75GB of the nearly finished game, and even server binaries.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196653" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: A Star Wars Classic Returns &amp; More New Releases" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="105" data-playlist="196653,195928,196251" data-current="196653"><div><p>The Week In Games: A Star Wars Classic Returns &amp; More New Releases</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196653/196653_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196653/196653_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196653/196653_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196653/196653_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22209.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Originally reported by <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://insider-gaming.com/spaice-marine-2-leak-playable/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://insider-gaming.com/spaice-marine-2-leak-playable/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Insider Gaming</em></a></span>, the sequel—developed by <em>Evil Dead</em> and <em>World War Z</em> studio Saber Interactive—has leaked in a completely playable form. While there are reportedly some placeholder assets and missing bits and pieces, it’s said this unfinished build can be played online with other people. Absolutely horrific news for all involved.</p><p>People have been posting in-game footage of  the leaked game, although it looks as though publishers Focus are copyright striking it as fast as they can. However, a 47-minute Russian video I found shows the game running extremely smoothly, and looking extremely good. It has, if nothing else, got me hyped for the game’s official release.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/warhammer-w40k-space-marine-2-pvp-co-op-reveal-trailer-1851497076&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/warhammer-w40k-space-marine-2-pvp-co-op-reveal-trailer-1851497076">Space Marine 2 Might End Up Being The Best Warhammer Game Ever</a></span></p><p>The original <em>Space Marine</em> was made by Relic, the studio behind <em>Company of Heroes </em>and <em>Homeworld. </em>In 2013, a sequel was in the works when the company became collateral damage in the miserable collapse of THQ. Almost a decade later, with the rights now in the hands of Focus Entertainment, the project was restarted by Saber in 2021, with footage first seen in 2022. By 2023 we learned of three-player co-op, and earlier this year, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/warhammer-w40k-space-marine-2-pvp-co-op-reveal-trailer-1851497076&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/warhammer-w40k-space-marine-2-pvp-co-op-reveal-trailer-1851497076"><em>Kotaku</em> suggested it could be “the best <em>Warhammer</em> game ever.”</a></span></p><p><em>Insider Gaming</em> says it believes the leaked <em>Space Marine 2 </em>build is from February 23 this year. This obviously means it’s going to be months behind what Saber intends to release on September 9.</p><p>It’s also worth adding that leaked builds found online are fantastically likely to contain all manner of malware, added by those looking to take advantage of the situation, let alone all those who will mis-label absolutely anything else with the name of the game to lure in the gullible, giving even further reason not to consider downloading the leak. </p><p>While this must be devastating for all involved, it’s possible to take solace in the knowledge that historically, major leaks can offer enormous extra promotion for a game (I bet you’d forgotten <em>Space Marine 2</em> was coming in a couple of months). And when they’re as incredible-looking as what’s appearing in footage, even provide guerrilla advertising. I’m <em>certainly</em> going to be playing the released version come September 9, having glimpsed how good this looks.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In a new <a href="https://x.com/PixelsofMark/status/1813203749973991561" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">thread on X</a>, XDefiant executive producer Mark Rubin revealed that Patch 1.2 is coming tomorrow, and also spoke about server updates for the game.</p>



<p>First, Rubin mentioned a server change designed to fix up matchmaking regions. In a series of replies to fan questions, they also elaborated on plans for future updates, including Patch 1.2. Rubin confirmed this new update will arrive sometime tomorrow.</p>



<p>One player asked about weapon updates “for nerfing and buffing different guns.” Rubin confirmed some are coming to XDefiant in Patch 1.2 tomorrow, and added “we have more coming in patch 1.3.” </p>



<p>They did not offer details about other changes coming to Patch 1.2. If some plans are already in place for 1.3, it might arrive sooner than later, but that is only speculation.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hey all! We made a server change last night that may reduce the number of times you matchmake with a region that is not the one you are in. Let me know if you are still getting in games that are in a different region than your own. And if you do get a region that is not yours let…</p>— Mark Rubin (@PixelsofMark) <a href="https://twitter.com/PixelsofMark/status/1813203749973991561?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 16, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>







<p>Another fan asked about a server select option, as a potential addition to last night’s server fixes.</p>



<p>Rubin stated “that is something we are looking at,” but did not confirm plans to do so. They clarified there is “no eta at this time to know if/when we would add that.”</p>



<p>Earlier this month, Rubin also addressed concerns <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xdefiant-executive-producer-addresses-spiderbot-concerns/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over the Spiderbot issues</a>. Ubisoft only just released Season 1 and its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xdefiant-season-1-patch-notes-released/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">corresponding patch notes</a> this month.  Season 1 features the new Capture the Flag mode, more factions and maps, and more.</p>

As spotted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-mod-lets-you-summon-bosses-for-aid" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eurogamer</a>, a grand total of 11 named antagonists from the DLC are included in the mod, which directly replace select spirit ashes, though the art relating to those summons remains the same as in the vanilla version of the game. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/16/er-1721137309950.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>DLC Summon Bosses Mod by FlippantTunic22. Image credit: NexusMods.</figcaption></figure></output><p>For example, triggering the Kindred of Rot spirit ash will now summon the Divine Beast Dancing Lion to fight at your side, while the Nomad ash will call upon Messmer the Impaler to aid you in battle. YouTube user KanesGrace also posted a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S_9Kuy8faU&amp;t=885s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video of the mod at work</a>, showcasing a number of climactic fights, including one in which <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring/Metyr,_Mother_of_Fingers_Location_and_Guide">Meytr, Mother of Fingers</a> took down the DLC's final boss, <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring/Promised_Consort_Radahn_Location_and_Guide">Promised Consort Radahn</a>.</p><p>A full list of the summons and their counterparts can be found below, as per the NexusMods page, but obviously beware of spoilers for Shadow of the Erdtree's cast of bosses.</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Black Knife Tiche = Romina, Saint Of The Bud</li><li>Banished Knight Oleg = Twin Moon Rellana Summon</li><li>Banished Knight Engvall = Putrescent Knight</li><li>Latenna the Albinauric = Golden Hippopotamus (Can be Buggy, make sure to summon it on a clear area as it might fall through the map)</li><li>Nomad = Messmer The Impaler</li><li>Crystalian = Midra, Lord of Frenzied Flame (1st stage only)</li><li>Ancestral Follower = Midra, Lord of Frenzied Flame (2nd stage)</li><li>Cleanrot Knight Finlay = Commander Gaius</li><li>Fire Monk = Furnace Golem</li><li>Kaiden Sellsword = Promised Consort Radahn</li><li>Blackflame Monk Amon = Meytr, Mother of Fingers (Might be a little weird with it spawn and push you back)</li><li>Kindred of Rot = Divine Beast Dancing Lion (Might be a little weird with it spawn and push you back)</li></ul><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree DLC Review Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>The mod’s creator is planning to add more DLC characters to the mod in the future, and has ambitions to upload a separate addon at a later date that will allow players to summon bosses featured in Elden Ring’s base game.

Its appeal lies in its blend of strategic depth and accessible gameplay, making it an obvious choice for game nights with people who don't devote their entire lives to the hobby.</p><p>Players draft colorful tiles representing Portuguese azulejos, which are ceramic tiles used in decorative art. There's a great tactile aspect to the game, which makes it fun to physically handle and place the tiles to create a mosaic of your own design. There's a certain satisfaction of watching your pattern unfold as you strategically place each tile. It's kinda hard to explain until you try it for yourself.</p><p>The game also has a mild competitive aspect to it. Players must carefully plan each move to maximize points while strategically denying opportunities to their opponents.
