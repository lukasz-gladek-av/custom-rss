            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/infinity-nikki-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Infold Games has revealed the&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>release date, so if you've been waiting for an open-world game that's packed with cutesy and cozy vibes to get you through the winter, today's your lucky day.</p>

<p><em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>officially arrives on December 5th, and it's coming to PC, PS5, and mobile devices. Sadly, it doesn't look like the game will be getting a Steam release anytime soon, so you'll have to grab it via its own launcher or via the Epic Games Store.</p>

<p>According to Infold Games,&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>has managed to attract 30 million pre-registrations in the runup to its release, so it's clearly striking a chord. Given that this is the fifth installment in the series, perhaps that's to be expected.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/infinity-nikki-release-date-platforming.jpg?itok=gGfjMrhp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/infinity-nikki-release-date-platforming.jpg?itok=OiBTDOQh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>lands next month.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>is helmed by&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>alumnus Kentaro Tominaga, who served as a game designer on 2017's influential&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-wild" rel="nofollow"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em></a>, as well as working in a directorial capacity on the likes of&nbsp;<em>The Wind Waker&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Twilight Princess</em>.</p>

<p>It's not hard to see the influence of more recent&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>games on&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki</em>, but Infold's game places much more of an emphasis on cozy open-world exploration rather than combat and conflict (although that's definitely in there too).</p>

<p>The studio is promising activities like pet grooming, fishing, and fashion competitions in&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki</em>, as well as "evocative and engaging story quests" and plenty of platforming challenges to keep you busy as well.</p>

<p>You can check out the release date announcement trailer for&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>below. It also features the game's theme song, "Together Till Infinity", which is performed by pop star Jessie J.</p>




<p><em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>arrives for PC, PlayStation 5, and mobile devices on December 5th.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-group-financials-q2-2024</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/embracer-group-sales-fall-by-20-as-company-sells-casual-giant-easybrain-for-1-2b.1035717/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-group-financials-q2-2024<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Swedish conglomerate Embracer Group has released its financial results for the second quarter of the 2024-25 fiscal year, and things aren't looking great for the company, although a massive casual studio sale might help things along a touch.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://embracer.com/releases/embracer-group-publishes-interim-report-q2-july-september-2024-adjusted-ebit-amounted-to-sek-1207-million/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">financial statement summarizing the quarter</a>, Embracer reveals that net sales dropped by 21% on a year-on-year basis, while sales across the first six months of the financial year dipped by 23% (again compared to the same period last year).</p>

<p>More specifically, PC and console sales dropped by 46% for Embracer this quarter and by 40% across the first six months of the fiscal year. Embracer puts this down in part to the underperformance of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/epic-mickey-rebrushed-release-date" rel="nofollow">remaster&nbsp;<em>Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed</em></a>, which the company says sold "slower than expected".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/disney-epic-mickey-rebrushed-embracer-group-financials-q2-2024.jpg?itok=1SUBCpaB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/disney-epic-mickey-rebrushed-embracer-group-financials-q2-2024.jpg?itok=NPXY4TOl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed&nbsp;</em>hasn't done very well for Embracer, apparently.</figcaption></figure><p>Embracer also says that the releases of&nbsp;<em>Remnant 2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Payday 3&nbsp;</em>in the same period last quarter makes the year-on-year comparison "tough". It's worth noting here too that&nbsp;<em>Payday 3&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/starbreeze-studios-ceo-steps-down" rel="nofollow">hasn't exactly done too well</a> since launch, so it's not really providing a constant revenue stream for Embracer.</p>

<p>Along with its financial results, Embracer has also announced the sale of casual gaming giant Easybrain, the company that owns the Sudoku.com domain.</p>

<p>It's been sold to fellow casual gaming purveyors Miniclip for an eye-watering $1.2 billion, which, along with the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/raid-shadow-legends-developer-bought-620m" rel="nofollow">recent sale of&nbsp;<em>Raid: Shadow Legends&nbsp;</em>developer Plarium for over $600 million</a>, just demonstrates how strong the mobile and casual markets are.</p>

<p>In general, it's a bit of a gloomy forecast for Embracer; not a single one of the business' divisions has reported increased sales either this quarter or across the April-September period.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/embracer-group-financials-q2-2024-easybrain.jpg?itok=JaDa76aP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/embracer-group-financials-q2-2024-easybrain.jpg?itok=FIgHLC_v 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Easybrain is now under the Miniclip company umbrella.</figcaption></figure><p>According to the Embracer statement, the company also expects its overall yearly earnings to be lower due to "the delay of a number of notable H2 releases".</p>

<p>The company's lineup for the second half of the fiscal year includes&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-release-date-delay" rel="nofollow"><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tomb-raider-4-6-remastered-announced" rel="nofollow"><em>Tomb Raider 4-6 Remastered</em></a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hyper-light-breaker-trailer-shows-pulse-pounding-action-reveals-release-window" rel="nofollow"><em>Hyper Light Breaker</em></a>, with releases like&nbsp;<em>Killing Floor 3&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gothic-1-remake-collectors-edition" rel="nofollow">Gothic 1 Remake</a>&nbsp;</em>also apparently set to arrive sometime in the next year or so.</p>

<p>We're also currently awaiting the splitting of Embracer into three separate companies, as was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-group-splitting-three-companies" rel="nofollow">revealed back in April</a>. Embracer says that Asmodee, in particular, which will handle the company's tabletop properties, is poised to "build on its successful track record" and "[unlock] shareholder value".</p>

    <p><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> is as much about the world, story, and characters as the gameplay.

<p>BioWare’s reputation as a AAA game development studio is built on three pillars: world-building, storytelling, and character development. <a href="https://dragonage.fandom.com/wiki/Codex">In-game codices</a> offer textual support for fan theories, replays are kept fresh by systems that encourage experimenting with alternative quest resolutions, and players get so attached to their characters that an entire fan-built ecosystem of player-generated fiction and artwork has sprung up over the years.</p>
<p>After two very publicly disappointing releases with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/03/early-review-mass-effect-andromeda-is-dragon-age-inquisition-in-space/"><i>Mass Effect: Andromeda</i></a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/02/anthem-game-review-honestly-its-not-finished/"><i>Anthem</i></a>, BioWare pivoted back to the formula that brought it success, but I’m wrapping up the first third of <i>The Veilguard</i>, and it feels like there’s an ingredient missing from the special sauce. Where are the quests that really let me agonize over the potential repercussions of my choices?</p>
<p>I love <a href="https://dragonage.fandom.com/wiki/Thedas">Thedas</a>, and I love the ragtag group of friends my hero has to assemble anew in each game, but what really gets me going as a roleplayer are the morally ambiguous questions that make me squirm: the dreadful and delicious BioWare decisions.</p>
<p>Should I <a href="https://dragonage.fandom.com/wiki/Broken_Circle">listen to the tormented templar</a> and assume every mage I meet is so dangerous that I need to adopt a "strike first, ask questions later" policy, or can I assume at least some magic users are probably not going to murder me on sight? When I find out <a href="https://dragonage.fandom.com/wiki/Demands_of_the_Qun">my best friend’s kleptomania</a> is the reason my city has been under armed occupation for the past 10 years, do I turn her in, or do I swear to defend her to the end?</p>
<p>Questions like these keep me coming back to replay BioWare games over and over. I’ve been eagerly awaiting the release of the fourth game in the Dragon Age franchise so I can find out what fresh dilemmas I’ll have to wrangle, but at about 70 hours in, they seem to be in short supply.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<h2>The allure of interactive media, and the limitations</h2>
<p>Before we get into some actual BioWare choices, I think it’s important to acknowledge the realities of the medium. These games are brilliant interactive stories. They reach me like my favorite novels do, but they offer a flexibility not available in printed media (well, outside of the old Choose Your Own Adventure novels, anyway). I’m not just reading about the main character’s decisions; I’m making the main character’s decisions, and that can be some heady stuff.</p>
<p>There's a limit to how much of the plot can be put into a player's hands, though. A roleplaying game developer wants to give as much player agency as possible, but that has to happen through the illusion of choice. You must arrive at one specific location for the sake of the plot, but the game can accommodate letting you choose from several open pathways to get there. It’s a railroad—hopefully a well-hidden railroad—but at the end of the day, no matter how great the storytelling is, these are still video games. There’s only so much they can do.</p>
<p>So if you have to maintain an illusion of choice but also want to to invite your players to thoughtfully engage with your decision nodes, what do you do? You reward them for playing along and suspending their disbelief by giving their choices meaningful weight inside your shared fantasy world.</p>
<p>If the win condition of a basic quest is a simple “perform action X at location Y,” you have to spice that up with some complexity or the game gets very old very quickly. That complexity can be programmatic, or it can be narrative. With your game development tools, you can give the player more than one route to navigate to location Y through good map design, or you can make action X easier or harder to accomplish by setting preconditions like puzzles to solve or other nodes that need interaction. With the narrative, you’re not limited to what can be accomplished in your game engine. The question becomes, “How much can I give the player to emotionally react to?”</p>

    <div>
          
          
<p>In a field packed with quality roleplaying game developers, this is where BioWare has historically shined: making me have big feelings about my companions and the world they live in. This is what I crave.</p>

<h2>Who is (my) Rook, anyway?</h2>
<p><i>The Veilguard</i> sets up your protagonist, Rook, with a lightly sketched backstory tied to your chosen <a href="https://dragonage.fandom.com/wiki/Factions_(The_Veilguard)">faction</a>. You pick a first name, you are assigned a last name, and you read a brief summary of an important event in Rook’s recent history. The rest is on you, and you reveal Rook’s essential nature through the dialog wheel and the major plot choices you make. Those plot choices are necessarily mechanically limited in scope and in rewards/consequences, but narratively, there’s a lot of ground you can cover.</p>

      For the record, I picked “Oof.” That’s just how my Rook rolls.

<p>During the game’s tutorial, you’re given information about a town that has mysteriously fallen out of communication with the group you’re assisting. You and your companions set out to discover what happened. You investigate the town, find the person responsible, and decide what happens to him next. Mechanically, it’s pretty straightforward.</p>
<p>The real action is happening inside your head. As Rook, I’ve just walked through a real horror show in this small village, put together some really disturbing clues about what’s happening, and I'm now staring down the person responsible while he’s trapped inside an uncomfortably slimy-looking cyst of material the game calls <a href="https://dragonage.fandom.com/wiki/Blight">the Blight</a>. Here is the choice: What does my Rook decide to do with him, and what does that choice say about her character? I can’t answer that question without looking through the lens of my personal morality, even if I intend for Rook to act counter to my own nature.</p>
<p>My first emotional, knee-jerk reaction is to say screw this guy. Leave him to the consequences of his own making. He’s given me an offensively venal justification for how he got here, so let him sit there and stare at his material reward for all the good it will do him while he’s being swallowed by the Blight.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>The alternative is saving him. You get to give him a scathing lecture, but he goes free, and it’s because you made that choice. You walked through the center of what used to be a vibrant settlement and saw this guy, you know he’s the one who allowed this mess to happen, and you stayed true to your moral center anyway. Don’t you feel good? Look at you, big hero! All those other people will die from the Blight, but you held the line and said, “Well, not this one.”</p>

      Being vindictive might feel good, but I feel leaving him is a profoundly evil choice.

<p>There’s no objectively right answer about what to do with the mayor, and I’m here for it. Leaving him or saving him: Neither option is without ethical hazards. I can use this medium to dig deep into who I am and how I see myself before building up my idea of who my Rook is going to be.</p>
<p>Make your decision, and Rook lives with the consequences. Some are significant, and some… not so much.</p>

<h2>Your choices are world-changing—but also can’t be</h2>
<p>Longtime BioWare fans have historically been given the luxury of having their choices—large and small—acknowledged by the next game in the franchise. In past games, this happened largely through small dialog mentions or NPC reappearances, but as satisfying as this is for me as a player, it creates a big problem for BioWare.</p>
<p>Here’s an example: depending on the actions of the player, ginger-haired bard and possible romantic <a href="https://dragonage.fandom.com/wiki/Leliana">companion Leliana</a> can be missed entirely as a recruitable companion in <i>Dragon Age: Origins</i>, the first game in the franchise. If she is recruited, she can potentially die in a <a href="https://dragonage.fandom.com/wiki/The_Urn_of_Sacred_Ashes">later quest</a>. It’s not guaranteed that she survives the first game. That’s a bit of a problem in <i>Dragon Age II</i>, where Leliana shows up in one of the <a href="https://dragonage.fandom.com/wiki/The_Exiled_Prince">downloadable content packs</a>. It’s a bigger problem in the third game, where Leliana is the official spymaster for the titular Inquisition. BioWare calls these NPCs who can exist in a superposition of states "quantum characters."</p>

      </figure>

<p>If you follow this thought to its logical end, you can understand where BioWare is coming from: After a critical mass of quantum characters is reached, the effects are impossible to manage. BioWare sidesteps the Leliana problem entirely in <i>The Veilguard</i>&nbsp;by just not talking about her.</p>
<p>BioWare has staunchly maintained that, as a studio, it does not have a set canon for the history of its games; there’s only the personal canon each player develops as a result of their gameplay. As I’ve been playing, I can tell there’s been a lot of thought put into ensuring none of <i>The Veilguard</i>’s in-game references to areas covered in the previous three games would invalidate a player’s personal canon, and I appreciate that. That’s not an easy needle to thread. I can also see that the same care was put into ensuring that this game’s decisions would not create future quantum characters, and that means the choices we're given are very carefully constrained to this story and only this story.</p>
<p>But it still feels like we’re missing an opportunity to make these moral decisions on a smaller scale. <i>Dragon Age: Inquisition</i> introduced a collectible and cleverly hidden item for players to track down while they worked on saving the world. Collect enough trinkets and you eventually open up an entirely optional area to explore. Because this is BioWare, though, there was a catch: To find the trinkets, you had to stare through the <a href="https://dragonage.fandom.com/wiki/Ocularum">crystal eyes of a skull</a> sourced from the body of a mage who has been forcibly cut off from the source of all magic in the world. Is your Inquisitor on board with that, even if it comes with a payoff? Personally, I don’t like the idea. My Inquisitor? She thoroughly looted <a href="https://dragonage.fandom.com/wiki/Solasan">the joint</a>. It’s a small choice, and it doesn’t really impact the long-term state of the world, but I still really enjoyed working through it.</p>

    <div>
          
          
<p>Later in the first act of <i>The Veilguard</i>, Rook finally gets an opportunity to make one of the big, ethically difficult decisions. I’ll avoid spoilers, but I don’t mind sharing that it was a satisfyingly difficult choice to make, and I wasn’t sure I felt good about my decision. I spent a lot of time staring at the screen before clicking on my answer. Yeah, that’s the good stuff right there.</p>
<p>In keeping with the studio’s effort to avoid creating quantum worldstates, <i>The Veilguard</i> treads lightly with the mechanical consequences of this specific choice and the player is asked to take up the narrative repercussions. How hard the consequences hit, or if they miss, comes down to your individual approach to roleplaying games. Are you a player who inhabits the character and lives in the world? Or is it more like you’re riding along, only watching a story unfold? Your answer will greatly influence how connected you feel to the choices BioWare asks you to make.</p>

<h2>Is this better or worse?</h2>
<p>Much online discussion around <i>The Veilguard</i> has centered on Bioware’s decision to incorporate only three choices from the previous game in the series, <i>Inquisition</i>, rather than using the existing <a href="https://dragonagekeep.com/en_US/">Dragon Age Keep</a> to import an entire worldstate. I’m a little disappointed by this, but I’m also not sure anything in Thedas is significantly changed because my Hero of Ferelden was a softie who convinced the guard in the Ostagar camp to give his lunch to <a href="https://dragonage.fandom.com/wiki/The_Hungry_Deserter">the prisoner</a> who was in the cage for attempted desertion.</p>
<p>At the same time, as I wrap up the first act, I’m missing the mild tension I should be feeling when the dialog wheel comes up, and not just because many of the dialog choices seem to be three flavors of “yes, and…” One of my companions was deeply unhappy with me for a period of time after I made the big first-act decision and sharply rebuffed my attempts at justification, snapping at me that I should go. Previous games allowed companions to leave your party forever if they disagreed enough with your main character; this doesn’t seem to be a mechanic you need to worry about in <i>The Veilguard</i>.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p>Rook’s friends might be divided on how they view her choice of verbal persuasion versus percussive diplomacy, but none of them had anything to say about it while she was very earnestly attempting to convince a significant NPC they were making a pretty big mistake. One of Rook’s companions later asked about her intentions during that interaction but otherwise had no reaction.</p>

<p>Seventy hours into the game, I’m looking for places where I have to navigate my own ethical landscape before I can choose to have Rook conform to, or flaunt, the social mores of northern Thedas. I’m still helping people, being the hero, and having a lot of fun doing so, but the problems I’m solving aren’t sticky, and they lack the nuance I enjoyed in previous games. I want to really wrestle with the potential consequences before I decide to do something. Maybe this is something I’ll see more of in the second act.</p>
<p>If the banal, puppy-kicking kind of evil has been minimized in favor of larger stakes—something I applaud—it has left a sort of vacuum on the roleplaying spectrum. BioWare has big opinions about how heroes should act and how they should handle interpersonal conflict. I wish I felt more like I was having that struggle rather than being told that’s how Rook is feeling.</p>
<p>I’m hopeful my Rook isn’t just going to just save the world, but that in the next act of the game, I'll see more opportunities from BioWare to let her do it her way.</p>

Free Range Games’ survival and crafting game first launched on PC as an Epic Games Store exclusive in October last year, before coming out on PS5 in December.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While we’re on The Lord of the Rings, Embracer said Middle-earth Enterprises had a “slow quarter” year-on-year (the July to September Q2), with no notable new partner releases, but a higher film revenue than expected. Embracer said it’s seen encouraging fan reactions to the marketing it’s doing for the December release of anime <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-war-of-the-rohirrim">The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Embracer had a brutal Q2 for PC and console games, with tough comparisons from last year’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/remnant-ii">Remnant 2</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/payday-3">Payday 3</a>. The most notable new release, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/disney-epic-mickey-rebrushed">Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed</a>, late in the quarter, “was well received by players but initial digital sales were slower than expected.” That’s corporate speak for a flop. In contrast, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/satisfactory-review">Satisfactory’s 1.0 launch on PC</a> “performed above management expectations,” which means it did great. Coffee Stain Studios’ first-person open-world factory building game had over 200,000 concurrent players in September.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Embracer has endured a tough time in recent years, laying off thousands of staff (the number of game developers working at the firm has decreased from 10,654 to 6,250) and selling a number of its studios, including Borderlands maker Gearbox and Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 developer Saber Interactive. Today, it announced the sale of subsidiary puzzle game mobile developer Easybrain to digital games company Miniclip for $1.2 billion, which should keep the lights on for the foreseeable future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the rest of its financial year, Embracer is pinning its hopes on the hotly anticipated <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a>, which it said was still on track for its February 11, 2025 release date.

However, we acknowledge that parts of our PC/Console and Entertainment &amp; Services segments are still underperforming due to delays and low ROI for primarily small and mid-sized releases. Combined with fixed operating costs this creates unacceptable margins which we are firmly addressing ahead of the spin-offs."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other Embracer games in the works include Deep Rock Galactic: Rogue Core, Fellowship, Gothic 1 Remake, Hyper Light Breaker, Killing Floor 3, REANIMAL, Satisfactory (console), Titan Quest II, Tomb Raider IV-VI Remastered, and Wreckfest 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/14/max-mustard-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>There’s a fair few VR platforming mascots that have come and gone, the likes of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/05/astro-bot-review/">Astro Bot</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/11/03/super-luckys-tale-review/">Lucky</a> graduating to broader flatscreen adventure, leaving a gap for new heroes to fill. Enter the quite adorable, yet inexplicably named Max Mustard. Can he make the cut?</p>
<p><iframe title="Max Mustard Official Trailer | PlayStation VR2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/q_mfBhTzdAE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The game begins with a large, tentacle-y alien robot kidnapping a bunch of adorable critters, called Mudpups. Just as it’s about to get its tentacles on you, Max Mustard turns up and scares it off, so you immediately team up with Mustard to fight off the alien’s various minions and save the Mudpups. By controlling Max with your robot-VR-controller hands. It’s a platformer, it doesn’t need to make perfect sense.</p>


<p>The platforming in Max Mustard is similar to that of his VR platforming predecessors. It’s essentially a classic platformer but rendered in a world that’s wrapped around you in 3D, so you can physically move your head to look around and follow the character through the world. There’s also more player interaction with the levels, whether it’s shooting guns with your actual hands, peeking around corners for hidden collectibles, that kind of thing.</p>


<p>You’ll accompany Max through four arcs, each of which has its own overworld map to work your way through, freeing Mudpups and collecting coins as you go. The platforming here is good, but not particularly notable. It does everything competently, but it doesn’t do anything particularly special. However, being a VR game does help make it more notable.</p>
<p>In addition to some of those coins and critters being hidden behind corners or other places that are easy to miss if you’re not careful, there’s also things like the plunger gun that you get very early on that turns a level into a platformer/shooting range at the same time, or the vacuum gun that allows you to suck enemies up and launch them at others.</p>
<p>There’s some nice touches without these specific tools as well, such as one area where two coins were definitely out of reach of Max, but I was pleasantly surprised when my random thought to just reach out and pick them up with my actual hand worked!&nbsp;The game also isn’t afraid to throw you off ledges mid-level either, or if you are foolish enough to pull the “Do not pull” cord in the van between levels, it shoots you through the roof for a bit before you fall all the way back down and land back where you started. Things like this just make me smile similarly to when it first handed me a plunger gun. It’s just fun!</p>

<p>It’s this combinations of VR and platforming where the game really shines, but there are a few great ideas sprinkled through the levels that don’t rely on it as well. One level was made of alternating platforms that changed every time I jumped, and another did something similar in time to the music – music that could be customised part way through the level with buttons to turn instruments on and off and it stayed that way for the remainder of the level. There’s also a few mini levels, such as shooting ranges for the plunger gun with some pretty tight time requirements to gain a Gold medal and a Mudpup as a prize, or the coin frenzy where you just jump Max through a stream of coins to try and collect as many as possible in a certain time. This latter one is particularly useful when it comes to buying upgrades, which you can do at an in-game shop and has a selection of upgrades for both Max and yourself. The first one was unlocking snap to turn, so you can turn your view with the controller instead of physically turning in real life – honestly quite ridiculous to have an accessibility or VR comfort feature locked behind a game upgrade – but then there’s also the spin attack for Max, faster move speed, an in-the-air dash attack, and so on.</p>
<p>It all looks pretty great, too. On PSVR2 it is crystal clear without a frame drop in sight, not even when you’re flying through the roof of your van suddenly. There’s plenty of details in the world and especially on Max, whose ponytail flutters about in their wake. The game’s aesthetic is pretty much what you expect for a platformer – it’s all bright a cutesy, even the enemies, and it doesn’t need to do anything more than that really. Most importantly, If you walk Max close to you they’ll look right at you and I challenge you not to say “aww” the first time it happens.</p>

<p>Throughout all this, Max handles almost exactly like Astro Bot, right down to jet boots which let Max float a bit in the air rather than double jump, except Max’s boots shoot flames rather than lasers. It’s clear that Astro Bot was a big influence here, but there’s more as well – there’s critters to rescue ala Sonic, you save them by breaking the under-sized cages they’re trapped in like Rayman, there’s bouncy crates with arrows pointing upwards similar to Crash Bandicoot, you choose what level to play via a overworld map with set routes like Mario, Basically, there’s a love for platformers and you see the breadcrumbs of that appreciation spread throughout the game.</p>
<p>This feeds into the only real problem with the game: it’s just kind of unremarkable. It plays well, it’s competently designed, it looks good, and gathers various ideas from other places and blends them into a game that is good and enjoyable enough, but it isn’t going to blow your mind either.</p>
<p>The only other negative really worth mentioning is that, when moving your head and moving Max at once, you tend to end up walking off in the wrong direction because it can be fiddly to judge the direction, as it changes based on your view. This is easy to adjust your playing style for, and only cost me three deaths.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/microsoft-gaming-ceo-gives-subtle-dig-at-ps5-pro-price-were-not-growing-the-market-with-1000-consoles/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer was featured in several interviews this week. Firstly, he joined Fallout TV creator Jonathan Nolan on a panel at the Paley International Council Summit. During the conversation, the head of the Microsoft Gaming division <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-tv-series-benefited-from-not-launching-with-a-new-game-says-phil-spencer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> not having a new Fallout game ready for the show's launch was actually beneficial.</p>
<p>The executive then stopped by Bloomberg's New York City office for another interview. As reported yesterday, he <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-red-line-porting-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> there is effectively no limit to porting Xbox games to other consoles following the launches of Pentiment, Grounded, Sea of Thieves, and Hi-Fi Rush, and the announcement of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. He also confirmed the existence of an Xbox handheld project (which, however, will take years to complete) and suggested more acquisitions might be possible, especially if it is an Asian developer.</p>
<p>In the same <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-13/microsoft-s-gaming-chief-is-still-looking-for-acquisitions-sees-future-growth?utm_source=website&amp;utm_medium=share&amp;utm_campaign=copy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bloomberg interview</a>, Spencer gave a subtle dig at Sony's controversial pricing of the new <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/playstation-5-pro-hardware-the-next-gen-graphics-upgrade/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation 5 Pro console</a>, saying the market won't grow with consoles that cost $1K.</p>
<p><em>I feel pretty good about where this industry is going. To reach new players, we need to be creative and adaptive of new business models, new devices, new ways of access. We’re not going to grow the market with $1,000 consoles.</em></p>
<p>The basic PS5 Pro costs $699, but if you add the optional vertical stand and the disc drive, the price increases to over $800. That's twice as much as the launch price of the PlayStation 4 Pro, Sony's previous mid-generation console refresh. The PS4 Pro included a disc drive (but not a vertical stand).</p>
<p>Microsoft hasn't mentioned anything about a mid-generation console refresh for the Xbox Series S|X. They did it for the Xbox One, of course; the Xbox One X launched a year after PS4 Pro, offering far better hardware at a slightly higher price ($499). Microsoft probably calculated that due to the rising manufacturing costs, it would have to offer a console with similar, if not even higher, pricing than the PS5 Pro and decided it wouldn't be a good idea to launch such a console on the market.</p>
<p>Besides, Microsoft isn't really focused that much on consoles anymore. While they <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-generation-largest-technical-leap-ever-seen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promised</a> a next-generation console delivering the biggest leap ever (likely with the help of machine learning), their real approach is fully multiplatform, as evidenced by the push on cloud and other consoles.</p>

            <p>
Hello, person of exceptional musical taste; as you'll already be aware, assuming  you read the headline first and didn't just fall headfirst into this story by accident, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a>: <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Shadow of the Erdtree</a>'s sublime soundtrack is now officially available across all major music streaming platforms, meaning you'll be able cavort along to Divine Beat Dancing Lion's  boss battle music (costume not mandatory) until your extremities start to bleed.
</p>
<p>
Bandai Namco's newly released digital Shadow of the Erdtree OST totals 36 tracks (compared to the 67 tracks found in the base game), and features contributions from long-time From Software collaborators Tsukasa Saitoh, Shoi Miyazawa, Yuka Kitamura, Yoshimi Kudo, as Tai Tomisawa, alongside series newcomer Soma Tanizaki.
</p>
<p>
And as you'll already know, being a person of exceptional musical taste, Shadow of the Erdtree's soundtrack is a <em>treat</em>, featuring some of the best tunes in the entire game. Who can forget the hip-swishing fury of Divine Beast Dancing Lion, for instance, or the thrilling majesty of The Twin Moon Knight, or the sorrowful dignity of The Putresecent Knight? Or how about the cosmic splendour of The Mother of Fingers, the mournful Shaman Village, or even the bowel-loosening terror of the Abyssal Wood? Oh, and the absolutely gorgeous St. Trina's theme, which is fab for all sorts of reasons, but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNBpg8Apvvs">especially this</a>.

<p>
It's cracking stuff, and the whole thing is now officially available - in most cases to either stream via subscription or buy - on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/6ucsCXHRL0OXnAM51V8Cb9?go=1">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_m7ysHzZR8PaDYTXIy6Kk0pOhosGM3Dh8U&amp;src">YouTube Music</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0DM7FNLVJ">Amazon Music</a>, Deezer, Line Music, AWA, Mora, and Recochoku. Full links can be <a href="https://lnk.to/6fGbIkfK">found here</a>. For whatever reason, Shadow of the Erdtree's complete soundtrack is not currently featured on Apple Music or iTunes, but there <em>is</em> a <a href="https://music.apple.com/gb/album/shadow-of-the-erdtree/1760572104">truncated variant</a> knocking around on Apple's service.
</p><p>
Sadly, there's no new behind-the-scenes video to accompany this latest soundtrack release, but we can at least still enjoy <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIKUzL1cLpA">this performance of The Twin Moon Knight</a> shared a couple of months ago - you know, just to temporarily satisfy those ears of exceptional taste.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/when-does-new-black-ops-6-zombies-map-coming-out/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Call of Duty: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-season-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6 Season 1</a> is bringing a plethora of new content to the game, from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-unlock-maelstorm-in-black-ops-6-warzone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new weapons</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/full-details-on-new-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-maps-released/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">maps</a> to a huge overhaul for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warzone-season-1-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warzone</a> and an exciting <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-battle-pass-release-date-season-one-pass-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battle Pass</a>.</p>



<p>On top of all that, Zombies fans will be excited to hear that a new map is also on the way – Citadelle des Morts. For those eager to find out more about the new BO6 Zombies map, here’s everything you need to know, including its release date.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-the-new-bo6-zombies-map-have-a-release-date">Does the new BO6 Zombies map have a release date?</h2>



<p>Citadelle des Morts will arrive in the <strong>mid-season update for Black Ops 6 Season 1</strong>. As the new season arrived on November 14, and seasons tend to last around 8 weeks, we expect the Season 1 Reloaded update to arrive on <strong>Thursday, December 12, 2024</strong>.</p>



<p>Take this with a pinch of salt, as this is just speculation and not an official release date. Once Treyarch confirm the date for the mid-season update, we’ll be sure to let you know exactly when the new Zombies map will be arriving.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<h2 id="h-citadelle-des-morts-map-details">Citadelle des Morts map details</h2>



<p>Citadelle des Morts (Citadel of the Dead) is a <strong>round-based Black Ops 6 Zombies map that’s located in Europe</strong>, specifically the Principality of Avalon. It’s an <strong>abandoned medieval castle</strong> that is host to ghoulish horrors and hidden secrets. We don’t know many details, but from the teaser image, we expect the map to be fairly big.</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-season-one-mp-zombies-maps-modes-announcement#Citadelle" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CoD blog</a>, players will take control of the BO6 Zombies crew, <strong>Weaver, Maya, Carver, and Grey, directly after the events of Terminus</strong>.</p>



<p>This isn’t the first time players have fought waves of the undead in a castle, as Black Ops 3 brought Der Eisendrache. Hopefully, Citadelle des Morts can live up to the setting, as Der Eisendrache is one of the most beloved maps of all time.</p>



<p>The new map also arrives alongside a new Perk, Wonder Weapon, Gobblegums, Augments, and enemy types.</p>

Black Dragon is Mortal Kombat’s mercenary clan headed up at various points (the timeline is pretty complicated!) by fan-favorites Kabal and Kano. The lore justification here is Ghostface has been transported to Lui Kang's timeline without his partners from the movies, so recruits two members of the Black Dragon clan to help him out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, Ghostface is actually three characters in one. You can switch to temporarily playing as The Enforcer or The Assassin by holding a button during certain moves. You can tell them apart by their knives, if you look closely. You get 12 seconds to play as an alternative Ghostface before you revert back to the OG, or your opponent lands a hit and triggers the OG to come running back in.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players have analyzed The Enforcer and The Assassin’s unique movesets for hints at the Black Dragon characters’ true identities. Already, there are two outstanding suggestions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em><strong>Warning!</strong></em><em> Spoilers for the identity of Ghostface in Mortal Kombat 1 follow.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mortal Kombat fans have identified moves that are directly related to Kobra (Enforcer) and Kira (Assassin), two human Black Dragon members who each made their debut in 2004’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mortal-kombat-deception">Mortal Kombat: Deception</a>. We also see Assassin do Kano’s famous roll attack, but Kira does this move as well in both Deception and 2006’s Mortal Kombat: Armageddon. As you can see from the movesets, this one looks nailed on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Reaction to this revelation has been positive, not only because it’s a clever way of bringing back two rather obscure Mortal Kombat characters that perhaps would never have seen the light of day otherwise, but also because it leaves the door open for other, perhaps more wanted characters to appear as Kameos or even fleshed out DLC characters with a potential, but so far unannounced Kombat Pack 3.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Ghostface, the OG version is voiced by Roger L. Jackson, who has voiced the character throughout the Scream franchise. Ghostface joins the Mortal Kombat 1 roster on November 19 as part of the early access period for Mortal Kombat 1: Khaos Reigns Expansion owners, followed by wide availability for purchase on November 26. Up next is Conan the Barbarian and T-1000 Terminator.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

Infinity Nikki, the hotly-anticipated "cosy" open-world adventure from the designer of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857">Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a>, now has a release date.
</p>
<p>
Android, iPhone, PC and PlayStation 5 versions of Infinity Nikki all arrive on 5th December, Singaporean developer Infold Games confirmed today, allowing players to dress up, explore and befriend cute pets in an ever-expanding open world.
</p>
<p>
Infinity Nikki is the most ambitious project yet for the Nikki series, which has to date enjoyed enormous popularity in China.

This latest entry boasts involvement from Nintendo veteran Kentaro Tominaga, who worked for 20 years at the Mario maker and served as game designer on Zelda: Breath of the Wild. 
</p>
<p>
Infold's hopes for this new entry are clearly high, with a worldwide marketing push and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/infinity-nikki-tops-30m-registrations-and-its-not-even-out-yet">30m registrations for Infinity Nikki</a> already under its brightly-coloured belt. And yes, that is Jessie J singing the song for the game's trailer, above.
</p>
<p>
Infinity Nikki's smartphone predecessor Shining Nikki was downloaded 100m times, though was the subject of a cultural spat in South Korea over traditional costumes - leading to the game's Korean version being pulled, and criticism of the developer's handling of the issue.
</p><p>
At Nintendo, Tominaga served as assistant director on GameCube classics such as Zelda: The Wind Waker, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/legend-zelda-twilight-princess">Twilight Princess</a> and Mario Kart: Double Dash. More recently, he worked on Zelda: <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/legend-zelda-link-between-worlds">A Link Between Worlds</a> and received a special thanks credit in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-walkthrough-tips-9343">Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a>.

            <p>
There's a lot to love about <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>, but one of its most impressive and remarked-upon technical aspects is undoubtedly its advanced rendering of characters' hair. 
</p>
<p>
Hairstyles move and sway naturally as you and your party walk, while long hair streams out behind as you run. Your whole hairdo reacts if you are impacted by a sudden force or object.
</p>
<p>
There are up to 50,000 strands of hair on each of Dragon Age: The Veilguard's main characters, powered by something BioWare and EA's Frostbite engine team call Strand Hair technology. It's something originally worked upon for EA Sports FC, but which has been expanded upon greatly here.
</p>

<figcaption>Here's a video version of our Dragon Age: The Veilguard review.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f0BX-JXzek" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
"While Strand Hair is present in other EA games, the BioWare team had to push the limits even further for Dragon Age: The Veilguard," EA writes in a new deep-dive <a href="https://www.ea.com/technology/news/strand-hair-dragon-age-the-veilguard">blog post</a> on Stand Hair. "For example, implementing Strand Hair technology for characters who have waist-length hair with horns on their head presented some unique challenges.
</p><p>
"With hair attachments that move seamlessly, and the decoupling of simulation and render tessellation, this is the first EA game to offer such detailed physics-driven long hairstyles. The Frostbite team increased maximum hair length from 63 points to 255, and implemented a new system for complex hair structures like braids."
</p>
<p>
Tomb Raider's TressFX eat your heart out.
</p>
<p>
There's some detailed technical notes on how it all works, though perhaps the most interesting bit here is how BioWare had to overcome difficulties dealing with the wealth of other semi-transparent objects on screen. In EA Sports FC, this hadn't been much of an issue. Here, in scenes frequently enveloped in fog, smog or fire, it was. 
</p>
<p>
Ultimately, BioWare developed a system where each hairdo is rendered multiple times, with opaque and transparent layers rendered and then blended on the fly.
</p>
<p>
"We first render the opaque part of strand hair, and then we render transparent objects," BioWare's senior rendering engineer James Power noted. "The shaders for the transparent objects use the transparent hair depth texture to determine whether the shading pixel is 'under' or 'on top' of the strand hair. If it's below, it renders the hair and marks a stencil bit (think of it as a masking texture)."
</p>
<figure>

 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>BioWare</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
There's discussion here too of how Strand Hair's "high memory footprint" is handled without degrading the performance. Dragon Age The Veilguard was never going to have a full squad of 22 characters on-screen all with Strand Hair at once, as is the case in EA Sports FC. But the added complexity of longer hair and more technical environments mean BioWare needed ways to adjust memory usage when multiple characters are shown.
</p>
<p>
For lower quality settings on PC, as well as Xbox Series S, the ability to ditch Strand Hair for more standard hairdo assets is also supported.

		<p>A long-awaited update for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/warhammer-vermintide-2">Warhammer: Verminitde 2</a> is here, with the Versus PvP mode now available to play after a free update. Not only that, but Fatshark has announced another free DLC level pack, Verminous Dreams, will be released starting in December.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warhammer: Vermintide 2 - Versus PvP Mode | Release Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lpzON3pVSO8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Versus play has been a much requested feature in the Vermintide community, given how close in style it is to Left 4 Dead, which had an excellent take on PvP play.</p>
<p>That’s roughly what has been translated to Vermintide 2, with two teams of four facing off against each other, taking turns to play as the Ubersreik Five heroes and the Pactsworn, giving players five Skaven beasts to choose from, each of which has a specific ability – you’ll know them as the special enemies that you regularly face off against in PvE.</p>
<p>There’s a new set of challenges and rewards to go alongside this, designed specifically for and earned through playing Versus, but letting you show off in other modes as well.</p>

<p>Fatshark has also revealed that a new free DLC pack, Verminous Dreams, will be added to the game. This will feature three new levels, the first of which arrives for all platforms on 9th December, with the remaining two levels coming in early 2025.</p>

<p>While it originally launched in 2018 for PC, and has now been followed by the sci-fi fuelled Warhammer 40,000: Darktide, Vermintide 2 has remained a fun co-op staple. We revisited Vermintide 2 back in 2022 and had a fantastic time once again. Jim said:</p>
<p>“Overall, Vermintide 2 offers a brilliant core game bolstered by years of updates, content, and support from its developers. That kind of passion hasn’t gone unnoticed by the Warhammer community, who eagerly await what may be coming next for the series. That said, those hoping to see Vermintide 3 in the near future may have a long wait ahead of them with Fatshark currently focusing its efforts on taking their four player co-op formula to the far future in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/07/15/warhammer-40000-darktide-delayed-until-2022/">Warhammer 40,000: Darktide</a>. The team is no doubt hoping lightning will strike twice as they leave the fantasy world behind for this grimdark sci-fi setting.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-2-remake-coming-to-iphone-in-december/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The latest models of the iPhone are pretty capable when it comes to handling high-end games, and developers are working to take full advantage of Apple's A17 Pro and A18 Pro chips. We are now hearing that Capcom is readying its Resident Evil 2 remake for the iPhone and iPad, with the release date set for December 10, possibly a day after the company releases iOS 18.2 to the public.</p>

<p>To be precise, it will be Capcom's fourth Resident Evil game for the iPhone and iPad and only one of the few AAA games you can play on your iOS or iPadOS device. When Apple announced on stage that it would bring PC games to the iPhone, people presumed that the company would port the titles to a more handheld version. However, the capability of the iPhone's latest chips has proved to be more significant than we previously expected.</p>
<p>The company released a full-fledged version of the PC game for the iPhone and not a stripped-down 'lite' version. The games were brought to the mobile experience without any cuts or edits, and they remained the same as they were on PCs or consoles. The <a href="https://wccftech.com/apple-a17-pro-gpu-features-ray-tracing-metalfx-upscaling-resident-evil-iv-remake-village-assassins-creed-mirage-coming-to-iphones/">Assassin's Creed Mirage</a> was another title that made headlines when the company offered it on the iPhone with full controller support and stunning visuals.</p>
<p>Capcom has confirmed that the Resident Evil 2 remake will be released on iPhone on December 10. At this stage, the company did not mention how much the game would cost, but it did say that it would be just like other titles. You will be able to download the game free from the App Store and play the trial version absolutely free of charge. If you wish to continue playing and move out of the demo version, you must buy the full game.</p>
<p>If we presume that Capcom would remain true to its word, we can expect the price of the Resident Evil 2 remake to be between $19.99 and 59.99, similar to its existing titles. If you are excited to play the popular title on your mobile device, it is worth noting that only the latest iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro models will be compatible, along with last year's iPhone 15 Pro models with an <a href="https://wccftech.com/ipad-mini-7-decent-gaming-tablet-for-running-resident-evil-4-remake/">A17 Pro chip</a>. If you have a compatible iPad or Mac, you will still be able to enjoy the game and make use of cross-progression to continue where you left off on another device.</p>
<p>You can register for Resident Evil 2 on the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/resident-evil-2/id1640632432">App Store</a> right now. We will let you guys know when the title hits the App Store. We will be covering the performance of the game on the iPhone 16 Pro Max, so be sure to keep an eye out.</p>

            <p>Epic Games has given the OK for their 1998 shooter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/unreal">Unreal</a> to be hosted on the Internet Archive, essentially making the classic sci-fi alien blaster free, and preserving it for the future. They've also given the same permission for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/unreal-tournament">Unreal Tournament</a> to be hosted there too, making free the multiplayer muckabout that spawned speedier and speedier sequels throughout the early 2000s (not to mention the origin of one of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-making-of-facing-worlds-unreal-tournaments-most-popular-map">most memorable multiplayer FPS maps of all time</a>, Facing Worlds). </p>

<p>Epic gave permission for this very recently, say fan group Old Unreal (as spotted by the folks on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/epic-games-gives-the-thumbs-up-to-archive-org-copies-of-unreal-gold-and-unreal-tournament-goty-free-to-download-for-all.1035414/">ResetEra</a>). That fan site are leading the way in making the now-free games easier to download and install. Archive.org is great, but it's not always the most user friendly of libraries. So the gang of Skaarj custodians have created two installers that will do everything for you. Here's <a href="https://www.oldunreal.com/downloads/unreal/full-game-installers/">one for Unreal Gold</a> and <a href="https://www.oldunreal.com/downloads/unrealtournament/full-game-installers/">one for Unreal Tournament</a>. </p>
<p>These basically slurp the .iso files from the Internet Archive's server and run everything necessary to get the games installed on modern machines. I tested it for Unreal Tournament and, yup, everything looks lovely. You'll still need to do some extra steps to play online with others, though, say the Old Unreal gang. </p>
<p>Epic Games delisted the first Unreal from Steam a couple of years ago, along with all other Unreal games. The reasons for this are obvious, considering Epic has its own store that directly competes with Steam. It still annoyed some people though. Maybe now that two of these games are totally free, no questions asked, that move can be forgiven. We are recently seeing some moves here and there towards game preservation, such as GOG <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gog-are-doubling-down-on-game-preservation-and-making-it-easier-to-see-which-games-run-well-on-modern-pcs">renewing their vows to making classic games playable on modern PCs</a>. And this isn't the first time Epic gave their original shootso <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/unreal-free-for-20th-birthday">away for free</a> (although that was a temporary birthday celebration). But yes. All this is generally good. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-free-pc-games">Free games</a> are good.</p><p>Unreal, for its part, was an important and impressive bit of blastin' at the time of release. It scared me to death. But that's okay, I confronted those fears years later by asking various members of the development team <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/unreal-retrospective-from-the-people-who-made-it">what it was like to make back in 1998</a>. Short answer? People worked 70-80 hour work weeks, and made some nice alien cows. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
