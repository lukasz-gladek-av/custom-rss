			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/alan-wake-ii-it-truly-was-an-ocean/">Alan Wake 2</a> will fully utilize the PlayStation 5 Pro hardware to enhance the experience further and finally offer a ray tracing option on console.</p>
<p>The game's Quality and Performance modes in the game are both improved on the PS5 Pro, taking full advantage of the PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution upscaler to deliver better visuals and performance. Quality mode will offer 30 FPS gameplay with ray tracing and ray-traced reflections (opaque and transparent) with an internal resolution of 2176 x 1224 upscaled to 4K.</p>
<p>Performance mode, on the other hand, will sport significantly higher output resolution and more visual detail compared to the base PS5, offering better image stability, fog, volumetric lighting, and shadow accuracy. In this display mode, Alan Wake 2 will run at 60 frames per second with an internal resolution of 1536 x 864 upscaled to 4K, a much higher output than the base model's 1440p.</p>
<p>To better show how Alan Wake 2 is improved on PlayStation 5 Pro, Remedy Entertainment shared a couple&nbsp;<span>of early comparison videos, which can be found below. The game's&nbsp;<a href="https://www.remedygames.com/article/alan-wake-2-on-playstation-5-pro---behind-the-scenes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official website</a> also offers some more insights on how the developer took advantage of the upcoming console's power to improve one of the best-looking</span>&nbsp;games ever released.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pokemon-teraleak-points-to-new-online-co-op-pokemon-battler.1015293/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-teraleak-online-co-op-battler<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>Teraleak just keeps on going, and now, an upcoming game based around online co-op&nbsp;Pokemon battling has seemingly been leaked, although whether it's still in active development or not is unclear.</p>
<p>Per&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>leaker <a href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1848370639544914190" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Centro Leaks on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, data has been uncovered concerning something with the project codename "Rodeo", although Centro also points out that the name appears to have been changed to "Synapse" at some point during development.</p>
<p>According to Centro, the game revolves around the <a href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1848369217336488065" rel="noopener" target="_blank">concept of riding Pokemon</a>&nbsp;(hence Rodeo, I suppose); players have a Pokemon to ride, then throw out Pokeballs containing other Pokemon to do battle from atop their Poke-steed.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-teraleak-new-online-co-op-game-scarvi-starters.jpg?itok=gb3y7F7D 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-teraleak-new-online-co-op-game-scarvi-starters.jpg?itok=TcIevaxe 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A new co-op&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>game appears to be in the works.</figcaption></figure><p>A <a href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1848369678000791637" rel="noopener" target="_blank">concept art shot</a> from the game depicts a player riding a Garchomp, and <a href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1848370639544914190" rel="noopener" target="_blank">followup videos</a> also posted by Centro show players riding the likes of Electivire, Samurott, and Decidueye, so it looks like a wide range of Pokemon will be available as steeds.</p>
<p>According to Centro, the unnamed online co-op&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>game will also feature <a href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1848369840853004637" rel="noopener" target="_blank">mechanisms</a> that look rather similar to guns, although they're not quite as explicitly lethal as those you might see in&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/palworld"><em>Palworld</em></a>.</p>
<p>You'll be able to customize your mount Pokemon with <a href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1848369999963926921" rel="noopener" target="_blank">different markings</a>, Centro says, and <a href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1848370152389169227" rel="noopener" target="_blank">two protagonists</a> will be available, one male and one female.</p>
<p>Gameplay footage posted by Centro shows a Geodude using a ground-based attack and also throwing up a shield around its trainer, as well as a Piplup surfing a wave and using a bubble-based attack.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-teraleak-new-online-co-op-game-unite.jpg?itok=D4h_G9qZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-teraleak-new-online-co-op-game-unite.jpg?itok=D-XR8OII 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Like&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Unite</em>, this mysterious&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>co-op game appears to be based around co-op play, although whether it's competitive or not is unclear.</figcaption></figure><p>Given that the premise appears to show players both using gun-like weapons and riding Pokemon, this might shed some light on why Nintendo has pursued&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>developer Pocketpair so aggressively for <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-palworld-pocketpair-lawsuit">patent infringement</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, since Synapse-slash-Rodeo hasn't officially been announced yet, we don't know if it'll ever see the light of day as an official&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>project, but what Centro has shown looks pretty definitive, so we may well get an official announcement in future.</p>
<p>This is all part of what's being referred to as the&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>Teraleak, a leak in which tons of data relating to past, present, and future&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>games <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/game-freak-pokemon-hack-confirmed">was revealed online</a>. As you can see, the data from that leak is still coming, so we'll bring you more on this as soon as we get it.</p>

            <p>If you're fondly dreaming of an actual <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/steam-deck">Steam Deck</a> 2, not some half-and-half OLED travesty, you should also be fondly dreaming of a better class of battery. Valve designers Lawrence Yang and Yazan Aldehayyat have shared a little of the company's thinking regarding "generational leaps" in hardware, commenting that they don't want to release a Steam Deck sequel that is "only incrementally better", and in particular, that they don't want to release a new Steam Deck that is drastically more powerful at the expense of battery life.</p> <!--more-->
<p>"It is important to us, and we've tried to be really clear, we are not doing the yearly cadence," Yang told <a href="https://www.reviews.org/au/games/valve-steam-deck-australia-interview/">Reviews.org</a> in an interview to mark the handheld PC's release in Australia. "We're not going to do a bump every year. There's no reason to do that. And, honestly, from our perspective, that's kind of not really fair to your customers to come out with something so soon that's only incrementally better. So we really do want to wait for a generational leap in compute without sacrificing battery life before we ship the real second generation of Steam Deck. But it is something that we're excited about and we're working on."</p>
<p>The aforesaid Steam Deck OLED, the pair added, was more of a question of Valve adding features they wish they'd been able to implement for the original Steam Deck. "What we said when we launched the OLED was that this is not a second-generation device," added Yang. "This is what we would say is what we wish we had shipped originally for Steam Deck [LCD], and I think that has been borne out." </p>
<p>There are still a few things they'd like to add to the current generation of Steam Deck handhelds. Asked about the competing ROG Ally X's variable refresh rate display, Aldehayyat acknowledged that "VRR is a thing that we've been asked a lot about and I can say that we also wanted it really badly for the OLED ones. We just couldn't get it done on time. So that's probably a feature that is on the top of our list of things that we would like to do." And then there's the apparently decisive question of battery. "The battery life on Steam Deck, I think there's a general consensus that's the best in its class, but I would really love to have it be better," said Aldehayyat.</p><p>If I were hardware editor James Archer, I'd probably have a clever insight at this point about, say, the differing battery capacities of Steam Deck and its competitors, trends in battery tech at large, and the energy footprints and efficiencies of the next generation of processors. Here's his <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-deck-oled-review">Steam Deck OLED review</a> for context, in which he notes that "nothing about the Steam Deck OLED has as fundamental an impact on its day-to-day doings as the battery life upgrades."</p>
<p>The reason I, and not James Archer, am writing this news article is basically that I want to punish James for his fickle lending habits. You see, James very kindly let me borrow one of his own Steam Decks, a few months ago, then very unkindly - viciously, you could argue - asked to have it back again, so that he could "test" something or other.</p>
<p>I’m not sure how many Steam Decks James owns, but I hear he sleeps on a huge pile of them, like a dragon. Me, I have to sleep on a cold, hard bed of bricked Acer netbooks. Still, perhaps when the "real" Steam Deck 2 does roll around James will find it in him to part with one of the spare OLEDs he otherwise uses to light his cigars. In the meantime, I will be passive-aggressively pinching the odd nugget of hardware news and proudly displaying my ignorance. I don't even know what "variable refresh rate" means. I assumed they'd just spelt VR wrong.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This primary weapon replacement — a huge shield that lets you deflect bullets from enemy weapons — has sparked as much frustration as it has devilish delight, with critics claiming the riot shield encourages frustrating turtle tactics that are hard to counter, and fans saying, essentially, get good.</p><p>Over the last few Call of Duty games, the riot shield has met with consistent calls for it to be either nerfed or pulled from the game. It’s a particular favorite of the Modern Warfare sub-brand, appearing in last year’s Modern Warfare 3, 2022’s Modern Warfare 2, and 2021’s Call of Duty: Vanguard. Black Ops developer Treyarch, however, isn't a fan; the only Treyarch game to have a riot shield as a weapon was 2012’s Black Ops 2.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/21/mwiii-preseason-04-005-1729517952017.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Modern Warfare 3's riot shield in action.

Lo and behold, it is nowhere to be found; cue rapturous applause from (most) fans who are now looking forward to straight up gun fights in their gun game.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Seeing the full Black Ops 6 weapon list without a Riot Shield on it... <a href="https://t.co/XMHznKUOXL" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/XMHznKUOXL</a></p>— James - JGOD (@JGODYT) <a href="https://twitter.com/JGODYT/status/1848060374186082398?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 20, 2024</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">There’s this thing called shooting your gun.

In truth, the riot shield and its slower, more defensive gameplay probably wasn’t the best fit for the fast-paced Black Ops 6 and its new Omnimovement mechanic anyway.</p><p>We’re nearing the October 25 release date for Black Ops 6 and so we have plenty of information on what to expect.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mysterious-nintendo-switch-online-playtest-leaks<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The mysterious Nintendo Switch Online playtest announced a couple of weeks ago has leaked, because of course it has, and the feature that it appears to be heralding is...well, it's pretty odd, to say the least.</p>
<p>Said playtest was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-new-feature-playtest">first announced on October 10th</a>, and although Nintendo gave nothing away, speculation was rife. Was this the introduction of GameCube games to Switch Online? A new game altogether? Some kind of secret, heretofore-unknown DLC?</p>
<p>Within minutes of Nintendo announcing the playtest, the company revealed that signups were full, and with so many people taking part, the content of the playtest was bound to leak sooner or later. Lo and behold, that's exactly what's happened.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-switch-online-playtest-leak-mario.jpg?itok=t0IlD45d 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-switch-online-playtest-leak-mario.jpg?itok=mYvE34vy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Nintendo Switch Online playtest has leaked, and it's probably about as odd as you'd expect from Nintendo.</figcaption></figure><p>Before long, enterprising playtesters had <a href="https://x.com/Aro75615955/status/1848223364143354236" rel="noopener" target="_blank">leaked the page</a> shown to them by Nintendo for the playtest, and another leaker <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1kfClf9A9jQnsHN6v91dZ7RVbUvpB1fGzG0ew0KLy7B8/mobilebasic" rel="noopener" target="_blank">compiled a Google Doc</a>&nbsp;that showed off everything in the playtest in detail.</p>
<p>In short, the leaks appear to show a game in which you must develop a planet by "utilizing creativity and farmed resources". Nintendo's stated aim with the playtest is to "test the boundaries of mass multiplayer functionality and gameplay on our servers".</p>
<p>As you play this new game, you'll gain Beacons, which you can place within your Planetary Block. Within your Beacon, you can "move, lift, [and] edit items", and outside player Beacons, anyone can build.</p>
<p>You'll socialize with other players within an area called the Dev Core, which is also where you'll level up your character, get new items, and more. The test looks like it's showing off a game that's somewhere between&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em>,&nbsp;<em>Dreams</em>, and a shared open-world MMO <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bossa-studios-worlds-adrift-is-shutting-down-this-summer">like&nbsp;<em>Worlds Adrift</em></a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-switch-online-playtest-leak-worlds-adrift.jpg?itok=uWtaOc5A 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-switch-online-playtest-leak-worlds-adrift.jpg?itok=x-s0gP6u 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Nintendo Switch Online playtest game is somewhat similar to games like&nbsp;<em>Worlds Adrift&nbsp;</em>by Bossa Studios.</figcaption></figure><p>The eventual goal is for all players to create their own planet together, and said planet will seemingly be a mixture of player-created Beacons and communally-created spaces outside the Beacons.</p>
<p>It's not clear whether this game will eventually see the light of day for the general public or whether it's intended solely as a way for Nintendo to test its server infrastructure, but it seems like a pretty typically Nintendo idea to me. We'll bring you more on this as we get it.</p>

The packs had an expiration date of December 8, 2024 and had been purchased the day the video was filmed on October 16. “That’s mold,” Pansino says. “This is not safe, especially for kids who are young they might not know what mold looks like, and just eat it.”</p><p>As the parent of a five-year old who recently attempted to take a swig of a nearly empty juice bottle that had been discarded by the curb in front of our house for nearly a week, I can confirm that kids will try to do the dumbest shit. <br></p><p>“I just want you guys to know I did not fake this,” Pansino continued. She said the original intent of the video was to go over nutritional facts and differences between the two brands with some expert input, and share healthier alternatives that were still affordable. “I did not expect this.

Most notably, the small, standard rat foes everywhere throughout this chapter have a reasonable chance at dropping the material for you. Even better, there are multiple shrines with plenty of these meanies hanging around, so by the time you play through the chapter at a normal pace, you should get most of the Silk you need for your initial upgrades. If you need more, just farm these guys until you’ve crafted everything you want.</p><h3 id="h5199"><a id=""></a><strong>Unlimited Silk!</strong></h3><p>Later in the game, when you’ve unlocked the main hub known as the Zodiac Village, you can purchase unlimited Silk from Yin Tiger—he’s the big tiger wailing on an anvil in the back of the area.

<p>The second season of the hit Fallout TV show is set to start filming soon. Leslie Uggams, who played Betty Pearson in the first season of the show, says that Fallout season 2 begins filming next month.</p>



<p>She let the information out during an interview at New York City Comic Con. She was asked by <a href="https://screenrant.com/fallout-season-2-filming-start-month-revealed-leslie-uggams/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Screen Rant</a> when filming would start, and replied with, “We start November. I’m excited about it.”.</p>







<p>Fallout debuted in April 2024 to mass praise across the board. The show led to a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-76-hits-record-player-count-after-tv-show/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">record number of people</a> playing Fallout 76, and saw an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-games-growth-player-count-tv-show/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">increase in players</a> across the board for Fallout games. </p>



<p>The show was also quickly renewed for a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-tv-show-renewed-for-season-2-at-amazon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">second season</a>. As far as future seasons, showrunner Graham Wagner <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-tv-show-five-seasons/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suggested that five seasons</a> is possible based on the response of the first.</p>



<p>“Look, we’ve talked about three seasons and we’ve talked about five seasons,” he told the Hollywood Reporter in June. “Given the success of the show, five is suddenly feeling a little more appealing. But the industry is a temperamental thing and we kind of have to go into each season being like, ‘This is our last.'”</p>

                <p>Valve's Steam Deck has done a lot to expand handheld gaming--you can enjoy a whole lot of different kinds of games on the Deck, including many that would previously have been impossible to play without a much bigger PC or gaming console. Fanatical's latest bundle, the <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dpbolvw.net%2Fclick-100770772-13797872%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatical.com%2Fen%2Fpick-and-mix%2Fplay-on-the-go-premium-edition-build-your-own-bundle&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fnew-steam-deck-game-bundle-includes-a-bunch-of-great-games-for-3-each%2F1100-6527275%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Build Your Own Play on the Go Bundle Premium Edition (Fall 2024)</a>, is packed with games that are great for playing while traveling and are all Steam Deck Verified.</p><p>The Build Your Own Play on the Go Bundle includes 15 games, including numerous standouts. There's Tails of Iron, a gorgeous side-scrolling RPG with brutal combat and a hand-drawn art style, Arise: A Simple Story, a story-driven, emotional adventure game, the charming Zelda-like adventure game Blossom Tales II: The Minotaur Prince, the well-designed Pokemon-like Coromon, and the throwback 3D platformer Demon Turf.</p><p>The bundle includes management sims, RPGs, deckbuilders, and side-scrolling and 3D platformers, so you can find just about any kind of game experience you're looking for. And while all the games are Steam Deck Verified, they are also great picks for PC users who game on desktops, laptops, or Windows handhelds.</p><p>As with Fanatical's other bundles, the more games you grab in the bundle, the better the price you get for each one. Here are the three tiers:</p><ul><li>2 games for $7 - $3.50 per game</li><li>3 games for $10 - $3.33 per game</li><li>5 games for $15 - $3 per game</li></ul><p>Every game you add to the bundle after your fifth also goes for $3 each, so you can get all 15 games for a total of $45.

                <p>The next big Call of Duty game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2024-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6523361/" data-ref-id="1100-6523361">Black Ops 6</a>, launches on October 25. Many might be wondering how long the campaign will take to complete. That remains to be seen, but one of the game's senior developers has informed fans about the length they should expect and how it compares to the franchise's past.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-ops-6-is-set-to-be-the-most-varied-call-of-duty-campaign-ever" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> reported that associate creative director Jon Zuk said the Black Ops 6 campaign is "slightly longer" than that of 2020's Black Ops Cold War. That game was criticized for, among other things, a campaign that some said was too short.</p><p>We won't know precisely how long Black Ops 6's campaign is until the game releases and people start playing it. And even then, since everyone plays games differently, there will never be an "official" length.</p><p>Before this, Treyarch production director Yale Miller said the Black Ops 6 campaign will be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-6-campaign-length-revealed-as-dev-discusses-impact-of-launching-on-game-pass/1100-6524149/" data-ref-id="1100-6524149">about as long as you'd expect</a> from a Call of Duty game. "Currently, the game's netting out in the kind of length of a classic Call of Duty campaign," Miller said back in June.</p><p>Some of Black Ops 6's missions can be played in different ways, which might encourage some players to go back a second time. People might also play the game more than once to try a different difficulty option. Then there's the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2024-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6523361/" data-ref-id="1100-6523361">Zombies mode</a>, which returns to the popular round-based format. And Black Ops 6 comes with its popular multiplayer mode, which can be played for as long as the servers stay online.</p><p>However, Black Ops 6's campaign is told through a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/does-black-ops-6-have-multiple-endings-heres-the-answer-and-more/1100-6527283/" data-ref-id="1100-6527283">linear narrative with just one ending</a>, breaking away from the Black Ops tradition of having multiple endings to the campaign.</p><p>Black Ops 6 launches on October 25, and it'll be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-how-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-works-on-game-pass/1100-6524136/" data-ref-id="1100-6524136">available on Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass right out of the gate</a>. The game will also be available to purchase outright on all platforms, including Xbox, PlayStation, and PC.

            <title><![CDATA[Alas, LinkedIn Games Are Pretty Good]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/linkedin-games</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/alas-linkedin-games-are-pretty-good.1015197/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/linkedin-games<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Look, we all know LinkedIn is a <a href="https://aftermath.site/linkedin-weird-guy-video-games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hellhole</a>. Despite this, it’s weirdly popular with <a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/why-teenagers-love-linkedin.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">young people</a>, and terribly useful for <a href="https://news.linkedin.com/media-resources/linkedin-for-journalists" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">journalists</a>. Back in May, LinkedIn tried to lighten the mood of applying for jobs that don’t exist and having screeds from AI evangelists forced down your throat by adding <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/linkedin-has-games-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">games</a>, and it recently added <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/08/linkedin-releases-tango-game-after-launch-of-queens-puzzle-in-may.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">another</a>. I regret to inform you that these games don’t suck.</p><p>I only started playing <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LinkedIn’s games</a> recently, after my past Launcher colleague <a href="https://www.readergrev.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mikhail Klimentov</a> <a href="https://x.com/LeaderGrev/status/1846977278301163680" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tweeted</a> that they’re good. Mikhail is an inveterate shitposter, so I was prepared not to believe him, but dammit, he’s right. While aesthetically they look pulled straight off the pages of The New York Times, they’re not knockoffs: Queens is a sort of <em>Minesweeper</em> meets sudoku, where you use deduction to place a chess queen in rows, columns, and colored regions. Pinpoint feels like a less satisfying version of the Times’ Connections, where you guess the category various word clues relate to. Tango involves filling a grid with either suns or moons. And Crossclimb is kind of like a crossword puzzle, where you answer clues by changing one letter in each word.</p><p>The word games, Crossclimb and Pinpoint, lack the quality of clues that the Times’ games have, and since you only see one clue at a time in Pinpoint, it feels a little guess-heavy. I do like Crossclimb a lot, which combines answering clues with some interesting wordplay. Queens initially baffled me but now I’m totally into it, digging the way the wide-open field gets narrowed down as you think things through. Tango scratches my logic puzzle itch while being chill enough not to derail my morning. I have no desire to share my scores with my LinkedIn network or to develop a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2022/12/09/wordle-streak-walkout-nyt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">streak</a> or any of the other gimmicks the puzzles have in an effort to get me to spend more time on LinkedIn, but I <em>am</em> looking forward to playing tomorrow’s puzzles, which is weird because it means I’m looking forward to visiting LinkedIn.</p><p>While obviously every place on the internet is just trying to get a slice of the Times’ games pie, I do like that all these semi-knockoffs means we’re getting alternatives. Like probably many of you, I have a complicated relationship to the Times’ games, which are undeniably good but <a href="https://www.writersagainstthewarongaza.com/boycott-nyt" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hard to support</a>. (A part of the Times that <em>isn’t </em>hard to support, incidentally, is the <a href="https://nytimesguild.org/tech-contract-campaign/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Times Tech Guild</a> and their current contract fight.) I appreciate the lightness of LinkedIn’s games when compared to, say, <a href="https://www.puzzmo.com/+/polygon/today" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Polygon’s Puzzmo </a>offerings, several of which are some of my favorite games on my phone but are a little too long or mentally intensive to be good choices for starting my day, especially now that I don’t commute. (Case in point: I started writing this blog a few hours ago, went to check out the Puzzmo games, and now I’m still writing this blog.) LinkedIn’s games feel like they could occupy the same place that some of the Times’ games have for me, short brain warmups that I can play and then move on from, rather than games I dig in to play.</p><p>Anyway, all this has caused me to write far more words about LinkedIn than I’ve ever wanted to, thus playing right into LinkedIn’s hands, but credit where it’s due. The games have their own page, so you don’t have to go to your LinkedIn proper to access them, though because it’s LinkedIn I can now see that I have a ton of unread messages and notifications, few of which are relevant to me in any way. But if you are someone in my network who’d like to give Aftermath millions of dollars because I’m faster at Queens than you, please get in touch.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/valve-won%E2%80%99t-be-doing-yearly-steam-deck-releases.1015191/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/valve-wont-be-doing-yearly-steam-deck-releases/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>This will be a massive relief for many, as not many people will have the finances to be able to purchase a new handheld every year, especially if the upgrades aren't that significant. Luckily, most consoles nowadays don't do yearly releases, and people don't have to worry about trying to fork out for the newest console so that they fit in with everyone else. The Steam Deck is no different. In an <a href="https://www.reviews.org/au/games/valve-steam-deck-australia-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interview with reviews.org,</a> Lawrence Yang and Yazan Aldehayyat, two Steam Deck Designers, confirmed that they won't be releasing the console or console updates on a yearly cadence. While most of the world has had access to the Steam Deck and <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-software-impact/">other handheld competitors</a> for quite a while, Australia is now just about getting its hands on the device, with pre-orders opening up in November of this year. For many, this is likely a surprise as the world has had the Steam Deck since 2022, with the OLED being released worldwide as of November 2023. However, Australia is just now getting both the LCD and OLED versions of the device.</p>
<p>We all know that there will be a second Steam Deck in the future, which will add new features and build on the hardware of the Steam Deck to make it more accessible, as well as allowing a more extensive game library to be played. As it is, people have found ways to mod their Steam Deck, and have even found ways to play games like World of Warcraft on their Steam Deck, so it begs the question of what opportunities a new device would hold.</p>
<p>When it comes to the release date of the Steam Deck 2, it seems that the release date is still quite a way off. When speaking about other competitors doing yearly refreshes to the hardware, Valve instantly expressed that they won't be taking that approach for the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>"It is important to us, and we've tried to be really clear, we are not doing the yearly cadence. We're not going to do a bump every year. There's no reason to do that. From our perspective, that's kind of not really fair to your customers to come out with something so soon that's only incrementally better," says Yang. With this statement, they clarified that they are waiting for there to be a "generational leap in compute" before they start working on the next prototype, and want to make sure that there is no sacrifice in battery life before they start shipping the next console.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fallout-vault-13-mod-development-suspended<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The creators of ambitious&nbsp;<em>Fallout 4&nbsp;</em>mod&nbsp;<em>Fallout: Vault 13&nbsp;</em>have announced that they're indefinitely suspending development on the project owing to "a combination of factors".</p>
<p>In <a href="https://x.com/FalloutVault13/status/1848149475132375468" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a message on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, the mod's developers say that the decision to suspend development was "not an easy decision", but that it was "the right step at this stage of our journey".</p>
<p>In the coming weeks, the developers say they'll "release a full build of&nbsp;<em>Fallout: Vault 13</em>" that shows off the work they've done on the project so far, as well as unfinished content, so that anyone else "interested in continuing or building upon it in the future" can have access to it.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fallout-vault-13-mod-khans-house.jpg?itok=BZinYN1j 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fallout-vault-13-mod-khans-house.jpg?itok=l_Bh1uqz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Fallout: Vault 13&nbsp;</em>is no more, unfortunately.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Fallout: Vault 13</em>'s creators also say they're going to release a "retrospective" at some point in the future that will take a look at "the highs, the lessons learned, and the passion that drove this project".</p>
<p>As for the reason for the mod's cancellation, the devs explain their motivation (or lack thereof) in <a href="https://x.com/FalloutVault13/status/1848149475132375468" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a followup message</a>, attributing the suspension of development to a number of factors including burnout, recruitment issues, and "personal life changes among core team members".</p>
<p>Unlike other <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/yoko-taro-fan-archive-cease-and-desist-square-enix">prominent</a> fan <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/team-fortress-source-2-fan-project-ceases-development-after-dmca-from-valve">endeavors</a>, the mod's developers say there was no cease and desist from the IP owner (in this case Bethesda), nor was there any "infighting" between project developers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Instead, the mods rather even-handedly say that the mod was "an ambitious project being made with limited resources by volunteers", and that in order to preserve "the well-being of project members", the suspension decision was made.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Fallout: Vault 13</em>, it was an ambitious attempt to recreate the entirety of&nbsp;the original&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>in the engine of&nbsp;<em>Fallout 4</em>, complete with the more recent game's emphasis on real-time gameplay rather than turn-based combat.</p>
<p>It's one of a number of ambitious&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>fan projects; others include&nbsp;<em>Fallout: London</em>, another&nbsp;<em>Fallout 4&nbsp;</em>mod that lets players <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fallout-london-out-now">explore post-apocalyptic London</a>, and a major&nbsp;<em>Fallout: New Vegas&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fallout-new-vegas-gun-animation-mod">gun mod pack</a> that aims to overhaul the game's animations.</p>

<div>
<div><p>As The Twenty-Sided Tavern continues to make a big name for itself off-broadway at Stage 42 in New York City. After having confirmed guests such as <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="69be1d21-ed08-4802-903c-bde55c08c3c8" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/felicia-day-is-new-guest-at-twenty-sided-tavern-key-to-improv-and-dungeons">Aabria Iyengar, Erika Ishii, and Felicia Day</a> today another special guest was announced.&nbsp;Travis McElroy, of 'The Adventure Zone' and 'My Brother, My Brother and Me', will be appearing at the Twenty-Sided Tavern for seven "special Thanksgiving performances."</p>
<p>The Twenty-Sided Tavern is a Dungeons &amp; Dragons stage production that sees <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="05539938-70ba-4cd6-98cf-b51345d15acc" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/twenty-sided-tavern-is-bringing-interactivity-to-dd-stage-theater">Dungeon Master,&nbsp;David Andrew Greener Law (DAGL), and Tavern Keeper, Sarah Davis Reynolds,</a> work with experienced improvisational actors and plenty of crowd input to make their way through a one-shot every night.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/21/24273397/amd-ryzen-x3d-processor-zen-5-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>AMD is officially announcing its first next-generation X3D desktop processors today, based on its latest Zen 5 architecture. I’d love to tell you which Ryzen 9000-series X3D chips are arriving next month, but AMD is strangely only teasing a release date of November 7th and providing no pricing or further details.</p><p>AMD has only provided a single slide about this X3D announcement, ahead of Intel’s Core Ultra 200-series launch on October 24th. Rumors <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/amd-ryzen-7-9800x3d-rumored-to-debut-on-october-25th-a-day-after-intel-core-ultra-200k-launch">had suggested</a> AMD would announce its highly anticipated Zen 5 X3D chips a day after Intel’s performance embargo for the Ultra 9 285K, but AMD has decided to tease the existence of next-gen X3D processors a little earlier than expected.</p><p>Thanks to other leaks, we’re expecting to hear more about the 9800X3D soon, which will likely be the first next-gen X3D processor to launch on November 7th, with eight cores. <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/amd-ryzen-7-9800x3d-teased-with-5-2-ghz-all-core-clock">Rumors suggest</a> it will include a 4.7GHz base clock, with a boost clock of 5.2GHz or higher. </p><p>Some recently leaked <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/11/24268219/amd-ryzen-9000-x3d-leak">MSI slides also suggest</a> the 9000X3D series will be much better at productivity and creator workloads than the 7000X3D series. If MSI’s slides are accurate, it should mean the 9000X3D chips will provide similar performance in benchmarks like Cinebench R23 to the non-X3D Ryzen 9000-series chips.</p><p>These upcoming X3D chips might not give much of a boost in gaming over the 7000-series X3D parts, though. They should still easily beat <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/10/24265928/intel-core-ultra-200s-series-specs-release-date-pricing">Intel’s Core Ultra 200S chips</a> in gaming, particularly because Intel has already admitted that its latest desktop CPUs will be around 5 percent behind AMD’s existing 7800X3D chip.</p><p>Alongside this X3D announcement, AMD is also launching an early holiday promotion for its latest Ryzen 9000-series processors. The Ryzen 9 9950X is now discounted by up to $50, while the Ryzen 9 9900X, Ryzen 7 9700X, and Ryzen 5 9600X will all see up to $30 off.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Back in the protean stink of 2013, the beast we call <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/factorio">Factorio</a> sprouted in lowercase early access form and began its meticulous, ravenous conquest of the emerging factory sim genre. Some say that Factorio gave that genre life, though I'd point at Dwarf Fortress as one among many notable forebears. Today, the terrain of factory simming is hotly contested by rival piles of conveyor belt spaghetti. I'm not just talking about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/satisfactory">Satisfactory</a> or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/shapez-2">Shapez</a> - they're even making <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sixty-four-is-a-very-elegant-abstract-factory-sim-with-sinister-depths">philosophical factory sims</a> these days. They have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/premature-evaluation-good-company"><em>cosy</em> factory sims</a> now.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the immense, smoke-rimmed cyborg eye of Factorio has turned from the exhausted soil to the relatively untapped heavens. Somewhere up there, there is unspoilt territory. Somewhere, there is land that has never known the roar of a smelter - and in Factorio's behemothic Space Age DLC, out today, you will find it.</p><!--more-->

<p>Factorio Space Age - <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/645390/Factorio_Space_Age/">Steam page here</a> - is being described as an effective sequel, which seems pretty fair given that it adds five new world types with their own mass of variables to the game. The first of these world types are space platforms, "flying factories that act as the means of transportation between planets", which need to be equipped with turrets and thrusters. Sounds hazardous, but perhaps not as much as Vulcanus, a world blanketed in ash where you'll craft unbreakable tungsten and dip your pipes in magma. Or Fulgora, a world of ancient technology where you'll have to worry about nightly lightning storms (which can be harnessed to power your buildings).</p><p>On Gleba, meanwhile, there's the opportunity to do a little biomechanical engineering by harvesting weird flora. Be sure to "cook, crush, and process your produce before they rot and turn to spoilage". On Aquilo, finally, freezing conditions oblige you to build a monstrous central heating system to keep machines functioning. Those who do so successfully will "unlock the power of cryogenic technologies and fusion power". As with base Factorio, each planet has its particular menagerie of indigenous species who won't take kindly to your attempts to strip the habitat bare.</p>
<p>All this in addition to: over an hour of new orchestral music from Czech composer Petr Wajsar! Elevated railways, which let you lay tracks across oceans and set up finicky multi-level intersections! An appropriately hefty price tag! I don't know exactly what the plan is for a Factorio Space Age review, but Ollie has been conspicuously absent this afternoon. Behind his door, I hear the screech and thunder of pistons. Through his keyhole spills a mad, dancing light, like the passage of comets. Either he's working on a review for us or he's having trouble with his crimping iron again.</p>
<p>If you don't have the pocket money for Space Age right now, the good news is that it's landing alongside a major free overhaul for the base game, which adds a new fluid system and improvements for train controls and worker robot AI, amongst much else.

When I start playing <em>Fear the Spotlight</em> as Vivian, all I carry in my <em>Silent Hill</em>-style inventory is a rosy envelope containing a letter I want to give Amy to confess my feelings. But in the top right corner of my inventory, I see Vivian’s pink lungs, too, which blink with either green, yellow, or red light depending on her health state. Vivian has asthma, so unless I pick up one of the many inhalers hidden throughout the game, I need to be careful with her heart.<br></p><p>First, I just need to get through the night. Wanting to impress Amy, who has teenage witch tendencies, Vivian organized a school library exhibit on the occult and included a weathered ouija board in the display. Tonight, Amy wants to use it, so I help her light a few candles and put my hands on the planchette. Almost immediately, the lights go out, Amy goes missing, and I prepare to wander a twisted version of my high school in order to find her.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="02222bcf1b2ad1585b58e1b259185874" data-recommend-id="image://02222bcf1b2ad1585b58e1b259185874" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The text &quot;A burned letter and rose&quot; is visible below a low-poly representation of said items.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It’s the exact same story—with the same puzzles and resolution—that <em>Fear the Spotlight</em> had in 2023, when Cozy Game Pals initially released it. People who have already completed the game a year ago may not want to play through its (perfectly paced) two-hour-long campaign again, though <em>Fear the Spotlight</em>’s Blumhouse edition also offers console ports, additional language translations, and new story content players can access after finishing the base game once.<br></p><p>Anyway, <em>Fear the Spotlight</em>’s horror is the kind that slowly pools — like blood around a scraped knee — so there’s still value in revisiting the game and allowing its more distressing aspects to gradually tear you open. Like its low-poly graphics, which give the game the same muddy quality as a lost teddy bear, left out in the rain. Admittedly, these PS1 graphics make Amy and Vivian look like extras from <em>The Lego Movie</em>, but they also enhance <em>Fear the Spotlight</em>’s surreal environmental details, which include flayed love birds and burnt roses.<br></p><p>Though it’s more romantic than the games that inspire it, <em>Fear the Spotlight</em> clearly pays homage to 90s and 2000s horror, and I especially see elements of <em>Silent Hill</em> and the high school survival horror game <em>ObsCure</em> in it. Like the former, <em>Fear the Spotlight</em> is stocked with cryptic poems and puzzles — including one that requires you tap bloody piano keys in the right order, like you had to do <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://silenthill.fandom.com/wiki/Piano_Puzzle&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://silenthill.fandom.com/wiki/Piano_Puzzle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in Konami’s 1999 game</a></span>. Like the latter, <em>Fear the Spotlight</em> turns its scholastic setting into the hell some kids and <em>Carrie</em> think it is. Shortly after Amy disappears, the library Vivian was sitting in turns as black and crumbly as an Oreo when fire breaks out and pushes her through a crack in the wall. There was a fatal fire at the school decades ago, too, though the one I experience as Vivian seems more supernatural. Before it started, I noticed dark figures with white eyes staring at me from between the bookshelves.<br></p><p>Once I emerge from the wall and see that the school is now dirty, empty, and outfitted with pay phones, I’m more sure of it: I’ve been transported into the past, and pieces of spiral notebook paper with scribbled notes from students offer insight into why I’m here. It seems like the historic fire wasn’t an accident, and Amy, with her psychic connection to the spirit world, could be a victim of it, too.</p><p>In reaching her, I’m forced to avoid an eerie recurring enemy: a man, seemingly, with a bloodied shirt and a spotlight for a head. As he wanders down hallways and around rooms hissing that he knows I’m in there, the orange beam of his skull searches for me and burns my whole body if it finds me. “<em>Fear the Spotlight</em>,” you know.</p><figure id="" data-id="d21455513c80a70211d039739087bb4b" data-recommend-id="image://d21455513c80a70211d039739087bb4b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A humanoid figure with a spotlight for a head glares.

Text reads, Spotlight: You are not taking her away from me!" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Inhalers, like I mentioned, cure Vivian of damage, but since she’s unequipped for combat — she was prepared for confessing her feelings, not taking on the Underworld like Orpheus — I deal with the spotlight enemy by running and hiding under things like desks. I get in a comfortable habit with this, though avoiding the spotlight is sometimes impossible and often makes me yelp with frustration. If only a millimeter of unlucky Vivian’s body sticks out from between lockers or debris, the spotlight zaps her entire body in a way that feels unintentional, not scary. To make <em>Fear the Spotlight</em>’s occasionally unfair enemy encounters even more tiresome, the game’s final battle totally does away with the sneaky self-preservation I’m forced to use throughout the game. It instead requires I assume an offensive position in an awkwardly telegraphed fight, and I couldn’t wait for it to be over so that I could go back to appreciating <em>Fear the Spotlight</em>’s much more compelling interpersonal drama.<br></p><p>After the credits roll, though, I enjoy <em>Fear the Spotlight</em>’s bonus content, which allows me to play the same story from Amy’s perspective. Since Amy spends nearly all of <em>Fear the Spotlight</em>’s base game in psychic purgatory, her perspective is interesting and conceptual.</p><p>After she vanishes from the ouija board table, she feels as if she is locked away in a dilapidated version of her childhood home, which is shuttered and guarded by puzzles — I must find the painting of Jesus to place on the candlelit table, use the hammer I found to rip plywood off of a door frame, etc.<br></p><p>Through it all, I receive eerie voice recordings of Vivian on my phone, which suggest someone has been listening to us get closer to one another for a long time. Sometimes, I get to peek through my locked front door’s peephole and see what Vivian’s enduring to find me, which only makes me more eager to get out. It doesn’t help that I’m being stalked by my childhood fear — a giant, soaking wet demoness from a movie I saw. When my stealthing inevitably fails and she tries ripping my guts out with her hand, I have to sniff the incense sticks I pick up around the house to ease my mind and restore my health.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="76fdbcff07645c9cecd71dc795c4ff20" data-recommend-id="image://76fdbcff07645c9cecd71dc795c4ff20" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A small candlelit altar holds a cross, a stylized representation of a religious figure, and a book." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A small candlelit altar holds a cross, a stylized representation of a religious figure, and a book." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blumhouse Games</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="76fdbcff07645c9cecd71dc795c4ff20" data-recommend-id="image://76fdbcff07645c9cecd71dc795c4ff20" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A small candlelit altar holds a cross, a stylized representation of a religious figure, and a book." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>But, for Amy, it’s worth getting impaled by mythical creatures to reunite with Vivian, much like Vivian is willing to get zapped by a hundred demonic spotlights in order to find Amy. This devotion, even more than <em>Fear the Spotlight</em>’s fantastic, hallucinatory setting, is what kept me with my face stuck to my Switch screen.<br></p><p>That’s unusual for me. I mostly play horror games for the scares, to distract myself from what I believe is the horror of my life — <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ocd-horror-video-games-mental-health-outlast-bloodborne-1849711413&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ocd-horror-video-games-mental-health-outlast-bloodborne-1849711413">my anxiety disorder</a></span> and a new round of insomnia, which can keep me up for days. On the most terrible occasions, I get too exhausted to do anything other than cry with the lights out. But <em>Fear the Spotlight</em> offers me solace over escapism. It tells me that love is everywhere, especially in the dark. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Crimson Desert won’t be a PlayStation 5 (PS5) exclusive, but its not because of Sony’s lack of trying. According to new information from an <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/pearl-abyss-at-kiwoom-securities-corporate-day-event-we-were-offered-an-exclusive-contract-for-crimson-desert-by-sony-but-refused-and-more.1014846/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">investor meeting</a> in September, it was revealed that Sony tried to convince developer Pearl Abyss to bring the action-adventure game exclusively to the PS5.</p>



<p>With the agreement, like most, Sony would’ve required Crimson Desert not be released on Xbox for a “certain period of time”. However, Pearl Abyss said that they decided to move forward with self-publishing the game because “it was judged that self-publishing would be highly profitable”.</p>







<p>In addition to trying to bring the game to PS5 exclusively, Sony reportedly had high praise for Crimson Desert as a whole. In terms of its story and atmosphere, it was compared it to the successful Ghost of Tsushima.</p>



<p>Despite no final systems being confirmed, this news almost guarantees that the game will be available on PS5, Xbox, and PC at launch. There’s also no set release date just yet, but the game is expected to release in Q2 2025. More information should be announced over the next few months.</p>



<p>What do you think of Pearl Abyss declining Sony’s offer to make Crimson Desert a PS5 exclusive? Let us know down below, or in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/1054/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forums</a>.</p>

<p>It has just been announced that Rebel Wolves, the new studio made up of CDPR veterans, has partnered with Bandai Namco to publish Dawnwalkers, the team’s first AAA RPG. It’s a ‘brand-new IP aimed at mature audiences and is powered by Unreal Engine 5.’ Not much is known about Dawnwalker, other than the fact that it’s a sandbox-based title set in a dark fantasy universe.</p>



<p>This will be Rebel Wolves’ first outing, and it’s now being backed by the publishing power of Bandai Namco, a titan of the industry that’s no stranger to RPG titles like this. Historically, Bandai Namco worked with CDPR to distribute The Witcher series of games in some markets.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-a-new-universe">A New Universe</h2>



<p>Per a recent press release, it was reiterated that Dawnwalker is an action-RPG game that’ll have players explore ‘medieval Europe’, with a few twists. In the first and only piece of concept art shared to showcase the game, we see what could be explained as a typical medical landscape, but there are a few core differences.</p>



<p>For instance, a bannerman dressed in medieval garb is some kind of grotesque creature, and he’s preparing to face off against what must be a vampire of some kind. It’s a lithe, muscular character sliding down a cliff face while being swarmed by bats, and he’s slowing his descent by digging strong claws into the cliff. </p>



<p>It sounds compelling enough, I just can’t wait to see more.</p>



<p>In a statement, Rebel Wolves’ CPO, Tomasz Tinc, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>Rebel Wolves is a new studio built upon solid foundations: a combination of experience and fresh energy. Bandai Namco Entertainment Europe, a company known for its dedication to the role-playing genre and willingness to engage with new IPs, is a perfect match for our Wolfpack. Not only does it share our values, but also its track record in publishing narrative-driven RPGs speaks for itself.</em> <em>We’re looking forward to working with them to bring the first chapter of the Dawnwalker saga to gamers worldwide.</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>‘The first chapter of the Dawnwalker saga’ is another nod to this being the first in a series of games. I’m hoping it ends up being as engaging as The Witcher, pulling across the team’s experience from working on <em>those </em>games.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 - PC Features Launch Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>While the overall Black Ops 6 narrative has one ending, some of the game's missions will allow players to pick and choose how they want to complete objectives. Lead narrative producer Natalie Pohorski said, "Some of the missions have those options of like, 'Okay, these are the objectives,' and then you can kind of get the lay of the land and choose which one you want to tackle first."</p><p>Pohorski added: "If you want to go in hot or stealthy, there's options for that too. So it kind of depends on the mission, but I think that's where some of the replayability comes in with the political gala.
