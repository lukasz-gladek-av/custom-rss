			<p>A new Final Fantasy VII Rebirth mod now available for download introduces ray-traced global illumination and significantly improves lighting, but with a barrier of entry.</p>
<p>The FF7 Rebirth RTGI Remake-Grading ReShade preset, now available on <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasy7rebirth/mods/222?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nexus Mods</a>, addresses what is possibly one of the game's most glaring issues, the lighting, which makes the image look washed out and is a considerable step down from Final Fantasy VII Remake's lighting. The aim of the preset created by ShinObi12 is to bring the contrast and tone closer to that of Remake, which was used as a reference, and tame the adaption to feel more natural while adding RT bounce lighting. Judging from the comparison screenshot, the preset definitely achieves what it sets out to do, giving the game a more natural look in both indoor and outdoor locations.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this ReShade preset is not exactly available for free, as it requires Pascal Gilcher's iMMERSE Pro shader, which can be downloaded by subscribing to the developer's <a href="https://www.patreon.com/mcflypg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Patreon</a> Ray Tracers tier. On the other hand, the cost of the subscription is only $5, which is definitely worth the visual improvements the shader can bring to a lot of games both old and new.</p>
<p>Despite some issues besides the downgraded lighting system over Remake, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is doing great on PC, as the game was the <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-had-great-steam-launch-best-selling-game-of-the-week-ending-jan-25/">best-selling game on Steam for the week ending January 25th</a>. The game's success is totally deserved, as it is an excellent continuation of the series, as highlighted by Kai in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/">review</a> of the PlayStation 5 version.</p>
<p>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is now available on PC and PlayStation 5 worldwide.</p>

            <p>If, like me, you failed and failed and failed to get a decent score in arcadey reaction game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/have-you-played-super-hexagon">Super Hexagon</a>, then take solace in this: there are a bunch of other games by the same developer you can fail at. Terry Cavanagh, also the maker of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vvvvvv">VVVVVV</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dicey-dungeons">Dicey Dungeons</a>, is releasing a collection of his freeware bits and bobs on Steam next week, called simply <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/terrys-other-games">Terry's Other Games</a>. Looking at the games included, it summons a nostalgic giggle just to see just how many of Terry's short, free games have been intriguing enough to grab the eye of an RPS writer over the years. I mean it literally. One game is called <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/grab-them-by-the-eyes">Grab Them By The Eyes</a>. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>There are 21 games in total. Others in the collection which we've previously written about include the clever isometric illusions of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-entire-world-is-a-lie-in-vvvvvv-creators-nayas-quest">Naya's Quest</a>, minimalist rando-gen thief 'em up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/free-loaders-heist-heist-baby">Tiny Heist</a>, and first-person co-op puzzler <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/at-distance">At A Distance</a>, which demands to be played on two machines side by side for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/watchngame-at-a-distance">full lateral-thinky effect</a>. </p>
<p>"But it also includes a bunch of smaller, messier games," says Cavanagh on the Steam page, "experimental games made in a weekend, an unfinished prototype, joke games I made for game jams, a game I made as a teenager." </p>

<p>That sounds as much an act of vulnerability as it is releasing a game, like those videos where artists <a href="https://youtu.be/V1F8YfAYOdk?si=vdGzsME9GUUPHcaE&amp;t=18">tour their sketchbooks</a>, or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNPFs_wBVzM&amp;t=0s">go through old work</a>. There is some achievement hunting to the proceedings as well. Each game in the launcher comes with a couple of tasks to fulfil for twinkling stars. But wait, this may be a trap. I have chased after all the shiny trinkets in VVVVVV, and I can tell you: it was only partially worth the hair loss. </p><p>Terry has <a href="https://distractionware.com/blog/2025/01/so-whats-in-the-collection/">written up the reasoning</a> for many games he has included, but also his thoughts on those he has excluded. Constellation - a swell wee browser game about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/super-hexagon-creator-releases-constellation">typing random words to see what appears</a> - didn't make the cut because you'd need a keyboard and he wanted every game to be uniformly playable on controller. </p>
<p>"Also! This game is weirdly tricky to localise," says Cavanagh, "because the word list is really particular and built about what words prompt you to think of other words, and those connections don’t quite seem to translate from one language to another."</p>
<p>Makes sense! I always get the feeling localisation and language is important to Cavangah. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dicey-dungeons-can-now-be-played-in-irish-with-a-gamepad">Dicey Dungeons was translated to Irish</a>, for example, and this collection is <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/unaminh.bsky.social/post/3lgspcwft6s2o">getting the same treatment</a>. You don't have long to wait, it'll be <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2824580/Terrys_Other_Games/">releasing on Steam</a> on Feb 13th. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
The UK government has said it won't tighten the law to protect video game fans who feel ripped off when a product they've bought becomes unusable - such as when a live-service game sees its servers switched off.
</p>
<p>
In a lengthy <a href="https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/702074">statement</a>, the government said it "had no plans to amend consumer law on digital obsolescence", and that video game companies would simply continue to be bound by existing legislation.
</p>
<p>
Almost 13,000 people had signed a petition stating that current laws do not do enough to dissuade video game companies from switching off games, partly or fully, "as a form of planned obsolescence" - leaving owners unable to continue using their purchase.
</p>
<p>
"We are aware of issues relating to the life-span of digital content, including video games, and we appreciate the concerns of players of some games that have been discontinued," the UK government said.
</p>
<p>
"Video games sellers must comply with existing consumer law - this includes the Consumer Rights Act 2015 (CRA) and Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008 (CPR).  However, there is no requirement in UK law for software companies to support older versions of their products.
</p><p>
"Decision-making is for those companies, taking account of commercial and regulatory factors and complying with existing consumer law. There may be occasions where companies make decisions based on the high running costs of maintaining older servers for games with declining user bases."
</p>
<p>
So, what are the provisions under existing law?
</p>
<p>
The CRA requires that products are fit for purpose and sold as described to consumers, and the government has acknowleged this extends to digital content, such as games bought via Steam or the Nintendo eShop, as well as physical items such as boxed games that contain a cartridge or disc.
</p>
<p>
But the government's response here also acknowledges that "it may be difficult and expensive for businesses to maintain support" over time. Ultimately, the government simply states that "if software is offered for sale that is not supported by the provider, then this should be made clear" - although in the majority of cases, video games are sold in a working condition, only for services to be switched off later.
</p>
<p>
The CPR, meanwhile, covers the information about a product available to a consumer at the time of purchase, and is designed to ensure buyers can make informed decisions about what they buy. 
</p>
<p>
"If consumers are led to believe that a game will remain playable indefinitely for certain systems, despite the end of physical support, the CPR may require that the game remains technically feasible (for example, available offline) to play under those circumstances," the government wrote.
</p>
<p>It's interesting to see live-service battler <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/thats-all-folks-another-warner-bros-live-service-bites-the-dust">MultiVersus take this approach when it shuts down</a> - this time for good. Publisher Warner Bros has said the game will remain playable offline for those who previously bought a copy.</p>
<p>
What can you do if you think the law has been broken? You can report a breach of the CPR to Citizens Advice, which can then refer complaints to Trading Standards and the Competition and Market Authority (CMA), which enforce the legislation. The recent Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act (DMCC) links into this, and from April will give the government "the power to add, amend or remove" any commercial description deemed unfair.
</p><p>
The other side to the loss of games is the disappearance of the creative work itself - something that has been highlighted by a growing awareness of the need for proper video game preservation. Silent-era American films have a better survival rate than classic video games - and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games-preservation-took-steps-forward-in-2024-but-still-has-a-long-way-to-go">as Will Butler summarised today, despite some improvements there is still a lot of work to be done</a>.

		<p>The next <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/id@xbox">ID@Xbox</a> Showcase is streaming on 24th February at 10am PT / 1pm ET / 6pm GMT as part of IGN Fan Fest.</p>
<p>There’s a big bunch of developers set to take part, but one of the few revealed highlights will be a new collaboration for addictive poker-like roguelite <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/balatro">Balatro</a>.</p>


<p>Here’s some of the studios that will be turning up with new trailers and reveals:</p>
<ul data-cy="list">
<li>11 Bit</li>
<li>BigFan</li>
<li>Critical Reflex</li>
<li>Daedalic</li>
<li>Game Source Entertainment</li>
<li>No More Robots</li>
<li>Panic</li>
<li>Playstack</li>
<li>Raw Fury</li>
<li>Thunder Lotus</li>
<li>Cult Games</li>
<li>Team17</li>
<li>Curve</li>
<li>Akapura</li>
<li>Don’t Nod</li>
</ul>
<p>There’s plenty that we might guess could appear through this showcase, with 11 Bit having released <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/frostpunk-2">Frostpunk 2</a> on PC last year and might have a console port to announce, or acting as publisher to the upcoming soulslike deck builder Death Howl. Panic, meanwhile, has a bunch of games they’re publishing, including <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/06/09/time-flies-is-a-fly-simulator-about-life-and-death/">Time Flies</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/11/everything-announced-during-day-of-the-devs-tga-2024-edition/">Blippo+</a> and more. Akapura also has an intriguing title they’re publishing, the 2D role playing game Cabernet, where you play as a 19th century vampire lady. That sounds like it sucks… but in a good way!</p>
<p>So plenty of possibilities, for what is sure to be a busy showcase!</p>

			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 can't come soon enough, as the Japanese company has clearly overestimated the life left in the current consoles, according to a well-known analyst.</p>
<p>Commenting on the company's latest financial report with <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/switch-2-cant-come-soon-enough-nintendo-lowers-forecast-again-as-switch-sales-decline-30/">VGC</a>, which confirmed the original Switch surpassed <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-sales-surpass-150-million-units-milestone/">150 million units sold worldwide</a>, Kantan Games' Serkan Toto highlighted how the new system can't come soon enough, as the company clearly overestimated the life left in the current system, which was highlighted by Nintendo revising its hardware sales forecast two times. The analyst, who feels that even the new lower forecast will be missed, is not sure why Nintendo thought they would sell 14 million units in the current fiscal year, especially with a pretty empty release schedule, which currently only includes Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition. As such, the Nintendo Switch 2 can't come soon enough, and hopefully not this Fall, the analyst added.</p>
<p>Despite the lack of a solid release date for the Nintendo Switch 2, the excitement surrounding the system continues to be high among both fans and developers.&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/civilization-vii-one-more-turn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Civilization VII</a> executive producer Dennis Shirk recently talked with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/civilization-7-dev-firaxis-remains-coy-on-nintendo-switch-2-mouse-joy-con" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IGN</a> about the system, saying that Nintendo is doing something very cool with the new Joy-Con controller and that it would be equally cool if the controller could be used as a mouse, as the reveal video suggested. While this is not exactly a confirmation, it definitely feels like there's still a lot we do not know about the new controller.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 launches on a yet-to-be-confirmed 2025 release date worldwide.</p>

<p>Early details for Pokémon TCG Pocket’s Set A2A expansion have started to trickle through. Not much is known about the anticipated next set, but Set A2A is reportedly a new mini-set to break up the pack-opening grind of Space-Time Smackdown and Set 3.</p>



<p>Pokémon TCG Pocket is not holding back when releasing new sets and promo cards. Genetic Apex launched first, then <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/every-mythical-island-themed-collection-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mythical Island</a> and it only took three months for the next big-time set in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-space-time-smackdown-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Space-Time Smackdown</a>. Tons of cards are available in packs with players desperate to catch ’em all.</p>



<p>Potential first details on Pokémon TCG Pocket Set A2A are already sifting through, so let’s see what’s happening.</p>



<h2 id="h-pokemon-tcg-pocket-set-a2a-rumored-release-date">Pokémon TCG Pocket Set A2A Rumored Release Date</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Mythical Island smashed it.  Credit to The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Pokémon TCG Pocket Set A2A is set to release on February 28, according to leaks</strong>.</p>



<p>The news comes from renowned and trusted Pokémon leaker <a href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@CentroLeaks</a> who has already leaked and gotten most of these insider tidbits correct since Pokémon TCG Pocket launched on Oct. 30, 2024.</p>



<p>They posted to <a href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1885731258719748246" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> on February 1 about upcoming content for the free-to-play mobile title: “<strong>The next themed booster pack (A2a) releases on February 28th.</strong>” This might come as a surprise to players as Space-Time Smackdown was only released on January 30—giving players less than a month to focus solely on Set 2.</p>



<p>However, there’s a big reason why this leak could be correct, and why Set A2A could be so soon—<strong>Pokémon Day is February 27</strong>. </p>



<p>Set A2A would coincide nicely with the annual celebration of all things Pokémon. We take all this information with a pinch of salt for now, as we have to where leaks are concerned. But @CentroLeaks is usually spot-on about its information. This means you haven’t got all that long until the next mini-set drops. You might need to start saving Pack Hourglasses sooner rather than later!</p>



<h2 id="h-what-to-expect-from-pokemon-tcg-pocket-set-a2a">What To Expect From Pokémon TCG Pocket Set A2A</h2>



<p><strong>Pokémon TCG Pocket Set A2A is potentially a themed booster pack, and the “A” after its number suggests it’s another mini-set in the same vein as Mythical Island.</strong></p>



<p>If true, it’s likely to have around <strong>80-100 new cards</strong> or so. Mythical Island introduced 86 new cards to Pokémon TCG Pocket, but because of how bunched-up releases are, it could be even fewer this time. We’ll have to wait and see what Creatures Inc. and DeNA have planned.</p>

<p>Make sure you’re keeping up to speed with the latest Pokémon TCG Pocket tips and tricks: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/quickest-way-to-get-trade-tokens-pokemon-tcg-pocket/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The best ways to get Trade Tokens</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-trade-cards-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket/">how to Trade Cards</a>, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-open-genetic-apex-booster-packs-pokemon-tcg-pocket/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how to open Genetic Apex Booster Packs</a>.</p>



<p>Each new set’s theme is a guessing game after Space-Time Smackdown shook up the system. What do you hope to see in Set A2A? Who will be the star of the show for the next Pokémon TCG Pocket expansion?</p>

It contains several hundred pages of concept art, quotations, and development info surrounding the next Assassin's Creed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The leak itself is notable, but the post on Reddit also alleged it originated from a site known for hosting hentai. Bizarre, to say the least. IGN has asked Ubisoft for comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The gallery had already been removed from the site in question, but has since been archived in other file-sharing sites and galleries.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Several interesting details are shown throughout, including concepts for famous historical characters, major cities, and a variety of weapons. The art also, presumably, leaks some potential spoilers for the plot of Assassin's Creed Shadows. We can't confirm as much until the game is actually out, but the images we have seen seem real enough.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The leak arrives <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-this-time-by-another-month"><u>just ahead of Assassin's Creed Shadows' launch on March 20, 2025</u></a>, after a previous delay pushed it out of 2024 into February.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At a recent preview event for Shadows, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-director-says-recent-delay-was-to-polish-parkour-especially-on-super-complex-roofs">IGN spoke with Assassin's Creed Shadows game director Charles Benoit</a>, who confirmed that the month delay was "mostly about polishing" and did not change any big systems. The team did update "a couple of things in progression to make it more engaging, also balancing a bit more," Benoit added, but the main feature that needed extra tweaking was the parkour system, which was running up against an obstacle unique to Feudal Japan.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The Japanese architecture, the roofs [are] super complex," he said. "Probably the most complex thing that I ever worked with if we compared to Odyssey and Syndicate. We needed specific codes and specific animations to support something super fluid, changing the transition of the parkour to make it even more fluid. So that's one of the specific feedback that we heard that we wanted to address, and it really improved since the last few months."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

They connect to a pair of connectors that seem to have relatively flat bottoms, and then slide across the surface like a mouse on a mouse pad. If you look closely, you can even see something that looks like a slider pad on the bottom of one of the connectors, leading further credence to the theory.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rumors had been flying in the lead-up to the Nintendo Switch 2 reveal that this would be possible due to a sensor on the inside of the Joy-Cons similar to the sensor on the bottom of a computer mouse. But thus far, Nintendo hasn't officially confirmed this is true, nor what it would mean if it is.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Nintendo Switch 2 - First Look</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the first upcoming video games that came to mind following the reveal was Firaxis’ <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii">Civilization 7</a>. The 4X strategy game is already confirmed as coming to the original Switch, and it’ll no-doubt work on the Switch 2 via backward compatibility. But will there be a bespoke Switch 2 version that takes advantage of the new Joy-Con and lets you play Civilization 7 as if you were using a mouse?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN brought up the Switch 2 reveal and that apparent mouse functionality in a recent interview with Civilization 7 lead designer Ed Beach and executive producer Dennis Shirk, and while Beach remained silent, Shirk offered a coy response that is sure to spark even more speculation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It is definitely intriguing,” Shirk teased. “You always do some trade-offs when you have to deal with pure console controls. And the announcement has some great stuff in it. I love what they're doing with the controllers. It's all very cool. That's about all I can say about it in terms of an opinion. I think it looks awesome and they're not wrong, so it would be cool for something like that.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course Firaxis isn’t going to announce a Nintendo Switch 2 version of Civilization 7 — it’ll leave that to publisher 2K Games. But with a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-direct-announced-for-april">Switch 2 Direct</a> set for this April, perhaps we will find out either way soon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For all we don't know about potential mouse support for the Switch 2 (as well as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-still-dont-know-what-the-nintendo-switch-2s-mysterious-new-joy-con-button-does"><u>what the mysterious new Joy-Con button does</u></a>), we do know Nintendo's next-gen console is coming out in 2025 (probably between June and September) and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/a-new-mario-kart-game-is-seemingly-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2"><u>there's a new Mario Kart in the works for it</u></a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/with-nintendo-switch-2-waiting-in-the-wings-sales-of-the-original-switch-and-its-games-continue-to-tumble<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo has revised its hardware forecast down yet again as sales of the Switch and its games came in “below expectations.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For the first nine months of the current financial year, sales from Nintendo’s dedicated game console business decreased by 31.7% year-on-year to 895.5 billion yen (approx. $5.7 billion) following a significant decline in sales of both the Nintendo Switch and software.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Similarly, mobile and IP related income decreased by 33.9% year-on-year to 49.7 billion yen (approx. $320 million), mainly due to the tough comparison with 2023’s blockbuster <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/the-super-mario-bros-movie">The Super Mario Bros. Movie</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As a result, gross profit declined by 27.3% year-on-year to 565.5 billion yen (approx. $3.6 billion).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo has now revised down its financial forecast for the year ending March 2025, the second time in a row it’s done so. It expects to sell even less Nintendo Switch hardware than previously forecast, too, revising its Switch expectation down by 1.5 million to 11 million, and software by 10 million to 150 million.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Given the Nintendo Switch is in its eighth year, declines are expected, although they are clearly more dramatic than Nintendo predicted. Still, the Switch is now over 150 million units sold, which is an astonishing success for Nintendo. Overtaking Sony’s PlayStation 2, which has 160 million sold, to become the best-selling video game console of all-time may be beyond the Switch now, but the Nintendo DS’ 154 million is in sight.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo itself described sales of Switch and software in its third quarter ending December 31, 2024, as “stable given the fact that the platform is in its eighth year.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Overall sales for the entire Nintendo Switch family of systems were down 30.6% year-on-year at 9.54 million units. Sales of software declined by 24.4% year-on-year to 123.98 million units. But Nintendo pointed to sales of new games <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a> (3.91 million), <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/super-mario-party-jamboree">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a> (6.17 million), <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mario-kart-8-deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a> (5.38 million), and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/nintendo-switch-sports">Nintendo Switch Sports</a> (2.63 million) during the three month period. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mario-luigi-brothership">Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</a> is on 1.4 million sold.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Super Mario Party Jamboree in particular sounds like a big hit. Nintendo said that during the first 11 weeks after its release on October 17, 2024, Super Mario Party Jamboree surpassed the pace of sales for previous titles in the Mario Party series for Nintendo Switch, namely Super Mario Party and Mario Party Superstars.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And, perhaps more importantly for Nintendo as it prepares to release the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tech/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a> later this year, more people are playing Switch now than ever before, with 129 million ‘annual playing users’ in 2024. This suggests fans are continuing to play Switch even now, nearly eight years after launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Nintendo Switch unit sales declined year-on-year, but even in the eighth year since its launch in March 2017, Nintendo Switch continues to attract the interest of consumers, and sales in some weeks during the holiday season exceeded same-week sales of the previous year,” Nintendo said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Given Nintendo’s latest financial report, investors will be keen for Nintendo Switch 2 to come out sooner rather than later. But Nintendo itself listed the OG Switch games it still has up its sleeve: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition">Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition</a> will be released on March 20, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-legends-z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/metroid-prime-4-beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> are scheduled for release in 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo Switch 2 even got a mention, although Nintendo did not say anything new here. “On January 16, we announced that Nintendo Switch 2, the successor to Nintendo Switch, will be released in 2025,” Nintendo said. “On the same day, we offered a first look at Nintendo Switch 2 in a video introducing the hardware.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo plans a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-direct-announced-for-april">Switch 2 Direct</a> for April 2, where it will reveal more. Nintendo will also hold <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-invites-go-out-to-fans-today">Switch 2 hands-on events</a> in cities around the world.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <p>The legendary, unreleased Nintendo PlayStation was due to get an unnamed 2D space shooter as its first game - and the project was almost finished.</p>
<p>It's well-documented how Sony and Nintendo first partnered on an ill-fated disc drive add-on for the SNES - a project that ultimately resulted in Sony launching the PlayStation as its own console. But in a new interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtiJlzs0xRE&amp;t=1s">MinnMax</a>, former PlayStation exec Shuhei Yoshida discussed playing the prototype Nintendo PlayStation system for the first time.</p>
<p>The first game everyone played, said Yoshida, was a 2D (or 2.5D) space shooter with assets streamed from the disc to offer richer graphics than had been seen at the time.</p>

<p>Yoshida compared the graphics to Silpheed developed by Game Arts that was released on Sega's Mega CD and used pre-rendered animation as a full motion video background.</p>
<p>Yoshida said he doesn't remember who developed or directed the game, though he wouldn't be surprised if the game still existed in Sony's archives on a CD.</p>
<p>As the Nintendo PlayStation was never released - and only one prototype seemingly still exists - Yoshida's comments are the only snippet we have of what kind of games players could have expected from the system.</p>
<p>Speaking of Nintendo, Yoshida also thought the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Switch 2</a> announcement could have been a "larger reveal". "I am surprised there are not many surprises," he said, adding that the mouse controller was the only real shock.</p>
<p>The mouse functionality is something Yoshida can see being used for FPS games, he said. "But hopefully because it's Nintendo they'll use it in some more weird, bizarre, amazing way," he continued. "Something people wouldn't anticipate."</p>
<p>Yoshida hopes Nintendo Switch 2's full reveal in April will show us something new that's still hidden to us about the console.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-legend-shuhei-yoshida-announces-retirement">Yoshida left PlayStation last month</a> after over 30 years at Sony.</p>
<p>He's since been discussing his time at the company and, in a previous interview, discussed how the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ps-vita-almost-had-switch-like-capabilities-says-former-exec-shuhei-yoshida">PS Vita almost had Switch-like capabilities</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p><a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/dragon-ball/dragon-ball-sparking-zero" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dragon Ball: Sparking! ZERO</a> is continuing to be a smashing success and has now reached an important milestone that has made it the fastest-selling Dragon Ball game to date on consoles.</p>
<p>Today, Bandai Namco confirmed that the new entry in the Budokai Tenkaichi series, released last October on PC and consoles, has sold over 5 million units worldwide since its launch. As mentioned above, this milestone makes the game the fastest-selling Dragon Ball console game to date, which is no small feat considering how many successful games based on the works of Akira Toriyama have been released over the years.</p>
<p>Dragon Ball: Sparking! ZERO's success is completely deserved, as the game developed by Spike Chunsoft is a labor of love that can be enjoyed by any fan of the series, regardless of their skill level.

			<p>People often talk about the ways that they channel and embody their inner animals. You’ve got people giving into their lizard brain impulses, showing they’ve got that dog in them, or mum’s looking out for their kids with the fierceness of a mother bear – just with more complaining to the manager and less claws. Coridden pulls that inside-out, putting the animal on the outside and the human on the inside.</p>
<p><iframe title="Coridden - Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/O_mnPa8t23A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Now, Coridden is not a perfect game, but it is one I think nearly everyone should play. I’m going to get my complaints out of the way first. The camera can be unhelpful at times; there is a little bit of jank and clipping in some exploration sections; and while the art direction is lovely, it’s lacks polish in some areas. I’m now going to spend the rest of this review raving about this game.</p>


<p>Coridden is an action RPG in which you can shift between a human form and a beastly one. You unlock new beast forms as you go, drawing them from the creatures that you defeat in battle, and each family of beasts has its own skill tree, along with a secondary one you can give it to gain more skills.</p>
<p>Your human form also has four classes to choose from, each of which has three skill trees, and then a custom class that lets you mix and match as you please. This game is, quite simply, an absolute dream for anybody that likes replaying games and mucking around with different character builds.</p>


<p>You can also weave in any combination of melee attacks, ranged attacks, special abilities, and transformations that you want as long as you’ve got energy for it. Better yet, your human and beast forms have separate energy bars, so you’re meant to constantly shift between them in combat to never actually have to stop fighting. There’s no worrying about stamina here: just become a weird little beast with a tractor beam for a tail and keep throwing down until you need to swap back to your human form and shoot fireballs or turn invisible.</p>
<p>In any other game, that would be the main focus, and while it’s a big part of the game, it’s not all there is in Coridden. For a lot of people, the main appeal here is going to be the co-op. That’s because, as the name of the game suggests, you can actually ride around on your friends. Any human player can jump on the back of a beast player to roam around as one, with both players having full access to their abilities and attacks as you do so. This completely changes the level of strategy available, and also means that if you’re playing with a younger player, they can have an easier time of things in combat and through the platforming bits.</p>

<p>Throw in some really cool exploration puzzles, a story that ends up being pretty heartfelt, and you’ve got an indie game that exemplifies why I love indie games so much. Coridden is taking so many big swings and chances, and while not everything lands perfectly, it’s just so gloriously fun and charming that you’ll forgive those flaws.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Coridden is quite simply one of the coolest concepts I've played in absolutely ages, and as a big fan of co-op games, is immensely refreshing. I adore this game, and I really hope we get more from this from the team at Aftnareld to shows off more of what they can do, because their first attempt is a triumph of ingenuity.	</p></div>

            <p>Peter Akemann - co-founder of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-duty-classic">Call Of Duty</a>'s Treyarch and recent president of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-walking-dead-saints-sinners">The Walking Dead: Saints &amp; Sinners</a> studio Skydance Interactive - has pleaded guilty to crashing a drone into a firefighting plane assisting with the recent LA wildfires. The crash, which grounded the plane by damaging its left wing, occurred after Akemann ignored temporary drone restrictions in order to survey the Palisades fires before losing control. Thanks, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/treyarch-co-founder-pleads-guilty-to-flying-drone-that-crashed-into-firefighting-plane-during-la-wildfires">Eurogamer</a>. For first noticing the case, I mean. I'm not blaming Eurogamer for the drone crash. Not this one, anyway.</p>
<p>The drone was traced back to Akemann, who has <a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/akemann-plea-agreement.pdf">agreed to plead</a> guilty to one count of unsafe operation of an unmanned aircraft. That's a misdemeanour that usually carries up to one year prison time, but he's "hoping to escape the prison term in exchange for 150 hours of community service in support of wildfire relief and the approximately $65,000 USD it cost to repair the plane," write Eurogamer, as part of a plea agreement.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>“This defendant recklessly flew an aircraft into airspace where first responders were risking their lives in an attempt to protect lives and property,” said Acting United States Attorney Joseph T. McNally in a <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-cdca/pr/culver-city-man-agrees-plead-guilty-recklessly-crashing-drone-super-scooper">statement</a>. “This damage caused to the Super Scooper is a stark reminder that flying drones during times of emergency poses an extreme threat to personnel trying to help people and compromises the overall ability of police and fire to conduct operations. As this case demonstrates, we will track down drone operators who violate the law and interfere with the critical work of our first responders.”</p>
<p>Here's how the statement describes the incident:</p>
<blockquote><p>Akemann flew the drone at least 2,500 meters (more than 1.5 miles) toward the fire and lost sight of the drone. As Akemann was flying the drone, it collided with a Government of Quebec Super Scooper carrying two crewmembers attempting to fight the blaze. The impact caused an approximately 3-inch-by-6-inch hole in the left wing. After landing, maintenance personnel identified the damage and took the aircraft out of service for repairs.</p></blockquote>
<p>Akemann's defense attorneys say he is "deeply sorry" for the incident in a separate statement, although bring up "a number of mitigating factors," write Eurogamer, "including the supposed failure of a geo fencing safeguard feature on Akemann’s DJI Drone".</p>
<p>Humble Bundle (who are owned by RPS parent company Ziff Davis) are currently offering a <a href="https://promo.humblebundle.com/lafirerelief">collection of bundles</a> to support those affected by the LA Fires. Call Of Duty Publisher Activision recently donated $1M to LA fire relief, <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/call-of-duty-introduces-a-new-operator-bundle-to-raise-funds-for-fire-relief-in-la">along with proceeds</a> from the 'LA Fire Relief Ultra' skin for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-2024">Black Ops 6</a> and Warzone. Necrosoft's Brandon Sheffield has recently been putting together an <a href="http://itch.io/">Itch.io bundle</a> to help those affected with direct financial assistance.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Nintendo has reported a huge drop in sales of its hardware and software, with Switch 1 console sales down 30.6 percent year-on-year for the nine months ending 31st December.
</p>
<p>
Switch 1 software sales also fell significantly - down 24.4 percent. In a statement, Nintendo blamed the scale of the drop on tough comparisons with 2023, and the launches of both <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-walkthrough-tips-9343">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a> and Super Mario Bros Wonder.
</p>
<p>
Sales of the aging Switch 1 have been falling for years, meanwhile, but Nintendo's latest results are worse than the company previously forecast. Alongside the impact of a poorer US dollar exchange rate, Switch 1's performance has now forced Nintendo to lower its expectations again for the remainder of the financial year. 
</p>

<p>
The company is now forecasting its net sales for the financial year ending on 31st March as 1.19tn yen (£6.16bn), down seven percent from its previous expectations, and its net profit as 270m yen (£1.39m), down 10 percent. 
</p>
<p>
It wasn't all doom and gloom. New releases included <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a>, which sold 3.91m copies - a good number, though predictably nowhere near the sales of either <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857">Breath of the Wild</a> or Tears of the Kingdom.
</p>
<p>
Nintendo also launched <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-party">Super Mario Party</a> Jamboree, which sold an impressive 6.17m copies.
</p>
<p>
And, of course, the unstoppable <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-8-deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a> continued to sell well. It shifted another 5.38m copies over the last nine months of 2024, and now stands at a whopping 67.35m copies sold.
</p>
<p>
Switch 1 now stands at 150.86m consoles sold to date, just shy of the Nintendo DS's lifetime total of 154m.  While Nintendo should squeak past that, its less certain the console can reach the record 160m sales of PlayStation 2.
</p><p>
How many more units can Switch 1 sell? Nintendo's software line-up currently looks slim, with Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition due in March, before Metroid Prime 4, which feels likely to be a Switch 2 cross-gen game, later this year.
</p>
<p>
Switch 1 still has one final Pokémon game up its sleeve, Pokémon Legends Z-A, expected to arrive this summer. But it's now clear that Switch 2 can't come soon enough. We're next due an update from Nintendo - when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">presumably we'll hear about Switch 2's release date and price</a> - in April.

            <p>Ready your wingsuits, Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan scribe is set to write the Just Cause movie adaptation.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/aaron-rabin-just-cause-video-game-adaptation-universal/">The Wrap</a>, Aaron Rabin has been brought on to write the upcoming film adaptation of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/avalanche-studios">Avalanche Studios</a>' action series. In addition to Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan, which starred John Krasinski in the lead role, Rabin is also known for Silent River and the upcoming action-thriller film sequel, Nobody 2.</p>
<p>The writer joins <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/just-cause-movie-is-on-the-way">Blue Beetle director Ángel Manuel Soto on the Just Cause adaptation</a>, which is being produced by Kelly McCormick and David Leitch through 87North's first-look deal with Universal. If that name sounds familiar, it's because the company has also produced films such as 2024's Ryan Gosling-fronted stunt comedy The Fall Guy, and Bullet Train.</p>

<p>Word of a Just Cause movie adaptation of some kind has been around for a while now. Back in 2017, Aquaman star <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/aquaman-jason-momoa-set-to-star-in-just-cause-movie">Jason Momoa was said to be in talks to play Rico Rodriguez</a> in a movie based on the open world action game. While his casting was not mentioned in today's report, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecraft-movies-second-trailer-brings-deep-steve-lore-tree-punching-square-bee">Momoa will still get to flex his video game related acting muscles in this year's Minecraft adaptation</a>, which is set to be released in April.</p><p>But, back to Just Cause. While the plot for the upcoming film is being kept under wraps for now, the Just Cause video game series follows protagonist Rico Rodriguez, as he attempts to overthrow corrupt governments and regimes across the globe.</p>
<p>The most recent series entry was <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/just-cause-4">Just Cause 4</a>. "Likeably scrappy open-world carnage," our Donlan wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/just-cause-4-review-likeably-scrappy-open-world-carnage">Eurogamer's Just Cause 4 review</a>. "Weather effects and party balloons see a knockabout charmer return in decent form."</p>
<p>There was also a Just Cause mobile game in the works, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enixs-long-delayed-just-cause-mobile-officially-cancelled">this was cancelled in 2023</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Today, Nintendo <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/hard_soft/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> a major new sales milestone reached by its Nintendo Switch console, which has surpassed 150 million units sold. To be precise, the Japanese company said 150.86 million units of the hybrid handheld/home console had been sold as of 31 December 2024. Total software sales are now 1.359 billion units.</p>
<p>In the last quarter, the Nintendo Switch sold 4.82 million hardware units and 53.7 million software units, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a> selling 3.91 million units and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/super-mario-party-jamboree/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a> selling 6.17 million units. Nintendo admitted that the overall performance was below expectations and lowered its full fiscal year forecast as a result:</p>
<p><em>Although Nintendo Switch hardware and software sales through the third quarter were below expectations, Nintendo Switch continues to be enjoyed by many people. Going forward, we will continue to release new offerings so even more consumers keep playing Nintendo Switch. Looking at software, we released Donkey Kong Country Returns HD in January and plan to follow up with the release of Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition in March. Other software publishers also have plans to release a wide variety of titles, and we will strive to invigorate the platform by continually introducing new titles in addition to the existing titles.</em></p>
<p><em>We have revised the financial forecast originally published on November 5, 2024, in consideration of the sales trend through the nine months ended December 31, 2024, prospects for the remainder of the fiscal year, as well as a reevaluation of the assumed exchange rate. We have also modified our Nintendo Switch hardware and software unit sales forecast for the fiscal year.</em></p>
<p>Considering that Nintendo is about to unveil the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-officially-revealed-with-a-new-trailer-dedicated-direct-confirmed-for-april/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Switch 2</a> with the dedicated Direct scheduled for April 2, it's not hard to imagine the original Switch's sales performance continuing to trend downward. Still, the 150 million hardware unit milestone is huge, and it means the Switch is only four million units away from Nintendo's best-selling console, the DS. The best-selling console of all time, Sony's PlayStation 2, is still further away with over 160 million units sold.</p>

            <p>Alice Bee (RPS in peace)<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/forgotton-anne-devs-reveal-a-new-metroidvania-starring-a-horrifying-face-torso"> covered the announcement</a> for Forgotlings back in 2023. It's a metroidvania by ThroughLine Games, them behind <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/forgotton-anne">Forgotton Anne</a> - one of my favourites from 2018. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/forgotlings">Forgotlings</a>, however, managed to completely slip by me until I recently noticed it had a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2059570/Forgotlings/">Steam demo</a>. This is such good news I've basically forgiven them for doubling down on the funky spelling.</p>

<p>You play as Fig, a mannequin with a face on his torso, which could be deeply off-putting in basically any other art style but ThroughLine's Ghibliness. It's still a little off-putting, honestly. The premise behind the setting is that forgotten objects - Forgotlings - wake up here as sentient creatures. Hopping wardrobes, talking TVs, and the like. As Fig, you start the demo searching for your friend Silvia in a mountain. This is obviously a tricky place to search. Lots of elevation. Could be anywhere.</p>
<p>While Forgotton Anne was basically a puzzle game with some platform elements, this one is far more of an action platformer. You'll scramble up ledges, wall jump, and slowly drag yourself up steep hills. There are still navigation puzzle elements - block pushing and the like - so I'm interested to see if ThroughLine keep up their previous's level of complexity in tandem with the combat. Forgotten Anne wasn't <em>too</em> much of a head-scratcher, mind - much more about getting to know the world than hitting it with things.</p><p>As for combat, it seems <em>fine</em> so far. You've got a nifty backstep and a block, as well as options to sneak around a bit before diving in. Still, the main draw for me here is another chance to dip into the world ThroughLine have built. I can find such overt Ghibli influence cloying sometimes, but there's enough character and charm elsewhere that the setting really does come alive as its own thing. No release date on this one yet, but I'll try to <em>remember</em> to keep you updated. <em>The name's Reuben</em>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>I was initially sceptical that we'd be seeing dark fantasy strategy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/whispers-of-the-eyeless">Whispers Of The Eyeless </a>any time soon.

He's co-developing this with Evil Gingerbread Studio but his other big project is the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-warhammer-iii">Total War: Warhammer III</a> overhaul mod SFO, and it seems barely a month passes without some huge update to that. Venris once told me <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/total-war-warhammer-2/sfo-grimhammer-2-venris">he mods for</a> around "eight to 12 hours a day", though, so I suppose I shouldn't be surprised that this cult-shepherding roguelite is now available in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2523890/Whispers_of_the_Eyeless/">Steam early access</a>. Edwin described it as "<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/darkest-dungeon">Darkest Dungeon</a>, but you're running the dungeon".

As you can likely glean from the deliciously overwrought trailer narration, this one's about gradually powering up your cult until you've shed the remains of your humanity, and then using that newfound power for wholesome activities like bending a crumbling city to the will of various horrible deities. Like Darkest Dungeon, things like the sanity and the health of your characters have a lasting impact from fight to fight.</p>
<p>You'll need to keep an eye on cult management by inspiring "fervor" among your cultists "or risk betrayal as doubts creep through the ranks". There's subterfuge too, as you "send disciples to weaken rivals, gather resources, and spread your influence". It looks dense, which isn't too surprising considering that Venris and the team's work on SFO has been based around adding even more complexity to an already silly complex game.</p><p>Whispers Of The Eyeless's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2523890/view/545599869129065070">next major patch</a> is set to arrive later today, with various balancing tweaks based on player feedback.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/new-steam-console-powered-by-rdna-4-might-be-in-the-works-at-valve/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>According to a new rumor, Valve might be making a new Steam console. The info was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8f3D79aoro8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">relayed</a> by renowned Spanish leaker extas1s, although it <a href="https://x.com/HandleDeck/status/1886501899832021224" target="_blank" rel="noopener">originates</a> from the owner of HandleDeck.com, who found out that Valve is working on drivers for the upcoming RDNA4-based <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-radeon-rx-9000-gpus-officially-launch-march-radeon-rx-9070-xt-9070-first-rdna-4-cards-for-gamers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AMD Radeon RX 9070 graphics cards</a> due next month. Here's the translated excerpt from the YouTube video:</p>
<p><em>It turns out that Valve is openly working on drivers for the AMD 9070 graphics cards. These cards are currently designed just for desktop devices. These AMD 9070s are the first to feature RDNA 4 technology and FSR 4. So yeah, that’s the scoop! This RDNA 4 architecture is currently designed only for desktops. It’s expected that, many years down the line, it might make its way to portable devices, but right now, it’s strictly desktop. Valve is already working on it; in fact, from what my friend has heard, Valve is putting a lot of effort into the drivers for these RX 9070 GPUs with RDNA 4. And the question he raises in his tweet, which we all might be wondering, is why Valve is so interested in collaborating on this.</em></p>
<p><em>This specific kind of graphics card and this particular AMD architecture, especially knowing that most of the graphics used on Steam are from NVIDIA, raises an interesting point. One of the main reasons this might be happening—and here’s the juicy part, especially after the recent Xbox news—is that Valve, the company behind Steam, is internally working on desktop consoles that will be branded with the SteamOS license. It looks like Valve might be considering AMD's 9070 graphics card as the main core for their desktop console. The codename for Valve's Steam console is currently Fremont, but we don't know what it's actually going to be called. It's also possible that they could use this graphics card to create some sort of external GPU for the Steam Deck 2, or it might just be for third parties to build their own stuff.</em></p>
<p>As the leaker mentioned in the last sentence, there are other possible reasons for Valve to be crafting drivers for the upcoming RDNA 4 GPU. However, the possibility of a new Steam console is enticing indeed. It's been nearly ten years since Valve's failed attempt with the Steam Machine, which was meant to deliver a PC-like experience to the living room. That was their first hardware product, and they've clearly learned a lot from it, as shown by subsequent and much more successful hardware releases like the <a href="https://wccftech.com/full-valve-index-vr-kit-priced-e1079-out-on-june-28th/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Valve Index</a> and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/steam-deck-portable-console-for-power-users/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam Deck</a>.</p>
<p>At the same time, if Valve was really going to use the Radeon 9070 for this hardware, the console would be very expensive, which makes us doubt this part of the rumor. Regardless of these specifics, would you like to see another attempt at a Steam console from Valve? Let us know below.</p>

            <p>I'm just so tired, man. Is this a dare? Because I'm basically taking the bait just by writing about it, aren't I? "The last carrier bag you’ll ever need," begins the description of this tribute to the plastic bag <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/disco-elysium">Disco Elysium</a>'s protagonist uses to collect bottles to exchange for cash at Martinet's local off-licence. "Frittte brings reassurance that the bag will serve your everyday needs on the toughest streets."</p>
<p>This nod to people whose main takeaway from Fight Club was how rad Brad Pitt's taste in shirts was is being sold by ZA/UM's collobrative merch store with company Atelier. They've previously put out things like a replica of Kim Kitsuragi's jacket. I'm not going to link them, as a pathetic act of rebellion.</p>
<p>As the man who couldn't afford an ambulance to get the gash on his head sewn up once said, let's try and keep an open mind about this. The bag's Dyneema fabric "is up to 15x stronger than steel on a weight-for-weight basis and provides the highest tear and tensile strength of any competing materials".</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I am willing to accept that this a very strong carrier bag. The brief amount of research I've done shows that Dyneema is indeed expensive, and also stronger than Kevlar. I have no doubt that, when it comes to the act of carrying things inside of it, this bag may be in some sense 'worth the money'.</p><p>But is it worth your soul, ZA/UM? Stupid question. Nothing attached to this game has escaped its curse. There was some brief hubbub over the weekend over a false rumour that creator Robert Kurvitz uploaded Disco Elysium to the Internet Archive. The actual upload had been around since 2023. It's <a href="https://archive.org/details/disco-elysium-ultra-compressed.-7z">now no longer available</a>, presumably as a result of this new wave of attention. Meanwhile, writer Argo Tuulik is currently running a crowdfunding campaign for legal fees for himself and fellow writer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/disco-elysium-studio-bosses-humiliated-the-cancelled-expansions-lead-writer-for-speaking-to-journalists-claims-report">Dora Klindžić</a> in a fight to get back the Disco IP. There are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sure-why-not-third-group-of-former-disco-elysium-devs-announce-revolutionary-new-rpg-studio">three Disco Elysium 'spiritual successors' currently in the works</a>. In any timeline but this, that should be cause for celebration.</p>
<p>Me? I'm just staring at this fucking carrier bag. Trying times, soulwise. I can't even think of anything sage or witty to say about it. It feels like even gesturing at the irony is itself such a self-defeating rabbit hole of cliches that I sigh loudly before I've even finished the sentence. It's <a href="https://youtu.be/mVscQYjuq_s">just that Zoolander</a> bit again. Be kind to each other. Leave tips. Not for Atelier though. Fuck those guys.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
I had trouble sleeping last night, due to a combination of press trip excitement, chugging too many complimentary coffees, and my hotel room being opposite a strange, insistently symmetrical building that reared over my dreams like Sauron’s penthouse. So to settle my nerves, I got up and played a game about being a horrible tree. Just the worst tree. A total shit of a tree. That game was <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/roots-devour">Roots Devour</a> - and great news, if you’re having trouble sleeping you can play it too, for there is a demo in the wilds.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Roots Devour is a vegetal horror cardgame in which you, a monstrous sapling grown from the mind-flaying manure of the Lovecraft mythos, spread your tendrils through a forest, harvesting fluids from its creatures and working your way up the food chain until you are top Tam-ash, Oakranos or [insert superior Lovecraft tree pun here]. To do this, you click-drag roots between cards. The basic constraints are, firstly, that you need a clear line of sight between cards, so you’ll need to expand around obstacles such as dense rival root networks, and secondly, that you need blood to grow, and each unfortunate lifeform you snare only has so much to share. 
</p>
<p>
Sometimes, the poor critters split under your embrace, forming fussy piles of limbs that must be scooped up individually. So inconsiderate. When they’re drained of blood, they continue to serve you as nodes in your root network, dangling like hairy dried fruits from your boughs. Roots Devour’s presentation is perfectly icky, like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cultist-simulator">Cultist Simulator</a> but with deep gushing notes of Bram Stoker. It’s also localised from Chinese, so even if you're hip to cosmic monsters, you might have a bit of trouble figuring out the tutorial and lore text.
</p>
<p>
As you expand, you’ll amplify your capacities with card packs that award various boons. A card that harbours digestive fluids, for example, will allow you to seize and pacify a larger beast such as a deer. A card that harbours a source of florescence will let you see cards from further off. Some of these card packs are awarded by a mysterious human-looking ally, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/flora">Flora</a>, who appears immune to your predations, and is capable of sucking vitality from you in turn. Between stages, you can also retreat to your sylvan heart of hearts and expend biomatter to level up.
</p><p>
Roots Devour did not help me sleep, but it did make me feel less unnerved about that mildly eldritch building across from my hotel. I’m watching it now. I wrote "insistently symmetrical" before, but now that I look closely, none of the windows appear to be the same shape. Still, at least it’s not, e.g., an absolute king-hell shitlord of a tree. The full version of Roots Devour launches this year, and you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2612690/Roots_Devour/">read more on Steam</a>.

That’s why one of the biggest CES announcements is that Valve is going to let people install SteamOS on other handhelds <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338405/valve-steamos-beta-other-handhelds-beyond-steam-deck">as soon as April</a>, potentially making the entire handheld PC gaming market a lot more appealing.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/9/24339466/nintendo-switch-2-pc-gaming-handhelds-steamos">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6NTQ5" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24345191/nintendo-switch-2-bigger-screen">The Switch 2’s bigger screen is just what I wanted</a></h2><div><p><cite>Image: The Verge, Nintendo</cite></p></div><div><p>Nintendo has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/23872810/nintendo-switch-2-next-generation-console-features-trailer">finally revealed the Switch 2</a> — but it didn’t reveal everything. Even still, the new console looks pretty much like a bigger, more refined Switch. Sure, that’s the straightforward and expected move from Nintendo. But it’s also exactly what I’ve been waiting for.</p><p>The first Switch was a revelation. When it launched, I marveled over being able to play <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> on my TV and then take the console out of the dock and play in handheld mode curled up on the couch. Nintendo absolutely nailed the execution of combining its console and portable expertise into one great device, and ever since, the Switch has been a constant companion at home and while traveling.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24345191/nintendo-switch-2-bigger-screen">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6NjU2" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24344511/nintendo-switch-2-features-specs-handheld-dock-upgrade-comparison">The Switch 2 is boring — and that’s exactly what Nintendo needs</a></h2><div><p><cite>Image: The Verge, Nintendo</cite></p></div><div><p>You can always count on Nintendo for a surprise.

It’s the company that lost its lead with the Wii U and then gambled on another innovation — the portable hybrid known as the Switch — to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23718273/nintendo-2023-big-moment-mario-zelda">ultimately get back on top</a>.

It’s kind of boring. But it’s also exactly the right move from Nintendo. At a time when people expect their games and experiences to carry over between devices, the old console paradigm of starting over with a new generation doesn’t make a whole lot of sense. And since Nintendo hit a home run with the original Switch, it has the runway to be a little bit boring this time.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24344511/nintendo-switch-2-features-specs-handheld-dock-upgrade-comparison">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>Whenever the Switch 2 comes out, it’ll have competition from handheld PCs.</p><p>As I wrote <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/9/24339466/nintendo-switch-2-pc-gaming-handhelds-steamos">earlier this month</a>, “it will launch into a world that’s packed with very capable handheld gaming PCs that could present an interesting challenge to Nintendo.”</p><p>Yes, the Switch 2 will probably outsell most handheld gaming PCs by a wide margin.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/steam-console-ps-xbox-rival-rumours/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/valve-is-building-a-%E2%80%98steam-console%E2%80%99-to-rival-ps5-and-xbox-rumour-claims.1099386/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/steam-console-ps-xbox-rival-rumours/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Late last year, rumours surfaced regarding a developing Steam-based console being built by Valve. It was claimed that the device was being designed alongside new iterations of the Steam Controller and a fresh VR headset. On social media, tech insiders were mulling over proposed specs for a Steam console, but of course, the claims were <strong>not </strong>addressed by Valve.</p>



<p>Today, fresh rumours have hit the airwaves, with eXtas1s commenting on social media (and uploading a video) about the ‘very spicy’ claim that the rumoured Steam console will compete with PS5 and Xbox Series consoles.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-more-competition">More Competition</h2>



<p>On <a href="https://xcancel.com/eXtas1stv/status/1886541769833398343?t=_-orVAMq3NTYowaQr-QYbQ&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a>, eXtas1s wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>New Steam console?</p>



<p>Very spicy with Valve, it already seems that a new Steam console is coming that competes against PS5 and Xbox in the future.</p>



<p>Thanks to HandleDeck, we have learned that Valve works closely with AMD and its RDNA 4 technologies.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In a follow-up video, eXtas1s expanded on the rumour – but I don’t speak Spanish, so perhaps you’ll have better luck breaking this down:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="EX-CEO de PLAYSTATION ATACA: &quot;XBOX = SEGA&quot; 😨 FORZA ÉXITO en PS5 🤯 REVIEW Kingdom Come Deliverance 2" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8f3D79aoro8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>Valve has had plenty of success with the Steam Deck, which is considered one of the best handheld gaming devices on the market, but would the tech titan see the same results with a home console? It would be welcome competition, but it could skew the existing market.</p>



<p>For instance, it could prevent PlayStation from launching further ‘exclusives’ on PC, as anyone with a Steam console could play them there as opposed to buying a PlayStation console to get that traditional home gaming experience.</p>



<p>It could also be another flop, just like the Steam Machines that Valve tried to launch several years ago.</p>



<p>It’s important to stress that these rumours are to be taken with a pinch of salt until Valve confirms what’s happening behind the scenes. The cards are being played very close to the chest of this gaming giant, so we’ll have to see what happens in due course.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/dr-disrespect-comments-midnight-society/</link>

<p>Dr Disrespect still hasn’t clawed his way back into the good graces of gamers worldwide and probably never will. Regardless, he’s still trying to retain some semblance of a streaming career across <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dr-disrespect-relocation-rumble-youtube-stream/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Rumble</a> and YouTube, and recently, he secured monetisation again on YouTube several months after losing it in the face of ‘minor messaging’ allegations.</p>



<p>During a recent live stream, Guy ‘Dr Disrespect’ Beahm levelled some accusations at Midnight Society, the studio that he fronted until last June when things turned awry for him. In his words, ‘I can say all this s*** now.’</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-don-t-get-me-started-with-that-guy">‘Don’t Get Me Started With That Guy’</h2>



<p>Last summer, Dr Disrespect found himself embroiled in (another) controversy, this one concerning events that occurred in 2017. It was alleged that the supersized streamer had used Twitch’s ‘Whisper’ mechanic to inappropriately <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dr-disrespect-allegations-twitch-ban/">message a minor</a>, which the creator copped to shortly after – in a way.</p>



<p>That prompted him to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dr-disrespect-loses-followers-allegations/">lose tens of thousands of followers</a>, be dropped by sponsors, and get cut out by fellow streamers.</p>



<p>Fast-forward several months, and Midnight Society, the studio that Dr Disrespect was a prolific part of until the allegations surfaced, is closing down. For a couple of years, Dr Disrespect provided a massive marketing pull, getting players around the world to invest in ‘DEADROP’, an NFT-backed extraction shooter that will now never see the light of day.</p>



<p>During a recent stream, Dr Disrespect went in against Midnight Society:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It was handled extremely poorly by leadership.</p>



<p>It’s unfortunate.</p>



<p>That tweet that weekend, it should have never gone out. It was never approved by me. They say, ‘after fully investigating’, whatever — they didn’t investigate nothing.</p>



<p>I can say all this s*** now.</p>
</blockquote>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Doc reacts to his studio SHUTTING DOWN #drdisrespect" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dygcjncJY4g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>Then, the creator fired shots at Robert Bowling, the former Call of Duty dev who co-founded Midnight Society:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Don’t get me f***ing started with that guy.</p>



<p>Don’t get me started with that guy.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Recently, data showed that while Dr Disrespect’s airtime has gone up, his viewership and peak counts are dropping rapidly, suggesting that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dr-disrespect-first-stream-back/">there’s no comeback in store</a> for the disgraced creator.</p>
