You can read more about </em><a href="https://corp.ign.com/review-practices" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>our review policies and philosophy here</em></a><em>.</em></p><p>In 2014, while wearing a cardboard plumbob headband I’d hastily made the night before, I lined up at a local game store to pick up my pre-ordered copy of The Sims 4. With a create-a-sim wardrobe full of Pinterest-friendly fashion items and a host of then-modern appliances, The Sims 4 felt like a cutting-edge sequel at launch, one that reflected those simpler times. But what’s even more impressive is that now, almost a decade of updates later, it’s <em>still </em>the benchmark life simulator, offering a profoundly unique household sandbox that’s yet to find stable competition. Its aging sense of style and sometimes archaic systems do mean The Sims 4 cannot coast on this legacy forever, even with an admirable free-to-play pivot back in 2022. But with a collaborative network of community tools and a world of chaos at your fingertips, The Sims 4 maintains itself as an Imagineer’s dream nonetheless. </p><p>As Dr. Frankenstein so famously found out, recreating life is full of complications, and The Sims 4 leans heavily into the mad scientist fantasy of it all. It provides you with all the tools you need to build a bespoke world full of customized people who have hopes, dreams, and occasionally questionable haircuts. By distilling the human experience into a pool of malleable metrics, you get the opportunity to play god with families of those virtual avatars, guiding them as they travel the peaks and valleys of life, from birth to death and everything in between. While The Sims 4 certainly could have taken the punishing route of finicky and overcomplicated systems, it instead carefully balances the complexities of human life in a surprisingly approachable manner.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>The Sims 4 Gameplay Screenshots (2024)</h3></div></output><p>Beyond staying on top of their immediate biological needs, like toilet breaks, sleep, and hunger, there are aspirations and fears to contend with, as well as bills to pay, careers to nurture, and social lives to spin. Your omnipotence gives you the unfettered freedom to mess with the citizens of your world, and it’s entertaining to haphazardly graft the frenzied whims of your imagination onto the lives of its inhabitants. Whether you wield this power for cruelty or kindness is entirely up to you, and the fact that most of your larger goals are self-driven (like levelling up your music skill enough to become a rockstar, or finding your Sim a loving soulmate) makes it fun to simply play around however the mood strikes you.</p><p>You can choose to use a variety of pre-made families or design a custom household using the Create a Sim toolset. As with humans, Sims are a complex combination of physical presence and personality, and I love that this DIY process allows you to make granular choices that will set each one apart from the crowd. Pairing up personality traits is a minigame in itself and allows for a cast of uncanny characters to take shape in front of you. A hot-headed genius might fly into a rage when they don’t find the time to play a game of chess, whereas a career-driven hopeless romantic could run into difficulties when perfecting their work-life balance. This enticing pick-n-mix process extends into a Sim’s likes and dislikes, with the quirks often playing out in strange and comical ways. A budding virtuoso could be made to cringe at the sound of a guitar, and it’s these small but meaningful interactions that add lifelike depth to these avatars.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>You'll have to buy DLC or rely on mods to find an acceptable fashion sense.</p></div><p>Unfortunately, there isn’t equal subtlety when developing your Sim’s physical appearance, especially by the standards of contemporary character creators. There’s a decent pool of predesigned facial features to choose from, with a more curated appearance achievable by pushing and pulling at a handful of anchor points to sculpt your Sim’s anatomical features. It’s certainly no Dragon’s Dogma 2, which admittedly isn’t a huge surprise when The Sims 4 first came out just two years after Dragon’s Dogma 1, but it is noticeable in 2024. Even so, I was happy to see that I could at least create a diverse range of body shapes through its sliders and sculpting capabilities. </p><p>Once you’re finished molding their form, your Sim will also need a wardrobe for the many situations life throws at them, from working out to bedtime to fancy dinners. Sadly, most of the clothing options and hairstyles in The Sims 4’s base game now feel ripped from a 2010s fashion magazine rather than any modern catalog. While skinny ties, plaid overshirts, and gauche graphic tees were welcome at launch, there hasn’t been a significant update to the default outfits across The Sims 4’s 10-year lifespan. That issue leaves long-term players stuck between spending cash on costly couture-focused DLC packs or relying on fan-made mods to achieve an acceptable fashion sense. That said, there have been some free additions to Create a Sim that are worth celebrating, such as the introduction of medical wearables like hearing aids and glucose monitors, as well as a choice of customisable pronouns and romantic boundaries for your Sims.</p><p>If you thought people management was The Sims 4’s only draw, think again. As well as a god, you’ll also become a city planner, able to tinker with the architecture of your community across three separate biomes thanks to a comprehensive construction kit called Build Mode. You’ll balance financial costs, health and safety, and style to realize your grand designs, no matter how absurd they may be. A rooftop toilet might be an eyesore for the neighbors, but if you like your restrooms with a view, The Sims 4 isn’t going to stand in your way. </p><p>Not only can you flex your creativity one wall, window, and staircase at a time, but you can also fill your creations with esoteric bric-a-brac like encased scrolls or a collection of creepy gnomes. And if your building skills peak out at hastily crafted mountainside Minecraft homes, the approachable toolset and submenu of ready-made rooms allow you to quickly leave your mark without needing a degree in architectural engineering – though having one certainly would help. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The approachable building tools mean you don't need an architectural degree.</p></div><p>The joy of building isn’t just for personal properties, either, as you’ll also be able to take a stab at commercial real estate. Where cash flow is the antagonizing force when building your Sim’s personal home, public lots instead require minimum furniture and amenities to fulfill their duty. It’s a process that keeps you accountable while gently guiding you away from making useless, lackluster locations. The Sims 4’s sandbox mission statement is always in frame, though, and you can easily ignore the rules and get weird with it anyway. However stifling the Create a Sim can feel at times, it’s made up for by the meticulous tools at your disposal in Build Mode. </p><p>But just because you <em>can </em>build something silly doesn’t mean your Sims will always be happy about it. For instance, while constructing a cheap family home in the desert locale of Oasis Springs, I cut corners on bedroom furniture to save money – a choice that really didn’t gel with the high-standards that were baked into the personality of one of its occupants. That decision led to a rampage of arguments with relatives thanks to their sour mood, spoiling relationships and threatening the fate of the household. Ultimately, I was sent back to the drawing board to clean up the aesthetics to avoid watching my Sim’s social life fall to pieces over mismatched lamps. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>This is just one example of how The Sims 4’s systems cleverly intermingle with one another, providing an unpredictable sandbox with so many reactive dynamics that delightfully get in the way of your best-laid plans. The ensuing chaos from such cataclysmic social events also acts as an organic jumping-off point for new stories to grow, leading you down scintillating rabbit holes you may not have been expecting. You have enough control to guide your Sims where you generally want them to go, but you won’t always be able to brute force their lives into perfection, and that mitigates the boredom that can come with getting everything you want all at once. (Although there’s nothing wrong with <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-sims-4/PC_Cheats"><u>turning on a few cheats</u></a> and playing without restriction when the mood strikes you, too.)</p><p>Perhaps you want to curate drama on a broader scale than just your household? Well, The Sims 4 has an answer for that, too. A relatively recent addition to the base game is Neighbourhood Stories, which allows you to influence the world by adjusting ambient life changes for the Sims across your map without having to directly play as them. Career changes, accidents, and having children are all aspects of real life, and through this process, the families scattered across your game can continue to thrive (or not) without you. While loosening my grip on every individual element of my Sims’ lives was an uncomfortable shift at first (and one you don’t have to make if it doesn’t suit you), it’s great that this tool allows Sims to flourish around your primary households in a more organic way. </p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><p><h3>Sarah's favourite simulation games</h3></p></div><p>If learning the ropes via happy little accidents doesn’t sound like your cup of tea, another pair of useful post-launch additions are the tips system and scripted scenarios, which can both help smooth over The Sims 4’s sharp edges where necessary. Not only a boon for newer players, these enlightening systems do well to get veteran players like me up to date with the many small-but-impactful changes that have arrived in free updates and paid DLC over the years. There’s a smart balance here that maintains a universal approachability by holding your hand when you want it to and letting go when you’re ready to take a risk. </p><p>Speaking of DLC, 10 years of developer support has left The Sims 4 with a copious amount of themed expansions, with options based around things like seasons, university, magic, and, most recently, dating. This is par for the course for this series, and the quality of these packs is generally top notch – but even with the base game becoming free-to-play, it’s a shame that some paid add-ons now feel like essential parts of the Sims experience. Adding pets to your household or having a more active role in your career come across as fundamental features that should be available to everyone. I get that this has become the business model, but it’s especially frustrating to see intrinsic human experiences like holiday festivities or the ability to create cliques locked behind a paywall. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>One of The Sims 4’s most prominent assets is its strong community. </p></div><p>To that end, I would be remiss not to mention one of The Sims 4’s most prominent assets: its strong community of players. There is a library’s worth of user-generated lots and characters to take inspiration from or graft into your game, often only a Google search away. Years of community ingenuity have also spawned a manufactured ‘hard mode’ that presents you with hyper-specific tasks to complete if you’re searching for more complex scenarios. These <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Nuzlocke_Challenge" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Nuzlocke</u></a>-esque challenges cater to all kinds of players and can involve anything from building a home with minimal square footage to, my personal favorite, attempting to make your Sim have one hundred babies in their lifetime. </p><p>Another consistent companion across The Sims 4 is its dazzling soundtrack and expressive sound effects, something the series has long been lauded for. Relentlessly optimistic and impressively orchestral, the score’s blend of string, woodwind, and percussive instrumentals offer a comforting backdrop to the building menus and loading screens you’ll spend hours staring at. </p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3>Verdict</h3><p>The Sims 4 is starting to feel its age in 2024, but what keeps it so compelling is that magical feeling that occurs when all its parts work together to create the rich tapestry of your Sims' lives. The complex character creator and approachable building mode are both impressive in their own right – and as personality quirks rub up against the houses you’ve tenderly built, you’re rewarded with hilarious and profound emotional reactions from the beloved families you’re guiding. Romance, friendship, and hatred all play essential roles, and there’s a deeper focus on replicating the complexities of human life than any other game in this genre. Yet despite maintaining the bar for life simulators at large, the last decade has also left the base game with an outdated fashion sense and locked what now feel like core features such as pets behind paid DLC – a problem that can only be escaped by indulging in fan-made mods or costly expansions. Even so, after hundreds of hours of playtime and nearly a decade of history, I’m still always excited to build a new family dynamic and start the chaotic cycle of life all over again.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Mafia Definitive Edition is headed to Game Pass next month, <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-game-studios-bethesda-abk-ot31-perfect-doom.894510/post-126372864" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to insider NateDrake</a>. The game released in September 2020 is a remake of 2002's original installment, which marked the debut of the franchise. The remake was handled by Hangar 13, the same studio that developed Mafia III a couple of years earlier, using that engine. It featured an updated script filled with new dialogue, expanded backstories, and additional cutscenes, not to mention all-new gameplay sequences and features, improved cinematics, and other enhancements. The game was also included as part of the trilogy pack.</p>
<p>Mafia Definitive Edition <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/mafia-definitive-edition-old-school-gangster/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">received</a> an eight out of ten score on Wccftech. Here's what Dave Aubrey had to say about the remake:</p>
<p><em>Mafia Definitive Edition is a complete remake of a classic crime game. It looks better than almost any other open-world crime sim you'll see this generation and has a story that'll keep you engaged to the end. It might not be the most revolutionary or innovative title in the genre, but it'll certainly keep you playing. This is an excellent story to play over the course of the weekend, and you're almost certain to be recommending it to your friends once you're done.</em></p>
<p>In other Mafia news, Hangar 13 <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-mafia-game-is-in-early-development-at-hangar-13/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> nearly two years ago that it is making a new installment in the franchise. We haven't heard any further news or rumors about the project, but that may change in the coming months, perhaps even at The Game Awards.</p>
<p>As for Game Pass, the subscription service's library would get even richer with this addition, following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/cod-modern-warfare-3-game-pass-valorant/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launch</a> of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III earlier this week.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/steam-improves-how-demos-appear-and-behave-in-your-library-and-on-the-steam-store.938637/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/steam-improves-how-demos-appear-and-behave-in-your-library-and-the-steam-store<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>Steam has updated how demos "appear and behave" within the Steam library.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/6233628070477025191">post</a> to the official website, Valve said that with "thousands of playable demos launching on Steam every year, and millions of players trying them out, we've noticed some trends in feedback from both developers and players about the process and functionality. We've put together an update based on that feedback".</p>
<figure>
<p>
<a aria-label="What happens to your Steam account when you die? - Here's A Thing" data-lightbox="false" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kHLFUbU5ceI?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">

<p>Going forward, you'll be able to add demos to your library without having to immediately install them. Just like full games, you can simply click "add to library" and download later on them when you're ready.</p>
<p>They also "behave more like free games" in that they'll now appear in all the same sections and lists, including the new and trending chart.</p>
<p>Perhaps best of all, Steam will now automatically notify you if a demo becomes available for a game you have on your wishlist.</p>
<p>"Demos can be installed even if you already own the full game," Valve adds. "Primarily, this will make it easier for developers to test demos, but it will also help players more easily manage installing/uninstalling demos."</p>
<p>You can also explicitly remove demos from your account, and when you choose to uninstall a demo, it will be scrubbed completely from your library, too.</p>
<p>"By default, free demos appear as a button on the full game's store page. But, developers have been asking for a way to enable a full store page to better describe the contents of the demo, add separate screenshots, upload a trailer, and specify supported features," Valve explains.</p>
<p>"So, that is now possible and you'll find that clicking on a demo sometimes loads a full demo store page while other times will take you to the full game's page with a button to install the demo.</p>
<p>"If developers have chosen to enable a store page for their demo, it will also be possible for players of the demo to post user reviews for the demo. These reviews and review score will appear on the demo store page just like reviews for any other free game on Steam."</p>
<p>ICYMI, a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2580190/PlayStationVR2_App/">Steam app for Sony's PlayStation VR2</a> headset is due for release on 6th August. The free, official app will allow Steam users to play games on the virtual reality headset, as well as use the PlayStation VR2 Sense controllers.</p>
<p>Use of the app will also require the PC adapter, which was unveiled in June and will release on 7th August.</p>

            <p>An open console beta is now available for Riot Games' hero shooter, Valorant.</p>
<p>The free-to-play 5v5 shooter was initially released for PC in 2020, but support for current-gen console systems finally rolled out last month through closed playtests.</p>

<p>Right now the open beta is limited to Brazil, Canada, Europe, Japan, and the US, and whilst console players will be able to team up with pals on the other console, there's currently no crossplay available with PC players. Sorry. Riot says it "believes strongly in competitive integrity, and this is the best way for us to keep the experience fair and consistent for players on both console and PC".</p>
<p>Riot also <a href="https://x.com/VALORANT/status/1816877050000736415">confirmed</a> on social media that PC players will have "access to [their] full collection [of skins and cosmetics] on PC and consoles".</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>All progress will be saved, too, so any battlepass progression, unlocked agents and skins will remain on your account even after the beta finishes, and you apparently don't require PlayStation Plus or Xbox Game Pass to play.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Riot says there's no formal end to the beta period. It will only be closed "once [Riot] feels confident in where the game is at".</p>
<p>In a frank discussion about the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valorant-studio-head-tells-toxic-players-to-play-something-else-we-wont-miss-you">"current state of player behaviour" in Valorant, Riot Games' head Anna Donlon recently outlined upcoming changes</a> designed "to make our community a better place".</p>
<p>It's the latest in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/riot-outlines-plans-to-start-monitoring-valorant-voice-chat-in-a-bid-to-combat-disruptive-behaviour">Riot's long-running effort to clamp down on toxicity and unacceptable behaviours in Valorant</a>. In July 2022, Riot Games began collecting "in-game voice communications" in North America as part of its "larger effort to combat disruptive behaviour."

		<p>Remasters of Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver 1 an 2 have leaked out via two collectable statues at San Diego Comic-Con. That’s a new one for leaks for sure, we’ve had games revealed by the ERSB, by promotional drinks and mistimed adverts, but never a statue.</p>



<p>We can also see the Crystal Dynamics logo and as that team took ownership of the franchise back when they <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/09/08/crystal-dynamics-tomb-raider-legacy-of-kain/">joined Embracer</a>, it appears they will have at least some input on the remaster. The statues are on display at the Dark Horse booth at San Diego Comic-Con 2024.</p>
<p>“We are excited to inform you that Crystal Dynamics has taken control of several game franchises—including TOMB RAIDER and Legacy of Kain—from the games’ previous owner, Square Enix Limited,” the team stated at the time. “As a result of this change, Crystal Dynamics (or its affiliate) is now the owner of these games and the controller of the gameplay and personal data related to them.”</p>
<p>Fans have been clamouring for something from the Soul Reaver franchise for many years but there really has not been any hint of a remake or remaster until now.&nbsp; However, Embracer did say that they saw “great potential, not only in sequels, but also in remakes, remasters, spinoffs, as well as transmedia projects” when they spent vast amounts of cash buying up loads of IPs.</p>

<p>The two games are sequels to The Legacy of Kain, both featuring the vampire wraith Raziel in a quest to kill Kain, the star of the first game.&nbsp; Both titles picked up excellent reviews when they were released between 1991 and 2001, not surprising when they were directed by Uncharted’s Amy Hennig.</p>

<p>Neither Crystal Dynamics or Embracer have officially revealed the games but if the merchandise is already in production they cannot be too far away from release.</p>

            <p>Activision has published a 25-page white paper exploring the impact of skill-based matchmaking (SBMM) on its multiplayer lobbies, determining that SBMM is better for all players.</p>
<p>As spotted by indie game developer and consultant <a href="https://x.com/tha_rami/status/1817178179208925317">Rami Ismail</a>, the report – which can be <a href="https://www.activision.com/cdn/research/CallofDuty_Matchmaking_Series_2.pdf">read in full on Activision's official website</a> – outlines an "amazing A/B test" where Activision "secretly progressively turned off SBMM and monitored retention… and turns out everyone hated it, with more quitting, less playing, and more negative blowouts".</p>

<p>Activision announced plans to launch the series of white papers back in <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/01/call-of-duty-update-an-Inside-look-at-matchmaking">April</a>, and has already considered the impact <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/01/call-of-duty-update-an-Inside-look-at-matchmaking">connections and Time to Match</a> has on online play.</p>
<p>The most recent paper, however – entitled "Matchmaking Series: The Role of Skill in Matchmaking" – "shares a look at matchmaking inside Call of Duty multiplayer, including how we always work to create a balanced system for the benefit of all players. While skill is one of many factors in matchmaking; it is not the driving force behind Call of Duty’s matchmaking system".</p>
<p>"Playing a better opponent may push players to become more proficient over time, but being severely outperformed in their matches, our testing has shown, instead leads players to quit matches in progress or to not play multiplayer," Activision surmises.</p>
<p>It also confirmed that it whilst it was "considering a single core multiplayer playlist that does not use skill as a factor in matchmaking", Activision believes "historical testing reveals that low- and mid-skill players would be unlikely to participate in such a playlist. As a match can only be created from players actively searching for a playlist, the likely result would be matches composed solely of high-skill players."</p>
<p>The experiment, Activision opines, shows that the existing SBMM system allows a broadest range of players to participate in "all key parts of Call of Duty's game design in core multiplayer".</p>
<p>This "includes games where players can contribute meaningfully to their team, not only with wins, but for their own personal records and achievements".</p>
<p>"The system strives for team balance, where players are not consistently on the wrong side of blowout matches. Players who frequently experience blowouts are seen to quit matches in progress and the game itself, which negatively impacts the experience for players of all skill levels," Activision concluded.</p>
<p>"We will always strive to improve our approach to matchmaking to ensure that players of all skill levels are having the best possible experience. A healthy player population is good for everyone in the community."</p>
<p>Further research papers into ranked played and "experimental methods" are expected later this year.</p>
<p>ICYMI, last year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-is-heading-to-xbox-game-pass-this-week">Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 joined Xbox Game Pass earlier this week</a>.</p>

            <p>Amazon Prime's Like a Dragon adaptation Like a Dragon: Yakuza will premier on 24th October, 2024.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/like-a-dragon-yakuza-tv-series-on-amazon-prime-later-this-year">Previously</a>, we'd been told the series would debut on 25th October.</p>
<p>To mark the change, Amazon also dropped a tantalising, if brief, peek at what's to come in a new teaser trailer:</p>

<p>Sega's Yakuza game series released in 2005. Amazon says in the video description that it was "positioned as an entertaining game for adults, which found massive fanfare amongst its target audience".</p>
<p>The series will span two time periods - 1995 and 2005 - and follow "the life, childhood friends, and repercussions of the decisions of Kazuma Kiryu, a fearsome and peerless Yakuza warrior with a strong sense of justice, duty, and humanity".</p>
<p>"The series depicts the lives of fierce yet passionate gangsters and people living in a huge entertainment district, Kamurochō, a fictional district modeled after the violent Shinjuku ward’s Kabukichō, that acts as the backdrop of the gameplay," the description adds.</p>
<p>"Like a Dragon: Yakuza showcases modern Japan and the dramatic stories of these intense characters, such as the legendary Kazuma Kiryu, that games in the past have not been able to explore. Coming October 24 to Prime."</p>
<p>Japanese actor and model Ryoma Takeuchi (who cameoed in Detective Pikachu, among other roles) will take on the lead role of Kazuma Kiryu, while Masaharu Take (The Naked Director) will direct.</p>
<p>The TV series is yet another indication of the success of the series, which has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-sammy-reports-best-financial-performance-for-a-decade-despite-european-studio-disappointment">sold 21.3m units in total</a>. The most recent game, this year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-hits-1m-sales-in-first-week">Infinite Wealth, sold 1m units in its first week</a> and was the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-is-series-biggest-steam-launch-to-date">series' biggest Steam launch ever</a>.</p>
<p>As Ed reported for us at the time, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/yakuza-was-flat-out-rejected-by-sega-in-its-first-proposal-says-series-creator">Sega "flat out rejected" the first proposal for the game</a>, presuming it wouldn't attract mass audiences. Yet the TV series is likely to do just that, especially following the success of Amazon's Fallout series, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-fallout-tv-show-was-watched-by-65m-people-in-its-first-two-weeks">was watched by 65 million people</a> in its first 16 days of release and has already been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-fallout-show-officially-renewed-for-second-season">renewed for a second season</a>.</p>

            <p>For those watching the Olympics opening ceremony last night, no, that was not your imagination – a familiar hooded Assassin did indeed invade the rooftops of Paris last night.</p>
<p>Whilst it's hard to find footage given a trigger-happy copyright gremlin is striking down videos all over the place, there are still a number of images and video of Assassin's Creed Unity's Arno carrying the Olympic torch for anyone who missed it:</p>

<p>And no, it's not a coincidence – that really is an Assassin's Creed reference. Though it had been <a href="https://x.com/ac_landmarks/status/1816424863961411730">suggested</a> that Ubisoft's tentpole franchise may be making an appearance, last night the French company confirmed it:</p> <div>

<p>Assassin's Creed Unity – which will soon celebrate its tenth anniversary – was set in 18th-century Paris, which makes Arno's return fitting, if a little surprising given he is perhaps not the most beloved Assassin, and Unity was not the best-performing game at launch.</p> <div>

<p>It does, however, commemorate the hugely-successful series in a mainstream event seen by millions, and solidifies just how influential Ubisoft is to the people of Paris.</p>

            <p>I like a good factory game, but there's a fine line between "I enjoy this" and "I am uninstalling this before it ruins my year." I can't tell on which side of the divide <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/shapez-2">Shapez 2</a> will fall, but I'm planning on finding out when it launches in Early Access next month on August 15th.

<p>Here's the Early Access announcemnt trailer from earlier this week:

<p>Like most factory games, Shapez 2 is about laying down conveyor belts to carry items between machinery that alters those items in some capacity. The difference is that instead of rendering one type of ore into another, Shapez is all about... shapes. That allows the game to broaden the possible solutions, with no predetermined recipes for the objects you're trying to create. Instead, it gives you machines that perform simple, fundamental actions - cutting a shape in half, changing its colour, rotating it, etc. - which you can puzzle out how to combine.
</p>
<p>The second compelling element to me is that the machinery is free to plonk down, and resources are infinite. It's more of a pure puzzle game, nearer the Opus Magnum end of the spectrum than the Factorio end. That's where I live. (Ollie, who lives in every factory possible, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/shapez-2s-next-fest-demo-is-the-purest-catnip-for-factory-game-lovers">loved the Shapez 2 Next Fest demo</a>.)
</p>
<p>I didn't play the original Shapez (which has overwhelmingly positive reviews and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1318690/shapez/">currently costs less than £1 on Steam</a>) but I admit, the leap to 3D presentation does make the sequel seem more approachable. You'll find Shapez 2 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2162800/shapez_2/">also on Steam</a>, where it's aiming to be in Early Access for around six months.</p>
