In the team's own words, "Where's the guy that said the game would be dead in a week?"</p><p dir="ltr">Over the weekend, according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3527290/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>, the game reached an all-time peak of just under 114,500 players. For comparison, Content Warning, a game from other co-developer Landfall that sits within that slightly hard to define genre of comedy co-op games, achieved an all-time peak of a little over 204,000 when it was released. The big difference there is that Content Warning was free at launch, so Peak's accomplishment is nothing to be sniffed at.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1713/17133350/4528230-peak.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4528230" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1713/17133350/4528230-peak.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4528230"></a><figcaption>Surviving with friends in PEAK.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1713/17133350/4528230-peak.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Last week, the game received a fresh update with a few bug fixes that was quickly reverted due to inviting in even more bugs missed in testing.

            <p>Square Enix has invested in a Danish indie studio to accelerate development of its forthcoming ARPG, as the Japanese company continues to look to the west for another publishing hit.</p>
<p>Back in 2022, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-sells-off-western-studios-and-ip-including-tomb-raider-and-deus-ex">Square Enix sold off its large western studios</a> and over 50 intellectual properties to Embracer for $300m, including the likes of Crystal Dynamics and Eidos Montreal. It later stated this decision was "driven by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-feared-western-studios-cannibalised-sales-of-japanese-games">concerns that the titles cannibalised sales of the rest of the group</a>".</p>
<p>As such, Square Enix has most recently focused on its Japanese games (namely Final Fantasy, Dragon Quest and Kingdom Hearts), but by its own admission, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-admits-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-and-final-fantasy-16-profits-did-not-meet-expectations">the Final Fantasy games especially have underperformed</a>.</p>

<p>But western publishing has still continued at Square Enix. Publishing indie hit PowerWash Simulator through its Square Enix Collective has been a huge success for the company. That's alongside publishing Life is Strange Double Exposure last year for US studio Deck Nine Games, following previous games in the series.</p>
<p>It seems that western investment is set to continue. At Summer Game Fest this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-follows-up-foamstars-flop-with-traitors-esque-killer-inn">Square Enix revealed its new online multiplayer game Killer Inn</a>, which it's publishing for Canadian studio Tactic Studios.</p>
<p>Now it's investing in Danish studio BetaDwarf to assist with development of its Vaultbreakers ARPG, which was first announced at the start of the year.</p>
<p>"Square Enix is always looking for high-quality games and talented development studios," said Hideaki Uehara, Square Enix general manager of business development. "When I played Vaultbreakers, I was genuinely excited by the experience of connecting with other players and exploring its rich game world.</p>
<p>"After visiting BetaDwarf and learning about the team's mission and passion, we decided to invest in them to help realise their dream and bring this game to players around the world."</p>
<p>BetaDwarf CEO and game director Steffen Kabbelgaard noted the "amazing access to a combination of knowledge, talent, and resources" thanks to this partnership.</p>
<p>"We are already very far with our dream game Vaultbreakers: we have a huge amazing community, and we have already run 15+ tests with more than 50,000 players who constantly enable us to refine," added Kabbelgaard. "So getting this additional support feels amazing when we are far into production already. I can really see how this enables a home run vs having just started on an uncertain journey - yeah, I'm just really excited about our situation!"</p>
<p>Vaultbreakers is a Diablo-esque top-down ARPG set in a colourful fantasy world. It will be playable solo or in multiplayer in both PvE and PvPvE modes.</p>
<p>A beta test is currently taking place, though there's no firm release date yet.</p>
<p>Square Enix's next Final Fantasy game will be its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/long-rumoured-final-fantasy-tactics-remaster-is-real">long-rumoured Final Fantasy Tactics remaster</a>, The Ivalice Chronicles. It's set for release on 30th September across PS4, PS5, Switch, Switch 2, Xbox Series X/S, and PC (Steam).</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-invests-in-danish-indie-studio-as-it-seeks-next-western-publishing-hit]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster Review - Screenshot 1 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157209/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>What comes to mind when you think about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/bioshock_the_collection">BioShock</a>? The remarkable sense of place? The Plasmids? The creepy atmosphere and unsettling enemies? The audio logs? Whatever it may be, chances are that it probably cropped up first in the 1999 sci-fi horror FPS <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/pc/system_shock_2">System Shock 2</a>.</p>
<p>Written and designed by Ken Levine, who would go on to lead the development on BioShock (2007) and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/bioshock_infinite_the_complete_edition">BioShock Infinite</a> (2013), System Shock 2 is widely regarded as a pioneering title; leagues ahead of its time and to this day one of the finest games ever made. Now, thanks to the remaster wizards over at Nightdive Studios, it’s finally available on console via <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/system_shock_2_25th_anniversary_remaster">System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster</a>.</p>
<p>Taking place on the starship ‘Von Braun’, you play as a soldier who awakens from cryostasis with amnesia, and it’s up to you to work your way through the environment and meet with Dr. Janice Polito, who helps you along the way via radio. Naturally, this is merely a slice of the overarching narrative, and like much of Levine’s work, you can expect a couple of twists and turns during your adventure that, if you’re completely new to the game, will undoubtedly shock you (all puns intended).</p>
<figure><a title="System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster Review - Screenshot 2 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157203/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Gameplay is a mix of exploration, combat, and light RPG mechanics. Exploring Von Braun is an absolute joy, with each main area presenting its own unique sense of atmosphere. Given the game's age, some of the environments look a little ‘samey’ at times, so I’d definitely recommend toggling the mini-map to give you a helping hand if you ever get lost. That said, Von Braun is a ship that’s begging to be explored from top to bottom, and the combination of visual storytelling and collectible audio logs really help add vital context to the overall narrative. The ambient soundtrack enhances the sense of place even further thanks to its retro, <strong>Blade Runner</strong>-inspired sci-fi tracks.</p>
<p>Taking your time and navigating the environment carefully is highly advisable. Not only will enemies like Hybrids, Monkeys, and Rumblers lurk behind the corners, but surveillance cameras hamper your progress at every turn. Shoot them out if you wish (or clobber them with a crowbar), or hack into the security systems and disable them temporarily. Hacking is done by switching nodes to light up three in a line, but failing on a red-outlined 'ICE' node shuts down the terminal completely, raising the alarm, and locking you out until you're able to repair it. It's tense stuff.</p>
<figure><a title="System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster Review - Screenshot 3 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157204/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Combat, on the other hand, definitely struggles a bit by comparison. It’s not for lack of options, mind: you’ve got standard guns, laser guns, melee weapons, and even Plasmid-like cybernetic abilities via the spherical ‘psionic amplifier’. The problem is that, by virtue of the game’s vintage, encounters often boil down to simply whacking enemies or shooting them until their health drops to zero, with the enemy AI doing little to avoid your attacks.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I’d argue that you don’t play a game like System Shock 2 for the combat first and foremost, but it’s something to keep in mind given the frequency with which you encounter enemies. It’s also pretty difficult at times, so make sure you either lower the setting down to ‘easy’ or save manually whenever you can to ease the pressure. If you're after a true challenge, however, then 'impossible' mode is ready and waiting.</p>
<p>Either way, you can make things easier by activating the 'Regeneration Stations' in each area. These act like respawn points when you die, removing the stress of having to reload your save entirely. If you save frequently enough, however, you might find that reloading can be more beneficial in certain scenarios.</p>
<figure><a title="System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster Review - Screenshot 4 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157211/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Finally, unlike BioShock, System Shock 2 gives you complete control over how to build your character abilities. You can increase stats across four key areas, including Tech, Weapons, Psi Powers, and O/S. If that’s not enough, you can also increase your core stats like strength and endurance.</p>
<p>All of this is achieved via collectable Cyber Modules, which are either gifted to you upon completion of main story objectives or located throughout the environment. They’re pretty rare, though, so careful consideration on how to spend them is key to your success. Vending machines are also located throughout Von Braun, so you’ll be gathering quite a hefty amount of Nanites, the game’s currency, from dead bodies and crates.</p>
<p>Nightdive’s revival of System Shock 2 retains much of the original’s essence, enhancing the experience in small, yet key ways. Crucially, the game works surprisingly well with traditional console controls via the Switch’s analogue sticks (with optional gyro aiming thrown into the mix, too), though I’d also concede that its complex menu system can be a little tricky to navigate at times. Should Nightdive opt to update the game for Switch 2 and introduce mouse controls, this would give it a significant advantage over the likes of the PS5 and Xbox (on that note, it plays perfectly fine on Switch 2 - no issues to report).</p>
<figure><a title="System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster Review - Screenshot 5 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157202/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The original game also included co-op play, but to say that it became somewhat unwieldy over the years with mods and bugs is an understatement. Nightdive has again revived this for the 25th Anniversary Remaster, including cross-play across all platforms. You can't join strangers, mind you, so you'll need a room code to access an online session, but having a friend on board would definitely make those higher difficulty settings a bit more manageable. Switch 2 also proves a great option here too, as the built-in microphone makes in-game chat a breeze.</p>
<p>Like Nightdive’s other efforts on Switch, you’ve also got rock-solid 60fps performance to go along with the enhanced visuals, with frame rate in both docked and handheld mode never missing a beat. Visuals might look a <em>touch</em> sharper in docked mode, but again, it's near enough identical. Don’t expect anything even close to the <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/system_shock">System Shock</a> remake released in 2023, though — that’s an entirely different beast; one that we hope makes its way to Switch 2 eventually — but rather something more akin to Nightdive’s treatment of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/thing_remastered">The Thing: Remastered</a>. This is very much the same System Shock 2 that launched in 1999, but characters and environments look significantly crisper without losing its core identity.</p>
<figure><a title="System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster Review - Screenshot 6 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157206/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>You’ve also got a whole bunch of supplemental material via the ‘Vault’. Accessed through the main menu, this contains an almost overwhelming amount of content to peruse, including concept art, trailers, early screenshots, unused assets, sound clips, and interviews. The jewel in the crown, however, has to be the full inclusion of the 290-page Prima strategy guide, scanned and readily available should you need any help and can’t be bothered to hop onto the internet.</p>
<p>Overall, the Vault represents an excellent celebration of the original classic and should provide plenty of additional context to both newcomers and veterans.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster is a wonderful way to experience one of the most well-regarded FPS titles of all time. With an excellent narrative and a world that begs to be explored, it's not only an incredible game in its own right but should also be considered essential reading for BioShock fans.</p>
<p>Minor combat concerns aside, System Shock 2's immersive mechanics will keep you hooked from start to finish, with Nightdive's enhancements and supplemental material providing ample bonus points. Now go play it, insect.</p></section>

			<p>Tokyo Game Show 2025 is a little more than two months away at the time of this writing, and as spotted by <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/07/tokyo-game-show-2025-exhibitors-list-and-main-visual-announced">Gematsu</a>, the Computer Entertainment Supplier's Association has<a href="https://tgs.cesa.or.jp/en/news/detail/40012"> announced</a> the first batch of exhibitors who will be in attendance. The CESA also debuted this year's new key art for the event, which was illustrated by Zashiki Warashi.</p>



<p>So far, this year's show is significantly bigger than last year's, with this year featuring 4,083 booths compared to last years 3,252. There are 772 exhibitors confirmed for this year, the majority of them being local to Japan, while 299 exhibitors are coming from overseas to showcase their games and products at Tokyo Game Show 2025.</p>



<p>Sony Interactive Entertainment, Square Enix, Sega, Konami, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/capcom-cancels-monster-hunter-wilds-lecture-amid-player-harassment/">Capcom</a> are among the exhibitors that are confirmed to be in attendance at the show, which will run from September 25-28 and be hosted at Makuhari Messe in Chiba, Japan. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>Other notable exhibitors include Annapurna Interactive, Arc System Works, EA, Koei Tecmo, Pearl Abyss, Riot Games, Ubisoft, and Bandai Namco.</p>



<p>Tokyo Game Show is not often an event where we see major announcements, but its placement in the year falling after Gamescom but ahead of the holiday season means we do usually get a deeper look at some of the bigger titles set to arrive in the fall/winter. It'll be interesting to see what this year's show holds.</p>

            <p>If you dream of playing a game set inside a diagram of a spacebase from a Usborne Cutaway book published in the 1990s, Kuu is probably for you. If you dream of being very sad on the Moon, tending sickly plants for 30 days by Earthlight, then Kuu is also, probably, for you. If you enjoyed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/citizen-sleeper">Citizen Sleeper</a> but wish it was as depressing as, say, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/anoxia-station">Anoxia Station</a>, Kuu is also also, probably, for you.</p><!--more-->
<p>It's a bright and bony colony management game in which you play the titular Kuu, a "silent caretaker" for a "fragile sisterhood", trapped in a lunar greenhouse that has been trashed by a "mysterious blast" from a "long-abandoned Earth". You will divide each day between such tasks as setting up the solar panels (at the cost of blocking the light to your growpods), scouring the radio spectrum for help, and combing downloaded documents for answers about your plight. Here be trailer.</p>

<p>Being a silent caretaker, you will only be able to nod or shake your head when your sisters come to you with questions or requests. "Some will starve, and some will snap," <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3442050/KUU/">the Steam page comments</a>. "It will be your fault." Good-O. Each night, you'll retire to a hibernation pod and pick through a monograph left behind by a "disgraced pseudo-archaeologist". If it were me, I'd be binging Toradora excerpts and tearfully devouring a very large bowl of cereal, but I imagine Kuu doesn't have access to Youtube.</p>
<p>Kuu is the work of the perhaps humourously named Interactive Tragedy, Limited, founded by <a href="https://people.wgtn.ac.nz/zach.dodson">New Zealand academic Zach Dodson</a>. It's the video game component of a hybrid book project which seeks to "combine traditional print design and creative writing with new approaches in interactive fiction and visual narrative".</p>
<p>While I find some of the Steam page language a little too pointed in its poignancy, I like the cut(away) of Kuu's gib. I also like the sound of Dodson's research in general, as briefly outlined in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3442050/view/528724050310070595?l=english">this Steam post</a> on how "the affordances of different media can create a narrative ecosystem", which reminds me a bit of Whitney Trettien's <a href="https://whitneyannetrettien.com/thesis/">work on volvelles</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/in-this-austerely-beautiful-moonbase-management-game-your-only-choices-will-be-impossible-ones]]></content:encoded>

      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > Opus Major" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/opus-major">Opus Major</a>, a Paris-based studio formed by industry veterans from <a title="Companies > Ubisoft [1,303 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/ubisoft">Ubisoft</a> and other studios, has announced <em><a title="Games > MAJJAM" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/majjam">MAJJAM</a></em>, a massively multiplayer online player-versus-environment musical <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,387 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure game</a> currently in early development. It will be available for <a title="Platforms > PC [23,632 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3845650/MAJJAM/" target="_blank">Steam</a> when it launches, and users can register for an upcoming playtest via the <a href="http://www.majjam.com/" target="_blank">official website</a>. <span id="more-977970"></span></p><p>“Our team’s dream is to make the world jam together,” said Opus Major founders Pierre-Armand Nicq and Jean-Nicolas Vernin in a press release. “In music, a jam is a suspended moment—a shared energy between friends, strangers, and other passionate souls who just happen to be there. You might not know each other, but for a few magical, spontaneous moments, you vibe together. It’s that same spark you sometimes feel in a <a title="Genres > Multiplayer [551 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer">multiplayer game</a>. Our dream is to bring all these joyful moments together into one single, shared experience.”</p><div id="carousel_977973"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Opus Major:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>The rhythm of the world comes alive in <em>MAJJAM</em>, the debut project from the recently announced studio Opus Major: a multiplayer adventure game where music shapes the gameplay, from movement and combat to exploration and interaction. Created by a team of seasoned developers, <em>MAJJAM</em> is a vibrant co-op adventure inspired by the communal creativity of a live jam session, where players can build their own expressive arsenal of melodies, rhythms, and harmonies to explore and rescue a vibrant and ever-evolving world. With music at its core, <em>MAJJAM</em> offers a deeply immersive social experience that celebrates the connective power of both video games and music.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>In the lively world of <em>MAJJAM</em>, players interact with each other and their surroundings almost exclusively through rhythm and melodies. Music is the world’s life force—a sustaining energy that holds everything together and stands as the only defense against a corruptive presence known as Kode: a dark and encroaching presence pushing fog tides where death and silence rule. Players harness musical energy by Jamming, combining the unique abilities of their character and instruments alongside their allies to defeat enemies, solve puzzles, and reshape the world around them.</p><p>The ability to Jam is the main expression of music in-game, giving all players the opportunity to become musicians. The studio’s mission is to make the world jam together, so no instrumental expertise is required to cast melodies and rhythms. Jamming serves multiple functions: fighting back against Kode, exploring and influencing the environment, uncovering and solving puzzles, and more!</p><p>Each character’s special Jam ability is supported and augmented by a system of musical abilities that players will be able to unlock, collect, and store throughout the game. Each ability has a specific musical power that further deepens the player’s skill set and relationship to the world.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>The Fun and Creativity of Jamming, for Everyone</strong> – <em>MAJJAM</em> captures the joy and spontaneity of a musical jam session, for musicians and non musicians. The game’s technology auto-harmonizes all player performances online, with no noticeable latency. Players collaborate through intuitive gameplay mechanics, not musical skill, making creativity accessible to all. <em>MAJJAM</em> is not a <a title="Genres > Rhythm [187 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rhythm">rhythm game</a>: it emphasizes communal creation as players express their characters’ musical abilities.</li><li><strong>A Shifting, Musical World</strong> – The vibrant, detailed world of <em>MAJJAM</em> is constantly shifting based on player input: the environment is reacting to player abilities, responding to it, and even opening mysteries. By combining their musical expressions with others, players can reshape part of the world around them, unlocking new areas, discovering powerful melodies, and encountering surprising obstacles.</li><li><strong>A Dynamic and Dangerous Fog System</strong> – Kode isn’t just an antagonist—its power is materialized in the game as a massive environmental threat; a lethal active force that defines the boundaries of exploration. Players can beat back its fog through their musical powers, and explore new zones that used to be restrained under the fog tides.</li><li><strong>Social <a title="Companies > Experience [212 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/experience">Experience</a>s with <a title="Series > Persona [89 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/persona">Persona</a>l Customization</strong> – Whether you enjoy strumming some chords, hearing delightful woodwind melodies or you’re percussion-addict, <em>MAJJAM</em> offers multiple, colorful character types for players to select, each with their own musical capabilities and distinct look. The key to maximizing their power comes from jamming with others, <a title="Genres > Co-Op [302 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer/co-op">cooperative</a>ly creating with fellow players to craft a perfect harmony and exponentialize the effects on the world of <em>MAJJAM</em>.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-runescape-dragonwilds/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nvidia-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-is-coming-to-runescape-dragonwilds-mortal-online-2-and-brickadia.1238130/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Three PC games are integrating NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation shortly. Chronologically, the first one will be Jagex's RuneScape: Dragonwilds, the cooperative open world survival crafting game that <a href="https://wccftech.com/runescape-dragonwilds-has-suddenly-launched-on-steam-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launched in early access nearly three months ago</a>. </p>



<p>RuneScape: Dragonwilds debuted to decent numbers, registering a 52K concurrent player peak on Steam. However, those numbers are long gone - over the last week, the game has stayed below three thousand concurrent players at all times, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1374490/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to SteamDB</a>. Anyway, RuneScape: Dragonwilds launched with support for DLSS Super Resolution, Frame Generation, and DLAA, but a patch due today will also add NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation, boosting frame rates across the board for all owners of GeForce RTX 50 Series graphics cards.</p>



<p>On Friday, July 11, Brickadia LLC will launch the namesake next-generation brick building sandbox game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2199420/Brickadia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Steam Early Access</a>, where it is planned to stay until the end of 2026. In Brickadia, users have every creative tool, such as building, scripting, and more, available right in the game with real-time multiplayer enabled. That means they can work with friends to build massive worlds, intricate physics contraptions, and entirely new game modes without ever leaving the action. Some of the examples of things you can craft in Brickadia include skyscrapers, all sorts of vehicles, detailed islands, spaceships, and cityscapes.</p>



<p>The game is powered by Unreal Engine 5 and supports hardware accelerated ray tracing, boosting UE5's own Lumen, as you can see below. To compensate for that performance cost, players will find NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation, Frame Generation, Super Resolution, and DLAA options available.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Lastly, the Unreal Engine 5 sandbox indie MMORPG <a href="https://wccftech.com/mortal-online-2-gets-epic-megagrant-will-migrate-to-unreal-engine-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mortal Online 2</a> will receive NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation support later this month with its first expansion, Reckoning, <a href="https://www.mortalonline2.com/patch-notes-reckoning-ptr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">currently available for testing in the Public Test Realm</a>. The game already supports NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution, Frame Generation, and Reflex.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During the course of Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, you will connect with all sorts of people as you attempt to bring the whole of Australia into the Chiral Network. While the vast majority of preppers are encountered as part of the story, a few are entirely optional, and can be missed if you don't listen to what characters tell Sam and if you don't explore the map fully.</p>



<p>One of these optional preppers is <strong>The Inventor</strong>, a rather peculiar guy who has decided to bring Australia's current isolation to the next level by living on an island off the coast of the continent. Looking at the island from afar, it seems impossible to reach The Inventor's shelter, as no roads or bridges are going through or over the sea of tar, but there are actually a few easy ways to reach the island, and you can even reach him as soon as you get to Australia from the Plate Gate if you so desire.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>After reaching the beach closest to The Inventor's shelter, use your Odradek scanner to highlight areas where the tar is shallow. These areas, highlighted by yellow dots, can be traversed safely. Before you head out, however, <strong>look around the beach to find lost cargo for The Inventor</strong>, as he won't talk to you unlesss you have a delivery for him. Once you have loaded the cargo, you can follow the safe path, reach the shelter, and connect it to the Chiral Network.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Even if you are not a completionist who wants to see everything Death Stranding 2: On the Beach has to offer, there are still plenty of good reasons to unlock The Inventor as increasing the connection level with the prepper will unlock some <strong>useful items</strong>, including the Otter Head at level 1, the Stun Bomb at level 2, the Remote Stun Bomb at level 3, the Bola Stun Gun at level 4 and a Custom Hologram and a patch at level 5 with which you can customize your structures and backpack, respectively.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-docked-vrr-feasible/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-docked-vrr-support-is-technically-feasible-but-would-face-significant-challenges.1238124/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Nintendo Switch 2 docked VRR support may be technically feasible, but there would be too many hurdles to make it a smooth plug-and-play feature.</p>



<p>During the latest episode of their weekly podcast, the tech experts at Digital Foundry replied to a supporter's question asking if the dock's authentication chip is the reason why the Nintendo Switch 2 doesn't support VRR in docked mode, ruling out the possibility, as the authentication process is a separate process that takes place before any sort of output process begins. The reason why the Nintendo Switch 2 dock doesn't support VRR, Digital Foundry highlighted, has probably nothing to do with the dock, but rather with the Display Port to HDMI conversion through USB-C, which makes it difficult for VRR to work on the Steam Deck. Ultimately, Digital Foundry believes that VRR may be technically feasible, as it was recently proven how&nbsp;the dock can support it,&nbsp;but the hurdles to overcome may be too many to actually make it a smooth plug-and-play experience, which is what console users expect to find.</p>



<p>On a related note, the tech experts at Digital Foundry also commented on why so few Nintendo Switch 2 launch games do not support 40 FPS modes despite the 120 Hz panel making it a feasible option, saying that, at this time, not too many titles would benefit from it. At the same time, however, some games already supporting 40 FPS mode like Cyberpunk 2077, suggests that more titles will support it in the future, although it remains to be seen how many, especially if the VRR situation doesn't improve, as games would need to be locked at 40 FPS without VRR for a good experience.</p>

<p>Steven, who's part of a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/beat-saber">Beat Saber</a> community modding group, has put down their neon sword and made <a href="https://thunderstore.io/c/peak/p/Steven/Everest/">Everest</a>. It's a mod which "saves your death location and populates your world with skeletons where others have fallen." Lovely.</p>
<p>By scattering this spooky, scary stuff throughout your surroundings, the modder aims to create "a shared experience, potentially marking dangerous areas and connecting you to other adventurers in death." Given how often folks die in Peak, it appears you'll be connecting with a lot of corpses in addition to your own, with Steven having tweeted that one of the mod's first days in operation saw "10,000+ skeletons from over 3,000 different players" be summoned.</p> <div>

<p>The mod comes with a "detailed" config file so you can adjust things to suit your preferences and handy notifications that'll let you know if it's working or not, just in case your island not being littered with corpses isn't a dead giveaway.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Level-5 has announced that its cozy open-world RPG&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time&nbsp;</em>has passed another big sales milestone, and that a major update is coming to the game with a brand new feature soon as well.</p>

<p>Over on the official&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.fantasylife.jp/fli/en/topics/250708/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">website</a>, Level-5 says the game has crossed 1.2 million sales across all platforms around the world. That's another 200,000 sales <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fantasy-life-i-sales-1m-new-update" rel="nofollow">since mid-June</a>, a feat of which Level-5 can be justly proud.</p>

<p>Along with the new milestone, Level-5 also reveals that a photo mode is coming to&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i&nbsp;</em>as part of an update that will be deployed "later this month". It will, as the name suggests, allow you to pause the action and take snapshots of your favorite moments.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fantasy-life-i-sales-1.2m-photo-mode-menu.jpg?itok=hYUKL2DK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fantasy-life-i-sales-1.2m-photo-mode-menu.jpg?itok=EuBOOjYe 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time&nbsp;</em>is getting a photo mode later this month.</figcaption></figure><p>Options will include posing characters, showing or hiding Buddies, and adjusting camera angles, as well as letting characters show their feelings through various emotes.</p>

<p>When the photo mode arrives in&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i</em>, Level-5 is planning to hold a photo contest in which players will be invited to "showcase their islands, house designs, and more", so be on the lookout for that closer to the time (whenever that happens to be).</p>

<p>We're still not sure when the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/free-fantasy-life-i-dlc-roguelike-open-world" rel="nofollow">upcoming <em>Update the World!</em> DLC</a> will be released, but when it is, it'll bring a brand new roguelike open-world mode to the game in which you'll have the chance to earn new gear and more.</p>

<p>You can also enjoy some free stuff by entering the code "K9E8VADB" in&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i</em>'s main menu's gift code entry window, which will net you access to a bunch of nifty legendary crafting materials.</p>




<p><em>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2993780/FANTASY_LIFE_i_The_Girl_Who_Steals_Time/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time/9PP7TDRDZGHD" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and the Nintendo Switch console family.

        <p>Mod criticised for "distorted historical facts".</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Valve has denied reports its pulled a controversial mod from Steam around the world at the request of the South Korean government, saying the mod was only blocked in South Korea and only because it broke local laws. The mod's author is said to be behind its global removal.
</p>
<p>
Over the weekend, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/valve-cooperates-in-banning-steam-mod-for-depicting-historical-revisionism/">Automaton</a> (citing several South Korean sources including the <a href="https://www.yna.co.kr/view/AKR20250613133900017">Yonhap News Agency</a> and <a href="https://www.thisisgame.com/webzine/news/nboard/4/?category=4&amp;n=214032">ThisIsGame</a>) reported Valve had agreed to a request by South Korea's Game Rating and Administration Committee (GRAC) to remove a mod for strategy RPG Mount &amp; Blade: Warband not just locally but overseas as well.
</p>
<p>
The mod, titled Gwangju Running Man, reportedly depicted the events of the 1980 Gwangju Uprising - in which student-led pro-democracy protests were violently suppressed by the South Korean military, resulting in significant civilian casualties - in a way that "distorted historical facts". It's said the mod (which featured military dictator Chun Doo Hwan as its cover), depicted protesters as "armed and violent criminals", framing the military's response as "justified".
</p>
<p>
As reports of Valve's response began circulating, some expressed concern that the company was now seemingly willing to remove content worldwide at the request of a country's government. Valve, though, has now provided clarification on the events leading to the Mount &amp; Blade mod's removal, saying access was restricted in March - but only in South Korea - after the company was informed it violated South Korean laws. Valve added the mod was then deleted from Steam in June by its original uploader, causing its worldwide disappearance.
</p>
<p>
Valve has, of course, been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-accused-of-allowing-the-proliferation-of-hate-as-report-finds-18m-instances-of-extremist-or-hateful-content-on-steam">heavily criticised for its lack of adequate content moderation</a> in the past, facing condemnation for allowing the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-steam-school-shooting-game">school shooting game Active Shooter</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-under-fire-as-sexually-explicit-game-glorifying-rape-is-listed-on-steam">Rape Day</a>, and, more recently, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-quietly-removes-explicit-game-featuring-extreme-sexual-violence-from-steam-in-uk">non-consensual sex game No Mercy</a> onto its store.
</p>
<p>
In 2018, following the controversy caused by Active Shooter, Valve <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-backs-away-from-content-policing-says-it-will-allow-everything-on-steam">announced it had decided to "allow everything" onto Steam</a>, provided it wasn't illegal, "or straight up trolling". While Valve has also been known to quietly remove titles when faced with significant negative public attention, it seems Gwangju Running Man specifically fell foul of its legality rules.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Just in case you've been feeling like your shoe collection isn't cursed enough, Nintendo has announced a collaboration between&nbsp;<em>Animal Crossing&nbsp;</em>and Crocs. I'll let that sink in for a minute.</p>

<p>Per a Nintendo <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/crocs-launches-first-ever-collaboration-with-animal-crossing/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a>, a new collection of&nbsp;<em>Animal Crossing&nbsp;</em>Crocs will be launching on August 26th, which is, coincidentally, the same date on which a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-ps5-release-date-enhancements" rel="nofollow">trio</a> of previously console-exclusive <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gears-of-war-reloaded-announced" rel="nofollow">games</a> cross the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-xbox-series-xs-august" rel="nofollow">border</a> to join their rival ecosystems.</p>

<p>For adults, the&nbsp;<em>Animal Crossing&nbsp;</em>Platform Clog comes in size ranges of 4-13 for men and 6-12 for women. These shoes will set you back $69.99, but for your cash, you'll get Crocs decorated with&nbsp;<em>Animal Crossing</em>-themed pastel shades and characters.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/animal-crossing-crocs-nintendo-clog.jpg?itok=SeHEE8v6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/animal-crossing-crocs-nintendo-clog.jpg?itok=mH3qm_8W 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Look upon these Crocs, ye mighty, and despair.</figcaption></figure><p>For kids, the Kids'&nbsp;<em>Animal Crossing&nbsp;</em>Classic Clog comes in sizes 11C to 6Y, and it'll set you back a slightly more modest $54.99. The aesthetic is pretty similar, so you could even buy them as a matching set if you want to hasten the coming of the great Croc God of Destruction.</p>

<p>In addition to the shoes themselves, Nintendo and Crocs will also sell sets of Jibbitz Charms themed around&nbsp;<em>Animal Crossing</em>, and you can apply these charms to the Crocs as you see fit. A 5-pack will cost you $16.99, and you can buy individual charms for Rosie, Marshal, and Bunnie for $5 each.</p>

<p>These unholy shoes aren't the first collaboration between Nintendo and Crocs; the company also <a href="https://www.crocs.co.uk/c/collections/more-collections/pokemon" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">sells a set of&nbsp;<em>Pokemon</em>-themed clogs</a>, as well as sets of Jibbitz Charms based on the likes of Eevee, Togepi, and Pikachu, among others.</p>

<p>You can also find Jibbitz Charms themed around&nbsp;<em>Super Mario&nbsp;</em>characters, although no&nbsp;<em>Mario</em>-themed Crocs have appeared yet, so at the very least, we haven't reached that stage of Ragnarok yet.</p>

You'll be able to get them from the official Crocs <a href="https://www.crocs.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">website</a>, as well as Crocs retail stores and "select Crocs retailers" worldwide.</p>

<p>Nintendo has announced an Animal Crossing collaboration with Crocs, yes the company of rubber footwear fame, which are admittedly not the most flattering of shoe options but I do appreciate their easy-drain functionality when it comes to post-water sport escapades.</p>
<p>This Animal Crossing collection sees Crocs' footwear dressed up with beachy waves and lush vegetation. Oh, and of course as with all entrepreneurial Animal Crossing endeavours, Tom Nook will also feature thanks to the new Jibbitz charms.</p>

<p>This Croc collaboration will be released on 26th August, and include the Animal Crossing Platform Clog for adults as well as the Animal Crossing Classic Clog for children. These will cost $69.99 and $54.99 respectively, with the shoes being available in the US via the official Crocs online store and select retailers (I have asked for clarification on UK pricing and availability).</p>
<p>Nintendo has also announced some individual Jibbitz charm packs. The first of these features the Able Sisters trio - Sable, Mabel and Label - as well as a shirt and backpack charm. The second pack is made up with charms of Blathers, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/celeste">Celeste</a> and Pascal, as well as a fossil and a seashell. These packs will retail for $16.99.</p>
<p>Individual charms featuring Rosie, Marshal and Bunnie will also be available for $4.99 each.</p>

<p>"Animal Crossing lets players enjoy a relaxing, slow-paced life while interacting with a cast of unique animal characters.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/romero-games-not-closing-down</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/romero-games-says-it-hasnt-closed-down-search-for-new-publisher-is-on.1238073/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Romero Games, the studio founded by legendary industry auteur John Romero, has clarified that it is not, in fact, shutting down, and that it's currently seeking a new publisher for its ongoing project.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/romerogames.bsky.social/post/3ltfjxsyavs23" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> on social media, Romero Games says that while it's true funding for its game was pulled and that development on the game was halted, the studio is "not closed", and that "any suggestion otherwise is factually incorrect".</p>

<p>Romero Games goes on to say it held discussions regarding next steps just yesterday, and that while the studio will "reassess" its "entire staffing" structure, it's "doing everything in [its] power" to ensure closure doesn't happen.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/romero-games-not-closing-down-doom.jpg?itok=inBt5iX- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/romero-games-not-closing-down-doom.jpg?itok=U1nTCsy9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Romero Games has created new levels for the original&nbsp;<em>Doom</em>, and until recently, it was working on a brand new game as well.</figcaption></figure><p>Technically, Romero Games has never disclosed the publisher for its now-canceled project, although the studio says readers "may infer it from public information".</p>

<p>Just as a reminder, Microsoft recently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/latest-microsoft-layoff-wave-king-zenimax" rel="nofollow">undertook a massive layoff wave</a> that saw around 9,000 of its employees affected. As part of that layoff wave, in-development projects like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/everwild-canceled-rare-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">Rare's </a><i><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/everwild-canceled-rare-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">Everwild</a>&nbsp;</i>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shut-down" rel="nofollow">The Initiative's&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shut-down" rel="nofollow">Perfect Dark</a>&nbsp;</em>were canceled, with the latter also closing its doors for good.</p>

<p>It seems fairly obvious to me that Romero Games is referring to Xbox as the publisher for its game, although since the project itself was never officially announced, that hasn't technically been confirmed.</p>

<p>As for the future, Romero Games says it's "currently evaluating" the "opportunities" that the aforementioned publishers have provided, so it's entirely possible that the studio's project will be revived under a different banner. We'll have to wait and see what happens next.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rare-everwild-xbox-layoffs-romero-games.jpg?itok=F-VOXCsi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rare-everwild-xbox-layoffs-romero-games.jpg?itok=Bt7CwhFc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Xbox's recent layoff wave saw projects like&nbsp;<em>Everwild&nbsp;</em>canceled.</figcaption></figure><p>Amid cancellations and job losses at Xbox, Microsoft has <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/perfect-dark-everwild-game-canceled-microsoft-initiative-1236446212/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">reportedly</a> claimed that every game shown during <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-games-showcase-2025-all-news-and-announcements" rel="nofollow">its showcase this summer</a> is safe, so to speak. Still, given how suddenly these layoffs appear to have happened, it's hard to take that assertion at face value.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see what happens next, as well as whether Romero Games manages to find a new publisher for its game. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/clair-obscur-expedition-33-has-one-of-the-most-moving-stories-says-the-last-of-us-creator.1238043/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>One of the industry's most respected creators has joined the chorus of praise for Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, the JRPG developed by French studio Sandfall Interactive. Neil Druckmann, president and creative director at Naughty Dog and creator of The Last of Us franchise, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DLvd-3qh08Q/?utm_source=ig_embed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote on Instagram</a>:</p>



<p><em>Rolled credits on Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. I’m in awe. One of the most moving, creative stories I've played in a long time.</em></p>



<p>Druckmann, who recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/neil-druckmann-hbo-the-last-of-us-naughty-dog/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> he would leave his role as co-showrunner and director of the HBO adaptation of The Last of Us to focus solely on game development, certainly isn't the only one to rate the game so highly. Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is one of the highest rated new releases of 2025 so far, not to mention one of the most successful, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/33-days-after-launch-clair-obscur-expedition-33-reaches-3-3-million-copies-sold/">over 3.3 </a><a href="https://wccftech.com/33-days-after-launch-clair-obscur-expedition-33-reaches-3-3-million-copies-sold/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">million </a><a href="https://wccftech.com/33-days-after-launch-clair-obscur-expedition-33-reaches-3-3-million-copies-sold/">units sold in 33 days</a> despite also being available on Game Pass.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In his 9.5/10 review of the game on Wccftech</a>, Francesco De Meo similarly lauded the game's narrative:</p>



<p><em>Every little story development serves a purpose in the grand scheme of things, like the strokes from a brush. Everything comes together extremely well when the adventure ends, ultimately making the 40 or so hours needed to clear the game an enjoyable rollercoaster of emotions that is hugely satisfying, if not a little emotionally draining, like only the best of stories manage to do.</em></p>



<p><em>Besides the excellent pacing of the story, the characters are the reason Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is so enjoyable. Even though the members of the Expedition 33 and a few others met during the journey on the continent get the most development, which is greatly enhanced by the tapestry their relationships wove, even those that only appear briefly manage to leave an impact. For example, it is tough to forget about the characters met before the Gommage, and remain indifferent as the ritual concludes. The excellent writing and the stellar performance of the English voice cast, including performances from Charlie Cox, Jennifer English, and Ben Starr, are the cherry on top of the most interesting setting seen in RPGs in a long time.</em></p>



<p>Have you played the game yet, and if so, do you agree with all these compliments?</p>

But last week, Subnautica director and designer Charlie Cleveland and his fellow Unknown Worlds co-founder Max McGuire were reportedly forced out the company alongside CEO Ted Gill. Now, Cleveland has shared a message for fans about his ouster and where Subnautica 2 currently stands.</p><p>In an extended post on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/subnautica/comments/1lryw9o/what_is_a_wave_but_a_thousand_drops/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit</a>, Cleveland wrote "the events of this week have been quite a shock" in addition to recapping the history of Unknown Worlds, which began with a Half-Life mod called Natural Selection.

"And while we thought this was going to be our decision to make, at least for now, that decision is in Krafton’s hands. And after all these years, to find that I'm no longer able to work at the company I started stings."</p><p>"Our priority is, and has always been, to make the best damned game we can for the best community in the world," added Cleveland. "With your Gorge plushies and your hand-drawn fish fan-art, and yes, your hard-earned dollars, you've supported us in every way, in every season, cold and warm, since Half-Life modding was even a thing. And I also want you to know that this is not where the story ends."</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/survival-crafting/subnautica-2-studio-begs-rioting-fans-for-benefit-of-the-doubt-after-leadership-axed-by-owner-krafton-the-team-that-has-been-working-on-the-game-day-to-day-over-the-last-few-years-remains-completely-unchanged/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>, some fans have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1lqzmon/boycott_subnautica_2_remove_it_from_your_wishlist/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">called for a Subnautica 2 boycott</a> and urged others to remove the game from their wish lists.

            <p>If you've played a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/need-for-speed">Need For Speed</a> game in the last decade, odds are you've seen plenty of cars with Speedhunters stickers slapped somewhere amid whatever delightfully tacky livery their driver's decided to rock. Now, though, it looks like the EA-owned car culture site has gone dormant, with reports claiming it might have been shut down.</p>
<p>This news comes as development of NFS at EA is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/need-for-speed-will-return-ea-pledges-but-team-all-in-on-battlefield-for-now">on a hiatus</a>, with devs at Criterion having been drafted in to help deliver the next Battlefield, though exec Vince Zampella has hinted that there are still plans for the racing series going forwards.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/it-looks-like-speedhunters-is-dead">The Drive</a>, Speedhunters' site hasn't had any new stories published to it since April 3. Links to its store return an error message, and its Instagram account boasts an ominous black void as a profile photo.</p>
<p>The Drive reports having heard that Speedhunters might been shut down. We've reached out to EA for comment.</p>
<p>Founded in 2008 by <a href="https://rodchong.com/about/">Rod Chong</a>, Speedhunters have been <a href="https://www.speedhunters.com/2024/02/the-need-for-speedhunting/">backed by EA</a> since "since day one", with the various car-related articles and photography they've delivered over the years having been interspersed with plenty of NFS coverage and promo. As recently as December last year, the site were writing about <a href="https://www.speedhunters.com/2024/12/my-day-with-the-need-for-speed-bmw-m3-gtr/">the special Most Wanted BMW M3</a> that released in commemoration of the NFS series' 30th anniversary, having also covered <a href="https://www.speedhunters.com/2024/08/everything-need-know-nfs-unbound-vol-8-cops-vs-racers/">updates</a> to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/need-for-speed-unbound">NFS Unbound</a> in 2024.</p>
<p>As I alluded to earlier, Speedhunters has also been a regular presence in NFS games themselves via those ubiquitous stickers. One of its journalists, Dino Dalle Carbonare, even made a cameo in utterly forgettable mobile game NFS: No Limits.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/shootingcars/comments/1lne5xv/comment/n0kzeg8/">Reddit comment</a> responding to chatter about Speedhunters' unclear situation, former contributor <a href="https://www.speedhunters.com/author/2279972671/">Paddy McGrath</a> wrote the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>I haven't been involved in any meaningful way with the site over the last few years (although my name is still listed as a contributor). I did have the intention of submitting stories when I could in the future, but that doesn't look like it's going to be possible anymore.</p>
<p>FWIW, there were so many times that Speedhunters was circling the drain over the last decade. We rarely knew ahead of time if our contracts would be renewed each year. A lot of brilliant and dedicated people put a lot of work in to keep things going as long as it did.</p>
<p>As you might know, Speedhunters was founded and supported by EA from day one. It wouldn't have existed without them. However, Speedhunters was such a small project in an otherwise massive company that it was never going to get the attention &amp; resources it needed to grow, IMO. Why would they spend time on a website selling some merchandise when they have multiple billion dollar video game brands to tend to? </p>
<p>As time passed, and the original EA people involved in the creation of Speedhunters moved onto other things, it became more and more difficult to keep the project afloat. I knew this day was inevitable, so made the decision years ago to diversify my client base and take all of my eggs out of the Speedhunters basket. I am genuinely sad that this does look like the end for it, it deserved so much better.</p></blockquote>
<p>
Here's hoping Speedhunters hasn't done its last set of doughnuts in front of some expensive cameras.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/with-need-for-speed-devs-working-on-battlefield-eas-beloved-car-culture-site-seems-to-have-shut-off-its-engine]]></content:encoded>

<p>Launching on Switch this September</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Spike Chunsoft has released a new gameplay trailer for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/shuten_order">Shuten Order</a>, the new title from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/danganronpa_decadence">Danganronpa</a> / <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hundred_line_-_last_defense_academy">The Hundred Line</a> creator Kazutaka Kodaka. It provides our best look yet at the game's multi-genre mechanics, with the story branching off into five distinct paths.</p>
<p>You play as Rei Shimobe, the founder of Shuten Order who has been resurrected into a temporary body following his murder. You'll have to investigate one of Shuten Order's 'ministers', with each case presenting you with a completely unique gameplay hook.</p>
<p>For example, if you pursue Kishiru Inugami, you'll engage in a mystery adventure with point-and-click gameplay and puzzle-solving mechanics. Go after Manji Fushicho, however, and you'll be embroiled in stealth-action horror gameplay in which you need to avoid the wandering entity known as 'Nephilim'.</p>
<p>It looks awesome, and if Kodaka's previous work is anything to go by, then you can probably expect a whole bunch of unique story beats and twists as you work to solve your own murder.</p>
<p>Shuten Order launches on Switch on <strong>5th September 2025</strong> and includes an optional digital deluxe edition containing a digital art book and soundtrack.</p>
